<title>Abstract</title><p>Asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) generate two daughter cells with identical genetic information but distinct cell fates through epigenetic mechanisms. However, the process of partitioning different epigenetic information into daughter cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell rather than the apoptotic one during ACDs in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The absence of NuRD triggers apoptosis via the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 pathway, while an ectopic gain of NuRD enables apoptotic daughter cells to survive. We identify the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>–adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) complex as a crucial regulator of NuRD’s asymmetric segregation. V-ATPase interacts with NuRD and is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell. Inhibition of V-ATPase disrupts cytosolic pH asymmetry and NuRD asymmetry. We suggest that asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase may cause distinct acidification levels in the two daughter cells, enabling asymmetric epigenetic inheritance that specifies their respective life-versus-death fates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Asymmetric cell division (ACD) gives rise to two daughter cells that possess identical genetic material but distinct cell fates, playing a crucial role in both development and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Royall and Jessberger, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Venkei and Yamashita, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wooten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zion et al., 2020</xref>). Both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms determine distinct daughter cell fates after ACD. While extrinsic mechanisms, such as exposure to signaling cues from the local niche, have been extensively studied and are known to define stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>), the intrinsic mechanisms are more complex and largely unresolved, despite several proteins, RNA molecules, and organelles having been implicated in the regulation of some types of ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zion et al., 2020</xref>). Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in guiding the two daughter cells towards establishing differential gene expression profiles, ultimately defining their unique cell identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allis and Jenuwein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Escobar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stewart-Morgan et al., 2020</xref>). During the ACD of <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs), pre-existing and newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 are asymmetrically segregated towards the stem daughter cell and the differentiating daughter cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wooten et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the extent to which epigenetic information is asymmetrically inherited through ACD in other organisms and the mechanism by which this process occurs remains elusive.</p>
<p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> represents a valuable model for investigating ACD, given its invariant cell lineage and conserved mechanisms of ACD. During hermaphrodite development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, 131 somatic cells undergo programmed cell death, with the majority produced through ACD that create a large cell programmed for survival and a small cell programmed to die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sulston et al., 1983a</xref>) The opposing cell fates of daughter cells, i.e., to live or die, offer a compelling experimental system for investigating how epigenetic inheritance determines life versus death decisions during ACD. It is noteworthy that 105 of the 131 apoptotic cells arise from neuronal lineages, of which the Q neuroblast represents a tractable system for studying ACD and apoptosis at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ellis and Horvitz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hedgecock et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>). During the first larval stage, Q neuroblasts on the left (QL) and right (QR) undergo three rounds of asymmetric divisions, which produce three different neurons and two apoptotic cells (Q.aa and Q.pp), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>In the nematode, the classic apoptotic pathway initiates upon activation of the BH3-only protein EGL-1 in the cells that are fated to die. EGL-1 binds to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like protein CED-9, which facilitates the release of the pro-apoptotic protein CED-4, leading to caspase CED-3 activation. Activated caspase promotes the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of apoptotic cells, which triggers the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells via partially redundant signaling pathways such as the CED-1/CED-6/CED-7 pathway and the CED-2/CED-5/CED-12 pathway. Proper transcriptional regulation of the <italic>egl-1</italic> gene is vital for life-versus-death decisions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Conradt and Horvitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nehme and Conradt, 2008</xref>). Although the cell-specific transcriptional regulator has been identified in certain cells, including the sexually dimorphic HSN and CEM neurons, M4 motor neuron, NSM neuron, P11.aaap cell, ABpl/rpppapp, and the tail spike cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hirose et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jiang and Wu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nehme and Conradt, 2008</xref>), the general upstream regulators of <italic>egl-1</italic> at the chromatin remodeling or epigenetic level are unclear. Two NSM neuroblasts undergo ACDs to each generate a larger NSM cell programed to survive and a smaller NSM sister cell programed to die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sulston et al., 1983b</xref>). The PIG-1 kinase-dependent asymmetric partitioning of the Snail-like transcription factor, CES-1, represses <italic>egl-1</italic> transcription in the larger NSM sister cells, thereby preventing their apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hatzold and Conradt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wei et al., 2020</xref>) However, the mechanism underlying the asymmetrical activation of <italic>egl-1</italic> in other ACDs remains elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate the enrichment of the NuRD complex in cells that are predetermined to survive, and its role in suppressing the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 apoptotic pathway through repression of the <italic>egl-1</italic> gene. Furthermore, we report the interaction between the NuRD complex and the V-ATPase complex, and reveal that during asymmetric cell division, the localization of the V-ATPase complex and cytoplasmic pH are asymmetrical, thereby contributing to the polarized segregation of the NuRD complex.</p>

<title>NuRD asymmetric segregation during neuroblast ACDs</title>
<p>In order to gain insights into the molecular distinctions between apoptotic and surviving cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, we employed the SPLiT single-cell RNA sequencing platform to compare their transcriptomes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A-S1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>). The expression of the critical somatic apoptosis-inducing gene <italic>egl-1</italic> was used to distinguish the apoptotic and surviving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conradt et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, we identified transcripts encoding subunits of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD; also known as Mi-2) complex in cells where <italic>egl-1</italic> expression was indiscernible (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D-S1F</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). The NuRD complex represents an evolutionarily conserved protein complex associated with chromatin that couples the activities of chromatin-remodeling ATPases with histone deacetylases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lai and Wade, 2011</xref>). NuRD-mediated alterations in chromatin structure are vital for appropriate transcriptional regulation during cell fate determination and lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lai and Wade, 2011</xref>), suggesting that NuRD may serve as a candidate epigenetic factor to specify cell fate between survival and death.</p>
<p>To investigate whether NuRD components are distributed asymmetrically between apoptotic and surviving daughter cells, we expressed GFP-tagged NuRD subunits within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Q neuroblast lineages. Q.a neuroblast undergoes ACD to generate a large surviving Q.ap cell and a small apoptotic Q.aa cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that GFP-tagged NuRD subunits, including the histone deacetylase HDA-1, the histone binding protein LIN-53, the nucleosome remodeling factor CHD-3, and the MEP-1 protein were enriched asymmetrically in the surviving QR.ap cell during QR.a division (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>, Supplementary Movie S1 and S2). Notably, NuRD asymmetric distribution occurred within several minutes after metaphase, while GFP protein translation and chromophore maturation require approximately 30 min in Q neuroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ou and Vale, 2009</xref>), suggesting that the asymmetric enrichment of NuRD is likely the result of protein redistribution.</p>
<p>To investigate the dynamic distribution of endogenous NuRD during ACD, we generated a GFP knock-in (KI) strain for HDA-1 and an mNeonGreen (NG, green fluorescence) KI line for LIN-53 using CRISPR-Cas9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In QR.a cells, nuclear HDA-1 and LIN-53 were released into the cytoplasm and evenly distributed until metaphase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Supplementary Movie S3 and S4). At anaphase, HDA-1 and LIN-53 became enriched in the posterior part of QR.a but became less detectable in the anterior part (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, S3A-B, Supplementary Movie S3 and S4). By quantifying the fluorescence intensity ratio between posterior and anterior chromatids of QR.a or QR.ap and QR.aa nuclei, we found that nuclear HDA-1 or LIN-53 asymmetry gradually increased from 1.1-fold at the onset of anaphase to 1.5 or 1.8-fold upon completion of cytokinesis, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>). We measured the ratios of fluorescence intensities between the posterior and anterior halves of QR.a or between QR.ap and QR.aa (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>, see Materials and Methods). NuRD asymmetry became evident at ∼4 minutes and reached a plateau at ∼6 minutes after the anaphase onset (time 0 min, the last frame before the sister chromosome separation; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, 1F, S3A and S4B). QR.a spent ∼6 minutes from anaphase to the completion of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ou et al., 2010</xref>) indicating that QR.a cell establishes NuRD asymmetry during ACD.</p>
<p>Similar to QR.a, the dynamic and progressively developing NuRD asymmetry was also observed in the QL.a, QR.p and QL.p cell lineages, which generate apoptotic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, S3B and S4B). In contrast, an even distribution of HDA-1 and LIN-53 was observed in two surviving daughters of QR, QL, QL.pa and QR.pa cells, which generate two viable siblings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and S3B). To investigate whether other epigenetic factors are also asymmetrically segregated during Q cell ACDs, we tagged the MYST family histone acetyltransferase (MYS-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) with GFP. We found that MYS-1::GFP was symmetrically segregated into the apoptotic and surviving daughter cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-F</xref>, S3A and S4B, Supplementary Movie S5), indicating the specificity of the polarized NuRD partition. The total fluorescence of HDA-1, LIN-53, and MYS-1 remained constant during ACDs, suggesting that protein redistribution may establish NuRD asymmetry (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>). Inhibition of a PAR-1 family kinase PIG-1 led to symmetric Q cell divisions, producing extra neurons derived from some of their apoptotic daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cordes et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>pig-1 (gm344)</italic> mutants, HDA-1 and LIN-53 were evenly partitioned during ACDs (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>, Supplementary Movie S6 and S7), indicating that asymmetric NuRD segregation depends on the PIG-1 kinase.</p>

<title>NuRD asymmetric segregation in embryonic cell lineages</title>
<p>Given that 113 out of 131 somatic apoptotic events in <italic>C. elegans</italic> occur during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sulston et al., 1983a</xref>), we used live imaging and automated cell lineage tracing algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Du et al., 2014</xref>) to track NuRD asymmetry in embryos from the two- or four-cell stage up to the 350-cell stage For example, approximately 200 minutes after the first embryonic division, ABalaappp divides to generate two viable daughters while its sibling ABalaappa divides asymmetrically and produces one daughter that undergoes apoptosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar to what we observed in the Q lineage, HDA-1 was evenly distributed in the two viable daughters of ABalaappp, while it was asymmetrically segregated during the ACD of ABalaappa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Overall, we found that HDA-1 and LIN-53 were enriched (average ratio &gt; 1.5) in the surviving daughters from 15 out of 17 embryonic ACDs that produce apoptotic daughter cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref> and Supplementary Table 2). There were two exceptions, ABaraaaap and MSpppaa, whose two daughter cells received similar amounts of NuRD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>). While MSpppaa’s apoptotic daughter cell undergoes apoptosis about 400 minutes after its generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hsieh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sulston et al., 1983b</xref>), consistent with the idea that a low concentration of NuRD may promote apoptosis, ABaraaaap’s apoptotic daughter cell completes apoptosis within 35 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sulston et al., 1983a</xref>), suggesting that a NuRD-independent mechanism may regulate apoptosis in this cell.</p>

<title>Loss of the deacetylation activity of NuRD causes ectopic apoptosis</title>
<p>To investigate the role of NuRD in determining cell fate, we reduced the deacetylation activity of NuRD using RNA-mediated interference (RNAi). The <italic>hda-1</italic> and <italic>lin-53</italic> RNAi efficacy was confirmed by the reduced green fluorescence in the germlines of HDA-1::GFP and LIN-53::mNeonGreen KI animals, as well as the increased acetylation level of histone H3K27 (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). As reported before, RNAi of either <italic>hda-1</italic> or <italic>lin-53</italic> caused embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Shi and Mello, 1998</xref>). RNAi of <italic>lin-53</italic> led to embryos arrested at gastrulation stage before the generation of apoptotic cells, preventing us from analyzing its roles in somatic apoptosis. In contrast, <italic>hda-1</italic> RNAi embryos arrested between the late gastrulation stage and bean stage, allowing us to tracked some of apoptotic events. To quantify apoptotic events, we used a secreted Annexin V (sAnxV::GFP) sensor to label apoptotic cells with externalized phosphatidylserine (exPS) on the surface of the plasma membrane in <italic>ced-1(e1735)</italic> mutant embryos which inhibits engulfment of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conradt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mapes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). The sAnxV::GFP labeled an average of 10 cells in <italic>ced-1(e1735)</italic> mutant embryos treated with control RNAi and an average of 14 cells in <italic>ced-1(e1735)</italic>; <italic>hda-1</italic> RNAi embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>).

RNAi of <italic>hda-1</italic> in these embryos only generated 0-2 exPS-positive cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref> and S7A), indicating that the ectopic increase of apoptosis by HDA-1 inhibition requires the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 pathway. Considering the pleiotropic phenotypes caused by loss of HDA-1, we cannot exclude the possibility that ectopic cell death might result from global changes in development, even though HDA-1 may directly contribute to the life-versus-death fate determination.</p>

<title>NuRD RNAi upregulates the <italic>egl-1</italic> expression by increasing its H3K27 acetylation</title>
<p>To understand how NuRD regulates apoptotic cell fates, we performed RNA-Seq analyses on WT, <italic>hda-1</italic> RNAi and <italic>lin-53</italic> RNAi embryos. In both RNAi conditions, we observed 287 or 575 genes that were upregulated or downregulated (|log<sub>2</sub>FD| &gt; 2 and FDR &lt; 0.05) (Supplementary Table 3). Notably, we found that the apoptosis-inducing gene <italic>egl-1</italic> was among the upregulated genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Our quantitative RT-PCR results further confirmed that <italic>egl-1</italic> transcripts were more abundant in <italic>hda-1</italic> RNAi and <italic>lin-53</italic> RNAi embryos than in control RNAi embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We also used a P<italic>egl-1</italic>::NLS::GFP transcriptional reporter to examine the <italic>egl-1</italic> transcription activity during embryonic development, which allowed us to detect <italic>egl-1</italic> expression while avoiding the adverse effects of <italic>egl-1</italic> overexpression on apoptosis. We found that RNAi of <italic>hda-1</italic> or <italic>lin-53</italic> caused an increased number of P<italic>egl-1</italic>::NLS::GFP positive cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and S7B). These results indicate that the loss of NuRD abnormally activates the <italic>egl-1</italic> gene expression.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether the loss of histone deacetylase activity in NuRD increased the H3K27ac level at the <italic>egl-1</italic> locus, as the histone H3K27ac level is associated with transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heinz et al., 2015</xref>). To test this, we performed ChIP-Seq experiments with the anti-H3K27ac antibody and found that the transcription start site (TSS) and the gene body region of <italic>egl-1</italic> had higher levels of H3K27ac in <italic>hda-1</italic> or <italic>lin-53</italic> RNAi embryos compared to WT, while the H3K27ac level of genes adjacent to <italic>egl-1</italic> showed no significant changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). This was validated by ChIP-qPCR in <italic>hda-1</italic> RNAi embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Therefore, inhibiting NuRD increased the H3K27ac level at the <italic>egl-1</italic> locus, leading to its upregulation and subsequent activation of apoptosis.</p>

<title>V-ATPase regulates asymmetric segregation of NuRD during somatic ACDs</title>
<p>To investigate how NuRD is asymmetrically segregated during ACD, we used affinity purification with an anti-GFP antibody and mass spectrometry (MS) to isolate NuRD binding partners from the lysate of HDA-1::GFP KI animals. Our analysis revealed all the previously known NuRD subunits from HDA-1::GFP KI animals (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>, Supplementary Table 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lai and Wade, 2011</xref>), validating our experimental method. Interestingly, our co-immunoprecipitation and MS with HDA- 1::GFP identified 12 subunits of the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (V-ATPase) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>), consistent with a previous report that used FLAG-tagged LIN-53 to identify 4 V-ATPase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Muthel et al., 2019</xref>).

V-ATPase is a proton pump that comprises a transmembrane domain (V0) responsible for proton transport across membranes and a peripheral ATP-hydrolytic domain (V1) that catalyzes ATP hydrolysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). V-ATPases play a critical role in intracellular pH homeostasis and regulate numerous physiological processes, including apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ernstrom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Vasanthakumar and Rubinstein, 2020</xref>).

<p>To investigate the role of V-ATPase in NuRD asymmetric segregation in Q neuroblast, we used a pharmacologic inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), to inhibit V-ATPase proton pumping activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Furuchi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yoshimori et al., 1991</xref>). To assess the inhibitory effect of Baf A1 on the proton translocation activity of V-ATPase in Q neuroblast, we monitored the cytosolic pH dynamics in dividing QR.a using the super-ecliptic pHluorin. The pHluorin is a pH-sensitive GFP reporter whose fluorescence can be quenched by the acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Miesenbock et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000</xref>). Although BafA1-mediated disruption of lysosomal pH homeostasis is recognized to elicit a wide array of intracellular abnormalities, we found no evidence of such pleiotropic effects at the organismal level with the dosage and duration of treatment employed in this study. In DMSO-treated animals, the pHlourin fluorescence intensity remained constant in the posterior portion that forms QR.ap but was significantly reduced in the anterior portion that forms QR.aa, indicating that the cytoplasm of the future apoptotic cell became more acidic (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref> and Supplementary Movie S8). This observation is consistent with the recognition that cytosolic acidification is a common feature of both death receptor-mediated and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lagadic-Gossmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Matsuyama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Matsuyama and Reed, 2000</xref>). Notably, Baf A1 treatment reduced the pHluorin fluorescence intensity ratio between QR.ap and QR.aa from 1.6-fold to 1.3-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref> and Supplementary Movie S8), suggesting that Baf A1 may disrupt the cytosolic pH asymmetry in dividing QR.a cells by inhibiting V-ATPase activity, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the changes in fluorescence could be due to changes in the amount of pHluorin protein.</p>

<p>We observed that treatment with Baf A1 resulted in the symmetric segregation of HDA-1 during QR.a division (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref> and Supplementary Movie S9). Notably, neither DMSO nor Baf A1 treatment affected the asymmetry in daughter cell size (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref> and Supplementary Movie S9), suggesting that intracellular acidification, regulated by V-ATPase activity, specifically affects NuRD asymmetric segregation without influencing daughter cell size asymmetry. We also investigated whether the small QR.aa cell carrying ectopic NuRD could escape apoptosis. In DMSO-treated animals, QR.aa cells underwent apoptosis, and 12 out of 13 QR.aa cells were engulfed and degraded by a neighboring epithelial cell within 120 min after birth. However, in Baf A1-treated animals, QR.aa inherited similar levels of HDA-1::GFP as its sister cell, and 11 out of 12 QR.aa cells carrying ectopic NuRD survived for over 120 min and formed a short neurite-like outgrowth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). To confirm whether the long-lived QR.aa was a consequence of ectopic gain of NuRD, we depleted HDA-1 within Q cell lineages using the auxin-inducible protein degradation (AID) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). By introducing the degron sequence into the <italic>hda-1</italic> locus and expressing the TIR1 F-box protein under the Q cell-specific <italic>egl-17</italic> promoter, we showed that HDA-1::GFP fluorescence in Q cells was substantially decreased under auxin treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Administration of auxin restored QR.aa apoptosis in Baf A1-treated animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These results suggest that V-ATPase activity-dependent NuRD asymmetric segregation contributes to the specification of the live-death fate.</p>
<p>To understand how V-ATPase regulates NuRD asymmetric segregation, we generated a transgenic strain expressing wrmScarlet-tagged VHA-17, which is the e subunit of the V0 domain. Using this strain, we were able to examine the dynamic distribution of V-ATPase during QR.a cell division. Like HDA-1, V-ATPase was also asymmetrically enriched in the surviving QR.ap portion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref> and Supplementary Movie S10). This observation suggests that V-ATPase and NuRD may co-segregate asymmetrically during ACD. We also found that Baf A1 treatment disrupted V-ATPase asymmetric distribution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref> and Supplementary Movie S10), indicating the importance of the proton-pumping activity of V-ATPase in its asymmetric segregation. Therefore, our results suggest that V-ATPase may facilitate the asymmetric distribution of NuRD through its proton pumping activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that the asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex during ACD is regulated in a V-ATPase-dependent manner, and is critical for the differential expression of apoptosis activator <italic>egl-1</italic> and the life-versus-death fate decision (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Specifically, we have provided evidence that the reduced level of NuRD in the apoptotic daughter cell leads to an increased level of H3K27ac, an epigenetic modification known to be associated with active gene expression, at the <italic>egl-1</italic> locus, resulting in the upregulation of <italic>egl-1</italic> expression and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Based on our results, we propose a dual-function model of V-ATPase in NuRD asymmetric segregation: (i) V-ATPase interacts with NuRD, both of which are asymmetrically segregated into the surviving cell; (ii) the asymmetrical activity of V-ATPase generates a more acidic cytoplasmic environment in the future apoptotic cell portion compared to the surviving portion, which might contribute to the asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase and NuRD. This model sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the regulation of apoptosis during ACD, and opens up new avenues for further investigation into the intricate interplay between V-ATPase, NuRD, and epigenetic modifications in the context of cell fate decisions.</p>
<p>The intrinsic mechanisms governing binary cell fate decisions involve asymmetric cortical localization of cell fate determinants, polarized partitioning of RNA species, unequal segregation of organelles, and biased distribution of damaged proteins or protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Venkei and Yamashita, 2018</xref>). Despite this, little is known about the asymmetric segregation of epigenetic modification enzymes during ACDs, nor the functions of polarized V-ATPase distribution and cytoplasmic proton asymmetry during this process. Our findings provide new insights into the asymmetric segregation of cell-intrinsic factors and the previously unrecognized roles of V-ATPase and cytosolic acidification in this process.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the V-ATPase-dependent asymmetric segregation of NuRD. Firstly, a polarized intracellular transportation system could selectively deliver NuRD-V-ATPase-containing organelles to the surviving daughter cell. Although V-ATPase is primarily known for its localization and function in the late endosome and lysosome, recent evidence suggests that V-ATPase subunits are synthesized and assembled on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Graham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that V-ATPase colocalizes with the ER marker during ACDs, suggesting that NuRD-V-ATPase may be delivered as cargo on the ER or ER-derived vesicles (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>). As reported in previous studies, a polarized microtubule transportation system, governed by specific motor proteins and the microtubule tracks, is responsible for the asymmetric segregation of signaling endosomes during ACDs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory organ precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Derivery et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that a similar biased transportation system plays a role in the asymmetric segregation of NuRD-V-ATPase-containing organelles.</p>
<p>Secondly, the surviving daughter cell chromatids may have a greater ability to recruit NuRD than their apoptotic sister. This could be due to a higher number of yet unknown NuRD recruiting factors on chromatids or specific posttranslational modifications of chromosomal proteins that enhance the chromosomal recruitment of NuRD. Despite having an identical DNA sequence, sister chromatids can be distinguished by chromosomal proteins or modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ranjan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tran et al., 2012</xref>), which likely provides the specific molecular cues for asymmetric NuRD recruitment. The NuRD asymmetry on chromosomes (1.5∼1.8-fold between QR.ap and QR.aa nuclei) is greater than that between the two daughter cells (approximately 1.3-fold) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-1F</xref>), suggesting that polarized NuRD-V-ATPase transportation and distinct NuRD affinity from sister chromatids may act in concert to establish NuRD asymmetry.</p>
<p>The observation of asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex during cell divisions suggests that the mother cell may play a role in initiating the fate specification of its daughter cells. This notion is supported by studies conducted on <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs) which demonstrated that the old and new histone H3-H4 or unequal amounts of histone H3 variant CENP-A were incorporated into sister chromatids prior to cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ranjan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tran et al., 2012</xref>). Although these patterns were not observed in cell types other than GSCs, asymmetric NuRD segregation was found to be common in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). Among the 395 cell lineages that were tracked in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos and generated two surviving daughter cells, NuRD was equally distributed to both daughters in 390 instances (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-2D</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). However, in the remaining five cell divisions, both HDA-1 and LIN-53 exhibited &gt;1.5-fold differences between the two surviving siblings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-2D</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). This observation suggests that biased NuRD segregation may contribute to binary cell fate decisions beyond apoptosis. In the embryonic cerebral cortex of mammals, approximately 30% of newborn cells undergo programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Voiculescu et al., 2000</xref>), which is a significantly higher rate than observed in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> where only 12% of somatically born cells undergo apoptosis (131 apoptotic cells among 1090 somatically born cells). Thus, it is worth exploring whether brain stem cell divisions employ asymmetric NuRD segregation to specify daughter cell fates. Further studies on polarity establishment hold promise in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the asymmetric inheritance of epigenetic information.</p>

We used the CRISPR design tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources">https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources</ext-link>) to select the target sites. The sgRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Extended Data Table 2</xref>) were inserted into the pDD162 vector (Addgene #47549) by linearizing the vector with 15 base pairs (bp) overlapped primers using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, cat. no.

The linearized PCR products with 15 bp overlapping ends were cyclized to generate plasmids by spontaneous recombination in bacteria. Homology recombination (HR) templates were constructed by cloning the 1.5 kb upstream and downstream homology arms into the pPD95.77 plasmid using the In-Fusion Advantage PCR cloning kit (Clontech, Cat. #639621).

<title>Live-Cell Imaging and quantification</title>
<p>Live imaging of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, larvae, or young adults followed our established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). L1 larvae or young-adult worms were anesthetized with 0.1 mmol/L levamisole in M9 buffer, mounted on 3% (wt/vol) agarose pads maintained at 20°C. Our imaging system includes an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) equipped with a Zeiss 100×/1.46 numerical aperture (NA) objective, an Andor iXon+ EM-CCD camera, and 488 and 561-nm lines of a Sapphire CW CDRH USB Laser System attached to a spinning disk confocal scan head (Yokogawa CSU-X1 Spinning Disk Unit). Images were acquired by μManager (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.micro-manager.org">https://www.micro-manager.org</ext-link>). Time-lapse images of Q cell divisions were acquired with an exposure time of 200 msec every 1 min. Recent advancements in optical and camera technologies permit the acquisition of Z-stacks without perturbing Q cell division or overall animal development. Z-stack images were acquired over a range of -1.6 to +1.6 μm from the focal plane, at intervals of 0.8 μm. The field-of-view spaned 160 μm × 160 μm, and the laser power, as measured at the optical fiber, was approximately 1 mW. ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) was used to perform image analysis and measurement. Image stacks were z-projected using the average projection for quantification and using the maximum projection for visual display. To follow the cell fate of QR.aa in WT, Baf A1- or Baf A1 and IAA-treated worms, time-lapse images were acquired with 300 msec for 561 nm and 100 msec for 488 nm exposure time at 5-minute intervals. To image P<italic>hsp-16.41</italic>::sAnxV::GFP positive cells in WT, mutant, or RNAi animals, we incubated the eggs at 33 °C for 30 min to induce the reporter expression 3 hours post-egg-laying. After we kept the eggs at 20 °C for 2 hours, we imaged them with an exposure time of 200 msec. To acquire time-lapse images of P<italic>egl-1</italic>::NLS::GFP positive cells during embryonic development, we dissected 2-4 cell-stage embryos from gravid adults and imaged them with an exposure time of 300 msec every 5 min.</p>
<p>The quantifications of cellular fluorescence intensity ratios in Q cell lineages were described in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>. We used the mCherry-labeled plasma membrane to circumscribe Q cells (Region of Interest). To determine the ratios of fluorescence intensities in the posterior to anterior half (P/A) of Q.a lineages or A/P of Q.p lineages, the cell in the mean intensity projection was divided into posterior and anterior halves. ImageJ software was used to measure the fluorescence intensities of two halves with the background subtracted. The fluorescence intensity of the slide background was measured from a region without worm bodies, of the same size as the region of interest. The background-subtracted mean fluorescence intensities in the two halves were then normalized by the area and the two resulting values were divided. The same procedure was used to determine the ratios of fluorescence intensities between two daughter cells. Total fluorescence intensity was the sum of the posterior and anterior fluorescence intensities or the sum of fluorescence intensities from two daughter cells without area normalization. The ROIs used in the measurement and calculation of the nuclear intensity ratios were determined as regions with mCherry-tagged histone in each cell.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry</title>
<p>GFP transgenic or knock-in worms were raised on one hundred 90-mm NGM plates. Animals were collected and washed with M9 buffer three times. For each replicate, the lysate was made from 1∼2 ml packed worms with 3∼4 ml of 0.5-mm diameter glass beads using FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals) in lysis buffer [pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 1x cocktail of protease inhibitors from Roche (Complete, EDTA free), 40 mM NaF, 5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>]. Worm lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. For anti-GFP immunoprecipitation (IP), the supernatant was incubated with GFP-Trap A beads (Chromoteck, GTA20) for 1 hr. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. To detect the interaction between the V-ATPase subunit and HDA-1, beads are boiled with 1X SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer for SDS–PAGE and western blot. Otherwise, proteins were eluted from beads with 300 μl 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) Add 15 μl 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) to the eluted protein, followed by precipitation using 100 μl trichloroacetic acid and re-dissolution in 60 μl 8 M Urea, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) for MS. MS Samples were then reduced in 5 mM TCEP, alkylated by 10 mM iodoacetamide, and diluted four-fold with 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The 0.2 μg trypsin was used to digest 10 μg protein in 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 20 mM methylamine overnight at 37°C. The resultant peptides were desalted by ZipTip pipette tips (Merck Millipore). For liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, peptides were separated by an EASY-nLCII integrated nano-HPLC system (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) directly interfaced to a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded on an analytical fused-silica capillary column (150 mm in length, 75 mm in internal diameter; Upchurch) packed with 5 mm, 300 Å C-18 resin (Varian). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid, while mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid and 100% acetonitrile. The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated through Xcalibur 2.1.2 software in data-dependent acquisition mode. A single full-scan mass spectrum was used in the orbitrap (400–1,800 m/z in mass range, 60,000 in resolution) followed by ten data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry scans at 27% normalized collision energy (HCD). The tandem mass spectrometry spectra results were searched against the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteome database by the Proteome Discoverer (version PD1.4; Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

<p>To achieve Q cell conditional HDA-1 depletion, the auxin-inducible degradation (AID) was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). The natural auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (#A10556). A 400 mM solution in ethanol was stored at 4°C as stock. Before imaging, L1 larvae were transferred to the S basal buffer supplemented with 3% (v/v) pelleted OP50 and 4 mM of auxin for a 1.5 h treatment.</p>

<title>Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot</title>
<p>For immunoprecipitation of endogenous V-ATPase A subunit with HDA-1, HDA-1-GFP knock-in worms were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer [pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 2x cocktail of protease inhibitors from Roche (Complete, EDTA free), 40 mM NaF, 5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO4]. The soluble fractions from worm lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP GFP-Trap A beads (Chromoteck, GTA20) for 1 hr at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 1x cocktail of protease inhibitors from Roche (Complete, EDTA free) and were then transferred to new tubes. Beads were washed again with 100 mM PB (pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, or 7.5) and boiled in 1X SDS loading buffer under 95 ℃ for 5min. The protein samples were analyzed by Western blotting.</p>
<p>Protein samples were resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Each membrane was divided into two parts to be incubated with GFP (Abcam ab290, 1:4,000) or ATP6V1A (Abcam ab199326, 1:2,000) primary antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H&amp;L) (Easybio, 1:5,000) secondary antibodies. Quantification of the endogenous V-ATPase A subunit interacting with HDA-1 was performed using HDA-1::GFP bands as a calibration standard. Quantitative densitometry of chemiluminescent bands was performed using ImageJ software.</p>

<p>The authors propose that the asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is regulated in a V-ATPase-dependent manner, that this plays a crucial role in determining the differential expression of the apoptosis activator egl-1, and that it is therefore critical for the life/death fate decision in this species. If proven, the proposed model of the V-ATPase-NuRD-EGL-1-Apoptosis cascade would shed light onto the mechanisms underlying the regulation of apoptosis fate during asymmetric cell division, and stimulate further investigation into the intricate interplay between V-ATPase, NuRD, and epigenetic modifications. However, the strength of evidence for this is currently <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Xie et al. propose that the asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex is regulated in a V-ATPase-dependent manner, and plays a crucial role in determining the differential expression of the apoptosis activator egl-1 and thus critical for the life/death fate decision.</p>
<p>While the model is very intriguing, the reviewers raised concerns regarding the rigor of the method. One issue is with statistics (either insufficient information or inadequate use of statistics), and second is the concern that the asymmetry observed may be caused by one cell dying (resulting in protein degradation, RNA degradation etc). We recommend that the authors address these issues.</p>
<p>Major #1:</p>
<p>There are still many misleading statements/conclusions that are not rigorously tested or that are logically flawed. These issues must be thoroughly addressed for this manuscript to be solid.</p>
<p>1. Asymmetry detected by scRNA seq vs. imaging may not represent the same phenomenon, thus should not be discussed as two supporting pieces of evidence for the authors' model, and importantly each method has its own flaw. First, for scRNA seq, when cells become already egl-1 positive, those cells may be already dying, and thus NuRD complex's transcripts' asymmetry may not have any significance. The data presented in FigS1D, E show that there are lots of genes (6487 out of 8624) that are decreased in dying cells. Thus, it is not convincing to claim that NuRD asymmetry is regulated by differential RNA amount.</p>
<p>2. Regarding NuRD protein's asymmetry, there are still multiple issues. Most likely explanation of their asymmetry is purely daughter size asymmetry. Because one cell is much bigger than the other (3 times larger), NuRD components, which are not chromatin associated, would be inherited to the bigger cell 3 times more than the smaller daughter. Then, upon nuclear envelope reformation, NuRD components will enter the nucleus, and there will be 3 times more NuRD components in the bigger daughter cell. It is possible that this is actually the underling mechanism to regulate gene expression differentially, but this possibility is not properly acknowledged. Currently, the authors use chromatin associated protein (Mys-1) as 'symmetric control', but this is not necessarily a fair comparison. For NuRD asymmetry to be meaningful, an example of protein is needed that is non-chromatin associated in mitosis, distributed to daughter cells proportional to daughter cell size, and re-enter nucleus after nuclear envelope formation to show symmetric distribution. And if daughter size asymmetry is the cause of NuRD asymmetry, other lineages that do not undergo apoptosis but exhibit daughter size asymmetry would also show NuRD asymmetry. The authors should comment on this (if such examples exist, it is fine in that in those cell types, NuRD asymmetry may be used for differential gene expression, not necessarily to induce cell death, but such comparison provides the explanation for NuRD asymmetry, and puts the authors finding in a better context).</p>
<p>3. For the analysis of protein asymmetry between two daughters in Fig S4C, the method of calibration is unclear, making it difficult to interpret the results.</p>
<p>4. As for pHluorin experiments, the authors were asked to test the changes in fluorescence observed are due to changes in pH or changes in the amount of pHluorin protein. They need to add a ratio-metric method in this manuscript. A brief mention to Page 12 line 12 is insufficient to clarify this issue.</p>
<p>Major #2:</p>
<p>Some issues surrounding statistics must be resolved.</p>
<p>1. Fig. 1FG, 2D, 3BDEG, 5BD and 6B used either one-sample t-test or unpaired two-tailed parametric t-test for statistical comparison. These t-tests require a verification of each sample fitting to a normal distribution. The authors need to describe a statistical test used to verify a normal distribution of each sample.</p>
<p>2. Fig. 2D, 3D, and 3G have very small sample size (N=3-4, N=6, N=3, respectively), it is possible that a normal distribution cannot be verified. How can the authors justify the use of one-sample t-test and unpaired parametric t-test ?</p>
<p>3. Statistical comparison in Fig. 2D and Fig. 6B should be re-assessed. For Fig. 2D, the authors need to compare the intensity ratio of HDA-1/LIN53 between sister cells dying within 35 min and those over 400 min. For Fig. 6B, they need to compare the intensity ratio of VHA-17 between DMSO- and BafA1- treated cells at the same time point after anaphase.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p>Throughout the study, there is insufficient information about how experiments were performed and how often (imaging, pull-downs etc), how data was acquired, modified and analysed (especially imaging data, see below), how statistical analyses were done and what is presented in the figures (single planes or maximum intensity projections etc). This makes it difficult to evaluate the data and results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have incorporated additional experimental details to the Materials and Methods section: &quot;Recent advancements in optical and camera technologies permit the acquisition of Z-stacks without perturbing Q cell division or overall animal development. Z-stack images were acquired over a range of -1.6 to +1.6 μm from the focal plane, at intervals of 0.8 μm. The field-of-view spanned 160 μm × 160 μm, and the laser power, as measured at the optical fiber, was approximately 1 mW. ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) was used to perform image analysis and measurement. Image stacks were z-projected using the average projection for quantification and using the maximum projection for visual display. &quot;</p>
<p>The majority of our experimental procedures adhere to methodologies delineated in our prior publications and other scientific literature. We were pioneers in the development of fluorescence time-lapse live microscopy techniques for capturing Q cell migration and asymmetric division (Ou and Vale, Journal of Cell Biology, 2009; Ou et al., Science, 2010; Chai et al., Nature Protocols, 2012). Our innovative imaging protocol uncovered a novel mode of polarized, non-muscle myosin-II-dependent asymmetric cell division (Ou et al., Science, 2010). Subsequently, we unveiled another previously uncharacterized mechanism of asymmetric cell division dependent on polarized actin polymerization (Chai et al., Cell Discovery, 2022). In the present study, we have significantly refined our imaging and quantification protocols. Different from the single-focal-plane imaging employed in our earlier study by Ou et al. 2009, advancements in optical technologies and camera resolution now enable us to undertake time-lapse imaging across multiple focal planes and track signal differences between the anterior and posterior segments of dividing cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There is insufficient information about tools and reporters used. This is misleading and impacts the conclusions that can be made from the results presented. To give an example, in Figure 1D-F, the authors present data that HDA-1::GFP and LIN-53::mNeonGreen (both components of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex) but not the histone acetyltransferase MYS-1::GFP are 'asymmetrically segregated' during QR.a division. However, the authors do not mention that HDA-1::GFP and LIN-53::mNeonGreen are expressed at endogenous levels (they are CRISPR alleles) whereas MYS-1::GFP is overexpressed (integration of a multi-copy extrachromosomal array). The difference in 'segregation' could therefore be a consequence of different levels of expression rather than different modes of segregation ('asymmetric' versus 'symmetric').</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure S2 shows overexpressed HDA-1, LIN-53 and CHD-3 are also asymmetrically segregated during ACD of QR.a, which indicates that different levels of expression do not affect the modes of segregation, at least for the NuRD subunits. In the main text, however, we presented the asymmetric segregation of HDA-1::GFP and LIN-53::mNeonGreen using their CRISPR KI alleles.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There is insufficient information about the phenotypes of the animals used (RNAi knock-downs of hda-1, lin-53 RNAi, pig-1 etc). Again this is misleading and impacts the conclusions that can be made. To give some examples,</p>
<p>1. In Figure 3A-G, control RNAi embryos are compared to hda-1 RNAi and lin-53 RNAi embryos. What the authors do not mention is that hda-1 RNAi and lin-53 RNAi embryos have severe developmental defects and essentially cannot be compared to control RNAi embryos. The differences between the embryos can be seen in Figure S7B where bright-field images of control RNAi, hda-1 RNAi and lin-53 RNAi embryos are shown. At the 350 min time point, a normal embryo is visible for the control, a 'ball of cells' embryo for hda-1 RNAi and an embryo that seems to have arrested at an earlier developmental stage (and therefore have much larger cells) for lin-53 RNAi. Because of these pleiotropic phenotypes, it is unclear whether differences seen for example in sAnxV::GFP positive cells (Figure 3A) are the result of a direct effect of hda-1(RNAi) on cell death or whether they are the result of global changes in development and cell fate induced by hda-1(RNAi). hda-1(RNAi) and lin-53(RNAi) embryos are also used for the data shown in Figures S6 and S7, raising the same concerns;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the submitted manuscript, we mentioned that hda-1 RNAi and lin-53 RNAi caused embryonic lethality and that we could track some of the apoptotic events in hda-1 RNAi embryos arrested between the late gastrulation stage and bean stage. We agree with the reviewers that because of the pleiotropic phenotypes, we cannot distinguish whether sAnxV::GFP positive cells (Figure 3A) are the result of a direct effect of hda-1 (RNAi) on cell death or whether they are the result of global changes in development and cell fate induced by hda-1 (RNAi). We added the sentence to page 9 line 26: “Considering the pleiotropic phenotypes caused by loss of HDA-1, we cannot exclude the possibility that ectopic cell death might result from global changes in development, even though HDA-1 may directly contribute to the life-versus-death fate determination.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors do not mention what the impact of Baf A1 treatment is on animals; however, the images provided in Figure 5E indicate that Baf A1 treatment causes pleiotropic effects in L1 larvae.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have carefully checked the BafA1 treated animals, but have not been able to detect any visible defect in Baf A1 treated animals under a 25× dissection microscope at the given dosage and duration of treatment. We also searched for the published images or literature and did not find pleiotropic effects on the animal level at this dosage and duration; however, we agree with the reviewers that perturbation of pH homeostasis in lysosomes by BafA1 will certainly generate pleiotropic cellular defects. We discussed the issue below:</p>
<p>&quot;Although BafA1-mediated disruption of lysosomal pH homeostasis is recognized to elicit a wide array of intracellular abnormalities, we found no evidence of such pleiotropic effects at the organismal level with the dosage and duration of treatment employed in this study.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There is a lack of adequate controls. Because of this, some of the data presented must be considered as preliminary. To give some examples:</p>
<p>1. Controls are lacking for the data shown in Figure 3D-G (i.e. genes other than egl-1). Since hda-1 RNAi has a pleiotropic effect and most likely affects H3K27 acetylation genome-wide, this is critical. Based on what is shown, it is unclear whether the results presented are specific to egl-1 or not;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In figure 3F, we added F23B12.1 and sru-43 as the controls of egl-1. We added “while the H3K27ac level of genes adjacent to egl-1 showed no significant changes” to Page 10 line 22 in the revised text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The co-IP and mass spec data shown in Figure 4A, C and Figure S8 also lack a critical control, which is GFP only. Because of this, it is unclear whether subunits of the V-ATPase bind to HDA-1 or GFP. The co-IP and mass spec data forms the basis of Figures 5 and 6 as well as Figure S9. Data presented in these figures therefore has to be considered preliminary as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the co-IP and mass spec shown in Figure 4A, we used ACT-4::GFP as the negative control, which can preclude V-ATPase subunits that bind to GFP. In Figure 4C, we used anti-V1A (V-ATPase V1 domain A subunit) antibody to confirm the interaction between V1A and HDA-1. In Figure S8B, we also used ACT-4::GFP as a control, showing other NuRD subunits bind to HDA-1 rather than GFP.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Inappropriate methods are used. For this reason, some of the data again must be considered preliminary. To give some examples:</p>
<p>1. In Figure 5A, B, the authors used super-ecliptic pHluorin to look at changes in pH in the daughter cells. However, the authors used quenching of super-ecliptic pHluorin fluorescence rather than a ratio-metric method to 'measure' changes in pH. Because of this, it is unclear whether the changes in fluorescence observed are due to changes in pH or changes in the amount of pHluorin protein. Figure 5A, B forms the basis for the experiments presented in the remaining parts of Figure 5 as well as in Figure 6 and Figure S9;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Bafilomycin A1 inhibits the activity of V-ATPase, presumably preventing the pumping of protons into the apoptotic daughter cell. It is more likely that the apoptotic daughter cell becomes less acidic and more neutral after the treatment of Baf1A, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the changes in fluorescence could be due to changes in the amount of pHluorin protein. A ratio-metric method to measure changes in pH will be further used to distinguish the two possibilities.</p>
<p>We added “although we cannot exclude the possibility that the changes in fluorescence could be due to changes in the amount of pHluorin protein.” to Page 12 line 12 in the revised text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors' description of how some images were modified before quantitative analysis raises concerns. The figures of concern are particularly Figure 1 and Figure S4, where background subtraction with denoising and deconvolution was used. Background subtraction, with denoising and deconvolution is an image manipulation that enhances the contrast between background and what looks like foreground. Therefore, background subtraction should be applied primarily in experiments involving image segmentation not fluorescence intensity measurement. Not being provided any information by the authors about the kind of subtraction that was made, this processing could lead to an uneven subtraction across the image, which can easily lead to artefacts. Since the fluorescence intensity in the smaller daughter cell is lower, and thus closer to background, the algorithm the authors used may have misinterpreted the grey value information in the smaller daughter cell pixels. This could have led to an asymmetric subtraction of background in the two daughter cells, leading to a stronger subtraction in the smaller daughter cell. Ultimately, their processing could have artificially increased the intensity asymmetry between the two daughter cells in all their results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the imaging and quantification methods of this manuscript have been routinely used in our previous publications or studies from many other labs (Gräbnitz F, et al., Cell Rep. 2023; Herrero E, et al., Genetics. 2020; Roubinet C, et al., Curr Biol. 2021). Background subtraction is a standard procedure to quantify cellular fluorescence intensities. The fluorescence intensity of the slide background was measured from a region without worm bodies, of the same size as the region of interest. We have added how we measured the background to page 19 Line 24: “The fluorescence intensity of the slide background was measured from a region without worm bodies, of the same size as the region of interest.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The imaging data is of low quality (for example Figures 1, 2, 5, 6; Figures S2, S3, S5, S6, S9). Since much of the study and the findings are based on imaging, this is a major concern. Critical parameters are not mentioned (number of sections in z-stack, size of the field-of-view, laser power used etc), which makes it difficult to understand what was done and what one is looking at.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fluorescence images of neuroblast asymmetric cell division in developing C. elegans larvae has historically presented considerable challenges. Our recent methodological advancements have facilitated live imaging in this intricate system with improved resolution. In the revised manuscript, we have elucidated the specific z-stack parameters, field-of-view dimensions, and laser power settings employed: &quot;Z-stack images were acquired over a range of -1.6 to +1.6 μm from the focal plane, at intervals of 0.8 μm. The field-of-view spaned 160 μm × 160 μm, and the laser power, as measured at the optical fiber, was approximately 1 mW.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To give some specific examples,</p>
<p>1. The images shown in Figure 2B are of very low quality with severe background from neighbouring cells. In addition, the outline of the cells (plasma membrane) or the nuclei of the daughter cells is unknown. Based on this it is not clear how the authors could have measured 'Fluorescence intensity ratio between sister nuclei' in an accurate and unbiased way (what is clear from these images is that there is an increase in HDA-1::GFP signal in ALL surviving daughters (asymmetric and symmetric divisions) post cytokinesis but not in the daughter cell that is about to die (asymmetric and unequal division));</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We employed live-cell imaging in conjunction with automated cell lineage tracing algorithms (Du et al., Cell, 2014) to scrutinize NuRD asymmetry in embryos from the two- or four-cell stage up to the 350-cell stage. This sophisticated approach was initially pioneered by Dr. Zhirong Bao at Sloan Kettering and subsequently refined by Dr. Zhuo Du during Dr. Du's postdoctoral training in Dr. Bao's laboratory. This advanced imaging pipeline enables the scientific community to quantify cellular fluorescence intensity in an automated fashion, thereby substantially mitigating manual intervention and bias.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The images in Figure 6A and Figure S9A on VHA-17 segregation and its colocalization to ER and lysosome segregation during QR.a division are of very low quality and it is unclear to the reviewer how such images were used to obtain the quantitative data shown.</p>
<p>In some cases, there is a discrepancy between what is shown in figures and what the authors state in the text. To give some examples:</p>
<p>1. On page 7, the authors state &quot;..., we found that nuclear HDA-1 or LIN-53 asymmetry gradually increased from 1.1-fold at the onset of anaphase to 1.5 or 1.8-fold at cytokinesis, respectively (Figure 1D-E).&quot; Looking at the images for HDA-1 and LIN-53 in Figure 1D, the increase in the ratio mainly occurs between 4 min and 6 min, which is post cytokinesis and NOT prior to cytokinesis;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank the reviewer for pointing out this. The nuclear HDA-1 or LIN-53 asymmetry increased to 1.5 or 1.8-fold 6 min after the onset of anaphase, when QR.a just completes cytokinesis. Therefore, We change the sentence “we found that nuclear HDA-1 or LIN-53 asymmetry gradually increased from 1.1-fold at the onset of anaphase to 1.5 or 1.8-fold at cytokinesis, respectively (Figure 1D-E).” to “we found that nuclear HDA-1 or LIN-53 asymmetry gradually increased from 1.1-fold at the onset of anaphase to 1.5 or 1.8-fold upon the completion of cytokinesis, respectively (Figure 1D-E).”</p>
<p>However, nuclear HDA-1 or LIN-53 asymmetry initiates prior to cytokinesis. We started to see the nuclear HDA-1 or LIN-53 asymmetry (1.4 fold for HDA-1 and 1.2 fold for LIN-53 ) 2 min after the onset of anaphase (Figure 1D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. These images (Figure 1D) also show that there is an increase in the HDA-1 and LIN-53 signals in the larger daughter cells (QR.ap), which suggests that the increase in ratios (Figure 1E) is the result of increased HDA-1 and LIN-53 synthesis post cytokinesis. However, on top of page 8, the authors state &quot;The total fluorescence of HDA-1, LIN-53 and MYS-1 remained constant during ACDs, suggesting that protein redistribution may establish NuRD asymmetry (Figure S4C).&quot; In Figure S4C, the authors present straight lines for 'relative total fluorescence' for imaging (probably z-stacks) that was done every min over the course of 7 min. If there was no increase in material as the authors claim, they should have seen significant photobleaching over the course of the 7 min and therefore reduced level of 'relative total fluorescence' over time. How the data presented in Figure S4C was generated is therefore unclear. (Despite the fact that the authors claim that the asymmetry seen is not due to new synthesis in the larger daughter cell post cytokinesis, it would be more consistent with the first experiment presented in this study (Figure S1) that shows that there is more hda-1 mRNA in egl-1(-) cells compared to egl-1(+) cells);</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the concern of photo-bleaching, we have meticulously calibrated our imaging system over the past several years. Rigorous controls, qualification, and analyses were scrupulously undertaken during the development of our fluorescence time-lapse imaging system for the investigation of Q cell dynamics, initially established by Dr. Guangshuo Ou in Ron Vale's laboratory—a renowned hub for avant-garde imaging techniques (Ou &amp; Vale, Journal of Cell Biology, 2009; Ou et al., Science, 2010). Remarkably, no discernible photobleaching was observed even during two to three-hour imaging.</p>
<p>We agree that protein turnover, involving both degradation and synthesis, may occur.  However, NuRD asymmetric distribution occurred within several minutes after metaphase and QR.a completes cytokinesis ~6min after the onset of anaphase, while GFP protein translation and maturation require ~ 30 min in Q neuroblast (Ou &amp; Vale, Journal of Cell Biology, 2009). Even if hda-1::gfp mRNA is translated during cell division, the nascent GFP-tagged protein will mature long after the completion of cytokinesis. Consequently, we postulate that the influence of newly synthesized GFP-tagged protein during Q cell division is negligible for quantification purposes. It is plausible that the asymmetry in HAD-1 protein distribution is independent of hda-1 mRNA asymmetry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. On page 12, the authors state &quot;..., in Baf A1-treated animals, QRaa inherited similar levels of HDA-1::GFP as its sister cell,...&quot;. However, looking at the image provided in Figure 5E (0 min), there seems to be a similar ratio of HDA-1::GFP between the daughter cells in DMSO and Baf A1-treated animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have adjusted the images in Figure 5E to show the asymmetry in DMSO-treated control animals. We acknowledge variations among animals. Our quantifications from more than 10 animals show the HDA-1 asymmetry in DMSO-treated animals in Figure 5B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>Conclusion 1</p>
<p>&quot;Here, we demonstrate that the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell rather than the apoptotic one during ACDs in Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; (Abstract)</p>
<p>Results described on pages 6-9 (&quot;NuRD asymmetric segregation during neuroblast ACDs&quot; and &quot;NuRD asymmetric segregation in embryonic cell lineages&quot;) and data shown in Figure S1, Figure 1, Figures S2, S3, S4, S5, Figure 2.</p>
<p>Conclusion 1 is not supported by the results as numerous concerns exist about the data in many of these figures (see above, major weaknesses). A more likely explanation for the authors' observations is that there is synthesis of NuRD post cytokinesis and that asymmetries in the amounts of NuRD observed in the two daughter cells is a consequence of their different cell sizes (QR.ap is 3x as large as QR.aa). This is supported by the finding that the loss of pig-1, which causes 'equal' division resulting in two daughter cells of similar sizes, abolishes the differences in NuRD seen between the daughter cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed earlier, GFP protein translation and maturation require ~ 30 min in Q neuroblast (Ou &amp; Vale, Journal of Cell Biology, 2009). Even if there is the synthesis of NuRD post cytokinesis, the nascent GFP-tagged protein will not mature within our imaging timeframe, Therefore, NuRD asymmetry is unlikely to be a result of the synthesis of NuRD post cytokinesis. In addition, We found that MYS-1::GFP was symmetrically segregated into the small apoptotic daughter cells and big surviving daughter cells, suggesting NuRD asymmetry may be irrelevant to cell size asymmetry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Interestingly, despite the fact that the loss of pig-1 causes 100% of the divisions to be equal by size and symmetric with respect to NuRD amounts, it only causes about 30% of QR.aa cells to inappropriately survive. This demonstrates that there is a correlation between NuRD asymmetry and daughter cell size asymmetry but NOT between NuRD asymmetry and cell death. This also demonstrates that loss of 'NuRD asymmetry' and presence of NuRD in the daughter that should die is NOT sufficient to block its death.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Cordes et al. 2006 (DOI: 10.1242/dev.02447) reported that in pig-1 loss-of-function mutants, &lt;40% of Q.p lineages produce extra neurons because Q.pp cells inappropriately survive. Noticeably, only 30% and 5% Q.p lineages produce extra neurons in ced-3 and egl-1 loss of function single mutant, respectively. pig-1 ced-3 double mutant or pig-1 egl-1 double mutants show a dramatically stronger phenotype than either single mutant, resulting in about 80% of Q.p lineages producing extra neurons. These results suggest that pig-1 functions in parallel to the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 cell death pathway to promote Q cell apoptosis.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that “loss of 'NuRD asymmetry' and presence of NuRD in the daughter that should die is NOT sufficient to block its death” in pig-1 loss-of-function mutants. However, these results do not rule out the correlation between NuRD asymmetry and cell death. In the pig-1 mutant, the concentration of NuRD in Q.pp might not be high enough to completely block the death pathway. Alternatively, NuRD may be one but not the only factor blocking the cell death pathway.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is imperative to underscore that cellular aberrations observed during early developmental stages frequently undergo compensatory correction during subsequent developmental stages or even initial aging stages. For example, in certain cell migration mutants exhibiting early migration defects, the initial penetrance exceeds 80%; however, the penetrance is mitigated to a mere 30% in adults. Such observations have been corroborated in our prior publications focusing on cell migration dynamics (Wang et al., PNAS, 2013; Zhu et al., Dev Cell, 2016). This appears to be a pervasive phenomenon, echoed by several laboratories specializing in neural development. Sengupta and Blacque’s labs has reported that early aging can ameliorate ciliary phenotypes in C. elegans mutants with compromised intraflagellar transport mechanisms. Accordingly, late developmental stages may act as a compensatory buffer for antecedent developmental abnormalities.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Conclusion 2</p>
<p>&quot;The absence of NuRD triggers apoptosis via the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 pathway, while an ectopic gain of NuRD enables apoptotic cells to survive.&quot; (Abstract)
Results described on pages 8-10 (&quot;Loss of the deacetylation activity of NuRD causes ectopic apoptosis&quot; and &quot;NuRD RNAi upregulates the egl-1 expression by increasing its H3K27 aceylation&quot;) and data shown in Figure S6, Figure 3, Figure S7 and data shown in Figure 5.</p>
<p>Because of the various concerns raised above (major weaknesses) about the data presented in Figure S6, Figure 3, Figure S7 (pleiotropic phenotypes of hda-1 and lin-53 RNAi animals, lack of controls etc), there is no evidence that NuRD has a specific and/or direct effect on egl-1 expression in cells programmed to die or that loss of NuRD causes ectopic egl-1-dependent cell death. The claim that &quot;ectopic gain of NuRD enables apoptotic cells to survive.&quot; is based on Figure 5E, where the authors show that Baf A1 treatment causes symmetric NuRD segregation in 11/12 animals and that QR.aa survives in 11/12 animals. However, those data are unconvincing. As mentioned above (major weaknesses), from the low-quality images provided, it is not clear whether there is 'symmetric NuRD segregation' in Baf A1 treated animals, and the conditions of the animals are a concern because of pleiotropic effects of blocking V-ATPase. (I am not convinced I am actually looking at the same region of an L1 larvae in the three animals because the HDA-1::GFP signal seems inconsistent across them.) One process that is affected by a block of V-ATPase is engulfment. The fact that the authors observe that 130 min post-cytokinesis, QR.aa still persists in Baf A1 treated animals could therefore be the result of a delay in engulfment rather than a block in cell death. In addition, the claim that ectopic gain of NuRD enables apoptotic cells to survive contradicts their findings on loss of pig-1 described about ('Conclusion 1').</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the limitations of our imaging system; however, as we pointed out earlier that we developed imaging methods and kept improving them. We have tried our best to obtain images from developing C. elegans larvae. On the other hand, we showed that hda-1 RNAi and lin-53 RNAi increase the expression of a subset of genes, including egl-1, either directly or indirectly (Fig. 3C). Figure 3B shows the ectopic cell death caused by loss of NuRD is dependent on EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 pathway. While we cannot exclude several other possibilities while addressing such a complex problem in such a challenging model system, these results provide some evidence supporting that our claim can be one of the possibilities.</p>

<p>Conclusion(s) 3</p>
<p>&quot;We identified the vacuolar H+-adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) complex as a crucial regulator of NuRD's asymmetric segregation. V-ATPase interacts with NuRD and is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell. Inhibition of V-ATPase disrupts cytosolic pH asymmetry and NuRD asymmetry&quot; (Abstract)</p>
<p>Results described on pages 10-13 (&quot;V-ATPase regulates asymmetric segregation of NuRD during somatic ACDs&quot;) and data shown in Figures 4, 5, 6, Figures S8, S9.</p>
<p>As outlined above (major weaknesses), the evidence that HDA-1 interacts with the V-ATPase complex is preliminary (no GFP control), and I consider the imaging data showing that V-ATPase asymmetrically segregates very low quality and unconvincing (Figure 6). The data on pH changes are also preliminary as the experiment was not done the way it should have (quenching rather than ratiometric). Finally, there are concerns about the results that apparently demonstrate that inhibiting V-ATPase activity disrupts pH asymmetry and NuRD asymmetry (impact of Baf A1 treatment).</p>

<p>As discussed earlier, Bafilomycin A1 inhibits the activity of V-ATPase, presumably preventing the pumping of protons into apoptotic daughter cells. It is more likely that the apoptotic daughter cell becomes less acidic and more neutral after the treatment of Baf1A, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the changes in fluorescence could be due to changes in the amount of pHluorin protein. A ratio-metric method to measure changes in pH will be further used to distinguish the two possibilities.</p>
<p>We added “although we cannot exclude the possibility that the changes in fluorescence could be due to changes in the amount of pHluorin protein.” to Page 12 line 12 in the revised text.</p>

<p>Conclusion 4</p>
<p>&quot;We suggest that asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase may cause distinct acidification levels in the two daughter cells, enabling asymmetric epigenetic inheritance that specifies their respective life-versus-death fates.&quot; (Abstract)
Discussion and model Figure 6C.</p>
<p>I consider the model premature and not based on any convincing data. In addition, the role of V-ATPase and acidification does not make sense. V-ATPase is involved in the acidification of the lysosomal system (lumen), and it is thought that cytosolic acidification in apoptotic cells is caused by lysosomal leakage. This is not consistent with the authors' model.</p>
<p>This manuscript lacks a section describing details of statistical analyses and the rationale for the chosen test, sample sizes, exclusion criteria, and replication details. Although the sample size is relatively smaller (less than 30), the authors used &quot;unpaired t-test&quot; for most of the tests. They should describe which type of t-test they used (parametric or non-parametric test). They also should provide replication details for non-statistical data set, for example Fig 3F and Fig 4C.</p>

<p>We used the Unpaired two-tailed parametric t-test. We have now added the information for statistic tests in the revised methods and figure legends.</p>
