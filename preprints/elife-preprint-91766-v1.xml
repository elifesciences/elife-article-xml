<title>Abstract</title><p>Dormancy in cancer is a clinical state in which residual disease remains undetectable for a prolonged duration. At a cellular level, rare cancer cells cease proliferation and survive chemotherapy and disseminate disease. We utilized a suspension culture model of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cell dormancy and devised a novel CRISPR screening approach to identify genetic requirements for cell survival under growth arrested and spheroid culture conditions. In addition, multiple RNA-seq comparisons were used to identify genes whose expression correlates with survival in dormancy. Combined, these approaches discover the Netrin signaling pathway as critical to dormant HGSOC cell survival. We demonstrate that Netrin-1 and -3, UNC5H receptors, DCC and other fibronectin receptors induce low level ERK activation to promote survival in dormant conditions. Furthermore, we determine that Netrin-1 and -3 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in HGSOC and demonstrate their overexpression elevates cell survival in dormant conditions. Lastly, Netrin-1 or -3 overexpression contributes to greater spread of disease in a xenograft model of abdominal dissemination. This study highlights Netrin signaling as a key mediator HGSOC cancer cell dormancy and metastasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Relapse from initially effective cancer treatment represents one of the greatest barriers to improving outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Dormant or minimal residual disease that is not clinically detectable is a common source of relapse, particularly in a metastatic setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). This has motivated the search for, and study of, disseminated cancer cells. Cellular dormancy has been characterized in cancer cells derived from a variety of primary disease sites including breast, prostate, melanoma, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Disseminated cells often occupy specific cellular niches in perivascular space or in bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), they adopt catabolic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), and withdraw from the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Stem like phenotypes and epithelial to mesenchymal transition also characterize the biology of these cells as they survive dissemination and lay quiescent in distant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Across a variety of disease sites this dormant state is characterized by diminished Ras-MAPK signaling and elevated p38 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). To develop treatments specifically tailored for dormant cells, a systematic search for vulnerabilities unique to dormancy is needed. To this end, high grade serous ovarian cancer disseminates as growth arrested cellular aggregates that are amenable to modeling in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), suggesting they are ideal to search for survival dependencies of dormant cells.</p>
<p>High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy, accounting for more than 70% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Its poor prognosis is largely attributed to late-stage diagnosis with metastases already present. Metastatic spread is facilitated by multicellular clusters of tumor cells, called spheroids, that are shed into the peritoneal cavity and disseminate to nearby organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The non-proliferative state of spheroid cells renders them chemoresistant and contributes to disease recurrence, emphasizing the need to understand the biology of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Dormant HGSOC cells are characterized by similar metabolic changes, EMT, and cytokine signaling as dormant cancer cells from other disease sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Mechanisms that mediate their dormant properties include AMPK-LKB1 signaling that induces autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), STAT3 and FAK for survival and chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), and DYRK1A signaling to arrest proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Unfortunately, therapeutic approaches to target these pathways in ovarian cancer have yet to emerge, indicating that more candidates are needed.</p>
<p>Netrins are a family of secreted factors that reside in the extracellular matrix around cells and were first identified in axon guidance in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Together with their receptors, Netrins have since been implicated in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Netrin-1 is the most studied and its misregulation in cancer leads to pro-survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Netrin interactions with DCC and UNC5 homologs (UNC5H, UNC5A-D) convert pro-death signals by these dependence receptors to survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Netrin signals through PI3K-AKT and ERK-MAPK are known to participate in growth and orientation by providing guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), while loss of ligand binding leads DCC or UNC5H to stimulate dephosphorylation of DAPK1 that sends pro-death signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The gene encoding DCC is frequently deleted in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), and Netrin-1 blocking antibodies are in Phase II clinical trials for endometrial and cervical carcinomas to inhibit metastatic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Alternative receptors for Netrins such as NEO, DSCAM, and Integrins also mediate their signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), creating a myriad of possible signaling pathways for Netrins to regulate cancer cells. Lastly, functional roles for Netrin-3, -4, and -5 are still relatively unexplored compared to Netrin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), although their expression patterns suggest roles in advanced forms of some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). A functional role for Netrins and their receptors in dormancy, or other aspects of HGSOC spheroid biology have yet to be reported.</p>
<p>In this study we utilized a suspension culture system to interrogate survival mechanisms in dormancy using HGSOC spheroids. To maximize discovery of gene loss events that compromise viability in dormancy, we devised a novel genome-wide CRISPR screen approach that we term ‘GO-CRISPR’. In addition to the standard CRISPR workflow, GO-CRISPR utilizes a parallel screen in which ‘guide-only’ cells lacking Cas9 are used to control for stochastic changes in gRNA abundance in non-proliferative cells. This screen identified multiple Netrin ligands, DCC, UNC5Hs, and downstream MAPK signaling components as supporting survival of HGSOC cells in dormant culture conditions. A transcriptomic analysis of HGSOC spheroids also revealed Netrin signaling components were enriched in HGSOC spheroids compared to adherent cells, and that in the absence of the DYRK1A survival kinase Netrin transcriptional increases were lost. We show that multiple Netrins, UNC5 receptors, and the downstream MEK-ERK axis is crucial for survival signaling in dormancy. Overexpression of Netrin-1 and -3 are associated with poor prognosis in HGSOC and their overexpression in culture increases survival in dormant suspension culture. Lastly, we demonstrate that Netrin signaling contributes to disease dissemination in a xenograft model of metastasis. Our study highlights Netrin-ERK signaling as a requirement for spheroid survival and suggests it may be a potential therapeutic target for eradicating dormant HGSOC cells.</p>

<title>Axon guidance genes are essential factors for EOC spheroid viability</title>
<p>To dissect genetic dependencies of dormant ovarian cancer cells, we utilized a suspension culture system that encourages cellular aggregation, leading to non-proliferative spheroids that resemble dormant aggregates found in ovarian cancer patient ascites. <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold> shows phospho-western blots for ERK and p38 from three high grade serous EOC cell lines; iOvCa147, OVCAR8, TOV1946. Reduced phospho-ERK and elevated phospho-p38 are indicative of the characteristic signaling switch reported to underlie most paradigms of cancer cell dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). To discover genes required for survival in spheroids, we utilized a new approach called GO-CRISPR (Guide Only CRISPR) that we developed specifically for survival gene discovery in three-dimensional organoid/spheroid cell culture conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). GO-CRISPR incorporates sgRNA abundances from non-Cas9-expressing cells to control for stochastic (non-Cas9 dependent) effects that are a challenge in three-dimensional culture conditions with slow or arrested proliferation. We used sequencing to determine sgRNA identity and abundance in the library, initially infected cells, and in cells following 48 hours of suspension culture (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). Read count data was analyzed using a software package that we developed to analyze GO-CRISPR data (summarized in <bold>Sup. Fig. 1A&amp;B</bold>). We filtered the results for genes that had a Spheroid/Adherent Enrichment Ratio (ER) less than 1, with a <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, which is indicative of genes that were most depleted in dormant suspension conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). To assess reliability of screen data, we investigated the classification of non-targeting control sgRNAs. We computed a receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) and determined the area under the curve for each cell line (<bold>Sup. Fig. 1C</bold>). Greater than 95% of sgRNAs in iOVCA147 and OVCAR8 screens were classified as non-essential, while 83% of sgRNAs in TOV1946 cells were non-essential. In addition, we compared GO-CRISPR screen ER values with viability data from siRNA knock down for 35 individual genes we have previously studied in spheroid survival assays (<bold>Sup. Fig. 1D</bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). This revealed a statistically significant correlation between the two sets of data, suggesting that genes we previously knew supported spheroid viability (or were dispensable) were classified similarly by our screen. These controls suggested our screen data was reliable for identifying new survival dependencies.</p>

<p>We found 6,717 genes with an ER below 1 in iOvCa147 cells; and 7,637 genes in TOV1946; and 7,640 genes in OVCAR8 cells. Among these genes; 1,382 were commonly depleted in suspension culture in all three cell lines (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). We performed pathway enrichment analysis on these common genes and identified several significantly enriched pathways. These include primary Reactome gene sets such as signal transduction, metabolism, and signaling by GPCR (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). In addition, we identified a tertiary category called ‘axon guidance,’ that includes numerous components of the Netrin signaling pathway.</p>

<p>DYRK1A was previously discovered to support survival of ovarian cancer cells in suspension culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Since DYRK1A phosphorylates RNA polymerase II in transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), we sought to determine if it regulates gene expression in spheroid survival. We created <italic>DYRK1A<sup>−/−</sup></italic> iOvCa147 cells and confirmed their deficiency for survival in suspension (<bold>Sup. Fig. 2A-E</bold>). Using iOvCa147 and <italic>DYRK1A<sup>−/−</sup></italic> derivatives, we performed RNA-seq on adherent and spheroid cells. We collected spheroids following a 6-hour incubation in suspension because overexpression of known cell cycle transcriptional targets due to DYRK1A loss were first evident at this time point, but loss of viability due to DYRK1A deficiency had not yet occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). We compared iOvCa147 adherent cells to 6-hour suspension culture to identify transcriptional changes that occur as these cells transitioned from adherent conditions to suspension conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). We identified 1,834 genes that were upregulated, and pathway enrichment analysis identified many of the same categories as our CRISPR screen including axon guidance (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). We then compared iOvCa147 spheroid cells to <italic>DYRK1A<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroid cells to identify mRNA expression changes caused by DYRK1A deficiency (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). We identified 744 genes that were downregulated and these also belonged to many of the same pathways, including axon guidance (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We compared enriched pathways from these two RNA-seq analyses with those that were identified in our GO-CRISPR screens to identify gene expression programs in spheroids whose products are essential for cell survival. 78 Reactome pathways were commonly enriched across the GO-CRISPR screens and transcriptomic analyses, including 78 of the 83 pathways identified in RNA-seq from <italic>DYRK1A<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroid cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). The axon guidance pathway was one of the most enriched among these common pathways (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>). These data reveal that our GO-CRISPR screen and transcriptomic analyses converge on this highly specific tertiary Reactome category of axon guidance alongside much broader primary or secondary gene sets. This category includes Netrin ligands, receptors, and downstream signaling components, suggesting a previously unappreciated role in HGSOC spheroid viability.</p>
<p>We separately sought to confirm expression of Netrins and their signaling components in HGSOC spheroids. We examined expression levels of ligands and receptors in the three cell lines used in our GO-CRISPR screen using RT-qPCR (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref></bold>). The precise identities of upregulated genes varies between cell lines, however each cell line increases expression of some Netrins, at least one UNC5, and at least one of DCC, DSCAM, and Neogenin. This suggests that the Netrin pathway may play a previously unappreciated role in HGSOC dormancy and disease progression. Since Netrin signaling has not been previously reported in HGSOC dormancy we examined expression of Netrin-1 and -3 ligands in spheroids isolated directly from patient ascites by immunohistochemistry (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-F</xref></bold>). We confirmed Netrin-1 and -3 antibody specificity using spheroids generated from OVCAR8 cells bearing knock out or over expression of these Netrins (<bold>Sup. Fig. 3</bold>). Spheroids were paraffin embedded and serial sections were also stained with epithelial markers Cytokeratin and EpCAM, as well as p53 to confirm cancer cell identity within spheroids that co-stain for Netrins (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-F</xref></bold>). Overall, this confirms Netrin expression occurs in HGSOC patient spheroids in precisely the context our screen indicates that it is critical for cell survival.</p>

<title>Netrin signaling stimulates ERK to support HGSOC spheroid survival</title>
<p>Netrin ligands and their dependence receptors are best known for their roles in axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), but are appreciated to regulate apoptosis in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold> illustrates components of Netrin signaling and the frequency with which they were discovered to have an ER of &lt;1 in our screens.

To confirm screen findings, we independently knocked out <italic>NTN1</italic>, <italic>NTN3</italic>, <italic>NTN4</italic>, <italic>NTN5</italic>, the UNC5H receptor homologs (<italic>UNC5A</italic>, <italic>UNC5B</italic>, <italic>UNC5C</italic>, and <italic>UNC5D</italic>), as well as <italic>DCC</italic>, <italic>DSCAM</italic>, and <italic>NEO1</italic> alone or in multigene combinations using lentiviral delivery of sgRNAs and Cas9 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and Sup. Fig. 4</bold>). We assessed their loss on spheroid survival in six HGSOC cell lines (iOvCa147, TOV1946, OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR8, and COV318). Loss of at least one netrin ligand resulted in reduced spheroid cell survival in five of six cell lines (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). Notably, Netrin-3 loss showed the most pronounced effect on survival. Cell lines such as OVCAR8 and COV318 were relatively resistant to the deletion of netrin pathway components as individual UNC5H, <italic>DCC</italic>, and <italic>DSCAM</italic> genes rarely affected viability (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). In these instances, combined deletions of UNC5H family members, or <italic>DCC;DSCAM;NEO1</italic> (DDN for short) were either inviable or highly sensitive to suspension culture induced cell death suggesting redundancy in this pathway in some cell lines. Other cell lines, such as OVCAR3, were highly sensitive to the loss of multiple individual ligands and any individual UNC5H receptor was highly sensitizing to death induction in suspension culture (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). Overall, these illustrate a robust and redundant role for Netrins in survival in this dormant cell culture assay. Importantly, loss of receptor expression does not elevate viability as expected for a dependence receptor, suggesting that Netrin receptors in HGSOC simply transmit positive survival signals.</p>

<p>To determine if Netrin dependent signaling is active in EOC spheroids, we transferred serum deprived adherent cells to suspension and stimulated with recombinant Netrin-1 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). Western blotting for phospho-ERK, as a measure of activation, reveals stimulation of MEK-ERK signaling in each of the cell lines tested under spheroid culture conditions. Because MEK and ERK family members were identified in our screens (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>), Netrin is a candidate pathway to provide low level, but essential survival signals through the MAPK pathway. We investigated the dependence of ERK phosphorylation on UNC5H and DDN receptors and demonstrate it is lower when receptors are deleted (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>). Activation using Netrin-1 stimulation of suspension cultures of OVCAR8 cells, or derivatives deleted for UNC5 family members or DDN receptors, indicates that Netrin receptors are essential to activate ERK in dormant suspension culture (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref></bold>). Inhibition of MEK using the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD184352 causes loss of cell viability in suspension culture (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref></bold>), emphasizing that MEK-ERK signaling is key to cell survival. The simplest explanation of this data is that Netrins signal through a heterodimer or multi-receptor complex containing both an UNC5 and DDN component that provides stimulation for MEK and ERK in the absence of mitogenic signals in dormant culture conditions.</p>

<title>Netrin overexpression is correlated with poor outcome in HGSOC</title>
<p>Genomic studies indicate that HGSOC is one of the most aneuploid cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In addition to the frequency of copy number variants per tumor, the locations of gains and losses are dissimilar between cases, making this a highly heterogenous disease. Evaluation of TCGA genomic data for HGSOC indicates rare amplifications or deletions of Netrin or Netrin-receptor genes (<bold>Sup. Fig. 5A</bold>). Because of redundancy of Netrins and their receptor families this data suggests HGSOC cases with deficiency for Netrin signaling are rare. This is consistent with our data that all six cell lines tested reveal evidence of Netrin component dependence for survival (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). Some TCGA HGSOC cases display elevated gene expression for Netrins or their receptors, but only rare cases display low expression (<bold>Sup. Fig. 5B</bold>). Collectively, this suggests that Netrin signaling in HGSOC is retained despite high copy number variation in this cancer type and there is occasional overexpression.</p>
<p>In agreement with our experimental data that multiple Netrin ligands can contribute to spheroid survival in HGSOC (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A&amp;B</xref></bold>), sorting cases by high level expression of Netrin-1 and -3 ligands reveals a significantly shorter survival compared to cases with low level expression and this trend is evident in the cases that only overexpress Netrin-3 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). This genomic data supports the interpretation that Netrin signaling is retained in HGSOC and its elevation is deleterious to patient outcome.</p>

<p>We investigated overexpression of Netrin-1 and -3 in spheroid survival by generating OVCAR8 derivatives that stably overexpress these proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>).

This data indicates that overexpression of either Netrin-1 or -3 increases OVCAR8 cell survival in dormant spheroid culture conditions. Examination of fixed spheroids isolated from this experiment further indicates that elevated survival in this experiment is explained by an increase in abundance of individual spheroids that overexpress either Netrin-1 or -3 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). These experiments reveal the significance of a previously undiscovered role for Netrins in HGSOC.

<title>Netrin overexpression induces abdominal spread of HGSOC</title>
<p>Our findings from CRISPR screens and cell culture experiments indicate that Netrin signaling supports dormant HGSOC cell survival.

<p>We utilized a xenograft assay in which OVCAR8 cells overexpressing Netrin-1 or -3 were injected into the peritoneal cavity and compared with OVCAR8 cells bearing an empty vector as control. Mice were harvest following 35 days to analyze disease dissemination and characterize the effect of Netrins in this model of HGSOC metastatic spread (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>). Necropsy of all animals at endpoint allowed for the identification and quantitation of tumor nodules within the abdomen (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). Petal plots illustrate the frequency of specific organ and tissue sites displaying tumor nodules (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). This revealed spread to the omentum was similar across all genotypes of xenografted cells and occurred in all mice (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). In contrast, tumor nodules were detected with increased abundance on the diaphragm, the liver, and mesenteries that support the uterus (mesometrium) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). In addition to more frequent disease spread to these locations caused by Netrin overexpressing cells, we note that the quantity of nodules was also increase in comparison with OVCAR8 control cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-F</xref></bold>). We confirmed the source of these lesions to be the xenografted cells using immunohistochemical staining for human cytokeratin (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G,H</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this report we investigated survival mechanisms in a model of HGSOC dormancy. We utilized a modified CRISPR screening approach that was adapted to discover gene loss events in largely non-proliferative conditions. We compared essential genes discovered in the screen with gene expression increases identified by RNA-seq in dormant HGSOC cultures. This implicated the Netrin signaling pathway in HGSOC spheroid survival. We independently validated the role of Netrins, their receptors, and downstream intracellular targets MEK and ERK in the survival biology of HGSOC cells in dormant culture. Furthermore, we reveal that overexpression of Netrin-1 and -3 are correlated with poor clinical outcome in HGSOC and over expression of these ligands induces elevated survival in dormant HGSOC culture conditions and disease spread in a xenograft model of dissemination. Our work implicates Netrins, their receptors, and MEK-ERK as a previously unappreciated, but critical signaling network in HGSOC survival.</p>
<p>HGSOC spheroid cell biology has presented a unique challenge to cancer chemotherapy. Dormant spheroids are most abundant in patients with late-stage disease and they contribute to therapeutic resistance and seed metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Hence, there is a critical unmet need to understand HGSOC spheroid dependencies and target them therapeutically. Our data suggests that Netrin signaling is a universally active mechanism in spheroid cell survival. HGSOC is characterized by extensive genomic rearrangements and copy number variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), and we speculate that Netrin signaling is retained because of the extensive redundancy of components of this pathway. Netrin-1 and -3 can both contribute to survival signaling and knock out of three or four different Netrin receptors is necessary to compromise Netrin signaling in survival. A key goal for the future is to identify Netrin-1 or -3 overexpression patients and compare their specific disease progression patterns with our xenograft model. This will be most informative of the effects of Netrin ligand overexpression in scenarios of dormancy, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that Netrins function to stimulate UNC5H and fibronectin repeat containing receptors such as DCC to activate survival signals in HGSOC spheroids. This is distinct from the known role of UNC5H and DCC as dependence receptors where Netrin inhibits their pro-apoptotic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Our data does not show elevated survival of spheroid cells in response to deletions of receptors, even in instances where families of Netrin receptors are co-deleted. Consistent with this observation, over expression of Netrin-1 or -3 in OVCAR8 cells stimulates higher level survival in suspension. In colon cancer, frequent deletions of DCC confer a survival advantage and underscore the dependence receptor concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). In HGSOC DCC or UNC5H deletions are relatively rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). This suggests that ovarian cancer cells utilize Netrin signals for positive survival signaling instead of to neutralize inherent death signals from dependence receptors. Our data suggests that Netrin activates MEK and ERK to support cell survival indicating that targeting ligands, receptors or downstream at MEK are all possible approaches to inhibit this survival pathway. Netrin-1 inhibition in solid tumor xenograft models of melanoma have been shown to be effective in combination with chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), but its effects on a dormant scenario are unknown. Identifying agents that cooperate with standard HGSOC chemotherapeutic agents such as carboplatin would offer an attractive strategy to eradicate dormant cells while combating progressive disease. Alternatively, a novel approach to targeting dormancy discovered in this study is, ironically, MEK inhibition. Dormancy is characterized by low phospho-ERK levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), indicating low MEK activity, yet low levels of RAS-MAPK signaling are known to provide survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). A challenge with deploying MEK inhibitors as an anti-dormancy setting in HGSOC therapy is its incompatibility with standard chemotherapies that rely on cell proliferation. Overall, our study aimed to identify potential new therapeutic targets in dormancy and Netrins and MEK are feasible new candidates for dormant HGSOC disease.</p>
<p>Current literature offers little to connect Netrins with HGSOC beyond the observation that <italic>NTN1</italic> expression is increased in tumors compared to benign lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Similarly, recent dormancy literature beyond HGSOC does not include a role for Netrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). We expect that Netrin signaling may play an unappreciated role in dormancy in other cancer disease site paradigms. As stated in the introduction, dormancy is characterized by acquisition of stem like properties, EMT, and in most paradigms it involves rare cells establishing themselves in perivascular or bone marrow niches. A chick chorioallantoic membrane assay of metastasis in which MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded was monitored for lung dissemination. Inhibition of Netrin-1 with NP137 and treatment with decitabine has been shown to reduce lung seeding suggesting that Netrins are relevant in a metastatic scenario that may include dormant intermediate steps in dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Furthermore, Netrin signaling through UNC5B is known to direct vascular branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). This suggests that Netrins are available in the perivascular niche where dormant cells often reside. Lastly, Netrin-1 has been shown to be a component of the bone marrow niche that suppresses hematopoietic stem cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). While not a cancer dormancy scenario, it indicates that Netrins support some solitary dormant cell properties and are expressed by resident cells in the appropriate dormant cell niches beyond just HGSOC. For these reasons we expect Netrins will have a significant role in tumor dormancy beyond ovarian cancer.</p>

<p>For GO-CRISPR screens and multi-omics comparisons, we used the filtered list of genes obtained using TRACS and performed gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis using the ConsensusPathDB enrichment analysis test (Release 34 (15.01.2019), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/">http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/</ext-link>) for top-ranked genes of interest. p<sub>adj</sub> values and ER values for each gene were used as inputs. The minimum required genes for enrichment was set to 45 and the FDR-corrected p<sub>adj</sub> value cutoff was set to &lt; 0.01. The Reactome pathway dataset was used as the reference. For each identified pathway, ConsensusPathDB provides the number of enriched genes and a q value (p<sub>adj</sub>) for the enrichment. Bar plots were generated in R 3.6.2 using these values to depict the significant pathways identified.</p>

<title>Generating DYRK1A knockout cells</title>
<p>A double cutting CRISPR/Cas9 approach with a pair of sgRNAs (sgRNA A and B) was used to completely excise exon 2 (322 bp region) of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> using a px458 vector (Addgene #48138) that was modified to express the full CMV promoter. PCR primers that flank the targeted region of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> were used to verify deletion. Single-cell clones were generated by liming dilutions and evaluated for DYRK1A status by PCR, western blot, and sequencing. See Supplemental Table 1 for sgRNA and PCR primer sequences.</p>

<title>Western blots</title>
<p>Adherent cells were washed in 1x PBS and lysed on the plate by the addition of complete RIPA buffer with protease (Cell Signaling Technology #5871S) and phosphatase (Cell Signaling Technologies #5870S) inhibitors and incubated for 5-10 minutes on ice. Spheres were collected by gentle centrifugation at 300 rpm, washed gently in ice cold PBS, centrifuged again and then resuspended in RIPA buffer as above. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 RPM at 4°C for 10 minutes. The supernatant liquid for each sample was collected and the pellets re-extracted with RIPA containing the above inhibitor cocktails. Following centrifugation, the supernates for each treatment were collected and pooled. Protein was determined by Bradford assay. To assess the effect of Netrin 1 on downstream signaling, spheres incubated under non adherent conditions for 5 days were challenged with the addition of 500 ng/ml human recombinant Netrin-1 (R&amp;D Systems #6419-N1-025) for a period of 20 minutes before collection. Lysates were mixed with 6x SDS loading dye buffer and resolved using standard SDS-PAGE protocols.

<title>Generation of gene knockout cell lines</title>
<p>Gibson Assembly (NEB #E2611) was used to clone sgRNAs sequences derived from the GeCKO v2 library per gene of interest (<italic>NTN1, NTN3, NTN4, NTN5, DSCAM, DCC, NEO1, UNC5A, UNC5B, UNC5C, UNC5D,</italic> and <italic>EGFP</italic> control (See Supplemental Table 1 for sgRNA sequences for each)) into lentiCRISPR v2 (Addgene #52961). For individual gene knockouts pooled libraries of up to four sgRNAs were generated. For multiple gene knockouts pooled libraries of two sgRNAs/gene were constructed. To each 20-nucleotide guide (Supplemental table I) was appended the 5’ sequence, 5’-TATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACC-3’ and the 3’ sequence, 5’-GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAAT-3’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). A 100 bp fragment was then generated using the forward primer, 5’-GGCTTTATATATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACCG-3’, and reverse primer, 5’-CTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTATTTCTAGCTCTAAAAC-3’. The resulting fragment was gel purified, quantitated by Qubit and cloned into the lentiviral vector as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). To generate virus particles, HEK293T cells were transfected with the assembled plasmid along with plasmids encoding lentiviral packaging proteins. Media was collected after 2-3 days and any cells or debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 x g. Supernatant containing viral particles was filtered through a low protein binding 0.45 µM filter. For each knockout, it was important to ensure that each target cell was transduced with a full complement of guides. To ensure this, the cells were transduced at relatively high MOI. Briefly, 25,000 cells were plated and transduced with fresh HEK293T conditioned media containing virus. While we did not titer the viral preparations for these experiments, previous experience indicated that we could generate sufficiently high virus titers using our protocol. Under these conditions, we found a lack of puromycin sensitive cells following 2-3 days in media containing 2-4 μg/ml puromycin indicating that every cell received at least one virus particle. Multi-gene knock outs were created through multiple rounds of infection with the relevant culture supernatants followed by one round of puromycin selection.</p>

<title>Generation of gene overexpression cell lines</title>
<p>Plasmids encoding Netrin1 and Netrin3 were obtained from Addgene (Ntn1-Fc-His, #72104 and Ntn3-Fc-His, #72105). Netrin1 was PCR amplified using the forward primer 5’-GCTATCGATATCCCAAACGCCACCATGATGCGCGCTGTGTGGGAGGCGCTG-3’ and reverse 5’-GCTATCTCTAGAGGCCTTCTTGCACTTGCCCTTCTTCTCCCG-3’ and cloned into the EcoRV/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1/myc-HisA. For lentiviral expression, pcDNA NTN1 was amplified using the primers, forward 5’-CACTGTAGATCTCCAAACGCCACCATGATGCGCGCTGTGTGGGAGGCGCTG-3’ and, reverse 5’-ACGCGTGAATTCTTATCAACCGGTATGCATATTCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGAT-3’ while NTN3 was amplified from pcDNA NTN3 using, forward 5’-CTCGAGAGATCTGCGGCCGCCACCATGCCTGGCTGGCCCTGG-3’ and the same reverse primer as for NTN1. In this way both constructs carry a C-terminal Myc tag. Both cDNA’s were inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the lentiviral expression vector FUtdTW (Addgene #22478). Construction of lentiviral particle and transduction into the target cells was as described above. Selection was with Zeocin (ThermoFisher #R25001).</p>

<title>Spheroid formation and reattachment assays</title>
<p>For each targeted gene in iOvCa147, OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR8, COV318, or TOV1946 cells, spheroid viability was assayed as follows: Knockout cells were cultured for 72 hours in suspension conditions using ULA plasticware (2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well) to allow spheroid formation. Addition of therapeutics (PD184352) was made at the time of plating. Spheroids were collected and transferred directly to standard plasticware to facilitate reattachment for 24 hours. Reattached cells were fixed in 25% methanol in PBS for 3 minutes. Fixed cells were incubated for 30 minutes with shaking in 0.5% crystal violet, 25% methanol in PBS. Plates were carefully immersed in water to remove residual crystal violet and destained in 10% acetic acid in 1x PBS for 1 hour with shaking to extract crystal violet from cells. Absorbance of crystal violet was measured at 590 nm using a microplate reader (Perkin Elmer Wallac 1420). Each knockout was normalized to the EGFP control. Because crystal violet binds protein, a linear relationship between the absorbance and the number of cells present is obtained and may be represented as the percent of spheroid cells surviving suspension.</p>

<title>Patient derived spheroids</title>
<p>Patient derived spheroids were isolated from ascites fluid obtained from debulking surgical procedures. These HGSOC samples were obtained with permission and institutional REB oversight. Spheroids were prepared by filtering the ascites fluid through a 100μm mesh filter and washing the captured spheroids from the filter with PBS. The spheres were collected by gravity on ice in PBS, washed twice with ice cold PBS and allowed to settle on ice. Spheres were then fixed for 20 minutes in 10% formalin, washed, and resuspended in PBS before being embedded in paraffin.</p>

<title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Fixed organs from xenografts or spheroids were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with H&amp;E. Sections were deparaffinized by standard procedures and antigen retrieval was performed in 10mM citrate, pH6.0. The sections were blocked with 10% goat serum/3% BSA/0.3% Triton X-100 and stained with antibodies to Netrin-1 (Abcam #ab126729, 1:200), Cytokeratin (human specific cytokeratin 7 and 8, ZETA Corporation #Z2018ML, 1:200), EpCAM (Cell Signaling Technologies, #14452), p53 (Cell Signaling Technologies, #2527) and Netrin-3 (1:250). Netrin-3 antibodies were generated using immunized rabbits and their generation and purification will be published elsewhere. Primary antibodies were followed with a biotinylated anti-rabbit (Vector Labs, # BA-1000) or anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #115-067-003) IgG as a secondary antibody (1:500).

<p>Perampalam and colleagues provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that Netrin signaling drives survival of non-proliferating ovarian cancer cells and their dissemination. These <bold>valuable</bold> findings were thought to provide unique insights into the molecular underpinnings of ovarian cancer spread and thus to be of significant interest to cancer biologists. However, the <bold>incomplete</bold> evidence supporting the role of the described Netrin-dependent mechanism in cancer dormancy was found to be a major shortcoming of the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Perampalam et al. describe novel methods for genome-wide CRISPR screening to identify and validate genes essential for HGSOC spheroid viability. In this study, they report that Netrin signaling is essential for maintaining disseminated cancer spheroid survival, wherein overexpression of Netrin pathway genes increases tumor burden in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. They also show that high netrin expression correlates with poor survival outcomes in ovarian cancer patients. The study provides insights into the biology of netrin signaling in DTC cluster survival and warrants development of therapies to block netrin signaling for treating serous ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The study identifies Netrin signaling to be important in disseminated cancer spheroid survival</p>
<p>
- A Novel GO-CRISPR methodology was used to find key genes and pathways essential for disseminated cancer cell survival</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The term dormancy is not fully validated and requires additional confirmation to claim the importance of Netrin signaling in &quot;dormant&quot; cancer survival.</p>
<p>
- Findings shown in the study largely relate to cancer dissemination and DTS survival rather than cancer dormancy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article, the authors employed modified CRISPR screens [&quot;guide-only (GO)-CRISPR&quot;] in the attempt to identify the genes which may mediate cancer cell dormancy in the high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) spheroid culture models. Using this approach, they observed that abrogation of several of the components of the netrin (e.g., DCC, UNC5Hs) and MAPK pathways compromise the survival of non-proliferative ovarian cancer cells. This strategy was complemented by the RNAseq approach which revealed that a number of the components of the netrin pathway are upregulated in non-proliferative ovarian cancer cells and that their overexpression is lost upon disruption of DYRK1A kinase that has been previously demonstrated to play a major role in survival of these cells. Perampalam et al. then employed a battery of cell biology approaches to support the model whereby the Netrin signaling governs the MEK-ERK axis to support survival of non-proliferative ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, the authors show that overexpression of Netrins 1 and 3 bolsters dissemination of ovarian cancer cells in the xenograft mouse model, while also providing evidence that high levels of the aforementioned factors are associated with poor prognosis of HGSOC patients.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall it was thought that this study is of potentially broad interest inasmuch as it provides previously unappreciated insights into the potential molecular underpinnings of cancer cell dormancy, which has been associated with therapy resistance, disease dissemination, and relapse as well as poor prognosis. Notwithstanding the potential limitations of cellular models in mimicking cancer cell dormancy, it was thought that the authors provided sufficient support for their model that netrin signaling drives survival of non-proliferating ovarian cancer cells and their dissemination. Collectively, it was thought that these findings hold a promise to significantly contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancer cell dormancy and in the long term may provide a molecular basis to address this emerging major issue in the clinical practice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several issues were observed regarding methodology and data interpretation. The major concerns were related to the reliability of modelling cancer cell dormancy. To this end, it was relatively hard to appreciate how the employed spheroid model allows to distinguish between dormant and e.g., quiescent or even senescent cells. This was in contrast to solid evidence that netrin signaling stimulates abdominal dissemination of ovarian cancer cells in the mouse xenograft and their survival in organoid culture. Moreover, the role of ERK in mediating the effects of netrin signaling in the context of the survival of non-proliferative ovarian cancer cells was found to be somewhat underdeveloped.</p>
