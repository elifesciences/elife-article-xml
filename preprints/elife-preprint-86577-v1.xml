<title>Abstract</title><p>Bactofilins have emerged as a widespread family of cytoskeletal proteins with important roles in bacterial morphogenesis, but their precise mode of action is still incompletely understood. Here, we identify the bactofilin cytoskeleton as a key regulator of cell growth in the stalked budding alphaproteobacterium <italic>Hyphomonas neptunium</italic>. We show that in this species, the lack of bactofilins causes severe morphological defects, resulting from unconstrained growth of the stalk and bud compartments. In line with this finding, bactofilin polymers localize dynamically to the stalk base and then to the incipient bud neck prior to the onset of bud formation, suggesting that they act as a barrier that retains the cell wall biosynthetic machinery in the respective growth zones. Notably, in a broad range of species, bactofilin genes lie adjacent to genes encoding cell wall hydrolases of the M23 peptidase family. We show that the corresponding <italic>H. neptunium</italic> endopeptidase, LmdC, is a bitopic membrane protein with peptidoglycan hydrolase activity that colocalizes with the bactofilin cytoskeleton, dependent on a direct interaction of its cytoplasmic tail with the bactofilin cytoskeleton. A functional association of bactofilins with M23 peptidases is further verified by studies of the spiral-shaped alphaproteobacterium <italic>Rhodospirillum rubrum</italic>, whose bactofilin and LmdC homologs colocalize at the inner cell curvature, forming a complex that modulates the degree of cell helicity. These findings indicate that bactofilins and M23 peptidases form a conserved functional module that is critical for cell shape determination in morphologically complex bacteria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacteria come in a variety of different cell shapes, which can be further modified by the formation of cellular extensions such as branches or stalks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kysela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Their morphology can change as a function of the cell cycle or in response to environmental cues to ensure optimal fitness in the given ecological niche or growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">van Teeseling et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). In the vast majority of species, cell shape is determined by the peptidoglycan cell wall, a complex macromolecule composed of glycan chains that are crosslinked by short peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Typas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). The synthesis of this mesh-like structure is achieved by an array of synthetic and lytic enzymes that are typically combined into multi-protein complexes and associated with regulatory factors and cytoskeletal elements to facilitate the coordination and spatiotemporal regulation of their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Egan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rohs and Bernhardt, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Basic spherical, rod-like and hyphal shapes are generated by the combined action of the cell division and cell elongation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Margolin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rohs and Bernhardt, 2021</xref>). In most bacteria, cell division is executed by the divisome, which is organized by the tubulin homolog FtsZ and mediates cell constriction and the synthesis of the new cell poles prior to cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McQuillen and Xiao, 2020</xref>). Cell elongation, by contrast, can be achieved by various types of cell wall-biosynthetic complexes, including the so-called elongasome, which is organized by the actin homolog MreB and mediates the dispersed incorporation of new cell wall material along the lateral cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shi et al., 2018</xref>), or different cell pole-associated complexes that promote polar growth of the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). More complex cell shapes are generated with the help of accessory systems that either modulate the activity of the generic cell elongation machinery or have peptidoglycan biosynthetic activity on their own, thereby locally modifying the structure of the peptidoglycan layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>A particularly widespread family of cytoskeletal proteins implicated in cell shape modification are the bactofilins. They are characterized by a conserved central Bactofilin A/B domain (InterPro ID: IPR007607; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Paysan-Lafosse et al., 2022</xref>) with a barrel-like β-helical fold that is typically flanked by short disordered terminal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>). Bactofilins polymerize spontaneously without the need for nucleotide cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Koch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>), driven by head-to-head and tail-to-tail interactions between the core domains of neighboring molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). Lateral interactions between individual protofilaments can then give rise to higher-order assemblies, such as bundles or two-dimensional sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zuckerman et al., 2015</xref>). Previous work has suggested that bactofilin polymers typically associate with the inner face of the cyto-plasmic membrane and localize to regions of high membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caccamo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hay et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>). These structures have been co-opted as localization determinants and assembly platforms by several different morphogenetic systems.</p>
<p>For instance, bactofilin homologs were reported to contribute to rod-shape maintenance in <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Koch et al., 2011</xref>), the establishment of helical cell shape in the human pathogen <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>) as well as the modulation of cell helicity in the spiral-shaped bacterium <italic>Leptospira biflexa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jackson et al., 2018</xref>). Apart from modulating general cell shape, they were found to have an important role in the formation of cellular extensions known as stalks, which are wide-spread among alphaproteobacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wagner and Brun, 2007</xref>). Stalks are elongated protrusions of the cell envelope that are filled with a thin thread of cytoplasm and grow through zonal incorporation of cell wall material at their base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aaron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Randich and Brun, 2015</xref>). In <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and <italic>Asticcacaulis biprosthecum</italic>, bactofilin polymers were shown to localize to the stalk base to direct proper stalk formation. In <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, they recruit a cell wall synthase that contributes to stalk elongation, with their absence leading to a reduction in stalk length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>A. biprosthecum</italic>, by contrast, bactofilin acts as a central topological regulator that is required to efficiently initiate stalk formation and limit peptidoglycan biosynthesis to the stalk base. Its absence leads to the development of pseudostalks, which are much shorter and wider than normal stalks and irregularly shaped, likely due to unrestrained peptidoglycan biosynthesis through the entire stalk envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caccamo et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>While stalks are often accessory structures with highly specialized functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Klein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Persat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wagner and Brun, 2007</xref>), stalked budding bacteria such as <italic>Hyphomonas neptunium</italic> and other members of the <italic>Hyphomonadaceae</italic> and <italic>Hyphomicrobiaceae</italic> use them as integral parts of the cell with key roles in cell growth and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Moore, 1981</xref>). <italic>H. neptunium</italic> has a biphasic life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wali et al., 1980</xref>), in which a non-replicative, motile swimmer cell sheds its single polar flagellum and differentiates into a replicative, sessile stalked cell (<bold><xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Unlike most widely studied model species, it does not divide by binary fission but instead produces new offspring through the formation of buds at the tip of the stalk. As the terminal stalk segment gradually dilates, a flagellum is formed at the pole opposite the stalk. After DNA replication and translocation of one of the sister chromosomes through the stalk into the bud compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jung et al., 2019</xref>), cytokinesis occurs at the bud neck, releasing a new swimmer cell. While the newborn cell first needs to differentiate into stalked cells to start replication, the stalked mother cell restores the stalk and then immediately re-enters the next budding cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wali et al., 1980</xref>). The developmental program of <italic>H. neptunium</italic> involves several switches in the pattern of peptidoglycan biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cserti et al., 2017</xref>). After birth, swimmer cells increase in size by dispersed incorporation of new cell wall material throughout the cell body. Stalk formation is then achieved by zonal growth at the stalk base, followed by localized dispersed growth of the stalk-terminal bud compartment and, finally, zonal peptidoglycan synthesis at the site of cell division. The pattern of new cell wall synthesis is similar to the localization pattern of elongasome components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cserti et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting the involvement of this machinery in all growth phases. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are still unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we identify the bactofilin cytoskeleton as a central player in the regulation of cell growth in <italic>H. neptunium</italic>. We show that in this organism bactofilin polymers localize dynamically to the stalk base and the bud neck, with their absence leading to unconstrained growth of the stalk and bud compartments, indicating a central role in the spatial regulation of cell wall biosynthesis. Interestingly, database searches reveal that in a range of different species bactofilin genes are clustered with genes for cell wall hydrolases of the M23 peptidase family, suggesting a functional connection between these two types of proteins. We find that the <italic>H. neptunium</italic> M23 peptidase homolog LmdC indeed consistently colocalizes with the bactofilin cytoskeleton <italic>in vivo</italic> and interacts directly with bactofilin <italic>in vitro</italic>. Studies in the spiral-shaped alpha-proteobacterium <italic>Rhodospirillum rubrum</italic> again reveal a close association of its bactofilin and LmdC homologs, which colocalize in regions of positive inner cell curvature and are both required to ensure proper cell helicity. Collectively, these demonstrate a conserved functional interaction between bactofilins and M23 peptidases that is important for the control of cell growth in morphologically complex bacteria.</p>

<title>The bactofilin cytoskeleton is required for cell shape determination in <italic>H. neptunium</italic></title>
<p>The <italic>H. neptunium</italic> chromosome contains two open reading frames that encode bactofilin homologs, HNE_0444 and HNE_2629 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Badger et al., 2006</xref>). Reciprocal BLAST analysis using the two bactofilins described in the close relative <italic>C. crescentus</italic> identified HNE_2629 as a potential ortholog of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA (43% identity, 60% similarity). By contrast, HNE_0444 was only distantly related (&lt;30% identity) to either of the two proteins. Based on these results, we propose to designate the two bactofilin homologs of <italic>H. neptunium</italic> BacA (HNE_2629) and BacD (HNE_0444), respectively. <italic>bacA</italic> forms a putative bicistronic operon with <italic>lmdC</italic>, an essential gene encoding an M23 peptidase homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cserti et al., 2017</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). The two genes overlap by 17 base pairs, suggesting that their expression is closely coupled. <italic>bacD</italic>, by contrast, is not part of an operon. Both BacA and BacD display the typical architecture of bactofilins, with a central polymerization domain flanked by short non-structured N- and C-terminal regions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate the role of bactofilins in <italic>H. neptunium</italic>, we generated mutant strains in which <italic>bacA</italic> and <italic>bacD</italic> were deleted either individually or in combination. Upon light and electron microscopic analysis, Δ<italic>bacA</italic> and Δ<italic>bacAD</italic> cells showed severe morphological defects, as reflected by irregularly shaped, elongated and/or oversized cells, buds directly fused with the mother cell body, branched stalks, and multiple wide protrusions that emerged from the cells in an apparently random fashion (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C-F</xref></bold>), reminiscent of the pseudostalks reported for a bactofilin-deficient <italic>A. biprosthecum</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caccamo et al., 2020</xref>). The wild-type phenotype could be largely restored by expressing an ectopic copy of <italic>bacA</italic> under the control of a copper-inducible promoter, even though BacA accumulated to lower-than-normal levels under this condition (<bold><xref rid="fig1_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-C</xref></bold>), confirming the absence of polar effects. The deletion of <italic>bacD</italic>, by contrast, did not cause any obvious cell shape defects (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C,F</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig1_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref></bold>). Moreover, neither <italic>bacD</italic> deletion (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,F</xref></bold>) nor <italic>bacD</italic> overexpression (<bold><xref rid="fig1_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,E</xref></bold>) had any influence on the proportion of distorted or amorphous cells in the Δ<italic>bacA</italic> background. These results demonstrate that BacA has a critical role in the regulation of cell growth in <italic>H. neptunium</italic>, whereas BacD might be an auxiliary factor of so-far unknown function, similar to BacB in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>.</p>
<p>To obtain more insight into the dynamics of cell growth in the Δ<italic>bacA</italic> mutant and identify the initial phenotypic defects induced upon BacA depletion, we imaged a conditional <italic>bacA</italic> mutant after its transfer from permissive to restrictive conditions on an agarose pad (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref></bold>). Following cells at the swimmer-to-stalked cell transition, we observed that stalk formation initially proceeded as in the wild-type strain. However, as BacA was gradually depleted, stalk elongation ceased and the stalk structure started to widen and eventually develop multiple bulges that kept on expanding in an apparently uncontrolled manner. Thus, BacA appears to be required to maintain the polar growth zone at the stalk base, with its absence leading to unconstrained growth of the stalk cell wall. To follow the fate of bactofilin-deficient cells over a prolonged period of time, we monitored Δ<italic>bacAD</italic> cells in a flow-cell system, which ensured optimal nutrient supply throughout the course of the experiment and led to a looser packing of cells, thereby facilitating their visual analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref></bold> and <bold>Video 1</bold>). In this setup, cells again started growth by the formation of irregularly shaped stalks that started to branch, with branches developing either into extensive hyphal-like structures or large, amorphous compartments that may represent morphologically aberrant buds. At irregular intervals, cells divided at the junctions between hyphal and bulged cellular segments, releasing smaller amorphous fragments and, occasionally, also cells with close-to-normal morphology. Wild-type cells, by contrast, showed the usual growth pattern when cultivated under these conditions (<bold>Video 2</bold>). Together, these results underscore the importance of BacA in the spatiotemporal control of cell growth in <italic>H. neptunium</italic>.</p>

<p>To obtain more detailed information about the dynamics of cell wall biosynthesis in the absence of bactofilins, we performed pulse-labeling studies with the fluorescent D-amino acid HADA, which is rapidly incorporated into peptidoglycan when added to the culture medium, thus marking regions of ongoing cell wall biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kuru et al., 2015</xref>). Wild-type cells showed the typical succession of growth modes, with dispersed growth in swimmer cells, zonal growth at the stalk base in stalked cells and localized dispersed growth in the nascent bud (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). In the Δ<italic>bacAD</italic> background, by contrast, this switch in the growth modes was abolished. Cells with close-to-normal morphology that had just initiated stalk formation still showed a distinct fluorescent focus at the stalked pole, suggesting that the initial recruitment of the machinery responsible for stalk formation occurred in a bactofilin-independent manner. However, all other cell types, including amorphous cells with aberrant stalk- and bud-like extensions, only displayed diffuse fluorescence, which points to uncontrolled growth through dispersed incorporation of new peptidoglycan throughout the entire cell envelope. These findings support the notion that the bactofilin cytoskeleton is required to limit cell wall biosynthesis to the different growth zones of <italic>H. neptunium</italic>.</p>

<title>Bactofilins localize dynamically to the boundaries of the <italic>H. neptunium</italic> growth zones</title>
<p>Despite their severe cell shape defects, the Δ<italic>bacA</italic> and Δ<italic>bacAD</italic> mutants showed only a moderate decrease in their apparent growth rates (<bold><xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref></bold>), and the global composition of their peptidoglycan remained essentially unchanged (<bold><xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref></bold> and <bold>Dataset 1</bold>). These findings suggested that BacA might affect cell wall composition at a local scale or act mainly by modulating the activity of the generic cell elongation machinery. To further investigate the role of bactofilins in <italic>H. neptunium</italic>, we first aimed to verify the ability of the proteins to assemble into polymeric scaffolds. A model of the structure of BacA generated with AlphaFold-Multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Evans et al., 2022</xref>) suggested that the protein adopted a β-helical fold and polymerized through head-to-head and tail-to-tail interactions among different subunits (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>), as revealed previously in experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this prediction, purified BacA produced a mixture of long filaments, filament bundles and two-dimensional polymeric sheets <italic>in vitro</italic>, which could be readily visualized by transmission electron microscopy (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Moreover, upon heterologous co-expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, fluorescently tagged derivatives of BacA and BacD colocalized into extended filamentous structures that were associated with the cell envelope (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). These results confirm the polymeric nature of bactofilin assemblies in <italic>H. neptunium</italic> and suggest that BacA and BacD interact with each other <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>Next, we sought to investigate the localization dynamics of the bactofilin cytoskeleton <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we generated strains producing fluorescently tagged BacA or BacD derivatives in place of the native proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Time-lapse microscopy analysis of cells producing a BacA-YFP fusion on agarose pads (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>) revealed that the protein was localized to the new cell pole in swimmer cells and remained associated with the stalk base during the initial phase of stalk formation. At some point, it appeared to attach to the stalk structure and then move away from the base as new cell wall material was inserted. Subsequently, stalk elongation ceased and the terminal stalk segment, delimited by the bactofilin assembly, started to swell and develop into a bud, gradually displacing BacA-YFP in the direction of the stalk base as its size increased. After cell division, both the mother cell and the newborn swimmer cells showed a fluorescent focus, indicating that the bactofilin assembly was split during cell division. To monitor the dynamics of the bactofilin cytoskeleton over multiple division cycles, we analyzed the same strain in a flow-cell system (<bold><xref rid="fig4_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref></bold> and <bold>Videos 3-5</bold>). Under these conditions, the small, newborn swimmer cells were washed away immediately after cytokinesis, preventing the formation of microcolonies around the mother cell. We observed that cell division occurred at a small distance from the BacA-YFP focus, leaving a short stalk-terminal segment in between the bactofilin assembly and the stalk tip. After cytokinesis, the stalk elongated again prior to the initiation of the next budding event. Notably, BacA-YFP was only occasionally detected at the stalked pole during the stalk restoration phase, suggesting that the bactofilin cytoskeleton no longer plays a major role in stalk growth once the stalk structure has been established. To verify the behavior observed in the time-lapse studies, we performed a population-wide analysis of the BacA-YFP localization pattern, based on snap-shot images of exponentially growing cells. A demographic analysis confirmed that the protein localizes to the new cell pole in swimmer cells, remains at the stalk base in cells with short stalks and then moves to a position close to the distal end of the stalk before the onset of budding, remaining associated with the bud neck up to the point of cell division (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). A very similar behavior was observed for a BacD-Venus fusion (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>), consistent with the notion that the two bactofilin paralogs interact. In support of this hypothesis, studies of a strain in which both proteins were fluorescently labeled showed that BacA and BacD indeed colocalized at all stages of the developmental cycle (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4_S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref></bold>). In the absence of BacA, BacD-Venus still formed distinct foci, albeit at apparently random positions within the cell (<bold><xref rid="fig4_S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref></bold>). Notably, a BacA-YFP variant carrying a previously reported mutation that disrupts the polymerization interface (F130R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zuckerman et al., 2015</xref>) was evenly distributed within the cell and unable to functionally replace the wild-type protein, indicating that the formation of polymeric assemblies is essential for proper BacA localization and function (<bold><xref rid="fig4_S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref></bold>). Given the localization of the bactofilin assemblies to the stalk and bud boundaries and the unconstrained growth of these cellular structures in bactofilin-deficient strains, we hypothesize that the bactofilin cytoskeleton has a critical role in limiting the cell wall biosynthetic machinery to the different growth zones of <italic>H. neptunium</italic>.</p>

<title>The assembly state of BacA changes at different stages of <italic>H. neptunium</italic> development</title>
<p>Since bactofilins form highly stable polymers <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zuckerman et al., 2015</xref>), the dynamic localization observed for BacA and BacD was unexpected. To further characterize the dynamics of the bactofilin cytoskeleton in <italic>H. neptunium</italic>, we followed the movement of individual BacA-YFP molecules in swimmer, stalked and budding cells. First, we used single-molecule tracking data to generate high-resolution images of the bactofilin assemblies in each of the three cell types. The results confirmed the cell cycle-dependent localization patterns observed by widefield fluorescence microscopy (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). In addition, they revealed clusters in medial regions of the stalk, which may represent transient polymers formed during the reshuffling of bactofilin molecules between the stalk base and the (incipient) bud neck. When calculating the average mean squared displacement of the tracked BacA-YFP molecules, we found that their mobility decreased gradually from the swimmer over the stalked cell to the budding cell stage (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). For each cell type, the distribution of step sizes in the single-particle tracks suggests the existence of two distinct diffusion regimes, with a static (D= 0.02 ± 0.0004 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and a mobile (D= 0.35 ± 0.004 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) population, likely representing the polymerized and freely diffusible states, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig5_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). In swimmer cells, the static fraction comprised only ~60% of the molecules. Its proportion increased to ~70% in stalked cells and finally reached ~80% in budding cells. The F130R variant, by contrast, showed less than 15% of static molecules, consistent with the notion that it is impaired in polymerization but still able to assemble under certain conditions after undergoing a structural change that generates an alternative polymerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these results show that, in <italic>H. neptunium</italic>, the assembly state of the bactofilin cytoskeleton changes as cells progress through their developmental cycle. Moreover, despite the inherent stability of bactofilin polymers, all cell types display a sizeable fraction of mobile BacA-YFP molecules, which could potentially reflect the dynamic reorganization of bactofilin assemblies during cell growth.</p>

To determine whether this gene arrangement was more widely conserved, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis in which we searched all bacterial genome sequences available for putative bactofilin genes that were located immediately upstream or downstream of open reading frames encoding proteins with a predicted M23 peptidase domain.

<p>To clarify whether LmdC was also required for proper growth in <italic>H. neptunium</italic>, we aimed to generate a mutant strain lacking LmdC activity. However, all attempts to delete the <italic>lmdC</italic> gene or the entire putative <italic>lmdC-bacA</italic> operon or to generate non-functional truncated <italic>lmdC</italic> alleles were unsuccessful, in line with a previous report suggesting that <italic>lmdC</italic> is essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cserti et al., 2017</xref>).

<p>Given that LmdC apparently had a critical role in <italic>H. neptunium</italic> growth, we went on to investigate the physiological role of this protein. LmdC is a predicted bitopic membrane protein with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic region, a transmembrane helix, large periplasmic region composed of a predicted coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal M23 peptidase domain (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). Members of the M23 peptidase family usually have Zn<sup>+</sup>-dependent hydrolase activity and cleave bonds within the peptide side chains of in the peptidoglycan meshwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Firczuk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grabowska et al., 2015</xref>). However, there are also various representatives that have lost their enzymatic activity because of mutations in residues required for metal cofactor binding and have instead adopted regulatory roles in cell wall biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Figueroa-Cuilan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gurnani Serrano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Möll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Poggio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Uehara et al., 2010</xref>).

Upon treatment with the protein, the proportion of dimeric muropeptide species strongly decreased, regardless of the length of the crosslinked peptides and without the formation of major additional monomer peaks (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). The activity of LmdC was particularly high at a pH value of 5, but the physiological significance of this effect remains to be determined.

<title>LmdC associates with the bactofilin cytoskeleton in <italic>H. neptunium</italic></title>
<p>To further investigate whether the peptidoglycan hydrolase LmdC was functionally linked to bactofilins in <italic>H. neptunium</italic>, we set out to conduct <italic>in vivo</italic> co-localization studies. All attempts to generate fluorescently labeled variants of full-length LmdC failed, because the fluorescent protein tags were cleaved off after synthesis of the fusion proteins. However, we reasoned that in case LmdC was associated with the cytoplasmic bactofilin cytoskeleton, its recruitment might be mediated by its N-terminal cytoplasmic region, which is predicted to fold into a short α-helix followed by a conspicuous β-hairpin (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>). To colocalize the two proteins, we therefore generated a truncated reporter construct comprising only the N-terminal cytoplasmic part and the transmembrane helix of LmdC fused to the red fluorescent protein mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></bold>). When produced in a <italic>bacA-yfp</italic> background, the fusion protein (LmdC<sup>N</sup>-mCherry) formed tight foci that perfectly colocalized with BacA-YFP and showed the characteristic cell cycle-dependent localization pattern observed for the bactofilin assemblies (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8B,C</xref></bold>). This result suggests that the N-terminal region of LmdC indeed associates with the bactofilin cytoskeleton, most likely through interaction with its key component BacA. To further validate this hypothesis, we analyzed the interaction between LmdC and BacA <italic>in vitro</italic> by biolayer interferometry. To this end, a synthetic peptide comprising the cytoplasmic region of LmdC (amino acids 1-38) was immobilized on a biosensor and probed with increasing concentrations of purified BacA protein. The results showed that BacA interacts with the LmdC peptide with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of ~15 µM. By contrast, an unrelated peptide used as a negative control was not bound with appreciable affinity (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8D,E</xref></bold>). This result confirms a direct interaction between BacA and LmdC and identifies the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of LmdC as the interaction determinant for BacA association. Notably, however, LmdC<sup>N</sup>-mCherry still formed foci in bactofilin-deficient cells, albeit at apparently random positions, suggesting that the protein can assemble into larger complexes independently of its interaction with BacA (<bold><xref rid="fig8_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title><italic>R. rubrum</italic> BacA recruits LmdC to the inner cell curvature to modulate spiral cell shape</title>
<p>Our bioinformatic analysis suggests that bactofilins and M23 peptidases may be functionally associated in a large number of species. To further explore this possibility, we turned our efforts to the spiral-shaped bacterium <italic>Rhodospirillum rubrum</italic>, which contains a putative <italic>lmdC</italic>-<italic>bacA</italic> operon similar to that in <italic>H. neptunium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Munk et al., 2011</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref></bold>). The <italic>R. rubrum</italic> BacA homolog Rru_A1867 (BacA<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic>) is 37% identical (57% similar) to BacA of <italic>H. neptunium</italic> and also consists of a central Bactofilin A/B domain flanked by terminal non-structured regions (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref></bold>).

<p>Complementation studies showed that the expression of a plasmid-borne <italic>bacA</italic> copy under the control of a weak constitutive promoter attenuated the curvature defect, albeit only partially, likely due to inadequate expression levels (<bold><xref rid="fig9_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). The generation of an analogous plasmid to complement the deletion of <italic>lmdC<sub>Rs</sub></italic>failed, because it was not possible to introduce the construct into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for plasmid propagation, suggesting that the expression of <italic>lmdC<sub>Rs</sub></italic> was toxic to the cells. To further test this hypothesis, we constructed a plasmid enabling the inducible expression of the gene in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Upon induction, a large part of the cell population lyzed, whereas control cells carrying an empty plasmid did not show any phenotypic defects (<bold><xref rid="fig9_S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref></bold>). These results indicate that, similar to its <italic>H. neptunium</italic> homolog, LmdC<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic> is an active enzyme with peptidoglycan hydrolase activity.</p>
<p>To determine how BacA<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic> and LmdC<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic>jointly affect cell curvature, we first generated an <italic>R. rubrum</italic> strain that lacked <italic>lmdC<sub>Rs</sub></italic> and carried a fully functional <italic>bacA<sub>Rs</sub>-mCherry</italic> fusion (<bold><xref rid="fig9_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref></bold>) in place of the native <italic>bacA<sub>Rs</sub></italic> gene. Subsequently, we introduced a replicating plasmid that harbored a constitutively expressed reporter construct encoding the predicted N-terminal cytoplasmic region and the transmembrane helix (amino acids 1-80) of LmdC<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic> fused to the green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shaner et al., 2013</xref>) (LmdC<sup>N</sup><italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic>-mNG) (<bold><xref rid="fig9_S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 4A,B</xref></bold>). We found that the two proteins colocalized, forming patchy or filamentous structures that were preferentially, but not exclusively, positioned at the inner cell curvature (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref></bold>). A very similar pattern was observed in the presence of the wild-type <italic>lmdC<sub>Rs</sub></italic> gene (<bold><xref rid="fig9_S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 4C</xref></bold>). Importantly, the localization pattern of BacA<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic> was not affected by the absence of LmdC<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref></bold>), whereas the LmdC<sup>N</sup><italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic>-mNG fusion was completely dispersed in cells lacking BacA<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic>, indicating that BacA<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic> acts as a localization determinant for LmdC<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9G</xref></bold>). Collectively, these findings confirm a functional association between the bactofilin cytoskeleton and LmdC<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic> in <italic>R. rubrum</italic>. Moreover, they lend support to the idea that bactofilins and M23 peptidases form a conserved module involved in bacterial cell shape determination.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although bactofilins are widely conserved among bacteria, their cellular functions are still incompletely understood. Here, we show that BacA homologs critically contribute to cell shape determination in two morphologically distinct members of the alphaproteobacteria, the stalked budding bacterium <italic>H. neptunium</italic> and the spiral-shaped bacterium <italic>R. rubrum</italic>. In both cases, they functionally interact with LmdC-type DD-endopeptidases to promote local changes in the pattern of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Bactofilins thus complement the activities of the MreB and FtsZ cytoskeletons in the regulation of cell growth and act as versatile cell shape modifiers that facilitate the establishment of complex bacterial morphologies.</p>
<p>In <italic>H. neptunium</italic>, the bactofilin cytoskeleton localizes dynamically to the stalk base and the bud neck, promoting stalk growth and subsequent bud formation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). While flanked by zones of active growth, the stalk itself is usually devoid of cell wall biosynthetic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cserti et al., 2017</xref>). In bactofilin-deficient cells, however, newly formed stalks are remodeled into wide and often branched cellular extensions that grow in an apparently uncontrolled manner (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). This observation suggests that bactofilin polymers establish barriers that normally prevent the entry of elongasome complexes from the mother cell or nascent bud compartments into the stalk. In their absence, the stalk and bud growth zones are no longer confined and expand into the stalk envelope, leading to stalk widening and the formation of irregular bulges due to uncontrolled peptidoglycan incorporation and bud expansion. Bulges or larger amorphous segments at some point separate from the mother cell and then continue to grow as independent cells, indicating that chromosome replication and segregation as well as cell division still occur under these conditions.</p>
<p>The precise mechanism underlying the function of bactofilin in cell morphogenesis remains to be clarified. It is conceivable that bactofilin polymers act by tethering peptidoglycan biosynthetic proteins or establishing physical barriers that hinder the mobility of elongasome complexes (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref></bold>). However, we observed a close functional association of bactofilins with M23 peptidases that appears to be widely conserved among species, suggesting that their activity may be intimately tied to cell wall hydrolysis. The transition zones between the stalk and the adjacent mother cell and bud compartments are characterized by a high degree of positive cell envelope curvature, which is in stark contrast to the negative curvature in the remaining parts of the cell. The hydrolytic activity of <italic>H. neptunium</italic> LmdC may be critical to remodel the cell wall in these zones. Importantly, MreB is thought to move along regions of negative inner curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). The positively curved transition zones generated by the bactofilin-LmdC assemblies could therefore represent topological barriers that are difficult to cross by elongasome complexes, thereby helping to restrict their movement to the mother cell and bud compartments. This effect may also be important during the stalk elongation phases following cell division, when bactofilin assemblies are no longer present at the stalk base.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Cell morphogenesis in <italic>H. neptunium</italic> wild-type (top) and Δ<italic>bacAD</italic> cells (bottom). In wild-type cells, BacA polymers form a complex with the DD-endopeptidase LmdC at the future stalked pole. The hydrolytic activity of LmdC helps to curve the cell wall at the incipient stalk base and thus determine stalk morphology. The zone of high positive inner cell curvature, and potentially the physical barrier constituted by the bactofilin polymer, prevent the movement of elongasome complexes from the mother cell body into the stalk, thereby limiting peptidoglycan biosynthesis to the stalked cell pole. At a later stage, the bactofilin-LmdC complex localizes close to the tip of the stalk and again generates a ring-shaped zone of positive cell curvature, thereby promoting the remodeling of the stalk tip into a spherical bud. At the onset of the budding process, elongasome complexes accumulate in the nascent bud by a so-far unknown mechanism. The positively curved bud neck and the bactofilin polymers prevent the movement of elongasome complexes from the bud into the stalk, thereby limiting cell growth to the bud compartment. In the Δ<italic>bacAD</italic> mutant, cells fail to concentrate LmdC at the future stalk base and bud neck. As a consequence, peptidoglycan biosynthesis is no longer limited to the different growth zones, leading to pseudo-stalk formation and unregulated bud expansion. <bold>(B)</bold> Bactofilin-mediated modulation of cell helicity in <italic>R. rubrum</italic>. BacA<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic> (yellow) recruits LmdC<italic><sub>Rs</sub></italic> (red) to the inner cell curvature.

</fig>
<p>Notably, a role in stalk formation has also been reported for the bactofilin homologs of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>A. biprosthecum</italic>. In <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, the major bactofilin BacA was shown to act as a localization determinant for the bifunctional penicillin-binding protein PbpC, a cell wall synthase that contributes to stalk elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>) and the proper sorting of a stalk-specific protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>). However, the absence of BacA only leads to a moderate reduction in stalk length and leaves overall cell shape unaffected, indicating that this protein has only a minor role in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> stalk formation. In <italic>A. biprosthecum</italic>, by contrast, the deletion of <italic>bacA</italic> completely abolishes stalk formation in rich medium and leads to the formation of wide cellular protrusions, named pseudostalks, under phosphate-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caccamo et al., 2020</xref>). Similar to the amorphous extensions observed for an <italic>H. neptunium</italic> Δ<italic>bacAD</italic> mutant, these structures grow through disperse incorporation of new peptidoglycan and develop into viable offspring. Their formation was also attributed to the entry of cell wall biosynthetic proteins into nascent stalks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caccamo et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>H. neptunium</italic> and <italic>A. biprosthecum</italic> BacA homologs share the same barrier function during stalk formation. However, in <italic>H. neptunium</italic>, another layer of regulation has been added in which bactofilins establish a second barrier close to the stalk tip that enables the formation of stalk-terminal buds. Bud expansion requires the relocation of elongasome complexes from the mother cell to the nascent bud at the onset of bud formation, as likely reflected by the fact that components of the elongasome (MreB, RodZ) and new cell wall biosynthesis can be detected within the stalk during a short interval at the end of the stalk elongation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cserti et al., 2017</xref>). This process may be facilitated by the (partial) disassembly of the bactofilin complex at the stalk base, but the mechanistic details remain to be investigated. Another open question concerns the factors that control the dynamic localization of bactofilin to the stalked pole and the future bud neck in the terminal segment of the stalk. In <italic>A. biprosthecum</italic>, the recruitment of BacA assemblies to the sites of stalk biosynthesis is dependent on the cell wall hydrolase SpmX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caccamo et al., 2020</xref>). However, an <italic>H. neptunium</italic> mutant lacking this protein shows normal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leicht et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the existence of a different localization determinant. The contribution of LmdC to bactofilin localization could not be investigated, because this protein is essential for <italic>H. neptunium</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cserti et al., 2017</xref>). However, the apparently random positioning of LmdC complexes in bactofilin-deficient cells suggests that its recruitment depends on the bactofilin cytoskeleton, excluding it as a potential candidate.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, bactofilins not only mediate stalk formation and stalk-terminal budding but also the formation of curved cell shapes. We show that both BacA and LmdC are required to establish the normal degree of cell helicity in <italic>R. rubrum</italic>, with their absence leading to hyper-curved cells (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C,D</xref></bold>). This result suggests that the two proteins form an accessory module that counteracts the activity of a so-far unknown system responsible for generating spiral cell shape in <italic>R. rubrum</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref></bold>). Cell curvature was shown to promote cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Martinez et al., 2016</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the expression of <italic>bacA</italic> and <italic>lmdC</italic> could be controlled in response to external cues to ensure optimal cell helicity and, thus, fitness in different environments. Our results show that <italic>R. rubrum</italic> cells contain multiple BacA-LmdC complexes that are distributed along the entire cell envelope but localize preferentially to the inner cell curvature (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref></bold>). In this case, it is immediately evident that BacA acts as a localization determinant for LmdC, since LmdC is evenly dispersed in its absence (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9G</xref></bold>). To reduce cell helicity, the hydrolytic activity of LmdC must ultimately stimulate the insertion of new peptidoglycan at the inner curvature, thereby increasing the rate of cell elongation in this region and straightening the cell. A similar mechanism may also be at work in the spirochete <italic>L. biflexa</italic>, where removal of the bactofilin paralog LbbD, whose gene lies adjacent to a gene for putative M23 peptidase (LEPBI_I1430) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>), was found to induce a strong increase in cell helicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jackson et al., 2018</xref>). A different variation of this theme is found in <italic>H. pylori</italic>. There, the bactofilin homolog CcmA also forms multiple assemblies along the cell envelope, which interact with a membrane-spanning protein complex including an M23 peptidase (Csd1) homologous to LmdC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sichel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>). However, these assemblies are enriched at the outer curvature, where they stimulate peptidoglycan synthesis to locally increase the rate of cell elongation over that at the inner curvature, leading to twisting of the cell body.</p>
<p>Notably, in all systems characterized so far in molecular detail, the function of bactofilin-M23 peptidase complexes involves a stimulation of cell wall biosynthesis in a confined region of the cell envelope that entails a local change in cell envelope curvature. In <italic>H. neptunium</italic>, these complexes are only localized to narrow bands at the stalk base and bud neck, generating sharp bends at the transition zones between the stalk and the adjacent mother cell and bud compartments. In spiral-shaped bacteria, by contrast, they are scattered along the entire length of the cell, thereby establishing an elongated zone of increased longitudinal growth that changes overall cell curvature. The same mechanistic principle may also explain the morphogenetic role of bactofilins in so-far uninvestigated systems.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results underscore the role of bactofilins as versatile modulators of bacterial cell shape. In association with M23 peptidases, they form cell wall biosynthetic complexes that introduce local changes in cell envelope curvature. In doing so, they complement the activities of the tubulin and actin cytoskeletons in cell shape determination and thus expand the morphogenetic potential of bacteria, enabling the generation of complex cell shapes that go beyond the generic rod-like or spherical morphologies. It will be interesting to investigate the molecular function of bactofilins in a range of morphologically diverse species to obtain a comprehensive picture of the functionalities provided by these cytoskeletal proteins and the conservation of their mode of action.</p>

<title>Single-particle tracking and diffusion analysis</title>
<p>Cells were cultivated overnight in ASS medium, transferred into fresh medium and grown to exponential phase prior to imaging by slimfield microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Plank et al., 2009</xref>). In this approach, the back aperture of the objective is underfilled by illumination with a collimated laser beam of reduced width, generating an area of ~10 μm in diameter with a light intensity high enough to enable the visualization of single fluorescent protein molecules at very high acquisition rates. The single-molecule level was reached by bleaching of most molecules in the cell for 100 to 1,000 frames, followed by tracking of the remaining and newly synthesized molecules for ~3,000 frames. Images were taken at 30 ms intervals using an Olympus IX-71 microscope equipped with a UAPON 100x/ NA 1.49 TIRF objective, a back-illuminated electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) iXon Ultra camera (Andor Solis, USA) in stream acquisition mode, and a LuxX 457-100 (457 nm, 100 mW) light-emitting diode laser (Omicron-Laserage Laserprodukte GmbH, Germany) as an excitation light source. The laser beam was focused onto the back focal plane and operated during image acquisition with up to 2 mW (60 W/cm<sup>2</sup> at the image plane). Andor Solis 4.21 software was used for camera control and stream acquisition. Prior to analysis, frames recorded before reaching the single-molecule level were removed from the streams, using photobleaching curves as a reference. Subsequently, the streams were cropped to an equal length of 2,000 frames and the proper pixel size (100 nm) and time increment were set in the imaging metadata using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Single particles were tracked with u-track 2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>). Trajectories were only considered for further statistical analysis if they had a length of at least five steps. Data analysis was performed using SMTracker 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Oviedo-Bocanegra et al., 2021</xref>). An estimate of the diffusion coefficient and insight into the kind of diffusive motion exhibited were obtained from mean-squared-displacement (MSD)-versus-time-lag curves. In addition, the frame-to-frame displacements of all molecules in x and the y direction were fitted to a two-population Gaussian mixture model to determine the proportions of mobile and static molecules in each condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Oviedo-Bocanegra et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>Bio-layer interferometry analyses were conducted using a BLItz system equipped with High Precision Streptavidin (SAX) Biosensors (Sartorius, Germany). As a ligand, a custom-synthetized N-terminally biotinylated peptide comprising residues Met1 to Gln38 of LmdC (GenScript, USA) was immobilized on the biosensors. After the establishment of a stable baseline, association reactions were monitored at various analyte concentrations. At the end of each binding step, the sensor was transferred into an analyte-free buffer to follow the dissociation kinetics. The extent of non-specific binding was assessed by monitoring the interaction of analyte with unmodified sensors.

<title>Protein purification</title>
<p>To purify BacA-His<sub>6</sub>, <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen) was transformed with pEC86 and grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8. Isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and the incubation was continued for another 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 7,500 ×g and 4 °C and washed with buffer B2 (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH). Subsequently, they were resuspended in buffer B2 containing 100 μg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/mL DNase I and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol and lysed by three passages through a French press at 16,000 psi. After the removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min, the supernatant was applied onto a 5 mL HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B3 (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH). The column was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of the same buffer, and protein was eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with a linear imidazole gradient obtained by mixing buffers B3 and B4 (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH). Fractions containing high concentrations of BacA-His<sub>6</sub> were pooled and dialyzed against 3 L of buffer B5 (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C. After the removal of precipitates by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min, the protein solution was aliquotted and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C until further use.</p>
<p>To purify LmdC, the protein was first produced as a His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-LmdC fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Marblestone et al., 2006</xref>). To this end, <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells carrying plasmid pLY015 were grown at 37 °C in 3 L of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol. At an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6, the culture was chilled to 18°C, and protein synthesis was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG prior to overnight incubation at 18 °C. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C and washed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl). Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with 5 mM imidazole, 10 mg/mL DNase I and 100 mg/mL PMSF. After three passages through a French press (16,000 psi), the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (30,000 ×g, 30 min, 4 °C). Protein was then purified using zinc-affinity chromatography using a 1 mL Zn-NTA column (Cube Biotech) equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 5 mM imidazole. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 5 to 250 mM imidazole in lysis buffer at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Fractions containing high concentrations of His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-LmdC were pooled and dialyzed against 3 L of low-salt lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol). After the addition of Ulp1 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Marblestone et al., 2006</xref>) and dithiothreitol (1 mM), the protein was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C to cleave off the His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO tag. The solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 38,000 ×g and 4 °C to remove precipitates and then subjected to ion exchange chromatography using a 1 mL HiTrap Q HP column (Cytiva, USA) equilibrated with low-salt lysis buffer. His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO passed the column in the flow-through, and LmdC was eluted with a linear gradient of 150-1000 mM NaCl in low-salt buffer. Fractions containing LmdC were concentrated in an Amicon Ultra-4 10K spin concentrator (MWCO 10,000; Merck, Germany). After the removal of precipitates by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min, LmdC was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a HighLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare, USA) equilibrated with SEC buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl). Fractions containing pure protein were pooled and concentrated.

<caption><title>The dimorphic lifecycle of <italic>H. neptunium</italic>.</title>
<p>A motile, flagellated swimmer sheds its flagellum and forms a stalk at the opposite cell pole. A a defined point in the cell cycle, the terminal segment of the stalk dilates and develops into a new swimmer cell. After cell division, the newborn swimmer cell first needs to differentiate into a stalked cell to initiate a new round of cell division, whereas the stalked mother cell immediately enters the next replication cycle.

<p>In their study, Osorio-Valeriano and colleagues seek to understand how bacterial-specific polymerizing proteins called bactofilins contribute to morphogenesis. They do this primarily in the stalked budding bacterium Hyphomonas neptunium, with supporting work in a spiral-shaped bacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum. Overall the study incorporates bacterial genetics and physiology, imaging, and biochemistry to explore the function of bactofilins and cell wall hydrolases that are frequently encoded together within an operon. They demonstrate an important, but not essential, function for BacA in morphogenesis of H. neptunium. Using biochemistry and imaging, they show that BacA can polymerize and that its localization in cells is dynamic and cell-cycle regulated. The authors then focus on lmdC, which encodes a putative M23 endopeptidase upstream of bacA in H. neptunium, and find that is essential for viability. The purified LmdC C-terminal domain could cleave E. coli peptidoglycan in vitro suggesting that it is a DD-endopeptidase. LmdC interacts directly with BacA in vitro and co-localizes with BacA in cells. To expand their observations, the authors then explore a related endopeptidase/bactofilin pair in R. rubrum; those observations support a function for LmdC and BacA in R. rubrum morphogenesis as well.</p>
<p>An overall strength of this study is the breadth and completeness of approaches used to assess bactofilin and endopeptidase function in cells and in vitro. The authors establish a clear function for BacA in morphogenesis in two bacterial systems, and demonstrate a physical relationship between BacA and the cell wall hydrolase LmdC that may be broadly conserved. The eventual model the authors favor for BacA regulation of morphogenesis in H. neptunium is that it serves as a diffusion barrier and limits movement of morphogenetic machinery like the elongasome into the elongating stalk and/or bud. However, there is no data presented here to address that model and the role of LmdC in H. neptunium morphogenesis remains unclear.</p>
<p>The data presented illuminate aspects of bacterial morphogenesis and the physical and functional relationship between polymerizing proteins and cell wall enzymes in bacteria, a recurring theme in bacterial cell biology with a variety of underlying mechanisms. Bactofilins in particular are relatively recently discovered and any new insights into their functions and mechanisms of action are valuable. The findings presented here are likely to interest those studying bacterial morphogenesis, peptidoglycan, and cytoskeletal function.</p>

<p>This is an excellent study. It starts with the identification of two bactofilins in H. neptunium, a demonstration of their important role for the determination of cell shape and discovery of an associated endopeptidase to provide a convincing model for how these two classes of proteins interact to control cell shape. This model is backed up by a quantitative characterisation of their properties using high-resolution imaging and image analysis methods.</p>
<p>Overall, all evidence is very convincing and I do not have many recommendations on how to improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are only two issues that I have with the paper:</p>
<p>1. The single particle dynamics of BacA is presented as analysed and I would like to give some suggestions how to maybe extract even more information from the already acquired data:</p>
<p>1.1. Presentation: Figure 5A is only showing projections of single particle time-lapse movies. To convince the reader that it was indeed possible to detect single molecules it would be helpful if the authors present individual snapshots and intensity traces. In case of single molecules these will show step wise bleaching.</p>
<p>1.2. Analysis: Figure 5B and Supplement Figure 1 are showing the single particle tracking results, revealing that there are two populations of BacA-YFP in the cell. However, this data does not show if individual BacA particles transition between these two populations or not. A more detailed analysis of the existing data, where one can try to identify confinement events in single particle trajectories could be very revealing and help to understand the behaviour of BacA in more detail.</p>
<p>2. The title of Fig. 3 says that BacA and BacD copolymerise, however, the data presented to confirm this conclusion is actually rather weak. First, the Alphafold prediction does not show the co-polymer, and second, the in vitro polymerisation experiments were only done with BacA in the absence of BacD. Accordingly, the only evidence that supports this is their colocalization in fluorescence microscopy. I suggest either weakening the statement or changing the title adds more evidence.</p>
<p>Finally, did the authors think about biochemical experiments to study the interaction between the cytoplasmic part of LmdC and the bactofilins? These could further support their model.</p>
