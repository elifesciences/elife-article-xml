<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bacterial cell division relies on precise peptidoglycan (PG) remodelling, a process orchestrated by the FtsEX complex. Comprised of FtsE and FtsX, this complex collaborates with EnvC, a periplasmic lytic enzyme activator, to regulate septal PG hydrolysis by amidases like AmiB. While recent structural investigations, particularly of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> FtsEX (<italic>Pae</italic>FtsEX), have shed light on complex interactions and proposed activation mechanisms, the structural intricacies governing PG degradation by the FtsEX complex and EnvC in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cytokinesis remain unexplored. In this study, we present a comprehensive biochemical and structural analysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsEX complexes, unveiling a key role for ATP in complex stabilization that extends across bacterial species. Upon EnvC binding, ATPase activity markedly increases. High-resolution structures of <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX, both in the presence and absence of EnvC, reveal a symmetrical conformation of <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX capable of accommodating the inherent asymmetry of EnvC, mediated by flexible loops within the periplasmic domain. Our negative-staining imaging showcases an elongated <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX/EnvC/AmiB complex reminiscent of the <italic>Pae</italic>FtsEX system. These findings collectively provide intricate insights into the regulation of PG cleavage by FtsEX in <italic>E. coli</italic> - a pivotal model system used in pilot genetic studies, suggesting a conserved mechanism for precise hydrolase activation in bacteria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In most bacteria, peptidoglycan (PG) is remodelled during cytokinesis in a highly coordinated fashion. This coordination ensures the daughter cells are separated without causing lethal lesions of PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). At least 10 essential proteins are involved in cell division in the model organism <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, many of which are organized by the cytoskeletal protein FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). FtsZ recruits FtsA and FtsEX to form the early divisome. After a short pause, the early divisome recruits other division proteins such as FtsK, FtsQLB, FtsWI, and FtsN to the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The arrival of FtsN somehow triggers cell constriction, likely through activating the FtsQLB complex and FtsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Cell separation is then achieved through the amidases AmiA, AmiB, and AmiC. To control their PG hydrolytic activity, these amidases are activated by coiled-coil domain proteins EnvC (for AmiA and AmiB) and NlpD (for AmiC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). If these systems are simultaneously inactivated, the daughter cells will be unable to separate and form long chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>PG remodelling is linked to cytokinesis by an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-like protein complex FtsEX. Rather than transporting a substrate, the FtsEX complex transduces conformational changes that span the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Driven by ATP hydrolysis of FtsE, these changes are required for stimulating EnvC/AmiA/AmiB activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and initiating cell constriction via FtsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The FtsEX complex also recruits other cell division proteins to the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Thus, deletions of <italic>ftsEX</italic> result in non-viable cells unless they are grown in permissive conditions, such as at a low temperature or in media with high osmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Alternatively, the essentiality of <italic>ftsEX</italic> can be bypassed by gain-of-function mutations that strengthen the interaction between FtsN and FtsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>Several partial structures of the FtsEX complex have been reported, some are with their interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Very recently, progress has been made in elucidating the full-length structure of the FtsEX complex from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>Pae</italic>FtsEX), both in the presence and absence of critical regulators like ATP, EnvC, and AmiB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). These structures offer insight into the interfaces between FtsE, FtsX, and their binding partners. In addition, they suggest a mechanism in which the rearrangement of regulatory helices of EnvC and AmiB activates peptidoglycan hydrolysis at the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Yet, the majority of work regarding FtsEX was done in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), where an abundance of genetic studies has laid a significant foundation for our understanding of PG degradation activation in bacterial cell division. However, the intricate molecular basis orchestrating this process remains elusive, underscoring the need for a direct structural and biochemical investigation within this extensively studied model system. Specifically, given the relatively low sequence similarity between the FtsEX complexes from these two species, it is unclear whether the structural information of <italic>Pae</italic>FtsEX can reconcile the findings from genetic studies. Furthermore, previous genetic studies have proposed a direct interaction between FtsEX and components of the constriction ring, such as FtsA and FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), to ensure the accurate localization of FtsEX at the division site. However, there is currently a lack of supporting biochemical and structural evidence in this regard.</p>
<p>In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the structure and function of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> FtsEX complex (<italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX) in conjunction with EnvC, focusing on its regulation of AmiB activation for PG cleavage. Our investigation uncovers a previously unrecognized function of ATP in stabilizing the FtsEX complex, a role that appears to be conserved across different bacterial species. Notably, we observe a substantial increase in the ATPase activity of <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX upon binding with EnvC. High-resolution structures of <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX alone and with EnvC were obtained at 3.9 and 3.4 Å, respectively, offering insights into the EnvC recognition mechanism. Interestingly, <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX maintains a symmetrical conformation even when complexed with the asymmetrical EnvC. Comparative analyses identify the periplasmic domain’s flexible loops as key to EnvC interaction, revealing structural adaptability. Furthermore, our negative-staining imaging experiments unveil an elongated conformation of the <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX/EnvC/AmiB complex for PG cleavage, reminiscent of the FtsEX system from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Together, our results revealed a detailed regulation of PG cleavage by FtsEX in the key model system of <italic>E. coli</italic>, suggesting a conserved mechanism for hydrolase activation in bacteria.</p>

<title>ATP Binding as a Universal Stabilizing Factor for the FtsEX Complex</title>
<p>In our efforts to reconstitute the full-length <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX complex in vitro, we explored various strategies involving changing the expression constructs and extraction conditions. During the purification process, we observed that the protein remained stable in the presence of 10% glycerol. However, almost all protein precipitated out after the removal of glycerol either through size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) or during the peptidisc reconstitution (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). This indicated a low level of stability for the complex. To investigate whether the stability of the FtsEX complex might be dependent on its cognate partner, EnvC, we conducted co-expression experiments by introducing EnvC along with FtsE and FtsX (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Despite the presence of EnvC, FtsEX still exhibited a tendency to precipitate.</p>

</fig>
<p>Given the persistent challenges in achieving a stable FtsEX complex, we redirected our focus towards exploring the potential role of the substrate ligand, ATP, in complex stabilization. ATP, well-known for its role as a biological energy source, has also been associated with the stabilization of proteins, as reported in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments to assess the impact of ATP on the FtsEX or the FtsEX/EnvC complex (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Remarkably, the introduction of ATP resulted in the formation of a robust <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX complex, both in its standalone form and in the presence of EnvC. This complex remained tightly associated throughout the SEC process (<bold>Figure supplement 1A</bold>). Further validation through negative-staining electron microscopy confirmed that the purified <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX complex maintained stability, with clearly discernible features corresponding to an intact ABC transporter containing two FtsE and two FtsX subunits (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). This compelling evidence suggests that ATP, acting as the substrate of FtsEX, also plays a pivotal role in stabilizing this crucial complex formation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, ATP analogues, including ATPψS, AMP-PNP, and ADP, also exhibited similar stabilizing effects (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). As they are not hydrolysable for FtsEX, it indicates that ATP binding, rather than hydrolysis, is sufficient for complex stabilization. This was corroborated by the introduction of a FtsE mutant (E163Q), inspired by related ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), which is incapable of ATP hydrolysis. When this mutant was assessed for complex formation with FtsX in the presence of ATP, it indeed formed a stable complex (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). These findings suggest ATP binding alone is responsible for stabilizing the complex formation.</p>
<p>To expand the scope of our investigation, we explored whether ATP could similarly stabilize FtsEX complexes from other bacterial species, which had also presented challenges in in-vitro reconstitution. We expressed and purified FtsEX from various species, including <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> in the presence and absence of ATP. Remarkably, regardless of the bacterial species, ATP consistently enhanced the stability of the complexes, as demonstrated by either increased complex yield in SEC elution profiles or with a more accurate stoichiometry between FtsE and FtsX as shown from the SDS-page gel (<bold>Figure supplement 1B</bold>). Collectively, our findings underscore the pivotal role of ATP in stabilizing FtsEX complexes. Notably, the ability of other nonhydrolizable ATP analogues to replicate this effect suggests that ATP binding is a crucial step required to facilitate the coupling of FtsX and FtsE for the formation of a functionally stable complex.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Biochemical Characterization of FtsEX and Its Complexes with EnvC in <italic>E. coli</italic></title>
<p>The His-tagged full-length FtsE and FtsX proteins from <italic>E. coli</italic> (str. K-12, MG1655) were overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) and subsequently purified using a combination of affinity and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<bold>Figure supplement 1A</bold>). For subsequent functional and structural investigations, FtsEX was solubilized in DDM and reconstituted into peptidiscs (see Methods). Given the proven stabilization role, 0.5 mM ATP was maintained throughout the entire purification process of <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX.</p>
<p>Assays assessing ATPase activity demonstrated that, in contrast to previously reported FtsEX complexes from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, the <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX complex exhibited obvious basal ATPase activity (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). To confirm this, we introduced the FtsE mutant (E163Q) as a control, which was not able to hydrolyse ATP. As anticipated, ATPase activity in the mutant was markedly diminished (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>), while low ATPase activity was still detected, potentially attributable to co-purified proteins.</p>
<p>To understand the role of ATP binding/hydrolysis on EnvC recruitment, a protein pull-down assay was conducted. As ATP was present in the purified protein, a wash step with buffer in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 10% glycerol was performed to remove the extra ATP for the FtsEX complex that bind to the resin. Next, bound FtsEX and EnvC were mixed in the presence of ATP or its non-hydrolysable analogue, ATPψS (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). The results revealed that EnvC stably associated with FtsEX, with its binding seemingly unaffected by ATP hydrolysis. This was evidenced by the comparable amounts of EnvC bound in the presence of 3 mM ATPψS and 3 mM ATP. To confirm this, FtsEX<sup>E163Q</sup> mutant was introduced. Results, similar to those from the wild type, showed that the mutant still demonstrated similar EnvC binding levels. This confirms that ATP binding is sufficient to initiate EnvC recruitment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the effects of EnvC binding on the ATPase activity of <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX were probed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). An enhanced activity was observed upon the addition of EnvC. This EnvC-mediated increase in ATPase activity was further validated through ATPase assays involving varying ATP concentrations for both FtsEX and the FtsEX/EnvC complex. Both sets of data fit well with the Michaelis-Menten equation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Notably, in the presence of EnvC, the V<sub>max</sub> (92.7±5.1 nmol/mg/min) was approximately 2.2-fold higher than that observed for FtsEX (42.7±2.1 nmol/mg/min) alone. However, no large differences were observed regarding the K<sub>m</sub> (0.11±0.02 mM for FtsEX/EnvC; 0.13±0.02 mM for FtsEX). Together, these findings underscore that in the presence of ATP, FtsEX and EnvC form a robust complex; while <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX inherently exhibits ATPase activity, the presence of EnvC stimulates this activity.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>CryoEM structure of <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX reveals a symmetrical PLD arrangement</title>
<p>To elucidate the full-length structure of <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX, we subjected the WT <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX sample, incubated with 3 mM ATPψS, to single-particle CryoEM analysis and achieved a resolution of 3.7 Å (<bold>Figure supplement 2</bold>). This map was of sufficient resolution for detailed model-building for the Transmembrane domains (TMD), the nucleotide-binding domains (NBD), and a large portion of the Periplasmic domain (PLD); in addition, density for two bound nucleotides was clearly captured as well (<bold>Figure supplement 3A</bold>).</p>
<p><italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX, akin to most Type VII ABC transporters, possesses one coupling helice (CH) and a C terminal tail (C-tail) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Cryo-EM structure reveals the assembly of the full <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX system (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). This comprises two cytosolic FtsE NBD domains and two FtsX, with TMD domains embedded in the membrane and PLD extending into the periplasmic space. Both TMD and NBD regions in the <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX structure exhibit canonical folds, similar to other characterized Type VII ABC transporters such as MacB, LolCDE, and <italic>Pae</italic>FtsEX. The overall conformation of <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX is quite similar to that of <italic>Pae</italic>FtsEX (<bold>Figure supplement 3B</bold>).

<p>The entire PLD domain comprises a smaller loop and a larger domain. For ease of reference, only the larger domain is termed the PLD (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The smaller loop encompasses 14 residues between TM3 and TM4. The principal PLD domain, spanning residues between TM1 and TM2 (106–208), displays a canonical topology, with a Porter domain and an X-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Compared to the TMD and NBD regions, PLD domains exhibit higher flexibility, evident from their diminished EM density at a contour level of 0.22 in Chimera. Lowering the contour to 0.1 in Chimera reveals clear density, enabling the visualization of PLD’s secondary structures (<bold>Figure supplement 2F</bold>), with an exception for the X-lobe segment with residues 161-168 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>).

<p>To dissect the state of the bound EnvC, we compared our cryoEM FtsEX/EnvC complex with the crystal structure of the PLD domain in complex with EnvC (PLD/EnvC) from <italic>E. coli</italic> (PDB code: 6TPI) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>), where EnvC was in an inactivated state. In the PLD/EnvC structure, a distinct asymmetrical conformation is evident: one PLD is positioned about 5 Å higher than the other one, accommodating the bound asymmetric EnvC with its LytM domain locked (<bold>Figure supplement 8A, left</bold>). However, in our full-length ATP-bound FtsEX/EnvC structure, the two PLDs are highly symmetrical (<bold>Figure supplement 8A, right</bold>). Besides this, the bound EnvC has also undergone conformational shifts (<bold>Figure supplement 8B</bold>). In contrast to the PLD/EnvC crystal structure, where the two CCD helices exhibit huge asymmetry (<bold>Figure supplement 8B, left</bold>), our structure reveals a more symmetrical arrangement induced by simultaneous compression from both PLD domains (<bold>Figure supplement 8B, right</bold>). Consequently, the distance between the terminal residue of the α1 helix (Q127) and the initial residue of the α2 helix (Q143) within the CCD domain is reduced from 24 Å to a mere 10 Å, while residing at a relatively similar height from the PLD domain. This compression of the CCD helices may drive the release of the LytM domain, supported by the lack of LytM density in our EM map. Together, we hypothesize that in the presence of ATP, the LytM domain is released, facilitating AmiB recruitment.</p>

<title>Detailed EnvC interactions with FtsEX</title>
<p>The ATP-bound <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX/EnvC structure also revealed detailed interactions with EnvC.

<p>Upon detailed examination, we noticed that the motifs in FtsEX directly interacting with EnvC are primarily loops (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). The main loop engaging with EnvC is X-lobe (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>), covering residues G157-L171. This segment, originally disordered in the FtsEX alone structure, becomes crucial for engaging with EnvC, involving a binding interface of about 1204 Å<sup>2</sup>. The other interacting regions are loops spanning residues Y104-Q109 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>) and D208-L214 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>), and a segment of the small loop in the PLD domain (Q307-T311) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>). Combined, these loops (eight in total from the two PLD domains) are responsible for the majority of the interactions with EnvC. This inherent adaptability in the loops provides FtsEX the versatility needed for binding the asymmetrical EnvC. Notably, the interactions contributed by these loops are largely hydrophobic (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-G</xref>)</bold>. Thus, our data suggest that the flexible loops, along with the hydrophobic interactions they facilitate, equip the symmetrical FtsEX to effectively engage with asymmetrical partners.</p>

<title>Reconstitution and Elucidating the Elongated Conformation of <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsEX/EnvC/AmiB Complex for PG cleavage</title>
<p>The absence of the LytM density, in comparison to the crystal structure of PLD/EnvC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), indicates that our ATP-bound FtsEX/EnvC sample likely has the LytM domain released, primed for hydrolase interaction. To further validate this, we conducted pull-down assays (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). When we incubated AmiB with either the FtsEX/EnvC complex or the mutant FtsEX<sup>E163Q</sup>/EnvC in the presence of ATP or its nonhydrolyzable analogue, ATPψS, both the wild type and mutant FtsEX/EnvC complexes effectively pulled down AmiB. Notably, ATP and ATPψS showed similar levels of AmiB binding, confirming that ATP-bound FtsEX/EnvC is prepped for AmiB recruitment. Additionally, we investigated the influence of AmiB binding on FtsEX’s ATPase activity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>).

<p>Next, we sought to check if the bound AmiB is activated for PG cleavage.

An early eluting fraction was observed, and subsequent SDS-PAGE confirmed the co-existence of FtsE, FtsX, EnvC, and AmiB in this fraction. The reconstituted PG-cleaving complex of <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX/EnvC/AmiB, was further analysed using negative staining (NS) electron microscopy (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). Many of the observed particles exhibited long tails in the image, a feature suggestive of AmiB binding. A 2D classification analysis presented an elongated structure, mirroring previous observations in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The electron densities on the periplasmic side displayed a distinct rod-like form in alignment with the FtsEX complex’s central axis, extending about 290 Å into the periplasm, which we attribute to the bound EnvC and AmiB. This conformation likely represents an activated state prepared for PG cleavage. However, due to the <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX complex’s instability during the PG hydrolysis assay, we couldn’t directly check PG cleavage activity. The attempt to obtain a CryoEM structure of the complex was also unsuccessful, possibly because of its inherent flexibility, preventing the reconstruction of a clear EM map. Nonetheless, it has been well established in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, where the active FtsEX/EnvC/AmiB complex also assumes an extended form (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>), we propose that our observed complex with a similar conformation is also in an activated state, primed for PG degradation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A structural and functional description is here provided for the complete <italic>E. coli</italic> lytic machinery regulated by the FtsEX system. We observed an antiparallel arrangement of PLDs in the periplasmic space in the <italic>Eco</italic>FtsEX complex. Incorporation of ATP, but not hydrolysis, is capable of facilitating EnvC binding. The ternary complex increases its ATPase activity, compared with that of the binary complex. Interestingly, upon ATP binding, the flexibility of loops in the PLD domain allows a symmetric interaction with the EnvC coiled-coil domain that is compressed to allow the release of its LytM domain. While resolution for the complete FtsEX/EnvC/AmiB complex limited detailed descriptions, our cryo-EM data points to a very similar disposition of the lytic complex to that reported for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) with a fully expanded EnvC coiled-coil that would place the amidase at ∼300 Å over the inner membrane.</p>
<p>In the context of recruiting an asymmetric partner by the inherently symmetrical FtsEX complex, our study has unveiled a dynamic and intriguing mechanism. At the centre of this mechanism lies the highly flexible PLD domain (composed of the porter domain and the loops connecting the different TM of FtsX), which demonstrates exceptional adaptability due to the presence of multiple flexible loops, including the x-lobe. These flexible loops within the PLD domain function as dynamic connectors, enabling the FtsEX complex to finely tune its conformation and engage with asymmetric partners in an exceptionally adaptable manner. This inherent plasticity empowers the FtsEX complex to align itself with the specific structural requirements of its binding partners, thereby facilitating their effective interaction and subsequent regulatory processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, these flexible elements serve a dual role by providing the necessary adaptability to bridge the gap between the inherent symmetry of the FtsEX complex and the asymmetry present in its interacting partners. This becomes particularly intriguing in the context of bacterial cell division, where the same FtsEX complex must interact with a variety of asymmetric binding partners. These binding partners exhibit diverse structural features and distinct binding interfaces, necessitating a mechanism that allows the inherently symmetrical FtsEX complex to engage with them with precision and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Our study has uncovered a previously unrecognized role of ATP in the stabilization of the FtsEX complex, a role that extends beyond its established function as a substrate. This discovery not only expands our understanding of the functional versatility of ATP but also unravels a crucial aspect of how FtsEX complexes are regulated. The stabilizing influence of ATP is particularly intriguing, as evidenced by our experiments across diverse bacterial species, suggesting that ATP-driven stabilization might represent a shared feature among FtsEX complexes in various bacteria. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that both the FtsEX systems from <italic>E. coli</italic> and the recently characterized system from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> exhibit a relatively low basal ATPase activity. However, this activity is significantly enhanced in the presence of their respective cognate binding partner, EnvC. Specifically, for <italic>E. coli</italic>, the ATPase activity increases by a factor of 2.2, whereas for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the increase is even more pronounced, with a greater than 20-fold enhancement observed. This additional regulatory mechanism ensures that, under normal physiological conditions, minimal energy is expended. It is only during the cell division process, when components like EnvC are involved, that the ATPase activity of FtsEX becomes fully activated.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our cryoEM map of EcoFtsEX, expressed from its native host bacteria <italic>E. coli</italic>, revealed an additional density located on the bottom side of the complex adjacent to FtsE (<bold>Figure supplement 2</bold>, and <bold>Figure supplement 9A</bold>). This suggests the co-purification of endogenously binding proteins with the complex. To identify the proteins, we conducted mass spectrometry on the purified FtsEX sample. Our results showed that in addition to FtsE and FtsX, FtsA was present in significant abundance, followed by FtsZ (<bold>Figure supplement 9B</bold>). This observation is consistent with previous genetic and phenotypic observations on the <italic>E. coli</italic> divisome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). We also noted during the course of these studies that the interaction of <italic>E.coli</italic> FtsA with FtsEX protein complexes from other species is indicative of the conserved and fundamental nature of divisome protein interactions. For example, the overexpression of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> FtsEX in <italic>E. coli</italic> also indicated an association with <italic>E.coli</italic> FtsA and could be isolated using styrene-maleic acid isolation and affinity purification as shown in <bold>Figure supplement 9C</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). If this holds true, it would provide a mechanism for the temporal regulation of PG cleavage at the cell division site, as FtsA and FtsZ are the key components of the constriction ring at the septum site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). However, the identity of this density and the association of FtsEX with other Fts components for divisome formation warrant further investigation to fully elucidate the role of FtsEX in bacterial cell division.</p>
<p>In combination with previous studies on the inactivated EnvC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and AmiB activation by <italic>Pae</italic>FtsEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), we propose a working model that may be conserved across Gram-negative FtsEX systems (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>). Firstly, physiological ATP stabilizes the formation of a functional FtsEX regulator with low basal ATP hydrolysis activity. Secondly, the inactivated EnvC approaches the periplasmic space via the relatively flexible PLD domain of FtsEX, which adopts a highly asymmetric conformation, as shown in the inactivated EnvC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Thirdly, upon full recognition by FtsEX, considering the presence of ATP in cell and a symmetrical conformation defined within the context of a full-length FtsEX complex, recruited EnvC is compelled to adopt a relatively symmetrical conformation, involving squeezing of the coiled-coil domain to facilitate the release of the LytM domain; With EnvC engagement, the ATPase activity of FtsEX is fully activated. Finally, the released LytM recruits amidases through direct interaction, consequently removing the blocking helix from the catalytic site and activating PG cleavage. Remarkably, expansion of the coiled-coil domain in EnvC would place the amidase domain ∼300 Å over the inner membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria (as here seen in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and also in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)), compatible with the location of the septal PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and avoiding damages into the non-septal cell wall. Throughout this process, ATP binding appears to be sufficient, with ATP hydrolysis potentially serving as a driving force for the release of EnvC and amidases from FtsEX, allowing them to be recycled to a normal ABC transporter. This transporter by itself may play additional roles, such as antibiotic resistance, as suggested by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). For the temporal regulation of PG cleavage, the potential interaction between FtsEX and FtsA/FtsZ, as indicated in this study and previous genetic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), could bridge the PG-cleaving complex with septum constriction ring, facilitating precise cell division at the septum site. This model provides a potential conserved mechanism for PG cleavage activation by FtsEX and illuminates its temporal regulation. Although further validation is required, our results offer valuable biochemical and structural insights that complement and elucidate decades of genetic research in <italic>E. coli</italic> and other Gram-negative bacteria.</p>

<caption><title>A working model illustrating FtsEX complex formation, recruitment of EnvC and AmiB, and the temporal regulation of PG cleavage activation in Gram-negative bacterial systems.</title>
<p>Initially, the presence of physiological ATP stabilizes a fully functional FtsEX complex. Subsequently, the asymmetrical and inactive EnvC approaches the relatively flexible PLD domain of FtsEX. Upon complete recognition by FtsEX, the CCD domain of recruited EnvC undergoes a conformational change to a symmetrical state, involving compression of the coiled-coil domain, facilitating the release of the LytM domain. Interaction with EnvC activates FtsEX’s ATPase activity. The liberated LytM recruits amidases through direct interaction with the catalytic domain’s blocking helices, leading to the removal of the obstructing helix from the catalytic site and activation of PG cleavage. ATP hydrolysis likely triggers the release of EnvC and AmiB, allowing FtsEX to return to its normal ABC transporter state with a low basal ATPase activity. The potential interaction between FtsEX and the constriction ring component FtsA/FtsZ precisely locates the PG-cleaving complex at the septum for temporal regulation of PG cleavage.</p></caption>

The cells are subsequently harvested through centrifugation using a Beckman JLA9-1000 rotor at 5,180 xg and 20°C for 15 minutes. Harvested cells are then stored at −80°C.</p>
<p>For membrane extraction, the frozen cell pellets undergo thawing at 4°C and are resuspended in buffer A, consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mM ATP/MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Lysis of the mixture was achieved with a high-pressure homogenizer (AH-100D, ATS). Subsequent centrifugation was performed at 27,000 xg for an hour at 4°C. Following this, solubilization of the membrane takes place in buffer B, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 1.3% n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM), pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 2 mM ATP/MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and agitated for 2 hours at 4°C. Post a 30-minute centrifugation at 100,000 xg, the solubilized membrane fraction gets incubated with TALON SuperFlow resin (Takara 635502) for 1 hours at 4°C and was later washed using buffer B supplemented with 20 mM imidazole. The present detergent is substituted by a peptide (GenScript) to form peptidiscs, employing the “on-beads” method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) with a final peptide concentration of 1mg/ml. The FtsEX complex, reconstituted in the peptidiscs, is washed using buffer B inclusive of 20 mM imidazole and eluted with buffer B rich in 200 mM imidazole. The purified protein is directed through a gel filtration chromatography column (Superose 6 increase 10/300) and is eluted with buffer C, which includes 25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mM ATP/MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The fractions bearing the FtsEX complex are combined together, concentrated to 3 mg/ml by concentrator (Amicon® Ulyra-15 100kDa), and preserved at −80°C for further protein interaction, pull-down, and ATP hydrolysis assay.</p>

<title>Protein expression, purification of EnvC, AmiB</title>
<p>For the expression of EnvC, AmiB and their respective variants, the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3) pLysS was employed. These cells were cultured in LB medium with 50 µg/ml kanamycin at 37°C. Once the OD<sub>600</sub> reached a value of 0.6, induction was facilitated by the addition of IPTG to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and this was maintained for 16 hours at 20°C. Following the induction, cells were harvested through centrifugation using a JLA9-1000 rotor in a Beckman centrifuge at 5,000 rpm and 20°C for a duration of 15 minutes. The resulting pellets were stored at −80°C. For further processing, these frozen pellets were brought to 4°C for thawing, using buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol) and then subjected to lysis via a high-pressure homogenizer (AH-100D, ATS). Subsequent centrifugation was performed at 27,000 xg for an hour at 4°C. The resultant supernatant was incubated with TALON resin, followed by a wash using buffer C complemented with 20 mM imidazole. Post-washing, the His-tagged SUMO protease Ulp1 was introduced to the resin-buffer at a ratio of 0.1 mg Ulp1 for every liter of culture, facilitating the cleavage of the SUMO tag over 2 hours at ambient temperature. The processed samples were isolated, concentrated, and then passed through the Superose 6 increase 10/300 column previously balanced in buffer D which includes 25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0.

<title>Protein interaction assay</title>
<p>To explore the interaction between FtsEX and EnvC, we employed affinity chromatography with TALON resin. Specifically, 15 μg of FtsEX or its ATPase-defective variants were introduced to the resin pre-equilibrated at room temperature, utilizing a Micro Gravity Column, for a 15-minute duration. After washing away unbound FtsEX with 100 μl of buffer E (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) supplemented with 5 mM imidazole (to get rid of the extra ATP present in the protein), we incorporated 5 μg of EnvC diluted in 60 μl of the aforementioned buffer in the presence and absence of ATP or ATP analogs. This mixture was incubated for an additional 10 minutes. Subsequently, the beads were rinsed with buffer E supplemented with 5 mM imidazole in the presence and absence of ATP or ATP analogs. To elute the bound proteins and possible interaction partners, we utilized 20 μl of buffer E with a concentration of 300 mM imidazole, either with or without 2 mM ATP or ATP analogs. Eluted proteins were then analyzed using SDS-PAGE.</p>
<p>To explore the interactions between FtsEX/EnvC and AmiB, 20 μg of FtsEX/EnvC or its ATPase-deficient variants, FtsE<sup>E163Q</sup>X/EnvC, were added to the TALON resin. This was done either in the presence or absence of 2 mM ATP or ATP analogs and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Any free FtsEX/EnvC or FtsE<sup>E163Q</sup>X/EnvC was removed by washing the resin with 100 μl of buffer E containing 5 mM imidazole. Following this, 10 μg of AmiB were introduced to the resin with or without 2 mM ATP or ATP analogs. After a 10-minute incubation, a triple wash was executed using 100 μl of buffer E supplemented with 5 mM imidazole, either with or without 2 mM ATP or ATP analogs.

<title>Reconstitution of FtsEX complexes</title>
<p>For the reconstitution of the FtsEX-EnvC complex, an excess of EnvC, three times the amount of FtsEX, was introduced to the resin-bound FtsEX-peptidiscs during the purification process. This mixture was allowed to interact at room temperature for 15 minutes. Subsequent to this incubation, any free EnvC was removed by washing with buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole. The FtsEX-EnvC complex was subsequently eluted from the resin using buffer A supplemented with 200 mM imidazole. This eluted protein was applied to additional purification through gel filtration on a Superose 6 increase 10/300 column, equilibrated in buffer B.

For the elucidation of the Michaelis-Menten constants, varying concentrations of ATP/MgCl<sub>2</sub>, ranging from 0.05 to 5 mM, were utilized to initiate the enzymatic reaction. After a 10-minute incubation at 37°C, 80 μl of the Malachite Green-Ammonium Molybdate (MG-AG) solution was added and the resultant mixture was quickly vortexed to deactivate the enzyme. A brief 2-minute incubation was followed by the addition of 10 μl of a 34% (w/v) sodium citrate solution, with a subsequent vortexing step. Absorbance was then recorded at 650 nm after a 5-minute interval. Quantification of released inorganic phosphate (Pi) was achieved using a calibration curve derived from known Pi concentrations in a K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> solution.

<p>For negative staining of the FtsE<sup>E163Q</sup>X-EnvC-AmiB sample, it was diluted to a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml. A 5 μl aliquot of the sample was deposited onto a 300 mesh copper grid coated with carbon film (EMS). After allowing the sample to interact with the grid for 60 seconds, any surplus was carefully blotted away using filter paper. The grid was then washed with 5 μl of Uranyless EM Stain (EMS). Subsequent to the washing step, the grid was stained by applying another 5 μl of the Uranyless EM Stain for 120 seconds. Excess stain was again removed with filter paper. The prepared grid was left to air-dry under ambient conditions for approximately 15 minutes.

<p>For electron microscopy (EM) data processing, CryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) was utilized. Dose-fractionated movies, captured with a K3 Summit direct electron detector, was first applied to motion correction using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). A sum of all frames from each movie was generated applying a dose-weighting scheme. This sum was utilized for all subsequent image-processing steps, except for defocus determination.

The initial particle selection was achieved using the blob picker, which was subsequently refined by the template picker. The steps of 2D and 3D classification, as well as 3D refinement, were carried out using the “2D Classification”, “Ab-initial Reconstruction”, and “Heterogeneous Refinement” functions. For further refinement, both the “Homogeneous Refinement” and “Non-Uniform Refinement” functions were employed. The overall resolutions was determined using the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) threshold of 0.143.

<title>Model building and refinement for FtsEX and its complex with EnvC</title>

<p>This is a <bold>useful</bold> study that provides <bold>solid</bold>, yet confirmatory findings about the complex (FtsEX) that controls peptidoglycan remodeling during bacterial cell division. The authors capitalize on the finding that ATP binding stabilizes the FtsEX complex allowing structural characterization for this system. A model is then developed using biochemical approaches to explain ATP regulation. The resulting model would be strengthened were the authors to incorporate their structural findings as well as previously published work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Li and colleagues overcome solubility problems to determine the structure of FtsEX bound to EnvC from E. coli.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The structural work is well done and the work is consistent with previous work on the structure of this complex from P. aerugionsa.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The model does not take into account all information that the authors obtained as well as known in vivo data.</p>
<p>The work lacks a clear comparison to the Pseudomonas structure highlighting new information that was obtained so that it is readily available to the reader.</p>
<p>The authors set out to obtain the structure of FtsEX-EnvC complex from E. coli. Previously, they were unable to do so but were able to determine the structure of the complex from P. aeruginosa. Here they persisted in attacking the E. coli complex since more is known about its involvement in cell division and there is a wealth of mutants in E. coli. The structural work is well done and recapitulates the results this lab obtained with this complex from P. aeruginosa. It would be helpful to compare more directly the results obtained here with the E. coli complex with the previously reported P. aeruginosa complex - are they largely the same or has some insight been obtained from the work that was not present in the previous complex from P. aeruginosa. This is particularly the case in discussing the symmetrical FtsX dimer binding to the asymmetrical EnvC, since this is emphasized in the paper. However, Figures 3C &amp; D of this paper appear similar to Figures 2D &amp; E of the P. aeruginosa structure. Presumably, the additional information obtained and presented in Figure 4 is due to the higher resolution, but this needs to be highlighted and discussed to make it clear to a general audience.</p>
<p>The main issue is the model (Figure 6). In the model ATP is shown to bind to FtsEX before EnvC, however, in Figure 1c it is shown that ADP is sufficient to promote binding of FtsEX to EnvC.</p>
<p>The work here is all done in vitro, however, information from in vivo needs to be considered. In vivo results reveal that the ATP-binding mutant FtsE(D162N)X promotes the recruitment of EnvC (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2011 108:E1052-60). Thus, even FtsEX in vivo can bind EnvC without ATP (not sure if this mutant can bind ADP).</p>
<p>Perhaps the FtsE protein from E. coli has to have bound nucleotides to maintain its 3D structure.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Peptidoglycan remodeling, particularly that carried out by enzymes known as amidases, is essential for the later stages of cell division including cell separation. In E. coli, amidases are generally activated by the periplasmic proteins EnvC (AmiA and AmiB) and NlpD (AmiC). The ABC family member, FtsEX, in turn, has been implicated as a modulator of amidase activity through interactions with EnvC. Specifically how FtsEX regulates EnvC activity in the context of cell division remains unclear.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Li et al. make two primary contributions to the study of FtsEX. The first, the finding that ATP binding stabilizes FtsEX in vitro, enables the second, structural resolution of full-length FtsEX both alone (Figure 2) and in combination with EnvC (Figure 3). Leveraging these findings, the authors demonstrate that EnvC binding stimulates FtsEX-mediated ATP hydrolysis approximately two-fold. The authors present structural data suggesting EnvC binding leads to a conformational change in the complex. Biochemical reconstitution experiments (Figure 5) provide compelling support for this idea.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The potential impact of the study is curtailed by the lack of experiments testing the biochemical or physiological relevance of the model which is derived almost entirely from structural data.</p>
<p>Altogether the data support a model in which interaction with EnvC, results in a conformational change stimulating ATP hydrolysis by FtsEX and EnvC-mediated activation of the amidases, AmiA and AmiB. However, the study is limited in both approach and scope. The importance of interactions revealed in the structures to the function of FtsEX and its role in EnvC activation are not tested. Adding biochemical and/or in vivo experiments to fill in this gap would allow the authors to test the veracity of the model and increase the appeal of the study beyond the small number of researchers specifically interested in FtsEX.</p>
