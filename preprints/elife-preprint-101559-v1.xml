<title>Abstract</title><p>Signaling dynamics are crucial in biological systems, and biosensor-based real-time imaging has revolutionized their analysis. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) excels over the widely used fluorescence intensity imaging by allowing the measurement of absolute signal levels, independent of sensor concentration. This capability enables the comparison of signaling dynamics across different animals, body regions, and timeframes. However, FLIM’s advantage can be compromised by factors like autofluorescence in biological experiments. To address this, we introduce FLiSimBA, a flexible computational framework for realistic <underline>F</underline>luorescence <underline>Li</underline>fetime <underline>Sim</underline>ulation for <underline>B</underline>iological <underline>A</underline>pplications. Through simulations, we analyze the signal-to-noise ratios of fluorescence lifetime data, determining measurement uncertainty and providing necessary error bars for lifetime measurements. Furthermore, we challenge the belief that fluorescence lifetime is unaffected by sensor expression and establish quantitative limits to this insensitivity in biological applications. Additionally, we propose innovations, notably multiplexed dynamic imaging that combines fluorescence intensity and lifetime measurements. This innovation can transform the number of signals that can be simultaneously monitored, thereby enabling a systems approach in studying signaling dynamics. Thus, by incorporating diverse factors into our simulation framework, we uncover surprises, identify limitations, and propose advancements for fluorescence lifetime imaging in biology. This quantitative framework supports rigorous experimental design, facilitates accurate data interpretation, and paves the way for technological advancements in fluorescence lifetime imaging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and photometry (FLiP) are powerful methods for revealing the dynamics of biological signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bastiaens &amp; Squire, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Becker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brinks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lakowicz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Laviv et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lazzari-Dean et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lee et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Massengill et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mongeon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yasuda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yasuda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">S. X., Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Fluorescence lifetime refers to the time between excitation of a fluorophore and emission of light. Compared with intensity-based imaging, the greatest advantage of fluorescence lifetime is its insensitivity to fluorophore concentration. As a result, fluorescence lifetime can be used to compare the dynamics of biological signals across animals or over long periods of time despite changes in sensor expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Laviv et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al., 2024</xref>). Furthermore, it offers the potential to quantitate absolute values of biological signals because of its quantitative nature and its insensitivity to sensor expression. Because of these advantages, additional FLIM-compatible sensors have been developed and FLIM has been increasingly adopted to elucidate the dynamics of many types of biological signals over multiple time scales.</p>
<p>Although fluorescence lifetime is independent of sensor expression when only the sensor is present, in biology experiments, this very advantage of FLIM breaks down when multiple other factors are present. These include autofluorescence (natural emission of light by biological tissue after light absorption), background light (e.g., ambient light), dark current and afterpulse of the photomultiplier tube (PMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akgun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Georgakoudi &amp; Quinn, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Malak et al., 2022</xref>). As sensor expression varies, the relative contribution of sensor fluorescence over these other sources of light or electrical noise varies correspondingly, leading to an apparent change in fluorescence lifetime. Thus, to harness the power and correctly interpret the results of FLIM and FLiP experiments in biological tissue, it is critical to quantitatively understand the regime in which fluorescence lifetime varies with sensor expression, and the range in which sensor expression does not significantly alter lifetime measurements. Furthermore, these additional factors introduce bias and noise to fluorescence lifetime measurements. As innovation pushes the technological boundary to image larger fields of view at higher speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bowman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Raspe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Shcheslavskiy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Y. Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), it is critical to understand how these factors contribute to signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, and how many photons are required to achieve a certain SNR in biological settings.</p>
<p>An effective tool for exploring how experimental parameters contribute to outcomes is simulation. Both analytical and simulation methods have provided insights into issues such as the SNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Esposito et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gerritsen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Köllner &amp; Wolfrum, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kumar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nasser &amp; Meller, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Netaev et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Philip &amp; Carlsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Roethlein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Trinh &amp; Esposito, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Turton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Walsh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yasuda, 2006</xref>). However, prior work usually assumes the presence of sensor fluorescence only, without considering the important contributions to noise and bias due to other factors, such as autofluorescence and afterpulse of the PMT. Consequently, these simulations are useful in vitro but are not readily applicable in biological settings. Therefore, to understand how experimental conditions influence lifetime estimates for biological applications, simulations with realistic and, ideally, measured data must be performed.</p>
<p>Here we introduce <underline>F</underline>luorescence <underline>Li</underline>fetime <underline>Sim</underline>ulation for <underline>B</underline>iological <underline>A</underline>pplications (FLiSimBA) and use it to quantitatively define the potential and limitations of fluorescence lifetime experiments in biological settings. FLiSimBA is a flexible platform designed for realistic simulation of fluorescence lifetime data with empirically determined parameters through time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). FLiSimBA recapitulates experimental data. Using FLiSimBA, we determined the photon requirements for minimum detectable differences in fluorescence lifetime, thus providing realistic estimates of the SNR in biological tissue and the necessary quantification of measurement uncertainty for correct data interpretation. Furthermore, we challenge the conventional view that fluorescence lifetime is insensitive to sensor expression levels and establish quantitative limits of insensitivity, defining the potential and limits of comparing fluorescence lifetime measurements in biology. Finally, we use FLiSimBA to propel innovation in FLIM by assessing the impact of hardware improvement on the SNR, quantifying the value of developing sensors with spectra unaffected by autofluorescence, and specifying sensor characteristics that would greatly expand the power of simultaneous real-time measurements of multiple signals (multiplexing) with both intensity and lifetime properties of sensors. Our results show that considering relevant contributors and noise to fluorescence lifetime measurements in biological contexts does not merely add detail. Rather, these quantitative changes produce qualitatively different conclusions that require careful consideration to avoid misinterpretation of data and to harness the potential of FLIM. Thus, we provide a versatile tool for simulating experimental conditions, a quantitative framework for evaluating fluorescence lifetime results, and insights into the potential and limitations of fluorescence lifetime measurements in biological applications.</p>

<title>Simulation of fluorescence lifetime data in biological tissue</title>
<p>To realistically mimic the fluorescence lifetime in biological tissue, we simulated contributions from sensor fluorescence, autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background, which is composed of both a small amount of light leakage and the dark current of the photon detectors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>The simulation procedure of FLiSimBA.</title>
<p>The sensor fluorescence lifetime distribution of a FRET-based sensor was modeled as a double exponential decay, as shown in <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref> (<italic>τ<sub>1</sub></italic> = 2.14 ns, <italic>τ<sub>2</sub></italic> = 0.69 ns) and the lifetimes of photons were sampled with replacement. After the sensor fluorescence was convolved with the probability density function (PDF) of the instrument response function (IRF), the following were added to produce the final simulated data: autofluorescence (autoF) empirically measured from brain tissue with photon number <italic>F<sub>autoF</sub></italic>, afterpulse of the photomultiplier tube (PMT), and background signal (consisting of the dark current of the PMT and light leak) with photon number <italic>F<sub>background</sub></italic>. The histograms of the final simulated data were similar to those of the experimental data. The simulation was repeated 500 times under each <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and sensor fluorescence photon number (<italic>F<sub>sensor</sub></italic>) condition. The fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> (based on a double exponential decay fitting of the final simulated data) and empirical lifetime were used for subsequent analyses and evaluations.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>For sensor fluorescence, we sampled a specific number of photons (<italic>F<sub>sensor</sub></italic>) with replacement from an ideal distribution of photon lifetimes. In the examples in this study, we used the lifetime distribution of the FLIM-compatible A Kinase Activity Reporter (FLIM-AKAR), a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor that measures the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) in a variety of biological contexts, including brain slices and freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lee et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tilden et al., 2024</xref>). The fluorescence lifetime of FLIM-AKAR follows a double exponential decay defined by the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="572686v3_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>F(t)</italic> is the number of photons that arrive at time t, <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> is the number of photons at time 0, <italic>τ<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>τ<sub>2</sub></italic> are time constants corresponding to lifetime distributions of the donor fluorophore that is either free or undergoing FRET, and <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>2</sub></italic> are the proportions of the donor fluorophores in these two states (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Following sampling, we convolved the lifetime histogram with the probability density function (PDF) of an instrument response function (IRF) to account for instrument noise.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we added a specific number of sampled photons (<italic>F<sub>autoF</sub></italic>) from an autofluorescence curve, whose distribution was determined via fluorescence measurements in brain tissue without any sensor expression. The autofluorescence lifetime histogram exhibited faster decay than that of FLIM-AKAR (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). After that, we added the afterpulse of the PMT, long-lasting signals from ionization of residual gas inside the PMT following a photon detection event(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akgun et al., 2008</xref>). The afterpulse was modeled as an even lifetime distribution with the amount of signals as a fraction of sensor fluorescence. Finally, we added a specific number of background signals (<italic>F<sub>background</sub></italic>) that was empirically determined from measurements, accounted for largely by ambient light leakage and the dark current of the PMT. We generated 500 simulated fluorescence lifetime histograms for each <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and sensor photon count (for additional details, see Materials and Methods).</p>
<p>The simulated histogram closely matched the experimental histogram (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Following histogram generation, we used two commonly used fluorescence lifetime metrics to evaluate the simulated data: fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> after double exponential fitting of the final simulated data or calculation of the average lifetime of all photons, which we termed the empirical lifetime. The fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime were used for subsequent analyses and evaluations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Bias and noise introduced by different sources of fluorescence</title>
<p>To understand how different fluorescence and electronic sources contribute to bias and noise, we analyzed the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime across a range of values for the simulated <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and sensor photon counts. Autofluorescence (autoF) decreased the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime, consistent with the faster decay of autofluorescence compared with that of FLIM-AKAR sensor fluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; p &lt; 0.0001, sensor + autoF vs sensor only under all sensor photon number conditions for both fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime).

However, afterpulse and background increased the empirical lifetime, consistent with their presentation as an even distribution across lifetime time channels with a higher mean lifetime than that of FLIM-AKAR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; p &lt; 0.0001, final simulated data vs sensor + autoF for all sensor photon number conditions).</p>

</fig>
<p>Importantly, the biases introduced by autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background were less pronounced at higher sensor photon counts, which can be explained by the relatively small contribution of these factors when sensor fluorescence is high. Notably, as the number of sensor photons increased, the biases not only decreased but also plateaued, which made fluorescence lifetime less dependent on the number of sensor photons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-2B</xref>). Furthermore, the variance also decreased at higher photon counts for both the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and the empirical lifetime (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, higher photon counts resulted in both less bias and less noise.</p>
<p>To quantify how well our simulation matches the experimental conditions, we calculated empirical lifetime after each simulation step. The empirical lifetime of final simulated data was not significantly different from that of experimental data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>; adjusted p = 0.20, final simulated data vs experimental data; n = 500 and 7 respectively). Thus, our simulated fluorescence lifetime data recapitulated experimental data in biologically relevant settings.</p>
<p>In summary, using FLiSimBA, we realistically simulated fluorescence lifetime data in biological settings and quantitatively defined how different sources of signals contribute to bias and noise. These curves and quantitative approaches can therefore be used to evaluate the impact of optimization of these different sources on fluorescence lifetime measurements.</p>

<title>Determination of minimum photon number requirements to achieve specific SNRs</title>
<p>How many photons do we need for a given FLIM experiment in a biology experiment? Are more photons always better? A greater number of photons translates into a better SNR but also a lower sampling rate and reduced field of view. How can we quantitatively find the optimal compromise among these factors? As sensor fluorescence increases, the variances of both the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and the empirical lifetime decrease (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), and the ability to detect a specific amount of fluorescence lifetime response increases. Although the number of photons required to achieve a certain SNR was analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Esposito et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gerritsen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Köllner &amp; Wolfrum, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kumar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nasser &amp; Meller, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Netaev et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Philip &amp; Carlsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Roethlein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Trinh &amp; Esposito, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Turton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Walsh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yasuda, 2006</xref>), such analysis was not performed with consideration of biological samples in realistic experiments involving autofluorescence, background, and afterpulse.</p>
<p>To determine the minimum number of photons required for a certain SNR, we analyzed the minimum detectable differences (MDD) in both the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and the empirical lifetime for different numbers of sensor photons and repeated measurements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The MDD was calculated with 80% power and a 5% significance level. As the number of sensor photons increased, the MDDs decreased. As the number of repeated measurements increased, the MDD also decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-3C</xref>). Importantly, the MDD curves provide quantitative information on the minimum number of photons required for a certain amount of expected signal. For example, to detect a <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> change of 0.006 or a lifetime change of 5 ps with one sample measurement in each comparison group, approximately 300,000 photons are needed. As the sensor fluorescence increased, the gain in SNR decreased. Thus, MDD curves generated with FLiSimBA are instrumental for determining the optimal experimental conditions (for example, optimal imaging speed and sizes of imaging fields) necessary to detect a specific amount of lifetime change.</p>

<p>Using realistic determination of the SNR with FLiSimBA, we also quantitatively evaluated the impact of specific hardware changes on the SNR. Hybrid detectors (HBDs) are advantageous over traditional gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) PMTs because of their narrower IRF width and lack of afterpulsing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becker et al., 2011</xref>). However, hybrid detectors are more expensive. Thus, it is valuable to quantify the benefits HBDs can provide over traditional GaAsP PMTs for SNRs. We generated fluorescence lifetime histograms with narrower IRFs and no afterpulses for HBDs and compared them with the simulated data for traditional GaAsP PMTs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-4B</xref>). Hybrid detectors and GaAsP PMTs displayed similar photon-dependent changes in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-4D</xref>). Furthermore, a given sensor photon number gave a comparable MDD for HBDs and GaAsP PMTs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-4F</xref>). The similarity in the MDD curves can be explained by similar levels of variance between HBDs and PMTs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-4D</xref>): although HBDs with a narrower IRF introduced less noise than GaAsP detectors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-H</xref>; noise from sampling from the IRF: standard deviation (STD) of fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>: 0.0008 for GaAsP PMTs and 0.0005 for HBDs; STD of empirical lifetime: 0.0003 for GaAsP PMTs and 0.0001 for HBDs), the noise of lifetime measurements was dominated by photon noise, and not by IRF noise (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-H</xref>; noise from sampling of photons: STD of fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>: 0.0028 for both GaAsP PMTs and HBDs; STD of empirical lifetime: 0.0025 for both GaAsP PMTs and HBDs). Thus, although HBD can offer other advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Trinh &amp; Esposito, 2021</xref>), HBDs with a narrower IRF and no afterpulse yield little improvement in the SNR for fluorescent protein-based sensors in biological applications.</p>

<p>In summary, the quantitative and biologically realistic curves generated with FLiSimBA allow users to determine the appropriate tradeoff in each experiment. Given the specific sensor brightness, sensor lifetime, and expected signal amplitude in specific biological applications, FLiSimBA allows the users to select the imaging speed and size of the imaging field to achieve the desired SNR.

<title>Expression level dependence of fluorescence lifetime estimates</title>
<p>Sensor expression levels often change over days and across animals and is usually assumed not to influence lifetime estimates because fluorescence lifetime is an intensive property of fluorophores. However, this assumption is true only if the biosensor is the only contributor to fluorescence. With autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background signals present in biological applications, the amount of sensor fluorescence relative to these contributing factors can lead to an apparent change in fluorescence lifetime estimates even if the biosensor is in the same conformational state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we challenge the conventional view that fluorescence lifetime is independent of sensor expression and use simulation to define the range in which sensor expression has a negligible influence on lifetime.</p>
<p>We first determined how sensor expression levels altered the relative responses in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). When <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> changed from 0.4 to 0.5, both fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime increased as expected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-5C</xref>; adjusted p &lt; 0.0001, <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> = 0.4 vs <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> = 0.5, under all photon number conditions for both fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime). As the sensor photon count increased, fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> increased and empirical lifetime decreased with both plateauing at high photon counts (Fig.<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B-5C</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, 800,000 photons vs 550,000 photons or less for fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>, 800,000 photons vs 700,000 photons or less for empirical lifetime, for both <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> = 0.4 and <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> = 0.5). This photon-dependent change in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or lifetime is consistent with the diminishing effect of autofluorescence, background, and afterpulse. We next determined whether the response amplitude also changed as the sensor photon count increased by comparing the changes in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime when actual <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> changed from 0.4 to 0.5. As the sensor photon count increased, the change in the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime also showed an apparent increase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-5E</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, 800,000 photons vs 450,000 photons or less for fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and 400,000 photons or less for empirical lifetime). The response dependence on photons approached asymptotes at high photon counts: with the parameters used in our case study, the fluorescence lifetime responses were relatively stable at sensor photon counts of 500,000 and above (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-5E</xref>). Thus, our results challenge the widely held view that relative fluorescence lifetime changes are independent of sensor expression level and define a quantitative threshold of sensor expression that allows comparison of lifetime responses across different sensor expression levels.</p>

A higher sensor photon count reduces the likelihood of significant changes in lifetime due to sensor expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Thus, we determined the minimum number of sensor photons needed for a specific change in sensor expression to have a negligible impact on lifetime measurements (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We first determined the apparent change in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime introduced by the change in sensor expression levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, purple traces).

<title>Innovating to reduce sensor expression dependence: avoiding autofluorescence and lowering background signal</title>
<p>Sensor expression dependence limits comparisons of fluorescence lifetime values and responses across chronic periods and across animals. Thus, we investigated the extent to which the dependence of sensor expression could be mitigated by achievable technological advances, in particular, by developing sensors outside the autofluorescence spectra (e.g., red-shifted sensors), and/or by lowering background signal (e.g., with photodetectors with low dark current, together with better light proofing) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<p>If sensors could be made with emission spectra that do not overlap with tissue autofluorescence (e.g., red or far-red sensors), both the relative response and absolute values of fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> no longer depended on sensor expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, 7C left panels; 7A: p = 0.047 for 30,000 photons, p &gt; 0.8 for the other photon counts, vs 800,000 photons;). This expression independence can be explained by the fact that only autofluorescence contributes to the sensor expression-dependent bias of fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). With no autofluorescence, the relative response in empirical lifetime showed less dependence on sensor expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, left, p &lt; 0.05 for 150,000 photons or less, p &gt; 0.2 for the other photon counts, vs 800,000 photons), whereas the absolute empirical lifetime could tolerate less change in sensor expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, left). Thus, sensors with spectra that avoid overlap with autofluorescence are completely independent of sensor expression levels when fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> is used as the metric of evaluation.</p>
<p>When background signals were lower, both the relative response and absolute values of fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> showed a similar sensor expression dependence to that of the higher background (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, 7C, middle panels; 7A: p &lt; 0.05 for 350,000 photons or less, p &gt; 0.1 for the other photon counts, vs 800,000 photons). This is because the background is considered in the fitting process as a mathematical term. For the empirical lifetime response, a lower background slightly reduced the sensor expression dependence (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, middle, p &lt; 0.05 for 350,000 photons or less, p &gt; 0.1 for the other photon counts, vs 800,000 photons). Notably, a lower background signal caused greater tolerance of sensor expression level changes for the measurement of absolute empirical lifetime (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, middle). Thus, a lower background does not significantly alter the sensor level dependence when fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> is used as the metric of measurement, but it significantly reduces the sensor level dependence when empirical lifetime is used as the metric of measurement.</p>
<p>Consistent with the results above, when there was no autofluorescence and the background was lower, there was no longer sensor expression dependence for fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>, right panels; 7A: p &gt; 0.99 for all photon counts vs 800,000 photons), and the sensor expression dependence also became much less pronounced for empirical lifetime (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>, right; 7B: p &lt; 0.05 for 150,000 photons or less, p &gt; 0.3 for the other photon counts, vs 800,000 photons).</p>
<p>In summary, using FLiSimBA, we show quantitatively the benefit gained from future technological innovations: developing sensors outside autofluorescence spectra or having a lower background can significantly reduce the dependence of fluorescence lifetime on sensor expression in biological systems, increasing the versatility of lifetime comparison across animals, brain regions, and chronic time scales, as well as allowing us to quantify the absolute levels of analytes.</p>

<title>Innovating for multiplexing: revealing the feasibility and specifying sensor characteristics for multiplexed imaging with both fluorescence lifetime and intensity</title>
<p>Understanding of any biological systems requires the quantitation of the dynamics of many biological signals that interact together. Multiplexed imaging with sensors with different excitation and emission spectra is powerful, but only a few color channels can be effectively separated. Combining fluorescence lifetime and intensity could greatly enhance the capacity to monitor more biological signals simultaneously and this idea is becoming increasingly feasible with the development of genetically encoded and chemigenetic sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Farrants et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>).

<p>We modeled the system as having two sensors with different lifetimes. Furthermore, in response to a change in the concentration of a biological analyte, the fluorescence lifetime of each sensor remains constant whereas the fluorescence intensity is modulated. We used FLiSimBA to simulate multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging with realistic parameters and noise in biological systems, and then deconvolved the combined histogram by fitting it with a double exponential decay equation, whose decay time constants corresponded to those of the two sensor species (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>).</p>
<p>We first investigated whether varying sensor intensities could be accurately deconvolved (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Deconvolution accurately recovered the photon numbers attributed to each sensor compared with the actual sensor photons inputted into the model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). The number of fitted sensor 1 photons (with shorter lifetime) was greater than the number of simulated sensor 1 photons, consistent with the contribution of autofluorescence whose average lifetime is closer to that of Sensor 1. Furthermore, when the lifetime decay constants of the two species were further separated, the variance in the fitted sensor photons decreased (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>, STD = 0.012 for 4 ns separation and STD = 0.053-0.061 for 0.5 ns separation), indicating that further separation of lifetimes between the two sensors resulted in a better SNR.</p>
<p>To quantitatively evaluate the feasibility of multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging of sensors with the same spectra, we calculated the statistical power for detecting specific intensity changes of sensor 1 photons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). The statistical power for detecting a specific intensity change was greater when the intensity change was greater and when the difference between the lifetime constants of the two sensors was greater (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>, for any given heatmap). Furthermore, the statistical power was also greater when the number of starting sensor 1 photons was greater and the number of sensor 2 photons were lower (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>, comparing between the heatmaps). Therefore, these results were valuable for demonstrating the feasibility of using fluorescence lifetime for multiplexed imaging and for quantitatively specifying the parameter space that provided sufficient statistical power.</p>
<p>To systematically define the parameter space, we determined the minimum intensity change that was detectable under different conditions. For any given sensor 1 starting photon count, sensor 2 photon count, and lifetime separation, we fitted the statistical power versus intensity change relationship to a 5-parameter logistic curve (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). Using the fitted curve, we calculated the intensity change that would yield a statistical power of 80% and defined it as the minimum detectable ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). The minimum detectable ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> for sensor 1 decreased as the lifetime separation increased, as sensor 1 expression level increased, or as the number of sensor 2 photons decreased (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>). If the two sensors had comparable dynamic ranges and comparable expression levels, the minimum detectable ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> for sensor 2 was similar to that of sensor 1 (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>). Remarkably, only a 0.5 ns separation in lifetime constants between the two sensors could result in a minimum detectable ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> of 5% in sensor 1 if sensor 1 showed high but reasonable expression (800,000 photons or higher) and sensor 2 showed reasonable expression (500,000 photons or lower) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). These results showed how the sensitivity of the intensity response quantitatively depended on the sensor expression and differences in lifetime between the two sensors.</p>
<p>In summary, our simulation showed that multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging was feasible with small shifts in the sensor properties. Furthermore, FLiSimBA could be used to quantitatively define the parameters of the sensors to yield a desired sensitivity. Thus, these results provide sensor developers with specific sensor properties to evolve toward. With simultaneous spectral and lifetime multiplexing, our proposed method enables the detection of a much larger number of signals dynamically, opening doors to better systems understanding of signaling within the cell and physiological interactions between different organs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we provide a quantitative framework for analyzing fluorescence lifetime in realistic biological settings. We introduce FLiSimBA, a platform that accurately simulates fluorescence lifetime data for biological applications (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). With FLiSimBA, we address key questions in FLIM. First, to understand SNRs, we determined the number of photons required for different minimum detectable differences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Additionally, we assessed the impact of hardware changes on SNRs by comparing GaAsP PMTs with hybrid detectors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, we challenged the conventional view that biosensor expression levels do not affect fluorescence lifetime. We revealed how variation in sensor expression influences response amplitude (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) and identified the amount of expression level variation that does not significantly alter fluorescence lifetime estimates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

In summary, our study provides valuable insights and a quantitative framework for defining the power and limitations of fluorescence lifetime experiments in biological applications.</p>
<p>FLiSimBA is a necessary and useful tool for FLIM and FLiP experiments for a few reasons. First, realistic simulations of lifetime data for biological applications are performed. Second, FLiSimBA is versatile and can be easily adapted for new sensors, new methods of calculating fluorescence lifetime, new tissues and organisms with different amounts of autofluorescence, or new ideas for FLIM innovations. Third, FLiSimBA and the quantitative framework we provide can precisely define the benefits and limitations of a FLIM or FLiP experiment, enabling rigorous experimental design and data interpretation.</p>
<p>Our results provide insights into three critical questions for FLIM usage in biology that were not previously available. First, quantifying the uncertainty of values is a key aspect of any measurement but is often neglected. Our results provide the amplitude of the error bars and reveal the sources of bias and noise in fluorescence lifetime measurements in realistic biological experiments. Therefore, these results facilitate the disambiguation of signals from noise in data interpretation and empower FLIM users to design optimal experiments by precisely evaluating the compromise between the SNR, field-of-view size, and imaging speed.</p>
<p>Second, our analyses of expression level dependence serve as a striking example of how small quantitative changes result in large qualitative differences: we show how autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background give rise to the expression level dependence of lifetime measurements. These results challenge the widely held assumptions about the very advantage of fluorescence lifetime measurements: its insensitivity to sensor expression levels. Therefore, consideration of biologically realistic factors in FLiSimBA does not merely add details but qualitatively change conclusions. Importantly, our results not only highlight this problem but also offer a solution: we define the range where the expression level does not result in a significant lifetime change (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These analyses are critical for defining the window of opportunity in which FLIM and FLiP can be used to compare biosensor measurements over chronic time periods, across animals, and to quantify absolute levels of biological signals.</p>
<p>Finally, with three examples, our quantitative platform demonstrates how we can improve FLIM through future innovation. First, whereas our simulations showed little advantage of hybrid detectors over GaAsP PMTs in terms of the SNR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), different types of hybrid detectors offer narrower IRFs at the cost of lower quantum efficiency (QE). FLiSimBA enables the evaluation of the tradeoff between IRF width and QE. Additionally, hybrid detectors are more advantageous for shorter fluorescence lifetimes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Trinh &amp; Esposito, 2021</xref>) and FLiSimBA allows exploration of the range where they provide clear benefits in biological settings. Second, we quantified how the development of red or far-red sensors outside the autofluorescence spectrum, and the ability to minimize dark currents of the detector, could provide transformative benefits in reducing or removing the expression dependence of lifetime measurements (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This highlights exciting directions for sensor makers and hardware developers. Third, we demonstrate the feasibility and specify sensor parameters that enable the use of fluorescence lifetime and color spectrum as two orthogonal axes to distinguish many biological signals through intensity-based real-time imaging of biosensors. This approach promises to open doors to enhancing the ability of multiplexed imaging by orders of magnitude. Thus, FLiSimBA and our quantitative framework are instrumental for enabling optimal experimental design, rigorous data interpretation, and pushing the limit of FLIM imaging through innovations.</p>

<title>Two-Photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (2pFLIM)</title>
<p>2pFLIM was performed as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tilden et al., 2024</xref>). A custom-built microscope with a mode-locked laser source (Spectra-Physics, Insight X3 operating at 80 MHz) was used. Photons were collected with fast photomultiplier tubes (PMTs, Hamamatsu, H10770PB-40). A 60X (Olympus, NA 1.1) objective was used. Image acquisition was performed with the custom-written software ScanImage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>, 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tilden et al., 2024</xref>) in MATLAB 2012b. The excitation wavelength was 920 nm. Emission light was collected through a dichroic mirror (FF580-FDi01-25X36, Semrock) and a band-pass filter (FF03-525/50-25, Semrock). Images covering 15 μm x 15 μm fields of view were collected at 128x128 pixels via a frame scan at 4 Hz. The FLIM board SPC-150 (Becker and Hickl GmbH) was used, and time-correlated single photon counting was performed with 256 time channels. Photons from 20 frames were pooled for fluorescence lifetime calculations. Only healthy cells (judged by gradient contrast images) at 30-50 μm below the slice surface were selected.

<title>Experimental data collection, parameter determination, and simulation</title>
<p>The simulation was performed in MATLAB2022a with the following steps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The parameters described below were used for this study and could be altered with our code to adapt to different biological applications. The final simulated histograms consisted of the IRF-convolved sensor fluorescence, autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background fluorescence. The simulations were performed with 256 time channels for each laser cycle from an 80 MHz laser (12.5 ns interpulse interval). For each <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and sensor photon number condition, the simulation was repeated 500 times.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Generation of photon populations for sensor fluorescence</title>
<p>For sensor fluorescence, <italic>τ<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>τ<sub>2</sub></italic> were previously determined to be 2.14 ns and 0.69 ns respectively(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).

<p>For <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, to simulate the fluorescence lifetime with double exponential decay, we generated a population of photons with <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref> with <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> equal to 1,000,000. We generated photon populations and corresponding fluorescence lifetime histograms with <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 with an increment of 0.01.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e2">
<label>2.</label><title>Sensor fluorescence sampling and IRF convolution</title>
<p>For sensor fluorescence sampling, a specific number of photons were randomly drawn with replacement from the corresponding population generated with double exponential decay. IRF convolution of the fluorescence lifetime histogram was performed: the lifetime of each photon in the sample was redistributed along the time channels based on the probability of the IRF distribution. Following convolution, the histogram was wrapped around such that any photons whose lifetimes were beyond 12.5 ns (interpulse interval of laser) were redistributed to the next cycle.</p>
<p>In all the figures except for <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the IRF was empirically measured by second harmonic generation of the mouse tail with excitation at 1050 nm. The lifetime histogram was normalized to the total photon number and used as the IRF. For <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the IRFs of both systems were modeled as Gaussian distributions with different Gaussian widths. The mean of the Gaussian distribution (<italic>μ</italic>) was set as the peak channel of the experimentally collected IRF. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian IRF of the GaAsP PMT was set to match the FWHM of the experimentally collected IRF (340 ps). The FWHM of the hybrid detector Gaussian IRF was set as 120 ps based on the HPM-100-40 model (Becker &amp; Hickl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becker et al., 2011</xref>). The standard deviation (STD, <italic>s</italic>) of the Gaussian distribution of the IRFs was determined based on the relationship with the FWHM:

The Gaussian IRF was generated by normalization of <italic>G(t)</italic> against the total photon count.</p>
<p>For <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>, to isolate the noise from the sampling of photons, sensor fluorescence sampling was performed 500 times, followed by analytical IRF convolution of each sensor fluorescence decay histogram. To isolate the noise from sampling from the IRF distribution, only one sensor photon decay histogram was generated, and each photon was reassigned to a single lifetime value based on the probability density distribution of the IRF, and this procedure was repeated 500 times.</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Autofluorescence</title>
<p>All biological tissues exhibit autofluorescence due to fluorescent cellular components and metabolites such as nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD), flavins, and aromatic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Georgakoudi &amp; Quinn, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Malak et al., 2022</xref>). To determine the autofluorescence of brain tissue, we imaged brain slices from mice at postnatal 15 to 19 days of age without sensor expression. After brain slicing, neurons from the primary somatosensory cortex were imaged under the same imaging conditions (920 nm excitation light, 2.5 mW, 30-50 μm below the slice surface, 20 frames pooled over 5 seconds of acquisition, and 15 μm x 15 μm fields of view). The decay histograms from 19 acquisitions were averaged. The number of photons from autofluorescence contributing to autofluorescence (<italic>F<sub>auto</sub></italic>) was calculated as the average autofluorescence subtracted by the number of photons contributing to background fluorescence <italic>(F<sub>background</sub></italic>). Autofluorescence measurements consist of true autofluorescence together with background fluorescence (due to dark current and ambient light leakage). Thus, the average autofluorescence histogram was fitted with a double exponential function with background (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 2</xref>) to determine the <italic>t<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>t<sub>2</sub></italic>, <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>, and <italic>P<sub>2</sub></italic> of autofluorescence as well as background fluorescence. For simulated autofluorescence, up to 10% fluctuation was introduced to the number of photons with the random draw of an integer within the range of <italic>F<sub>auto</sub></italic>*(1±5%).</p>
<p>For <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the autofluorescence lifetime was simulated as double exponential decay (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref>). For the remaining figures, the autofluorescence lifetime was sampled from the empirical autofluorescence lifetime distribution, where the background was subtracted from the average autofluorescence lifetime histogram.</p>

<sec id="s4e4">
<label>4.</label><title>Afterpulse and background fluorescence</title>
<p>The afterpulse ratio of the PMT was derived from the IRF histogram and the background fluorescence measurement described above. Then the photons per channel were averaged at the end of the IRF histograms, where the distribution was even across time channels. The number was subtracted by the background fluorescence and the result was used as the afterpulse. Subsequently, the ratio between the number of photons contributing to the afterpulse and the total number of photons from the sensor fluorescence was calculated as the afterpulse ratio. This ratio was determined to be 0.32% for GaAsP PMTs.</p>
<p>Afterpulse and background fluorescence were simulated by sampling with replacement from an even distribution across time channels. The number of photons contributing to background fluorescence (<italic>F<sub>background</sub></italic>) was determined from autofluorescence fitting. Up to 10% fluctuation was introduced to the number of photons with the random draw of an integer within the range of <italic>F<sub>background</sub></italic>*(1±5%). For the low background conditions in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, the number of photons contributing to the background was half of the background photon count for the remaining figures. The number of photons from the afterpulse was determined by the afterpulse ratio (0.32% for GaAsP PMTs and 0 for hybrid detectors) multiplied by the number of photons from the sensor fluorescence.</p>

<title>FLIM analysis</title>
<p>Two metrics were used for subsequent data visualization and analysis. First, the fluorescence lifetime histograms generated from simulation or experimental data were fitted by <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 2</xref> with the Gauss-Newton nonlinear least-square fitting algorithm. Fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>, corresponding to the proportion of slower decay (2.14 ns), was used for data visualization and analysis.

</disp-formula>
in which <italic>t</italic> is the lifetime of a specific time channel, and <italic>F(t)</italic> is the photon count from that time channel. The lifetime range from 0.489 ns to 11.5 ns was used for both <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> fitting and empirical lifetime calculations.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>For each simulated condition, the mean and STD of the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or the empirical lifetime of the 500 simulation repeats were calculated.</p>
<p>For <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the minimum detectable difference (MDD) was calculated by:
<disp-formula id="eqn6">

With a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, the z value is 2.806. which was used for the calculations in this study. Under a certain sensor photon number, the STD of the two metrics under different <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> conditions (condition 1 and condition 2) were similar. Thus, given a certain sensor photon count, the STD under <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> condition (0.5 in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) was used to calculate the MDD:
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="572686v3_eqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where n is the number of data pairs used to analyze whether there was a significant change in the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or empirical lifetime.</p>
<p>For <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, to determine whether a certain amount of sensor expression-induced apparent change in the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or empirical lifetime was significant, t tests were used to compare whether there was any statistically significant difference between two distributions with the same simulated <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> but different photon numbers. The critical value of the t statistic is z = 1.96 for a significance level of 0.05. The equation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="572686v3_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> was used to calculate the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or empirical lifetime difference that would be statistically significant. As the photon count increased, there was an intersection where the mean fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or empirical lifetime difference between the two distributions became less than the difference that would reach statistical significance, and this intersection point (determined by linear interpolation of the curves plotted on a log scale for both axes) was used to determine the minimum number of sensor photons required to tolerate a specific amount of change in sensor fluorescence.</p>
<p>Detailed information on the quantification, sample size, and statistical tests used are summarized in the Figure Legends, Figures, and Results. T tests were performed to test whether two distributions had equal means. For analysis of variance, one-way or two-way ANOVA was performed followed by multiple comparison tests.</p>

<p>For <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> and S2, the simulations were performed with a laser cycle of 50 ns to capture the fluorescence decay curve of Sensor 2 with a longer lifetime constant. The fluorescence lifetime histograms of sensor 1 and sensor 2 were simulated as single exponential decays:

<p>To simulate the fluorescence lifetime with single exponential decay, we generated a population of photons with <xref rid="eqn8" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 8</xref> with <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> equal to 1,000,000. For sensor 1, the population was generated with <italic>τ</italic> = 2.0 ns. For sensor 2, the population was generated with <italic>τ</italic> = 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, or 6.0 ns.</p>
<p>Fluorescence lifetime histograms of sensor 1 and sensor 2 were generated by sampling from the corresponding population, followed by IRF convolution. The histograms of sensor 1 and sensor 2 were added together as the combined histogram. Autofluorescence and background signals were simulated with the same probability density function as above but with 3.2 fold of photon numbers to accommodate for the longer acquisition time needed with a longer laser cycle to reach the same number of photons. Afterpulse was added proportional to the sensor photons as described above.</p>
<p>The combined histograms were fitted by a double exponential decay (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 2</xref>), with fixed <italic>τ<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>τ<sub>2</sub></italic> that were used for the simulation that generated the histograms.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study describes a computational tool termed FliSimBA (Fluorescence Lifetime Simulation for Biological Applications), which uses simulations to rigorously assess experimental limitations in fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), including diverse noise factors, hardware effects, and sensor expression levels. The evidence from simulation and experimental measurements supporting the usefulness of FlimSimBA is <bold>solid</bold>. The authors may improve the application of the tool to a wide range of biological samples by providing the simulation package, currently in MATLB, in other common languages such as Python, and having better descriptions of the fitting algorithm and model assumptions. The work will interest scientists who wish to perform quantitative FLIM imaging for cells and tissues.</p>

<p>In this study, Ma et al. aimed to determine previously uncharacterized contributions of tissue autofluorescence, detector afterpulse, and background noise on fluorescence lifetime measurement interpretations. They introduce a computational framework they named &quot;Fluorescence Lifetime Simulation for Biological Applications (FLiSimBA)&quot; to model experimental limitations in Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) and determine parameters for achieving multiplexed imaging of dynamic biosensors using lifetime and intensity. By quantitatively defining sensor photon effects on signal-to-noise in either fitting or averaging methods of determining lifetime, the authors contradict any claims of FLIM sensor expression insensitivity to fluorescence lifetime and highlight how these artifacts occur differently depending on the analysis method. Finally, the authors quantify how statistically meaningful experiments using multiplexed imaging could be achieved.</p>
<p>A major strength of the study is the effort to present results in a clear and understandable way given that most researchers do not think about these factors on a day-to-day basis. The model code is available and written in Matlab, which should make it readily accessible, although a version in other common languages such as Python might help with dissemination in the community. One potential weakness is that the model uses parameters that are determined in a specific way by the authors, and it is not clear how vastly other biological tissue and microscope setups may differ from the values used by the authors.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors achieved their aims of demonstrating how common factors (autofluorescence, background, and sensor expression) will affect lifetime measurements and they present a clear strategy for understanding how sensor expression may confound results if not properly considered. This work should bring to awareness an issue that new users of lifetime biosensors may not be aware of and that experts, while aware, have not quantitatively determined the conditions where these issues arise. This work will also point to future directions for improving experiments using fluorescence lifetime biosensors and the development of new sensors with more favorable properties.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>By using simulations of common signal artefacts introduced by acquisition hardware and the sample itself, the authors are able to demonstrate methods to estimate their influence on the estimated lifetime, and lifetime proportions, when using signal fitting for fluorescence lifetime imaging.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They consider a range of effects such as after-pulsing and background signal, and present a range of situations that are relevant to many experimental situations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness is that they do not present enough detail on the fitting method that they used to estimate lifetimes and proportions. The method used will influence the results significantly. They seem to only use the &quot;empirical lifetime&quot; which is not a state of the art algorithm. The method used to deconvolve two multiplexed exponential signals is not given.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents a useful computational tool, termed FLiSimBA. The MATLAB-based FLiSimBA simulations allow users to examine the effects of various noise factors (such as autofluorescence, afterpulse of the photomultiplier tube detector, and other background signals) and varying sensor expression levels. Under the conditions explored, the simulations unveiled how these factors affect the observed lifetime measurements, thereby providing useful guidelines for experimental designs. Further simulations with two distinct fluorophores uncovered conditions in which two different lifetime signals could be distinguished, indicating multiplexed dynamic imaging may be possible.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The simulations and their analyses were done systematically and rigorously. FliSimba can be useful for guiding and validating fluorescence lifetime imaging studies. The simulations could define useful parameters such as the minimum number of photons required to detect a specific lifetime, how sensor protein expression level may affect the lifetime data, the conditions under which the lifetime would be insensitive to the sensor expression levels, and whether certain multiplexing could be feasible.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The analyses have relied on a key premise that the fluorescence lifetime in the system can be described as two-component discrete exponential decay. This means that the experimenter should ensure that this is the right model for their fluorophores a priori and should keep in mind that the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophores may not be perfectly described by a two-component discrete exponential (for which alternative algorithms have been implemented: e.g., Steinbach, P. J. Anal. Biochem. 427, 102-105, (2012)). In this regard, I also couldn't find how good the fits were for each simulation and experimental data to the given fitting equation (Equation 2, for example, for Figure 2C data).</p>
<p>Also, in Figure 2C, the 'sensor only' simulation without accounting for autofluorescence (as seen in Sensor + autoF) or afterpulse and background fluorescence (as seen in Final simulated data) seems to recapitulate the experimental data reasonably well. So, at least in this particular case where experimental data is limited by its broad spread with limited data points, being able to incorporate the additional noise factors into the simulation tool didn't seem to matter too much.</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This important study describes a computational tool termed FliSimBA (Fluorescence Lifetime Simulation for Biological Applications), which uses simulations to rigorously assess experimental limitations in fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), including diverse noise factors, hardware effects, and sensor expression levels. The evidence from simulation and experimental measurements supporting the usefulness of FlimSimBA is solid. The authors may improve the application of the tool to a wide range of biological samples by providing the simulation package, currently in MATLB, in other common languages such as Python, and having better descriptions of the fitting algorithm and model assumptions. The work will interest scientists who wish to perform quantitative FLIM imaging for cells and tissues.</p>

<p>We thank the editors and reviewers for the constructive feedback. We plan to provide the FLiSimBA simulation package in Python in addition to Matlab. We will also describe in more detail in the Results section our fitting method. Furthermore, we will explain more clearly in the text that our simulation package makes almost no model assumptions, and features flexibility and adaptability so that it can be used for any fluorescence lifetime measurements. We will clearly outline what are the specific examples we use for our case studies, and how users can input their own values based on the specific sensors, autofluorescence, and hardware they use.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, Ma et al. aimed to determine previously uncharacterized contributions of tissue autofluorescence, detector afterpulse, and background noise on fluorescence lifetime measurement interpretations. They introduce a computational framework they named &quot;Fluorescence Lifetime Simulation for Biological Applications (FLiSimBA)&quot; to model experimental limitations in Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) and determine parameters for achieving multiplexed imaging of dynamic biosensors using lifetime and intensity. By quantitatively defining sensor photon effects on signal-to-noise in either fitting or averaging methods of determining lifetime, the authors contradict any claims of FLIM sensor expression insensitivity to fluorescence lifetime and highlight how these artifacts occur differently depending on the analysis method. Finally, the authors quantify how statistically meaningful experiments using multiplexed imaging could be achieved.</p>
<p>A major strength of the study is the effort to present results in a clear and understandable way given that most researchers do not think about these factors on a day-to-day basis. The model code is available and written in Matlab, which should make it readily accessible, although a version in other common languages such as Python might help with dissemination in the community. One potential weakness is that the model uses parameters that are determined in a specific way by the authors, and it is not clear how vastly other biological tissue and microscope setups may differ from the values used by the authors.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors achieved their aims of demonstrating how common factors (autofluorescence, background, and sensor expression) will affect lifetime measurements and they present a clear strategy for understanding how sensor expression may confound results if not properly considered. This work should bring to awareness an issue that new users of lifetime biosensors may not be aware of and that experts, while aware, have not quantitatively determined the conditions where these issues arise. This work will also point to future directions for improving experiments using fluorescence lifetime biosensors and the development of new sensors with more favorable properties.</p>

<p>We appreciate the comments and helpful suggestions. We plan to present FLiSimBA simulation code in Python in addition to Matlab to make it more accessible to the community.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of FLiSimBA is that the simulation package is flexible and adaptable, allowing users to input parameters based on the specific sensors, hardware, and autofluorescence measurements for their biological and optical systems. We used parameters based on one FRET-based sensor, measured autofluorescence from mouse tissue, and measured dark count/after pulse of our specific GaAsP PMT in this manuscript as examples. We will emphasize this advantage and further clarify how these parameters can be adapted to diverse tissues, imaging systems, and sensors based on individual users in our revision.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>By using simulations of common signal artefacts introduced by acquisition hardware and the sample itself, the authors are able to demonstrate methods to estimate their influence on the estimated lifetime, and lifetime proportions, when using signal fitting for fluorescence lifetime imaging.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They consider a range of effects such as after-pulsing and background signal, and present a range of situations that are relevant to many experimental situations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness is that they do not present enough detail on the fitting method that they used to estimate lifetimes and proportions. The method used will influence the results significantly. They seem to only use the &quot;empirical lifetime&quot; which is not a state of the art algorithm. The method used to deconvolve two multiplexed exponential signals is not given.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comments and constructive feedback and will more clearly describe the fitting methods in our revision.</p>
<p>Two metrics are currently used to estimate lifetime in our paper, which are currently described in the Methods section ‘Experimental data collection, parameter determination, and simulation’ and ‘FLIM analysis’: (1) fitted <italic>P1:</italic> we described how lifetime histograms were fitted to Equation 2 with the Gauss-Newton nonlinear least-square fitting algorithm and the fitted <italic>P1</italic> was used as lifetime estimation; (2) empirical lifetime, defined by Equation 5. These two metrics were used for the following reasons: (1) when the exponential decay equation of a sensor is known (for example, the FRET-based PKA activity sensor FLIM-AKAR can be described as a double exponential equation), fitted coefficients for each exponential component provide a robust way for lifetime estimate that is less sensitive to noise and background signals; (2) when the biophysical properties of sensors are unknown, or when the sensors cannot be easily described with single or double exponential equations, empirical lifetime (i.e. average lifetime values) provides an unbiased way to quantify fluorescence lifetime without assumptions of underlying models to describe sensor lifetime.</p>
<p>To deconvolve two multiplexed exponential signals (Fig. 8), histograms were fitted to Equation 2 with the Gauss-Newton nonlinear least-square fitting algorithm, as described in Methods section ‘Simulation and analysis of multiplexed imaging with fluorescence intensity and lifetime data’.</p>
<p>Considering the importance of these methodological details for evaluating the conclusions of this study, and the importance of appreciating the advantages and limitations of different methods of lifetime estimates (e.g. Figure 7), we will move the description of the fitting method to estimate <italic>P1</italic> and the method of calculating empirical lifetime from Methods to Results, and will further clarify the rationale of using these different methods of lifetime estimates.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents a useful computational tool, termed FLiSimBA. The MATLAB-based FLiSimBA simulations allow users to examine the effects of various noise factors (such as autofluorescence, afterpulse of the photomultiplier tube detector, and other background signals) and varying sensor expression levels. Under the conditions explored, the simulations unveiled how these factors affect the observed lifetime measurements, thereby providing useful guidelines for experimental designs. Further simulations with two distinct fluorophores uncovered conditions in which two different lifetime signals could be distinguished, indicating multiplexed dynamic imaging may be possible.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The simulations and their analyses were done systematically and rigorously. FliSimba can be useful for guiding and validating fluorescence lifetime imaging studies. The simulations could define useful parameters such as the minimum number of photons required to detect a specific lifetime, how sensor protein expression level may affect the lifetime data, the conditions under which the lifetime would be insensitive to the sensor expression levels, and whether certain multiplexing could be feasible.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The analyses have relied on a key premise that the fluorescence lifetime in the system can be described as two-component discrete exponential decay. This means that the experimenter should ensure that this is the right model for their fluorophores a priori and should keep in mind that the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophores may not be perfectly described by a two-component discrete exponential (for which alternative algorithms have been implemented: e.g., Steinbach, P. J. Anal. Biochem. 427, 102-105, (2012)). In this regard, I also couldn't find how good the fits were for each simulation and experimental data to the given fitting equation (Equation 2, for example, for Figure 2C data).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. We agree that the FLiSimBA users should ensure that the right decay equations are used to describe the fluorescent sensors. In this study, we used a FRET-based PKA sensor FLIM-AKAR to provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of FLiSimBA usage. The donor fluorophore of FLIM-AKAR, truncated monomeric enhanced GFP, follows a single exponential decay. FLIM-AKAR, a FRET-based sensor, follows a double exponential decay. The time constants of the two exponential components were determined previously (Chen, et al, <italic>Frontiers in pharmacology</italic> (2014)).  Thus, a double exponential decay equation with known <italic>τ1</italic> and <italic>τ2</italic> (Equation 1) was used for both simulation and fitting. In our revision, we will refer to our prior study characterizing the double exponential decay model of FLIM-AKAR. We will also emphasize the importance of using the right decay equations, strategies to estimate sensor decays, and how the flexibility of FLiSimBA allows users to input different forms of models to describe their specific sensor histograms. We will additionally provide data showing the goodness of fit for both simulated data and experimental data.</p>

<p>Also, in Figure 2C, the 'sensor only' simulation without accounting for autofluorescence (as seen in Sensor + autoF) or afterpulse and background fluorescence (as seen in Final simulated data) seems to recapitulate the experimental data reasonably well. So, at least in this particular case where experimental data is limited by its broad spread with limited data points, being able to incorporate the additional noise factors into the simulation tool didn't seem to matter too much.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that in Figure 2C the contributions from autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background signals are small, because sensor photon count is high here. As seen in Figure 2B, when sensor photon counts are higher, the contributions from these other factors become less pronounced. The simulated data in Figure 2C were based on high photon counts because the simulated <italic>P1</italic> value was determined by fitting experimental data. To achieve reasonable fitting with minimal interference from autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background signals, we used experimental data with high sensor expression. We will clarify these details in our revision.</p>
