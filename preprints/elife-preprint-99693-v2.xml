<title>Summary</title><p>Cortical dynamics underlie many cognitive processes and emerge from complex multi-scale interactions, which are challenging to study <italic>in vivo</italic>. Large-scale, biophysically detailed models offer a tool which can complement laboratory approaches. We present a model comprising eight somatosensory cortex subregions, 4.2 million morphological and electrically-detailed neurons, and 13.2 billion local and mid-range synapses. <italic>In silico</italic> tools enabled reproduction and extension of complex laboratory experiments under a single parameterization, providing strong validation. The model reproduced millisecond-precise stimulus-responses, stimulus-encoding under targeted optogenetic activation, and selective propagation of stimulus-evoked activity to downstream areas. The model’s direct correspondence with biology generated predictions about how multiscale organization shapes activity; for example, how cortical activity is shaped by high-dimensional connectivity motifs in local and mid-range connectivity, and spatial targeting rules by inhibitory subpopulations. The latter was facilitated using a rewired connectome which included specific targeting rules observed for different inhibitory neuron types in electron microscopy. The model also predicted the role of inhibitory interneuron types and different layers in stimulus encoding. Simulation tools and a large subvolume of the model are made available to enable further community-driven improvement, validation and investigation.</p>

<label>1</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuroscience aims to characterize the dynamics of the brain and understand how they emerge as a product of anatomy and physiology. This is challenging however, due to the complexity of the brain’s multi-scale organization and its study <italic>in situ</italic>. <italic>Large-scale, data-driven, biophysically-detailed</italic> models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Billeh et al., 2020</xref>) offer a tool which can complement laboratory investigation. This “bottom-up” approach combines detailed constituent models into a 3D model of a given brain volume, thus consolidating disparate, multi-scale data sources. Such models aim to provide a general tool for multi-scale investigation; access and manipulation of any model component enables predictions about how these components combine to shape emergent dynamics. With increasing biological data, model refinement and validation must be continuous. This necessitates 1) open sourcing of models with high quality software tools for iterative, community-driven refinement and validation, and 2) rigorous methodology for model parameterization and validation, such that model iterations can be meaningfully compared. Here and in our companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Reimann et al., 2024</xref>) we present our methodology for parameterizing the anatomy and physiology of a cortical model, and validating its emergent dynamics. This enabled predictions about how cortical activity is shaped by high-dimensional connectivity motifs in local and mid-range connectivity, and spatial targeting rules by inhibitory subpopulations. Elsewhere, this has allowed the presented model to be used to study the formation of cell assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ecker et al., 2024b</xref>), functional synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ecker et al., 2024a</xref>), propagation of activity between cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bolaños-Puchet and Reimann, 2024</xref>) the role of non-random connectivity motifs on network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Pokorny et al., 2024</xref>) and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Egas Santander et al., 2024</xref>), the composition of high-level electrical signals such as the EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Tharayil et al., 2024</xref>), and how spike sorting biases population codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Laquitaine et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, we built and validated a model of the entire non-barrel primary somatosensory cortex (nbS1) comprising eight subregions. Whilst our previous data-driven, biophysically detailed model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al., 2015</xref>) provided insights at the scale of a single cortical column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Reimann et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Nolte et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Newton et al., 2021</xref>), the new model is ∼140 times larger and to our knowledge offers the first simulations of <italic>in vivo</italic>-like spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity in a biophysically detailed cortical model with interregion connectivity. In the companion paper, we introduce the anatomical model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, Step 1), describing how neuron morphologies were placed within an atlas-based geometry and connected through local and mid-range synapses. Here, we describe our improved techniques to model and validate the electrical properties of neurons and synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Steps 2 &amp; 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Reva et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barros-Zulaica et al., 2019</xref>)), and to compensate for input from missing brain areas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Steps 4). These improvements enabled enhanced validation of emerging <italic>in vivo</italic>-like activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Steps 5), including the reproduction and extension of five published studies in rodent sensory cortex under a single <italic>in vivo</italic>-like regime (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Steps 6).</p>

<p>Validating that network activity emerges from the same interactions driving <italic>in vivo</italic> dynamics, requires 1) an approach to tackle the large parameter space without overfitting and 2) comparison of emerging dynamics with laboratory experiments. With respect to, we strongly prefer parameterization with directly measured quantities over fitting parameters to yield the correct emerging activity. Additionally, where fitting is applied, we adhere to a principle of <italic>compartmentalization</italic> of parameters. That is, once a parameter has been parameterized at one biological level, it is no longer a free parameter at a higher level. For example, the maximal conductance of a synapse is fit to biological amplitudes of postsynaptic potentials, but is then never updated in the process of reaching in-vivo like population activity. If a connection is valid on the single-cell level, its contribution at the population level should be equally valid. As a result, the emerging in-vivo like activity is the consequence of only 10 free parameters representing the strength of extrinsic input from other brain regions into 9 layer-specific excitatory and inhibitory populations, and a parameter controlling the noise structure of this extrinsic input. These parameters were fitted using a novel methodology presented here and were in accordance with the mean number of missing synapses for each population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; Harris et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gao et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to 2), we conducted the following validations: Spontaneous activity reproduced layer-wise <italic>in vivo</italic> firing rates (or a specified proportion of <italic>in vivo</italic> firing rates to account for <italic>in vivo</italic> recording bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Wohrer et al., 2013</xref>)), varied along a spectrum of asynchronous to synchronous activity, exhibited spatially structured fluctuations and produced long-tailed firing rate distributions with sub 1 Hz peaks as <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Wohrer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>). Under the same parameterization, the model reproduced precise millisecond dynamics of layer-wise populations in response to simple stimuli. These initial validations demonstrated that the model was in a more accurate regime compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref> – an essential step before testing more complex or larger-scale validations. For example, under the same parameterization we then observed selective propagation of stimulus-evoked activity to downstream areas, and reproduced and extended more complex experiments through accurate modeling of targeted optogenetic stimulation and lesions. Importantly, we highlight where emergent activity shows discrepancies with <italic>in vivo</italic> activity, to guide future data-driven model refinement.</p>
<p>The model generated a number of predictions (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>), including about the role of different layers in driving layer 2/3 stimulus responses and how inhibitory interneuron types encode contrast, synchronous and rate-coded information. Additionally, with access to the full structural connectome and tools for precisely editing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Pokorny et al., 2024</xref>), we were able to make predictions about the relationship between structure and function. For example, we predict that an increase in the prevalence of non-random connectivity motifs towards deeper layers leads to a matched increase in spiking correlations, and that subregions more strongly innervated by mid-range connectivity have higher correlated activity locally. Additionally, we generated a new connectome which captured recently characterized spatially-specific targeting rules for different inhibitory neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2023</xref>) in the MICrONS electron microscopy dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">MICrONS-Consortium et al., 2021</xref>), such as increased perisomatic targeting by PV+ neurons, and increased targeting of inhibitory populations by VIP+ neurons. Comparing activity to the original connectome gave predictions about the role of these additional targeting rules. For example, inhibitory populations were more strongly inhibited (increasingly towards central layers) and required more non-local drive to reach the firing rates observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Evoked responses increased and decreased in superficial and deeper excitatory populations respectively, suggesting layer-specific roles of the more specific inhibitory targeting.</p>
<p>To provide a framework for further studies and integration of experimental data, the full model is made available with simulation tools, as well as a smaller subvolume with the optional new connectome capturing inhibitory targeting rules from electron microscopy. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Step 7). The detailed modeling approach provides a one-to-one correspondence with most types of experimental data, allowing different datasets to be readily integrated. Due to the incredible speed of discovery in neuroscience an integrative model will always be lagging behind the latest available data. We believe the solution is to provide a scientifically solid, validated model with clearly characterized strengths and weaknesses, along with the tools to advance or customize it for individual projects. We have therefore also made our tools for building and improving the model openly available: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.github.com/BlueBrain">www.github.com/BlueBrain</ext-link>.</p>

<p>The companion paper describes the full anatomical nbS1 model containing 4.2M morphological neuron models, connected through 9.1B local synapses and 4.1B mid-range synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Reimann et al., 2024</xref>). Each neuron is modeled as a multi-compartmental model belonging to one of 60 morphological types (m-types; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A1</xref>), and is either an instance or statistical variant of an exemplar in a pool of 1,017 morphological reconstructions. Neurons were placed (orientated towards the surface) within an atlas-based geometry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A2</xref>) based on estimated layer-wise density profiles of different morphological types. Local connectivity is based on axo-dendritic overlap with neighbouring neurons, whilst mid-range connectivity combines data on interregion connectivity and laminar innervation profiles. Thalamocortical afferents were also modeled based on laminar innervation to the barrel cortex. To simulate emergent activity it is necessary to model and validate the electrical properties of these neurons and synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> Steps 2 &amp; 3). These modeling steps are based on published methods and data sources (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and are summarized first. The method for compensating for missing synapses and the remaining results are then described (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> Steps 4-6).</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Improved modeling and validation of neuron physiology</title>
<p>Similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref>, electrical properties of single neurons were modeled by optimizing ion channel densities in specific compartment-types (soma, axon initial segment (AIS), basal dendrite, and apical dendrite) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) using an evolutionary algorithm (IBEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Van Geit et al., 2016</xref>) so that each neuron recreates electrical features of its corresponding electrical type (e-type) under multiple standardized protocols. Compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref>, electrical models were optimized and validated using 1) additional <italic>in vitro</italic> data, features and protocols, 2) ion channel and electrophysiological data corrected for the liquid junction potential, and 3) stochastic channels (StochKv3) now including inactivation profiles. The methodology and resulting electrical models are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Reva et al. (2023)</xref> (see Methods), and generated quantitatively more accurate electrical activity, including improved attenuation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and back-propagating action potentials. Electrical features included firing properties (e.g. spike frequency, inter-spike interval), action potential waveforms (e.g. fall and rise time, width) and passive properties (e.g. input resistance). The optimization was performed for a subset of neuron models. The resulting ion channel densities were generalized to other neuron models of the same e-type. For excitatory neurons such generalization was only made to neurons within the same layer. The resulting electrical activity of each neuron was validated against the corresponding electrical features, including the <italic>characteristic</italic> firing properties of the 11 e-types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Model neurons with a mean zscore (over the electrical features) further than two standard deviations from the experimental mean were discarded. The new neuron models saw a 5-fold improvement in generalizability compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Reva et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>For each of the 60 morphological types (m-types), the corresponding fractions of e-types were determined from experimental data as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref>, resulting in 208 morpho-electrical types (me-types; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Correspondence with predominant expression of biological markers PV (parvalbumin), Sst (somatostatin) or 5HT3aR (serotonin receptor 3A) was determined based on me-type, as previously done in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Finally, for layer five thick-tufted pyramidal cell (L5 TTPC) morphologies, we found that dendritic electrical features, namely the attenuation of back propagating action potentials and EPSPs, reproduced experimental measurements (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Reva et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The required data to constrain region-specific me-type distributions was not available when building the model; to our knowledge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Yao et al. (2023)</xref> is the first study that explored the question systematically (in mouse cortex). The atlas-based geometry does however impose heterogeneity in morphologies that e-types are paired with: only morphologies that are in line with the region-specific local curvature of the region are used throughout the volume. We demonstrate the effect of geometry on morphological composition in the companion paper.</p>

<p>The biological realism of synaptic physiology was improved relative to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al.

(2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ecker et al. (2020)</xref>. The model assumes a pool of available vesicles that is utilized by a presynaptic action potential, with a release probability dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration ([<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ohana and Sakmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Rozov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Borst, 2010</xref>). Additionally, single vesicles spontaneously release as an additional source of variability with a low frequency (with improved calibration relative to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref>). The utilization of vesicles leads to a postsynaptic conductance with bi-exponential kinetics. Short-term plasticity (STP) dynamics in response to sustained presynaptic activation are either facilitating (E1/I1), depressing (E2/I2), or pseudo-linear (I3). E synaptic currents consist of both AMPA and NMDA components, whilst I currents consist of a single <italic>GABA<sub>A</sub></italic> component, except for neurogliaform cells, whose synapses also feature a slow <italic>GABA<sub>B</sub></italic> component.

<title>Improved modeling and validation of thalamocortical projections</title>
<p>The anatomical model includes fibers from the thalamus, based on fibers projecting to the barrel cortex from the ventral posteriomedial (VPM) and posteriormedial (POm) thalamic nuclei. These fibers make synaptic contacts within a radius of the fiber proba-bilistically based on laminar innervation profiles (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Reimann et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).

<title>Algorithm efficiently finds spectrum of network regimes compatible with <italic>in vivo</italic> whilst accounting for unknown <italic>in vivo</italic> recording bias</title>
<p>Initial simulations produced no activity, and it was necessary to compensate for missing excitatory input from neurons external to the model. We estimated that the number of missing synapses for the full nbS1 and seven hexagon subvolume as ∼ two and seven times the number of internal synapses, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Oh et al. (2014)</xref>. We model the effect of these missing synaptic inputs explicitly as time-varying and statistically independent somatic conductance injections, using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes that mimic aggregated random background synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Destexhe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B1</xref>; see also Discussion). The mean (<italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic>) and standard deviation (<italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic>) are defined as a percentage of an individual cell’s input conductance at its resting membrane potential. The choice of <italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic> and <italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic> for different populations and [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B2</xref>), determine the model’s emergent dynamics and mean firing rates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B3</xref>). Initial simulations showed that using the same value of <italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic> and <italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic> for all neurons makes some populations highly active whilst others are silent, or produces network-wide bursts. Finding population-specific <italic>OU</italic> parameters which produce stable <italic>in vivo</italic>-like activity is challenging, however, due to the non-linearity and computational cost of simulations.</p>
<p>We developed an algorithm that efficiently calibrates population-specific <italic>OU</italic> parameters, for different values of [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>, which affects the strength and reliability of synaptic transmission (see “Synaptic Physiology”). Additionally, it fixes the ratio <italic>OU<sub>σ</sub>/OU<sub>µ</sub></italic>, denoted <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic>, across all neurons to specific values representing the amount of noise in the extrinsic inputs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B2</xref>). As extracellularly-derived firing rates are known to be severely overestimated to an unknown degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Olshausen and Field, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Wohrer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>), the algorithm finds parameters which produce realistic inter-population firing rate ratios at different global levels of activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B3</xref>). Specifically, to account for uncertainty in the firing rate bias during spontaneous activity from extracellular spike sorted recordings it targets mean spontaneous firing rates of neuron populations that are a constant fraction <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> of <italic>in vivo</italic> reference values, for 10 <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> values between 0.1 and 1. We refer to [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>, <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> as <italic>meta-parameters</italic>. The initial calibration was made for the seven hexagonal subvolume, and later generalised to the full nbS1 model.</p>
<p>The algorithm was first run for [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> = 1.1 mM, <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> = 0.4. Target firing rates for the 10 <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> values were reached (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) after five iterations of 10 simulations of 6.5 seconds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, left upper).

<title><italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic>, <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> and [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> determine the properties of correlative spontaneous activity</title>
<p>Rasters and histograms of spontaneous activity for two meta-parameter combinations are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G1</xref> (and for all combinations in Video 1). The first simulation uses a higher <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic>, lower <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> and lower synaptic transmission reliability ([<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>). In the second simulation, we found larger fluctuations, correlated between E and I populations across layers. Overall, increasing [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic>, and decreasing <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic>, increases the amplitude of correlated fluctuations (Video 1; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G2</xref>) and increases power at lower frequencies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G3</xref>). This supports the notion that decreasing <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> or increasing [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> shifts the model along a spectrum from externally (noise) driven to internally driven correlated activity. Note that the most correlated meta-parameter combination [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>: 1.1mM, <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> : 0.2, <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic>: 1.0 produced network-wide “bursting” activity, which we define as highly synchronous all or nothing events (Video 1).

<title>Spatially-coordinated fluctuations and increase in correlative and recurrent activity from supra- to infragranular layers</title>
<p>In the horizontal dimensions, under higher correlation regimes, fluctuations are spatially coordinated and global within the central hexagon of the simulated subvolume (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>; Video 2). In depth, the size of fluctuations and level of correlated activity increases from supragranular to infragranular layers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G1, I</xref>, left; Video 1), suggesting that activity in deeper layers of the model is more internally driven. We characterized the effect of recurrent connectivity by measuring the layer-specific decrease in firing rates when neurons in the model are disconnected from each other. As expected, we found that the effect (quantified by the ratio between connected and disconnected firing rates: <italic>R<sub>C/U</sub></italic>) increased from supra- to infragranular layers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, right).</p>

<title>High-dimensional connectivity motifs predict layer-wise spontaneous activity</title>
<p>By analysing the underlying network structure, we observed a corresponding gradient in the topology of intra-layer synaptic connectivity from supra- to infragranular layers. We calculated the mean <italic>node participation</italic> of neuron populations in various dimensions (see Methods; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, top). For dimension one, this is simply the degree of a neuron; for dimensions above one, this generalizes the notion to counting participation in dense, directed motifs of increasing size (<italic>directed simplices</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Reimann et al., 2017</xref>). We found that correlations of this measure with the ratio of connected and disconnected firing rates increased with dimension (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, bottom, 100% of data), indicating the importance of large directed simplices in shaping activity. Curiously, the correlations for higher dimensions were driven by a small number of neurons with very high node participation. This was indicated by a sharp drop in correlation when neurons above a given value were excluded (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, bottom). Additionally, we studied the structural effect on the firing rate (here measured as the inverse of the inter-spike interval, ISI, which can be thought of as a proxy of non-zero firing rate). We found that for the connected circuit, the firing rate increases with simplex dimension; in contrast with the disconnected circuit, where this relationship remains flat (see <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref> red vs. blue curves and Methods).</p>
<p>This also demonstrates high variability between neurons, in line with biology, both structurally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Towlson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Nigam et al., 2016</xref>) and functionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Wohrer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>). We next identified the cell types that are overexpressed in the group of neurons that have the 5% highest values of node participation across dimensions (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>). This could inform theoretical point neuron models with cell-type specificity, for example. We found that while in dimension one (i.e., node degree) this consists mostly of inhibitory cells, in higher dimensions the cell types concentrate in layers 4, 5 and 6, especially for TPC neurons.

Responses remained localized to within 600 <italic>µm</italic> of the stimulus location (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, Video 5). <italic>In vivo</italic>, layer-wise I populations precede the corresponding E populations and response latencies increase with distance from thalamus, except for the fast response of L4 I. The latencies and decays are matched by criteria passing simulations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, E</xref>, left), except for a longer L4 I latency, and shorter and longer sustained responses of L2/3 E and L4 E. PV+ and Sst+ subpopulations respond reliably in layers 2-6, but the 5HT3aR+ subpopulation responses are weaker and less reliable (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>).

<p>The passing parameter combinations form a contiguous region in the parameter space (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), characterized by combinations of low <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic>, [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> and <italic>F<sub>P</sub></italic> with higher <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic>, which displayed weakly correlated spontaneous activity (compare <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> with <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G2</xref>). This offers a prediction that true <italic>in vivo</italic> firing rates are within the range of these lower FRs. Specifically, simulations with <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> from 0.1 to 0.5 robustly support realistic stimulus responses, with the middle of this range (0.3) corresponding with estimates of <italic>in vivo</italic> recording bias; both the previous estimates of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Olshausen and Field (2006)</xref> and from a spike sorting study using this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Laquitaine et al., 2024</xref>). The remaining results apply to the criteria passing simulations. We characterized the magnitude of responses by <italic>R<sub>E</sub></italic>, the ratio between the peak of the evoked response and the pre-stimulus baseline activity level. Assuming that extracellular sampling biases are similar during spontaneous and evoked activity, <italic>R<sub>E</sub></italic> provides a bias-free metric for comparing response magnitude with <italic>in vivo</italic>. Decreasing <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic>, and increasing [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> and <italic>F<sub>P</sub></italic> led to a global increase of <italic>R<sub>E</sub></italic>, and results matched <italic>in vivo</italic> closely for a large part of the parameter space (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the parameter combination closest to <italic>in vivo</italic> was central in the parameter space of criteria passing simulations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, left). Values of <italic>R<sub>E</sub></italic>, normalized by the mean <italic>R<sub>E</sub></italic> across populations, were remarkably constant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, right), indicating that variation of the parameters provides a global scaling of response magnitude. More-over, I populations matched the <italic>in vivo</italic> reference closely, while the responses of L2/3 E were slightly greater, and for L4 E and L5 E slightly weaker. The region of the parameter space where responses match <italic>in vivo</italic> for the active whisker touch stimulus was the same as for single whisker deflections (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>).

<label>2.7.2</label><title>Recreation of contrast tuning modulation by optogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Shapiro et al. (2022)</xref> compared the modulatory effects of optogenetic activation of interneuron subtypes on contrast tuning of neurons in V1. Whilst visual regions differ from somatosensory regions, the study provided an opportunity to explore the generality of interactions between E and I subpopulations. We therefore created a version of the study <italic>in silico</italic>, presenting spatio-temporally modulated patterns with various contrast levels through the VPM inputs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E,F</xref>; see Methods).</p>
<p>Overall, we found within the single simulated column 228 PCs and 259 PV+ interneurons with robust contrast tuning of their responses (see Methods). Within spike detection range of a vertically penetrating extracellular electrode (50 <italic>µ</italic>m; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Henze et al. (2000)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Buzsáki (2004)</xref>), we found 15 PCs and 13 PV+ interneurons with robust tuning, which is roughly comparable to the original study (average of 8.2 tuned PCs and 3.0 PV+ neurons per mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Shapiro et al., 2022</xref>). Unlike the original study we found no Sst+ neurons with robust tuning.</p>
<p>Additionally, we found the following results, all in line with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Shapiro et al., 2022</xref>): The firing rates of both PCs and PV+ neurons were affected by optogenetic activation of the PV+ subpopulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>), resulting in changes to the contrast tuning curves of these populations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">S12A</xref>). The main effect of the optogenetic manipulation was an increase in contrast tuning for PV+ and a decrease for PCs. However, at high contrasts, we observed a paradoxical effect of the optogenetic stimulation on L6 PV+ neurons, reducing their activity with increasing stimulation strength (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12B</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mahrach et al. (2020)</xref>). This effect did not occur under grey screen conditions (i.e., at contrast 0.0) with a constant background firing rate of 0.2 Hz or 5 Hz respectively (not shown). The individual tuning curves could be accurately fit by sigmoidal functions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="541168v6_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and consequently the effect of optogenetic activation could be quantified in terms of changes to the fitted parameters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H2</xref> inset, <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">S13</xref>; Methods). We found great variability between neurons with increasing trends for parameter <italic>m</italic> in PV+ and <italic>c</italic><sub>50</sub> in PCs, and decreasing trends for <italic>R<sub>max</sub></italic> in PV+ and both <italic>m</italic> and <italic>R<sub>max</sub></italic> in PCs.

<p>Comparing three abstract mathematical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Shapiro et al., 2022</xref>; Methods), we found that the saturation additive model best captured the effect of the optogenetic manipulation for PV+ neurons (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14A, B1</xref>), as in the reference study. The relative contributions of saturation and addition varied strongly between individual neurons (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14C1</xref>). At low intensities of the optogenetic manipulation, this distribution matched qualitatively the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Shapiro et al.

Note, that the lower synaptic reliability <italic>in vivo</italic> weakens synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Borst, 2010</xref>), and the ongoing background input leads to higher membrane conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Destexhe et al., 2001</xref>); therefore our results are expected to differ substantially, and provide an independent prediction for a different dynamic state.

<title>EM targeting trends increase inhibition of inhibitory populations enabling increased long-range excitation</title>
<p>Inspite of this, the change in connectivity affected the activity sufficiently that recalibration of missing synaptic compensation was needed to attain the target firing rates for the original meta-parameter combinations (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Figure S15</xref>). Mean conductances onto I neurons had to be increased, indicating the efficacy of the newly introduced I-I targeting by VIP+ neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B1</xref>). On the other hand, conductances for E neurons remained roughly the same, except for L6. Curiously, we found that the firing rates of I populations were reduced when the internal connectivity was activated compared to when it was inactive, further highlighting the efficacy of the I-I targeting (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B2</xref>, <xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">S15</xref>). For E neurons in L2-5, activating internal connectivity increased firing rates, but less than in the original connectome. As the number of inhibitory synapses innervating them decreased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A2</xref>), this indicates that the placement of PV+ synapses closer to the soma increased the efficacy of inhibitory as expected. Taken together, this indicates that in the SM-connectome, I populations are more externally driven and more internally inhibited (as a function of proximity to L4), and L6 E more internally driven during spontaneous activity. Over the different meta-parameter combinations, correlation in the network decreased relative to the original circuit with some exceptions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B3</xref>, <xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">S15</xref>). This indicates, that activity in the SM-connectome is shifted slightly towards a more asynchronous state.</p>
<p>By correlating the structural and functional changes we concluded that the increased conductance injection into the I populations can be explained by the increased inhibitory synapse count (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Conversely, the mostly decreased synapse counts for E populations did not lead to a decrease of conductance injection, further indicating that the more perisomatic positioning of PV+ synapses compensates for the reduced synapse counts.</p>

<title>Independent functional subunits emerge during spontaneous activity with accurate layer and distance-dependence of noise correlations</title>
<p>The subregion with consistently higher firing rates was the upper-limb representation (S1ULp), separated from subregions of lower activity by the dysgranular zones (S1DZ, S1DZO). This demonstrates that the larger spatial scale of the model supports several independently acting functional units. Locations with higher firing rates were accompanied by higher spiking correlations of the local population (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B2</xref>, Video 7), indicating activity that was more driven by intrinsic excitation. Unlike in the simulations of smaller volumes, the correlation emerged mostly from short, transient packets of activity in L6 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Consequently, deviation from the target <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> in those cases was largest in L6 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Taken together, it appears as if the additional synapses from mid-range connectivity moved the model along the spectrum from extrinsically vs. intrinsically driven, but further for some regions than for others. We confirmed a divergence into two populations: one with correlation slightly increased from the simulations of smaller volumes, and one with almost maximal correlations (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). This distinction was determined mostly in L6 with increases of correlations in other layers remaining small.</p>
<p>The distance dependence of correlations followed a similar profile to that observed in a dataset characterizing spontaneous activity in the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Reyes-Puerta et al., 2015a</xref>) (compare red line in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8I</xref> with <xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Figure S16</xref>). In the <italic>in vivo</italic> dataset spiking correlation was also low but highest in lower layers, with short “up-states” in spiking activity constrained to L5 &amp; 6 (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E,F</xref> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Reyes-Puerta et al., 2015a</xref>)). In the model, they are constrained to L6.</p>

<title>Stable propagation of evoked activity through mid-range connectivity only emerges in nbS1 at predicted <italic>in vivo</italic> firing rates</title>
<p>We repeated the previous single whisker deflection evoked activity experiment in the full model, providing a synchronous thalamic input into the forelimb sub-region (S1FL; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>; Video 8 &amp; 9). Responses in S1FL were remarkably similar to the ones in the seven column subvolume, including the delays and decays of activity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). However, in addition to a localized primary response in S1FL within 350 <italic>µm</italic> of the stimulus, we found several secondary responses at distal locations (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>; Video 9), which was suggestive of selective propagation of the stimulus-evoked signal to downstream areas efferently connected by mid-range connectivity. The response of the main activated downstream area (visible in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>) was confined to L6 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref>). In a follow up study using the model to explore the propagation of activity between cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bolaños-Puchet and Reimann, 2024</xref>), it is described how the model contains both a feedforward projection pattern, which projects to principally to synapses in L1 &amp; L23, and a feedback type pattern, which principally projects to synapses in L1 &amp; L6. On visualizing the innervation profile from the stimulated hexagon to the downstream hexagon we can see that we have stimulated a feedback pathway (<xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Figure S16</xref>).</p>

<title>Membership in mid-range connectivity rich club predicts correlation of spontaneous activity</title>
<p>As the model is homogeneous across the different subregions in terms of neuronal morphologies and physiology, we expected the differences in spontaneous and evoked activity across the model to be explained by the topology of synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Reimann et al., 2024</xref>). While the extrinsic input from the OU injections was uncorrelated by design, synaptic input from local connectivity would feature at least some degree of correlation. This led to asking, how correlated was the input from mid-range connections? We estimated for each pair of mid-range connections innervating a 460 <italic>µm</italic> hexagonal subvolume its spiking correlation and compared the resulting distribution to the correlation within the subvolume itself (see Methods; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>, upper). We found low correlations for most pairs, but with a significant number of high-correlation outliers for subvolumes with high internal correlations. Moreover, when we considered the mean of the measure, we found that it explains most of the variability in internal correlations, for both spontaneous (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>, lower) and evoked states (<xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Figure S16</xref>).</p>
<p>This led to the following tentative explanation: Local connectivity provides inputs from within 500 <italic>µm</italic>, which is virtually guaranteed to be correlated to some degree (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8I</xref> upper vs. lower, orange). This is a result of connections being <italic>locally dense</italic>, as they are concentrated within a small neighborhood (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> lower, green vs. orange). mid-range connectivity originates from further away, sampling from different functional units that may or may not be correlated, and being more diluted (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8I</xref> lower, green vs. blue). Consequently, mid-range inputs are likely to act not much different from the uncorrelated OU process, unless this is overcome by a non-random topology of mid-range connectivity.</p>
<p>Specifically, we considered the mid-range connectivity at meso-scale in terms of the graph of synapse counts between 460 <italic>µm</italic> subvolumes. When the graph was thresholded at eight million synapses, most subvolumes lacked connections at that strength completely, but others formed a single connected component, indicating the formation of a <italic>rich club</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Colizza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8J</xref>, upper, red and orange). We found that subvolumes with high internal correlation were part of the rich club, or directly adjacent to one of its members (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8J</xref>). In the presence of strong thalamic inputs, this could be overcome, as the increased activity level spread along sufficiently strong mid-range connections (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8K</xref>), albeit with substantial delays between 60 and 100 ms. This could induce high correlations in strongly connected parts of the model, outside the rich club as well (<xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Figure S16</xref>) and shows that the model supports selective propagation of activity to areas efferently connected with mid-range connectivity.</p>

<label>3</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We presented novel methods to build, simulate and validate models of cortical tissue that correspond directly with 3D digitised brain atlases. As demonstrated, this enables laboratory experiments to have a simulatable <italic>in silico</italic> counterpart, and vice versa: predictions made by the model automatically have a precise correspondence in biology. By recreating and extending five laboratory experiments under a single model parameterization, we provided strong model validation and demonstrated the model’s natural versatility. To our knowledge the simulations of the full nbS1 represent the first simulations of stable <italic>in vivo</italic>-like spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity in a large-scale biophysically detailed model of multiple cortical subregions connected through local and mid-range connectivity. The model generated an initial set of predictions about the relationship between cortical structure and function, and provides a basis for future studies and predictions. <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref> describes each quantitative prediction made in this manuscript, and how it might be tested <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, all assumptions are listed in <xref rid="tbls8" ref-type="table">Table S8</xref>. We made the model and simulation tools available for use, enabling community driven testing, exploration and refinement.</p>
<p>Excitation from non-modeled brain regions is modeled by injecting somatic conductances and is calibrated for specific populations. For the purpose of calibration, we presented a novel technique, which allows rapid and methodical characterisation and validation of emergent model activity. The efficiency of the technique allows rapid recalibration after changes to the model such as adding new brain regions or changing anatomical details. Connected divided by unconnected firing rates measured during the process are also a prediction of the degree to which the activity of a population is determined by incoming connections from local vs extrinsic sources. We found an increase of the importance of local connectivity from superficial to deeper layers, in line with the canonical view of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Lübke and Feldmeyer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Feldmeyer, 2012</xref>), which places layers 5 and 6 at the end of local information flow.</p>
<p>Although abstract relative to the model, the injection amplitudes could be predicted from the number of missing synapses, suggesting it provides a functional representation of their anatomical counterparts. The modular model of extrinsic connectivity can be refined or replaced in the future, or when larger fractions of the brain are modeled. The calibration framework could optimize per population parameters for other compensation methods, whilst still offering an interpretable spectrum of firing rate regimes at different levels of <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic>. For example, more realistic compensation schemes could be explored which introduce a) correlations between the inputs received by different neurons and b) compensation distributed across dendrites, as well as at the soma. We predict that such changes would make spontaneous activity more correlated at the lower spontaneous firing rates which supported in vivo like responses (<italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> : 0.1 − 0.5), which would in turn make stimulus-responses more noise correlated.</p>
<p>Our approach to obtaining <italic>in vivo</italic>-like activity contrasts with a recent approach in a large-scale biophysical model of primary visual cortex of similar scale to our smaller subvolume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Billeh et al., 2020</xref>). There, extrinsic inputs were delivered through dendritic synapses instead of somatic injection, which is more anatomically realistic, and intrinsic recurrent weights were adjusted to match extracellularly recorded firing rates. They find a single activity state, instead of the <italic>in vivo</italic>-compatible spectrum here that allowed us to contrast anesthetized and awake states. The model in general differs from hybrid models, which jointly use biologically-detailed models and point neuron models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Billeh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Dura-Bernal et al., 2023</xref>), and also from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Egger et al. (2020)</xref> who modeled activation of L5 pyramidal cells by constraining patterns of synaptic input based on receptive fields and predicted anatomical innervation.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of the model, how can we be confident that its activity is <italic>in vivo</italic>-like? First, we demonstrated correlated spontaneous dynamics in the form of global and local fluctuations and dynamic E-I balance, as found experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Renart et al., 2010</xref>). Second, population firing rate distributions were long-tailed with sub 1 Hz peaks, and were similar for spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Wohrer et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, mean firing rates below 1 Hz are required by metabolic constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Lennie, 2003</xref>). In response to simple whisker stimuli, response sparsity, spike counts, and the temporal profile and amplitudes of layer-wise populations were similar to <italic>in vivo</italic> under anesthetized and awake conditions, for different regions of the meta-parameter space. The effect of the spontaneous meta-parameters on evoked responses, also shows that the networks spontaneous state affects stimulus-responses, as observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Isbister et al., 2021</xref>). Although from the barrel system, these stimuli offer some of the simplest stimulus-response paradigms, enabling principles of neural dynamics and information processing to be studied; in particular, the correspondence between atomic units of sensory information and neural representations. The model also predicts the number of thalamic fibers stimulated for whisker-flick stimuli. Such validations are crucial for complex models, as they provide context for more complex validations. Moreover, in a rich and complex nonlinear system, the source of discrepancies with <italic>in vivo</italic> activity are simpler to ascertain under simpler protocols.</p>
<p>For more complex validations, we reproduced protocols from three laboratory experiments. These experiments used a wide array of techniques, which could be accurately recreated due to the model’s close correspondence with biological tissue. Additionally, we could go beyond the original experiments. For example, we predicted an increased number of neurons would be required to have a decodable effect on postsynaptic activity under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions over the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions of the original experiment. This can be explained by lower synaptic reliability under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. Also, we predicted a paradoxical effect of optogenetic stimulation on L6 PV+ interneurons, namely a decrease in firing with increased stimulus strength. This is reminiscent of the paradoxical responses found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mahrach et al. (2020)</xref> in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (in L5, but not in L2/3) and barrel cortex (no layer distinction) respectively. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mahrach et al. (2020)</xref> conducted their recordings in awake mice not engaged in any behavior, we observed this effect only when drifting grating patterns with high contrast were presented. Nevertheless, consistent with their findings, we found the effect only in deep but not in superficial layers, and only for PV+ interneurons but not for PCs. Our model could therefore be used to improve the understanding of this paradoxical effect in follow up studies. These examples demonstrate that the approach of modeling entire brain regions can be used to further probe the topics of the original articles and cortical processing. This could be continued in the future using paradigms that take advantage of the multiple regions offered by the model to study processing in cortical hierarchies.</p>
<p>Responses to whisker flick stimuli were closer to biology for values of the <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> meta-parameter between 0.1 and 0.5, according with the known inflation of mean firing rates stemming from the bias of extracellular spike sorting techniques towards larger and more active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Olshausen and Field, 2006</xref>). Supporting our estimates, patch-clamp experiments show ubiquitous neuronal silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Crochet and Petersen, 2006</xref>), and spontaneous and stimulus-evoked barrel cortex firing rates as much as 10 times lower than for extracellular recordings (0.05-0.15 Hz vs. 0.8-1.5 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Olshausen and Field, 2006</xref>). This is also inline with our recent work using the model, which estimated a spike sorting bias corresponding to <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> = 0.3 using virtual extracellular electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Laquitaine et al., 2024</xref>). Each recording technique comes with challenges and biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Shoham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Olshausen and Field, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barth and Poulet, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Wohrer et al., 2013</xref>). Calcium imaging and patch-clamp experiments are less biased towards frequently spiking neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Wohrer et al., 2013</xref>), yet the former can only infer spiking activity and may be biased towards neurons that favor marker expression. Patch-clamp techniques can reduce firing rates, be biased towards larger or more active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Olshausen and Field, 2006</xref>); and are limited to recording a few neurons simultaneously, preventing characterizations of single trial population dynamics. An earlier version of the model has been used to simulate cortical extracellular potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Reimann et al., 2013</xref>). We can now simulate modern extracellular electrodes and compare multi-unit activity and spike sorting results to the <italic>in vivo</italic>-like ground truth to gain further insights into the potential over-estimation of mean firing rates.</p>
<p>During simulations of the entire nbS1, we found emerging spatial inhomogeneities in network activity. Specifically, we observed sharp transitions in firing rates and pairwise correlations at disgranular zones. This highlights that the model supports several, independently acting functional units. Analysis of spatial correlations suggests a radius of approximately 400 <italic>µm</italic> for a single unit. This property was not present in the previous intra-regional scale model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al., 2015</xref>), but is rather an emergent property of the interregional scale, demonstrating that we achieved our goal of building a model that can be used to study mid-range interactions between regions. Analyzing the source of the inhomogeneities suggested a prominent role of a non-random rich-club structure of mid-range connections at the meso-scale. Within functional units, we found that inhomogeneous increases of spiking correlations were confined to spontaneous packets of L6 activity.</p>
<p>In keeping with the philosophy of compartmentalization of parameters and continuous model refinement (see Introduction), it was essential to improve validity at the columnar scale (relative to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref>) as part of demonstrating validity of the full nbS1. Indeed, improved parametrization and validation at smaller scales was essential to parameterizing background input which generated robust nbS1 activity within realistic [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> and firing rate ranges. We view this as a major achievement, as it was unknown whether the model would achieve a stable and meaningful regime at the start of our investigation. Whilst we would have liked to go further, our primary goal was to publish a well characterized model as an open resource that others could use to undertake further in-depth studies. In this regard, we are pleased that the parametrization of the nbS1 model has already been used to study EEG signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Tharayil et al., 2024</xref>), as well as propagation of activity between two subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bolaños-Puchet and Reimann, 2024</xref>). Investigation, improvement and validation must be continued at all spatial scales in follow up papers with detailed description, figures and analysis, which cannot be covered in this manuscript. Each new study increases the scope and validity of future investigations. In this way, this model and paper act as a stepping stone towards more complex questions of interest to the community such as perception, task performance, predictive coding and dendritic processing. This was similar for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref> where the initial paper was followed by more detailed studies. Unlike the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref> model, the new model can also be exploited by the community and has already been used in a number of follow up papers studying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ecker et al., 2024a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bolaños-Puchet and Reimann, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Pokorny et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Egas Santander et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Tharayil et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Laquitaine et al., 2024</xref>). We believe that the number of use cases for such a general model is vast, and is made larger by the increased size of the model.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight where the model deviates from biological data. First, the model omits several known anatomical elements, such as glia and the presence of gap junctions between certain neuron-types, but the model’s spatial context provides a natural scaffold for them. Our modeling techniques assume generality of rules and parameters, unless indicated by the data. Therefore, violations indicate that biological rules and data may be more specific. For example, model thalamic inputs innervate any dendrite placed in the targeted layers equally, but this did not reproduce the timing of inhibitory subpopulation responses. Stronger innervation of PV+ neurons than other inhibitory neurons may rectify this. However, it is unclear whether innervation should be anatomically or physiologically stronger, as the best available data mixes structural and physiological strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Sermet et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Roussel et al., 2023</xref>) we linked mouse inhibitory me-models to transcriptomic types (t-types) in a whole mouse cortex transcriptomic dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>). This can provide a direct correspondence in future large-scale mouse models. As we model only a single electrical type for pyramidal cells there is no one-to-one correspondence between our me-models and the 10 different pyramidal cell types identified there. We are not currently aware of any method which can recreate the electrical features of different types of pyramidal cells using only generic ion channel models. To achieve the firing pattern behavior of more specific electrical types, usually ion channel kinetics are tweaked, and this would violate the compartmentalization of parameters. In future we hope to build morpho-electric-transcriptomic type (met-type) models by selecting gene-specific ion channel models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Ranjan et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">2024</xref>) based on the met-type’s gene expression. Data specific to different neuron sections (i.e. soma, AIS, apical/basel dendrites) of different met-types, such as gene expression, distribution of ion channels, and voltage recordings under standard single cell protocols would be particularly useful.</p>
<p>Finally, when required, we generalized data from different animals and brain regions to build our rat nbS1 model. This is the accepted state-of-the-art in computational neuroscience, e.g., all 19 data-driven models of rodent microcircuitry listed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> of the recent review of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Ramaswamy (2024)</xref> conduct some sort of mixing, including the advanced mouse V1 model of the Allen Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Billeh et al., 2020</xref>). Whilst a first truly single species model would be a great advance, it is not required to be the basis of <italic>in silico</italic> research. Our model (and previous ones) can be used to study the many cortical mechanisms that are common to the closely related organisms rat and mouse. This paper and its companion paper serve to present a methodology for modeling micro- and mesoscale anatomy and physiology, which can be applied for other cortical regions and species. With the rapid increase in openly available data, efforts are already in progress to build models of mouse brain regions with reduced reliance on data mixing thanks to much larger quantities of available atlas-based data. This also includes data for the validation of emergent network level activity. Here we chose to compare network-level activity to data mostly from the barrel cortex, as well as a single study from primary visual cortex. Whilst a lot of the data used to build the model was from the barrel cortex, the barrel cortex also represents a very well characterized model of cortical processing for simple and controlled sensory stimuli. The initial comparison of population-wise responses in response to accurate thalamic input for single whisker deflections was essential to demonstrating that the model was closer to <italic>in vivo</italic>, and we were unaware of similar data for non-barrel somatosensory regions. Moreover, our optogenetic &amp; lesion study demonstrated the capacity to compare and extend studies of canonical cortical processing in the whisker system.</p>
<p>However, we cannot always predict the effect caused by mixing data sources. An interesting example of this is described in the companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Reimann et al., 2024</xref>), stating that certain rules of inhibitory connectivity found in a mouse electron-microscopic (EM) connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2023</xref>) cannot be explained by an non-selective pruning axo-dendritic appositions. We demonstrated the utility of the model to explore the effect of any connectivity rule, using the example of a mouse EM-compatible “SM-connectome”. After rewiring, and refitting synaptic, and conductance injection parameters, we found that the purely perisomatic targeting by PV+ neurons and the increased inhibitory targeting by VIP+ neurons shifted how much individual layers were driven by intrinsic and extrinsic excitation. This could not be explored with current techniques <italic>in vivo</italic> and highlights a strength of <italic>in silico</italic> experimentation. On the other hand, this data source contradicts some of our rat nbS1 parameters, e.g., the number of synapses per connection from light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al., 2015</xref>) do not match with the ones obtained from mouse V1 EM. Thus we used the rat data sources for building our baseline model, but make both models available in a simulatable format (see Data Availability).</p>

<p>Neuron models from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Reva et al. (2023)</xref> were made as follows. Ion channel conductance densities were optimised for a pool of reconstructed neurons, for which <italic>in vitro</italic> recordings had previously been made. Ion channel densities were then generalised to other neuron models of the same e-type.

<p>For some electrical models, further adjustments were made to AIS sections to handle the large input currents present under conditions of high network activity. In short, for certain pyramidal cell morphologies, the AIS was replaced by a cylinder with a length of 60 <italic>µm</italic>.

Where possible, pathway and synapse-type specific parameter values were taken from the literature, and after eventual corrections (for differences in the temperature and solutions used in the experiments), were put directly into the model using the technique described for the use case of hippocampal CA1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ecker et al. (2020)</xref>. For example, parameters <italic>U<sub>SE</sub></italic>, <italic>D</italic>, <italic>F</italic>, and <italic>U<sub>Hill</sub></italic> have previously been fitted for a number of pathways using data acquired from paired-recording experiments. Furthermore, <italic>ĝ<sub>ratio</sub></italic> parameter has been previously determined from outside-out patch recording experiments.</p>
<p>The remaining parameters (<italic>ĝ</italic> and <italic>N<sub>RRP</sub></italic>) were iteratively calibrated using an <italic>in silico</italic> setup reproducing the paired-recordings experiments detailed below. For this parameterization, all paired-recording data sources from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref> were re-used. To further constrain the variance of EPSP amplitudes in L5 TTPCs, fitted parameters from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barros-Zulaica et al. (2019)</xref> were used. The dataset was also enriched with recent recordings from L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Qi and Feldmeyer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Yang et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">2022</xref>). Instead of generalizing L4 E peak synaptic conductances for all thalamic fibers (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al., 2015</xref>), synaptic conductances were constrained using EPSP amplitude measurements from thalamocortical slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Beierlein and Connors, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Beierlein et al., 2003</xref>). Fibers originating from POm were not present in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref>. Due to the lack of <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements, physiological parameters from VPM synapses were generalized to describe POm synapses.</p>
<p>Not all synaptic peak conductances can be measured with paired recordings due to the space-clamp artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ecker et al., 2020</xref>), and estimating the number of release-ready vesicles is also challenging experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Loebel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barros-Zulaica et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, for synaptic pathways for which there was <italic>in vitro</italic> reference data, these two parameters were determined in a simulation-driven iterative process. Firstly, 50 pairs of <italic>in silico</italic> neurons were randomly sampled. Second, the postsynaptic cell was current-clamped, and the PSP at the soma of the postsynaptic cell in response to a presynaptic action potential was measured. This was repeated 35 times for each pair as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ecker et al. (2020)</xref>. Thridly, the mean and the CV of these amplitudes were extracted and compared with reference <italic>in vitro</italic> data. Finally, peak conductance (<italic>ĝ</italic>), and the average number of vesicles in the release-ready pool (<italic>N<sub>RRP</sub></italic>) were adjusted to match the amplitude and CV of the <italic>in vitro</italic> reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ecker et al., 2020</xref>). In some cases, this resulted in reaching the lower bound of univesicular release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barros-Zulaica et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Where experimental data was not available, mean synaptic physiology parameters from similar pathways were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ecker et al., 2020</xref>). For the VPM to L5 E pathway, the maximum of VPM to L4 E and VPM to L6 E conductances (instead of the mean) were used, based on resulting evoked firing rates found in a later modeling step (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). To calibrate the mPSC frequencies of different pathways, single cell simulations with different values of the spontaneous release frequency for all synapses of a set of 1000 cells in a given pathway were run. In these simulations, <italic>in silico</italic> voltage-clamp recordings were performed to measure the resulting mPSC frequency at the soma. This data was then fitted with a logarithmic function and the value of the spontaneous release frequency matching the <italic>in vitro</italic> reference value for the mPSC frequency was interpolated. As <italic>in vitro</italic> paired recording data is sparse, all available sources to determine synaptic parameters were re-used for validation.</p>

<label>4.1.4</label><title>Datasets used for validation of <italic>in vivo</italic>-like dynamics</title>
<p>Activity in the model is compared with spike-sorted extracellular recordings from the barrel cortex of anaesthetised rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Reyes-Puerta et al., 2015b</xref>). The dataset contains single unit spike times for both spontaneous activity and responses to single whisker deflections, across 6 layer-wise neuron populations (L2/3 E, L2/3 I, L4 E, L4 I, L5 E &amp; L5 I). We extend the dat aset using the average of L2/3 I, L4 I and L5 I as a reference for L1 I and L6 I, and an alternative reference for L6 E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">De Kock et al., 2007</xref>). The spontaneous firing rates of the 9 neuron populations are collected in the vector of reference firing rates, <bold><italic>V<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold>.</p>
<p>As a secondary comparison, we use a dataset of <italic>in vivo</italic> juxtacellular and whole-cell recordings of barrel cortex responses in awake mice during an active whisker touch paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). While the animal model is different, using this data enables comparison to awake responses of layer-wise E populations and I subpopulations (VIP+ (vasoactive intestinal peptide, a part of our 5HT3aR+ subpopulation), Sst+, FS (fast spiking, corresponding to our PV+ subpopulation)). Moreover, this allows validating the model against properties of cortical responses across similar but different paradigms, reducing the risk of over fitting.</p>

<label>4.1.5</label><title>Somatic conductance injection</title>
<p>Random background synaptic inputs, representing uncorrelated inputs from other brain regions not present in the model, are modelled as a conductance-based somatic injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B1</xref>). Specifically, we inject conductance signals described by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process (similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Destexhe et al. (2001)</xref>), given by the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="541168v6_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>g</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the conductance signal, <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> its mean value, <italic>τ</italic> is the decay time constant, <italic>D</italic> is the diffusion coefficient, and <italic>χ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is a Gaussian white noise process. The diffusion coefficient can also be expressed in terms of the standard deviation <italic>σ</italic> of the signal: <italic>D</italic> = <sup>2<italic>σ</italic>2</sup>. Note that we only consider an excitatory conductance signal representing mid-range excitatory drive, whereas local inhibitory input is deemed sufficient within the circuit model. As we are modeling a non-specific random background noise, we use a different, uncorrelated OU process for each cell.</p>
<p>Given the diversity of morphologies and electrical behaviors of cells in our circuit, we scale the mean and standard deviation of the injected signal based on individual cell properties. Specifically, we compute the input resistance <italic>R<sub>in</sub></italic> of each cell at its resting potential, then take its reciprocal value <italic>G<sub>in</sub></italic> = 1<italic>/R<sub>in</sub></italic> (units of conductance). The mean <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> and standard deviation <italic>σ</italic> of the injected conductance signal are then expressed as percentages <italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic> and <italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic> of this input conductance <italic>G<sub>in</sub></italic>:

<label>4.1.6</label><title>Details of spontaneous activity calibration</title>
<p><italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic> and <italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic> are parameterised separately for each of 9 populations (layer-wise E and I combinations; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B2</xref>), leading to 18 parameters, grouped into two 9-dimensional vectors <bold><italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic></bold>. Spontaneous firing rates across populations, denoted by the vector <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold>, are then determined by the vectors <bold><italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic></bold>, and [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>. The objective of the calibration procedure is to determine a mapping that outputs the <bold><italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic></bold> required to achieve a particular set of firing rates <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold>, for a given [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>This requires two simplifications: First, we reduce the space of possible <bold><italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic></bold> values by fixing <bold><italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic></bold> = <bold><italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic></bold> ∗ <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic>, where <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> is a pre-specified constant that controls the level of noise assumed to be present in the external synaptic input. Second, we learn the mapping only for dynamical states where the firing rates of the 9 populations are a proportion of reference <italic>in vivo</italic> firing rates, i.e. <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> = <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> ∗ <bold><italic>V<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold>, with <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> ∈ [0, 1] (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B2</xref>). This is based on the assumption that extracellular spike detection sampling biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Olshausen and Field, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Wohrer et al., 2013</xref>) affect all populations equally.</p>
<p>The mapping can be written as Ψ<italic><sub>Ca</sub></italic>2+<italic><sub>,ROU</sub></italic> : <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> 1→ <bold><italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic></bold> and is simplified into two separate mappings which are determined separately and then combined (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). The first mapping finds values of the 9 output parameters <bold><italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic></bold>, for a given <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic>, which produce particular <italic>unconnected firing rates</italic> <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> (i.e., where the neurons in the network are not connected to each other). The second then maps between <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold>.</p>
<p>The first mapping <italic>χ</italic> : (<italic>R<sub>OU</sub>,</italic> <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold>) 1→ <bold><italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic></bold>, is attained by running 1 second simulations over various combinations of <italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic> and <italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> constrains <italic>OU<sub>µ</sub></italic> and <italic>OU<sub>σ</sub></italic> to a line of possible combinations in the 2D space. We generate an approximation of <italic>χ</italic> based on linear interpolation between the results of simulations along the line. Note in particular, that <italic>χ</italic> is independent of [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>Given the mapping <italic>χ</italic>, the remaining problem is to determine the values of <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> that achieve certain target firing rates given by <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> ∗ <bold><italic>V<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold>, for <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> ∈ [0<italic>, P<sub>max</sub></italic>] and each combination of [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> and <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic>, i.e., to determine the mapping <italic>ϕ<sub>Ca</sub></italic>2+<italic><sub>,R</sub></italic>: <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> 1→ <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold>. This is done by measuring values of <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> produced for given values of <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> in a number of simulations. However, instead of exploring the whole parameter space of possible <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> values, we only explore a small number of values of <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> which we expect to produce the target <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> values. This is done by iteratively learning the mapping <italic>ϕ<sub>Ca</sub></italic>2+<italic><sub>,ROU</sub></italic> : <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> 1→ <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> and in each iteration using <italic>ϕ</italic> to predict <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> values that bring the dynamics closer to the target firing rate, i.e., by sampling values given by <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> = <italic>ϕ</italic><sup>−1</sup>(<italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic>) = <italic>ϕ</italic><sup>−1</sup>(<italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> ∗ <bold><italic>V<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold>) for 10 equidistant values of <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> ∈ [0<italic>, P<sub>max</sub></italic>]. The initial guess of <italic>ϕ</italic> is simply the identity, i.e., assuming no effect of connecting the network, with <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> = 0.5. All other iterations use <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> = 1.0.</p>
<p>We update <italic>ϕ</italic> by fitting an exponential: <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> = <italic>α</italic> ∗ <italic>e<sup>β</sup></italic><bold><italic><sup>U<sub>F R</sub></sup></italic></bold> + <italic>κ</italic> to the values of <bold><italic>U<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold>, <bold><italic>C<sub>F R</sub></italic></bold> measured on the latest iteration (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). In a recurrently connected network such as our model, the connected firing rate of a population depends on the firing rates of all other populations in complex and nonlinear ways. This is addressed by our simplification to restrict the compatible dynamic states, where by definition the target firing rate of one population determines the target firing rates of all others.</p>
<p>The firing rates of the L2/3 I, and L4 I and L6 I populations could not be sufficiently lowered for <italic>P<sub>F R</sub> &lt;</italic> 0.2 and <italic>P<sub>F R</sub> &lt;</italic> 0.1 respectively, as they spontaneously fired even at their resting potentials (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>).</p>

<p>The spike times of single whisker deflection stimuli were drawn from a PSTH of VPM neurons in response to 3 ms mechanical single whisker deflections made at 1 Hz in urethane anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Diamond et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A2</xref>). Since the <italic>in vivo</italic> data for cortical responses to single whisker deflections was from responses to 2 ms mechanical whisker deflections, we compressed the tail of the VPM PSTH to allow a direct comparison with <italic>in silico</italic> responses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A2</xref>). A VPM PSTH for the active whisker touch stimulus was used from the same dataset as the corresponding cortical responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Yu et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Firstly, <italic>in silico</italic> responses were compared to data from the C2 barrel of the anaesthetized rat in response to single whisker deflections made at <italic>&lt;</italic> 1Hz.

<p>As an initial test of similarity with the corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> dataset, trial-averaged PSTHs were first calculated for each parameter combination, both for all neurons, and for each of the layer-wise E and I populations. We then tested whether the latencies, 50% and 25%-decay points of the trial-averaged PSTHs were respectively no more than 10 ms, 10 ms and 40 ms later than those of the corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> populations, and that there was no secondary rise in the PSTHs after the initial decay (by testing that none of the PSTHs for individual populations were more than 35% above baseline after 75 ms).

<label>4.1.9</label><title>In-silico experimental methods</title>
<p>Simulation of a morphologically detailed model first requires specifying the conditions (parameters and inputs) under which to perform the simulation. Given the correspondence between variables in the model and properties of biological systems, we are able to mimic to a certain extent the conditions and protocols of experimental studies. These are combinations of existing techniques, or even techniques that cannot or have not yet been performed experimentally. On top of the compensation for missing external input and different [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>, we implemented further mechanisms to simulate specific experimental conditions. On a technical level, these comprise somatic current or conductance injections, adjustment of synaptic connectivity parameters, and selective activation of thalamic fibers. These are static conditions, however, in that their time course must be determined before the simulation is run. Somatic injections and connectivity adjustments can be targeted with single neuron or single pair resolution, respectively. To each thalamic fiber or neuron in the model, we can assign an arbitrary spike train, triggering synaptic release from all of its synapses with anatomically determined delays (from axonal conduction speed and path length). These mechanisms can target specific groups of neurons, e.g. based on neuron properties, such as location, layer, m-type or e-type, or inhibitory subpopulation (determined based on me-type as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Markram et al. (2015)</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We combined mechanisms to simulate various <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental paradigms. Pathway lesions, for example, are simulated by selecting sets of pre- and postsynaptic neurons and removing all synaptic connections between them (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). Simulated optogenetic stimulation, in addition to being targeted at specific groups of neurons, took into account the attenuation of light with depth for the wavelength being used. Neurons were then inhibited or excited according to the intensity of light reaching them (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). Finally, sensory stimuli were simulated by generating instances of stimulus-specific stochastic spike trains activating the thalamic input fibers (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Sensory inputs were simulated using a three step procedure (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C2</xref>): First, a time series representing sensory stimulation is assigned to each selected thalamic fiber; second, the time series is optionally transformed with a fiber-dependent transfer function; third, a spike train is generated from the time series through a stochastic spiking process. Thalamic input fibers were associated with roughly columnar, overlapping volumes of the model that they formed synaptic connections in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Reimann et al., 2024</xref>). Their centers were projected into the plane using a flat map of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Bolaños-Puchet et al., 2024</xref>), yielding [<italic>x<sub>ζ</sub>, y<sub>ζ</sub></italic>], the <italic>flat locations</italic> of each fiber <italic>ζ</italic>. A sensory stimulus was defined based on fiber location as <italic>ρ<sub>ζ</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>ρ</italic>(<italic>x<sub>ζ</sub>, y<sub>ζ</sub>, t</italic>). The stimulus function could be partially stochastic and its value was evaluated for each time bin of the simulation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C1</xref>). Next, a fiber could be associated with a transfer function <italic>υ<sub>ζ</sub></italic> that transforms the results of <italic>ρ</italic>. If none is mentioned, identity was used as transfer function. Finally, a spiking process <italic>ψ</italic> was used to instantiate a spike train for each fiber, based on its transformed time series. That is, the spike train associated with <italic>ζ</italic> was Γ<italic><sub>ζ</sub></italic> = <italic>ψ</italic>(<italic>υ<sub>ζ</sub></italic>(<italic>ρ<sub>ζ</sub></italic>)). The processes used were stochastic, leading to different spike trains for fibers associated with the same time series. Different, specific <italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>υ</italic> and <italic>ψ</italic> were used for different experimental paradigms that will be further described below.</p>

<p>To study how input from L4 contributes to L2/3 subthreshold responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Varani et al. (2022)</xref> used a 500 ms long whisker hold paradigm, while patch-clamping PCs in L2/3 in anesthetized and awake mice. We encoded the whisker hold stimulus as a step function (<italic>ρ<sub>ζ</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = 1, if 2000 ms ≤ t <italic>&lt;</italic> 2500 ms, 0 otherwise) in 10% of the VPM fibers within the seven column subvolume. One of four transfer functions were assigned to each fiber, based on the types of kinetic response properties of thalamic neurons identified in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Petersen et al., 2008</xref>). The types were selective for whisker position (<italic>υ<sub>pos</sub></italic>), velocity (<italic>υ<sub>vel</sub></italic>), acceleration (<italic>υ<sub>acc</sub></italic>), or direction (<italic>υ<sub>dir</sub></italic>), and were implemented as:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="541168v6_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>r<sub>max</sub></italic> = 150 Hz denotes the firing rate of a thalamic fiber when its associated feature property is at the fiber’s preferred value. Transfer functions were randomly assigned to fibers with the fractions identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Petersen et al. (2008)</xref> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 11% coding for position and acceleration, 58% for velocity and 20% for direction). The spiking process <italic>ψ</italic> was an adapting Markov process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Muller et al., 2007</xref>) with an adaptation time constant of 100 ms. As the whisker movements were short lasting, rates were evaluated at submillisecond (0.1) resolution.</p>
<p>Similarly to before, only the seven column subvolume (210k neurons) was used for the simulations, and the <italic>in vivo</italic>-like state was realized as <italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup> = 1.05 mM, <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> = 0.4, and <italic>P<sub>F R</sub></italic> = 0.3.</p>
<p>The optogenetic inhibition in this experiment targeted 95% (in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Varani et al. (2022)</xref>) of excitatory cells in layer 4. The authors found a few cells which also tested positive for Halo at the bottom of L3 as well, but as they did not quantify it, we decided not to target any lower L3 PCs in the <italic>in silico</italic> version of the experiment. Based on the 595 nm wavelength (yellow light) parameters were set to <italic>µ<sub>a</sub></italic> ≈ 0.49 <italic>mm</italic><sup>−1</sup> and <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub><sup>′</sup> ≈ 4.12 <italic>mm</italic><sup>−1</sup>. For the depth-based spatial binning of cells, 5 bins were used in L4. After scanning several values, <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> was set to -200% as that reproduced the ≈ 10 mV hyperpolarization of L4 PCs observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. In line with the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment, the optogenetic stimulus ended in a (100 ms long) ramp to avoid rebound spikes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>When going beyond reproducing the same experimental conditions and instead leveraging the <italic>in silico</italic> nature of our setup, synaptic pathways were lesioned by selecting the excitatory population in a given layer as the pre-synaptic population and the excitatory population in L2/3 as the post-synaptic population and not instantiating the connecting synapses during the simulation.</p>
<p>L2/3 PCs had to meet three criteria to be included in the subsequent analysis. Firstly, their activity was required to remain subthreshold during the 500 ms long whisker hold stimulus and in 200 ms long time windows before and after the stimulus, both in control and <italic>in silico</italic> optogenetic runs. Second, they had to be innervated by at least one (active) VPM fiber. Third, the derivative of their voltage trace had to cross the 1 mV/ms threshold in a 20 ms time window after stimulus onset in the control simulation. The last two were motivated by comparing subthreshold voltages to voltage traces from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Varani et al. (2022)</xref> that showed large, stimulus evoked EPSPs. Around 8% of L2/3 PCs in the central column met all the above criteria and their voltages were averaged to arrive to the traces shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>. Thus, unlike in the original analysis, cells rather than trials were averaged. The motivation for this approach is that while <italic>in vivo</italic> it is easier to repeat the same paradigm after establishing stable recording conditions in a given cell, <italic>in silico</italic> it is quicker to record from all cells in a single simulation, instead of repeating the stimulus several times.</p>

<p>Since our model comprises the nbS1 and not the V1 brain area, we modelled visual drifting gratings in a more abstract way, without taking specifics of the visual system into account. In particular, we defined <italic>ρ</italic>(<italic>x<sub>ζ</sub>, y<sub>ζ</sub>, t</italic>) as a spatio-temporal rate pattern corresponding to linear sinusoidal drifting gratings for a fraction <italic>F<sub>P</sub></italic> of 937 VPM fibers projecting to a single simulated column (30k neurons, 520 <italic>µm</italic> diameter). For all other VPM fibers <italic>ρ</italic> was zero. The gratings had a temporal frequency of <italic>f<sub>temp</sub></italic> = 2 Hz and a spatial frequency of 0.03 cycles/degree which we translated to <italic>f<sub>spat</sub></italic> = 0.001 cycles/<italic>µm</italic> by assuming a cortical magnification factor in rat of 30 <italic>µm</italic>/degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Gias et al., 2005</xref>). In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, the spatial grating patterns are illustrated at different points in time.</p>
<p>As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Shapiro et al. (2022)</xref>, we used five contrast levels <italic>C</italic> ∈ [0.06, 0.12, 0.24, 0.5, 1.0] which were defined as the Michelson contrast given the minimum and maximum luminance values <italic>L<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>L<sub>max</sub></italic>:
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="541168v6_eqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Since the physical quantity of luminance does not have a clear correspondence in our model, we used normalized luminance values <italic>L<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>L<sub>max</sub></italic> between 0.0 and 1.0 by computing the inverse Michelson contrast centered around a mean normalized luminance of 0.5. The resulting values of <italic>L<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>L<sub>max</sub></italic> where then scaled and shifted to the minimum and maximum rates of the sinusoidal modulation <italic>R<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>R<sub>max</sub></italic> respectively such that the peak firing rate at contrast 1.0 was given by <italic>R<sub>peak</sub></italic> and the mean of the modulation corresponding to the background firing rate at contrast 0.0 was given by <italic>R<sub>bk</sub></italic>. The resulting sinusoidal input rate signal can be written as:
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="541168v6_eqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>t</italic> is the time in seconds, <italic>l<sub>ζ</sub></italic> the linear position of <italic>ζ</italic> within the grating, and |<sub>+</sub> denotes that firing rates are truncated to positive values only. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref> illustrates a random series of rate signals corresponding to different contrasts. No transfer function was used, and spiking process <italic>ψ</italic> was an adapting Markov process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Muller et al., 2007</xref>) with an adaptation time constant of 100 ms. Values for <italic>F<sub>P</sub></italic>, <italic>R<sub>peak</sub></italic>, and <italic>R<sub>bk</sub></italic> were determined beforehand by a parameter optimization so that the resulting grating responses were qualitatively comparable with the ones reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Shapiro et al. (2022)</xref>, see next subsection for details.</p>
<sec id="s7c13a">
<title>Calibration of drifting grating stimulus</title>
<p>We ran a parameter scan to determine optimal values for <italic>F<sub>P</sub></italic> (fraction of 937 VPM fibers projecting to the central column of our model to apply grating stimulus to), <italic>R<sub>peak</sub></italic> (peak firing rate at contrast 1.0), and <italic>R<sub>bk</sub></italic> (background firing rate at contrast 0.0). This calibration was done by running 45 simulations using all combinations of parameter values in the ranges <italic>F<sub>P</sub></italic> ∈ [0.5, 0.75, 1.0], <italic>R<sub>peak</sub></italic> ∈ [5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0] Hz and <italic>R<sub>bk</sub></italic> ∈ [0.05, 0.1, 0.2] Hz, and selecting the optimal combination amongst them. Each simulation lasted 40 s during which 20 contrast stimuli were presented for 1 s, followed by a 1 s (blank) inter-stimulus interval. Four contrast levels <italic>C</italic> ∈ [0.06, 0.12, 0.5, 1.0] were presented five times each in random order, which was sufficient to fit sigmoidal tuning functions with four parameters (see <xref rid="eqn9" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 9</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed that especially under strong stimulus conditions the response rates of PCs to the first and second cycle of the sinusoidal grating pattern (1 s stimulus at <italic>f<sub>temp</sub></italic> = 2 Hz) were quite different, with the second response largely attenuated due to synaptic depletion. Therefore, we extracted first and second peak firing rates <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> respectively from the peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) computed with 1 ms resolution and 20 ms Gaussian smoothing (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10</xref>). We defined a measure of the normalized peak difference as the Michelson contrast of the peak rates <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub>, given by
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="541168v6_eqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Additionally, we extracted average firing rates for each contrast level of the whole population of PCs within the full (1 s) as well as the first and second halves (0.5 s each) of the stimulation intervals. We then fitted sigmoidal tuning functions with parameters <italic>c</italic><sub>50</sub>, <italic>m</italic>, <italic>n</italic>, and <italic>R<sub>max</sub></italic> (see <xref rid="eqn9" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 9</xref>) to these average tuning responses (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure S11</xref>). Finally, as summarized in <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10</xref> and <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">S11</xref>, we selected the best combination of parameters based on the following selection criteria:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The peak firing rates in response to the grating stimulus should be sufficiently strong, covering a range of values including the one reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Shapiro et al., 2022</xref>, cf. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). So we imposed the constraint that the maximum peak rates over the whole population of PCs of the first and second peaks <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> respectively should be at least <italic>r<sub>th</sub></italic> = 30 Hz at maximum contrast.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The peak responses to the first and second cycle of the grating stimulus should not be too different. So we aimed for a low peak difference <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="541168v6_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> at maximum contrast.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The overall tuning response of the PCs should be in a regime where the tuning curve would have a sigmoidal shape, meaning that it should be increasing but saturating with increasing contrasts. To fulfill this constraint, we aimed for
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>–</bold> Low <italic>c</italic><sub>50</sub>, i.e., the inflection point of the tuning curve would be at low contrasts</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>–</bold> High <italic>n</italic>, i.e., a steep non-linear increase of the tuning curve until saturation</p></list-item>
</list>

<p>We also compared the <italic>in vivo</italic> state of our model with the results of a recent <italic>in vitro</italic> study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Prince et al., 2021</xref>), which explored how neurons with different biophysical properties encode different types of signals. The <italic>in vitro</italic> study optically activated groups of 10 PCs in slices of L2/3 barrel cortex from mouse lines labelling fast-spiking (FS) and regularspiking (RS) interneurons. Each PC was targeted individually and a binary signal was encoded either through changes in the rate of optical pulses applied to the 10 stimulus neurons, or through changes in the synchronicity of the pulses. The mutual information shared between the binary signal (when encoded either as changes in firing rate or synchronicity) and the firing rate of different inhibitory sub-types (recorded using whole-cell patch clamping <italic>in vitro</italic>) was analysed.</p>
<p>While the <italic>in vitro</italic> stimuli used optical pulses targeted at single neurons with timings drawn from Poisson processes, it was not necessary to explicitly model such an optical stimulus <italic>in silico</italic>, as we can instead elicit spikes directly in the model. In the original study, the 10 stimulus neurons were uniformly separated in a grid-like pattern at horizontal and vertical distances of ∼50 <italic>µm</italic>. The binary signal alternated between two states at random intervals of 2-7 s. For the rate coding paradigm, the timings of the optical pulses for the 10 stimulus neurons were drawn from 10 independent inhomogeneous Poisson processes, with the rates of optical activation varying between 5 Hz and 0.5 Hz for the up and down states respectively (average firing rate: 2.7 Hz). For the synchronous case, the timings of the optical pulses for the 10 stimulus neurons were drawn from a single inhomogeneous Poisson process during the up state, or 10 independent inhomogeneous Poisson processes during the down state. For the synchronous case, the firing rates of the up and down state were both 2.7 Hz. We therefore tested stimulus encoding using a range of stimulus neuron counts: from 10 to 1,000.</p>
<p>In our interpretation of the study, mutual information was measured between the binary signal and neural activity during a 0-5 ms and 5-50 ms window following a change in the signal. These represented ‘early’ and ‘late’ stimulus encoding windows following the change in the signal, respectively. As the synchronous up state activated synchronous patterns at a rate of 2.7 Hz, we calculated that a synchronous pattern would only be activated during the early and late windows with probability 0.0135 (= 2.7 ∗ 5<italic>/</italic>1000) and 0.1125 (= 2.7 ∗ 45<italic>/</italic>1000) respectively. We therefore chose to use higher FR of 20 Hz for the synchronous up and down states, and to analyse mutual information between the binary signal and all 50 ms bins. To afford comparison with the rate code experiment type, we used 30 Hz and 10 Hz as the FRs of the up and down states respectively. We also compare stimulus coding during the first 50 ms following the stimulus change for both the synchronous and rate stimulus types.</p>

(2017)</xref> for more details). The <italic>n-node participation</italic> of a node <italic>v</italic> in <italic>G</italic> is the number of directed <italic>n</italic>-simplices this node is part of. In particular, for <italic>n</italic> = 1, this is the total degree of the node in <italic>G</italic>. Thus, this can be though of a generalization of the notion of degree that takes into account account higher order interactions and has been shown to strongly correlate with other node centrality metrics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Sizemore et al. (2018)</xref>.</p>
<p>For any numeric property of neurons, e.g., firing rate, we evaluate the effect of dimension on it by taking weighted averages across dimensions. That is for each dimension <italic>k</italic>, we take the weighted average of the property across neurons where the weights are given by node participation on dimension <italic>k</italic>. More precisely, let <italic>N</italic> be the number of neurons and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="541168v6_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> be a vector of a property on all the neurons e.g., the vector of firing rates. Then in each dimension <italic>k</italic> we compute
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="541168v6_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="541168v6_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the vector of node participation on dimension <italic>k</italic> for all neurons and · is the dot product.</p>
<p>To measure the over and underexpression of the different m-types among those with the highest 5% of values of node participation, we used the hypergeometric distribution to determine the expected distribution of m-types in a random sample of the same size. More precisely, for each dimension <italic>k</italic> and m-type <italic>m</italic>, let <italic>N<sub>total</sub></italic> be the total number of neurons in the circuit, <italic>N<sub>m</sub></italic> be the number of neurons of m-type <italic>m</italic> in the circuit, <italic>C<sub>top</sub></italic> be the number of neurons with the highest 5% values of node participation in dimension <italic>k</italic>, <italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic> the number of neurons of mtype <italic>m</italic> among these, and let <italic>P</italic> = <italic>hypergeom</italic>(<italic>N<sub>total</sub>, N<sub>m</sub>, C<sub>top</sub></italic>) be the hypergeometric distribution.</p>
<p>By definition, <italic>P</italic> (<italic>x</italic>) describes the probability of sampling <italic>x</italic> neurons of m-type <italic>m</italic> in a random sample of size <italic>C<sub>top</sub></italic>. Therefore, using the cumulative distribution <italic>F</italic> (<italic>x</italic>) = <italic>P</italic> (Counts ≤ <italic>x</italic>), we can compute the <italic>p</italic>-values as follows:

The mean conductance injections found for the original connectome for the 60 meta-parameter combinations were used for the first iteration of the re-optimisation and lead to decreases in firing rates for all inhibitory populations except L1 I (A1). In A1 and A2 blue and yellow points refer to <italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup> 1.05 and 1.1 respectively.

<p>This paper presents a model of the whole somatosensory non-barrel cortex of the rat, with 4.2 million morphologically and electrically detailed neurons, with many aspects of the model constrained by a variety of data. The paper focuses on simulation experiments, testing a range of observations. These experiments are aimed at understanding how multiscale organization of the cortical network shapes neural activity.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>• The model is very large and detailed. With 4.2 million neurons and 13.2 billion synapses, as well as the level of biophysical realism employed, it is a highly comprehensive computational representation of the cortical network.</p>
<p>• Large scope of work - the authors cover a variety of properties of the network structure and activity in this paper, from dendritic and synaptic physiology to multi-area neural activity.</p>
<p>• Direct comparisons with experiments, shown throughout the paper, are laudable.</p>
<p>• The authors make a number of observations, like describing how high-dimensional connectivity motifs shape patterns of neural activity, which can be useful for thinking about the relations between the structure and the function of the cortical network.</p>
<p>• Sharing the simulation tools and a &quot;large subvolume of the model&quot; is appreciated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>• A substantial part of this paper - the first few figures - focuses on single-cell and single-synapse properties, with high similarity to what was shown in Markram et al., 2015. Details may differ, but overall it is quite similar.</p>
<p>• Although the paper is about the model of the whole non-barrel somatosensory cortex, out of all figures, only one deals with simulations of the whole non-barrel somatosensory cortex. Most figures focus on simulations that involve one or a few &quot;microcolumns&quot;. Again, it is rather similar to what was done in Markram et al., 2015 and constitutes relatively incremental progress.</p>
<p>• With a model like this, one has an opportunity to investigate computations and interactions across an extensive cortical network in an in vivo-like context. However, the simulations presented are not addressing realistic specific situations corresponding to animals performing a task or perceiving a relevant somatosensory stimulus. This makes the insights into roles of cell types or connectivity architecture less interesting, as they are presented for relatively abstract situations. It is hard to see their relationship to important questions that the community would be excited about - theoretical concepts like predictive coding, biophysical mechanisms like dendritic nonlinearities, or circuit properties like feedforward, lateral, and feedback processing across interacting cortical areas. In other words, what do we learn from this work conceptually, especially, about the whole non-barrel somatosensory cortex?</p>
<p>• Most of comparisons with in vivo-like activity are done using experimental data for whisker deflection (plus some from the visual stimulation in V1). But this model is for the non-barrel somatosensory cortex, so exactly the part of the cortex that has less to do with whiskers (or vision). Is it not possible to find any in vivo neural activity data from non-barrel cortex?</p>
<p>• The authors almost do not show raw spike rasters or firing rates. I am sure most readers would want to decide for themselves whether the model makes sense, and for that the first thing to do is to look at raster plots and distributions of firing rates. Instead, the authors show comparisons with in vivo data using highly processed, normalized metrics.</p>
<p>• While the authors claim that their model with one set of parameters reproduces many experimentally established metrics, that is not entirely what one finds. Instead, they provide different levels of overall stimulation to their model (adjusting the target &quot;P_FR&quot; parameter, with values from 0 to 1, and other parameters), and that influences results. If I get this right (the figures could really be improved with better organization and labeling), simulations with P_FR closer to 1 provide more realistic firing rate levels for a few different cases, however, P_FR of 0.3 and possibly above tends to cause highly synchronized activity - what the authors call bursting, but which also could be called epileptic-like activity in the network.</p>
<p>• The authors mention that the model is available online, but the &quot;Resource availability&quot; section does not describe that in substantial detail. As they mention in the Abstract, it is only a subvolume that is available. That might be fine, but more detail in appropriate parts of the paper would be useful.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors addressed all my comments by revising and adding text as well as revising and adding some figures and videos. The limitations described in my previous review (above) mostly remain, but they are much better acknowledged and described now. These limitations can be addressed in the future work, whereas the current paper represents a step forward relative to the state of the art and provides a useful resource for the community.</p>
<p>Two minor points about the new additions to the paper:</p>
<p>(1) Something does not seem right in the sentence, &quot;Unlike the Markram et al. (2015) model, the new model can also be exploited by the community and has already been used in a number of follow up papers studying (Ecker et al., 2024a,b; ...)&quot;. Should the authors remove &quot;studying&quot;?</p>
<p>(2) It is great that the authors added more plots and videos of the firing rates, but most of them show maximum-normalized rates, which sort of defeats the purpose. No scale on the y-axis is shown (it can be useful even for normalized data). And it is impossible to see anything for inhibitory populations.</p>
<p>These are minor points that may not need to be addressed. Overall, it is a nice study that is certainly useful for the field.</p>
<p>A great improvement is that the model is made fully available to the public.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This paper presents a model of the whole somatosensory non-barrel cortex of the rat, with 4.2 million morphologically and electrically detailed neurons, with many aspects of the model constrained by a variety of data. The paper focuses on simulation experiments, testing a range of observations. These experiments are aimed at understanding how the multiscale organization of the cortical network shapes neural activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The model is very large and detailed. With 4.2 million neurons and 13.2 billion synapses, as well as the level of biophysical realism employed, it is a highly comprehensive computational representation of the cortical network.</p>
<p>(2) Large scope of work - the authors cover a variety of properties of the network structure and activity in this paper, from dendritic and synaptic physiology to multi-area neural activity.</p>
<p>(3) Direct comparisons with experiments, shown throughout the paper, are laudable.</p>
<p>(4) The authors make a number of observations, like describing how high-dimensional connectivity motifs shape patterns of neural activity, which can be useful for thinking about the relations between the structure and the function of the cortical network.</p>
<p>(5) Sharing the simulation tools and a &quot;large subvolume of the model&quot; is appreciated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and are pleased they appreciated these aspects of the work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A substantial part of this paper - the first few figures - focuses on single-cell and single-synapse properties, with high similarity to what was shown in Markram et al., 2015. Details may differ, but overall it is quite similar.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this useful comment and agree that it is important to better highlight the incremental improvements to the model’s low-level physiology. The validity of any model can continuously be improved at all spatial scales and the validity of emergent network activity increases with improved validity at lower levels. For this reason, we felt it was valuable to improve the low-level physiology of the model.</p>
<p>Regarding neuron physiology, we have added the following in Section 2.1 on page 5:</p>
<p>“2.1 Improved modeling and validation of neuron physiology</p>
<p>Similarly to Markram et al. (2015), electrical properties of single neurons were modelled by optimizing ion channel densities in specific compartment-types (soma, axon initial segment (AIS), basal dendrite, and apical dendrite) (Figure 2B) using an evolutionary algorithm (IBEA; Van Geit et al., 2016) so that each neuron recreates electrical features of its corresponding electrical type (e-type) under multiple standardized protocols. Compared to Markram et al. (2015), electrical models were optimized and validated using 1) additional in vitro data, features and protocols, 2) ion channel and electrophysiological data corrected for the liquid junction potential, and 3) stochastic channels (StochKv3) now including inactivation profiles. The methodology and resulting electrical models are described in Reva et al. (2023) (see Methods), and generated quantitatively more accurate electrical activity, including improved attenuation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and back-propagating action potentials.”</p>
<p>And page 8:</p>
<p>“The new neuron models saw a 5-fold improvement in generalizability compared to Markram et al. (2015) (Reva et al., 2023).”</p>
<p>We have also made the descriptions of the improvements to synaptic physiology more explicit in Section 2.2 on page 9:</p>
<p>“2.2 Improved modeling and validation of synaptic physiology</p>
<p>The biological realism of synaptic physiology was improved relative to Markram et al. (2015) using additional data sources and by extending the stochastic version of the Tsodyks-Markram model (Tsodyks and Markram, 1997; Markram et al., 1998; Fuhrmann et al., 2002; Loebel et al., 2009) to feature multi-vesicular release, which in turn improved the accuracy of the coefficient of variations (CV; std/mean) of postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) as described in Barros-Zulaica et al. (2019) and Ecker et al. (2020). The model assumes a pool of available vesicles that is utilized by a presynaptic action potential, with a release probability dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]o; Ohana and Sakmann, 1998; Rozov et al., 2001; Borst, 2010). Additionally, single vesicles spontaneously release as an additional source of variability with a low frequency (with improved calibration relative to Markram et al. (2015)). The utilization of vesicles leads to a postsynaptic conductance with bi-exponential kinetics. Short-term plasticity (STP) dynamics in response to sustained presynaptic activation are either facilitating (E1/I1), depressing (E2/I2), or pseudo-linear (I3). E synaptic currents consist of both AMPA and NMDA components, whilst I currents consist of a single GABAA component, except for neurogliaform cells, whose synapses also feature a slow GABAB component. The NMDA component of E synaptic currents depends on the state of the Mg2+ block (Jahr and Stevens, 1990), with the improved fitting of parameters to cortical recordings from Vargas-Caballero and Robinson (2003) by Chindemi et al. (2022).”</p>

<p>(2) Although the paper is about the model of the whole non-barrel somatosensory cortex, out of all figures, only one deals with simulations of the whole non-barrel somatosensory cortex. Most figures focus on simulations that involve one or a few &quot;microcolumns&quot;. Again, it is rather similar to what was done by Markram et al., 2015 and constitutes relatively incremental progress.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have added the following text to the Discussion on page 33 to explain our rationale:</p>
<p>“In keeping with the philosophy of compartmentalization of parameters and continuous model refinement (see Introduction), it was essential to improve validity at the columnar scale (relative to Markram et al. (2015)) as part of demonstrating validity of the full nbS1. Indeed, improved parametrization and validation at smaller scales was essential to parameterizing background input which generated robust nbS1 activity within realistic [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> and firing rate ranges. We view this as a major achievement, as it was unknown whether the model would achieve a stable and meaningful regime at the start of our investigation. Whilst we would have liked to go further, our primary goal was to publish a well characterized model as an open resource that others could use to undertake further in-depth studies. In this regard, we are pleased that the parametrization of the nbS1 model has already been used to study EEG signals (Tharayil et al., 2024), as well as propagation of activity between two subregions (Bolaños-Puchet and Reimann, 2024).”</p>
<p>We also make it clearer in the Introduction on page 4 that the improved validation of the emergent columnar regime was essential to stable activity at the larger scale:</p>
<p>“These initial validations demonstrated that the model was in a more accurate regime compared to Markram et al. (2015) – an essential step before testing more complex or larger-scale validations. For example, under the same parameterization we then observed selective propagation of stimulus-evoked activity to downstream areas, and…”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) With a model like this, one has an opportunity to investigate computations and interactions across an extensive cortical network in an in vivo-like context. However, the simulations presented are not addressing realistic specific situations corresponding to animals performing a task or perceiving a relevant somatosensory stimulus. This makes the insights into the roles of cell types or connectivity architecture less interesting, as they are presented for relatively abstract situations. It is hard to see their relationship to important questions that the community would be excited about - theoretical concepts like predictive coding, biophysical mechanisms like dendritic nonlinearities, or circuit properties like feedforward, lateral, and feedback processing across interacting cortical areas. In other words, what do we learn from this work conceptually, especially, about the whole non-barrel somatosensory cortex?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that it would be very interesting to explore such topics. In the Introduction on page 4, we have updated the list of papers which have so far used the model for more in depth studies:</p>
<p>“…propagation of activity between cortical areas (Bolaños-Puchet and Reimann, 2024) the role of non-random connectivity motifs on network activity (Pokorny et al., 2024) and reliability (Egas Santander et al., 2024), the composition of high-level electrical signals such as the EEG (Tharayil et al., 2024), and how spike sorting biases population codes (Laquitaine et al., 2024).”</p>
<p>In the Discussion on page 33 we also add our additional thoughts on this topic:</p>
<p>“Whilst we would have liked to go further, our primary goal was to publish a well characterized model as an open resource that others could use to undertake further in-depth studies. In this regard, we are pleased that the parametrization of the nbS1 model has already been used to study EEG signals (Tharayil et al., 2024), as well as propagation of activity between two subregions (Bolaños-Puchet and Reimann, 2024). Investigation, improvement and validation must be continued at all spatial scales in follow up papers with detailed description, figures and analysis, which cannot be covered in this manuscript. Each new study increases the scope and validity of future investigations. In this way, this model and paper act as a stepping stone towards more complex questions of interest to the community such as perception, task performance, predictive coding and dendritic processing. This was similar for Markram et al. (2015) where the initial paper was followed by more detailed studies. Unlike the Markram et al. (2015) model, the new model can also be exploited by the community and has already been used in a number of follow up papers studying (Ecker et al., 2024a,b; Bolaños-Puchet and Reimann, 2024; Pokorny et al., 2024; Egas Santander et al., 2024; Tharayil et al., 2024; Laquitaine et al., 2024). We believe that the number of use cases for such a general model is vast, and is made larger by the increased size of the model.”</p>

<p>(4) Most comparisons with in vivo-like activity are done using experimental data for whisker deflection (plus some from the visual stimulation in V1). But this model is for the non-barrel somatosensory cortex, so exactly the part of the cortex that has less to do with whiskers (or vision). Is it not possible to find any in vivo neural activity data from the non-barrel cortex?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a weakness. We have expanded our discussion of the need to mix data sources to also consider our view for network level activity:</p>
<p>“This paper and its companion paper serve to present a methodology for modeling micro- and mesoscale anatomy and physiology, which can be applied for other cortical regions and species. With the rapid increase in openly available data, efforts are already in progress to build models of mouse brain regions with reduced reliance on data mixing thanks to much larger quantities of available atlas-based data. This also includes data for the validation of emergent network level activity. Here we chose to compare network-level activity to data mostly from the barrel cortex, as well as a single study from primary visual cortex. Whilst a lot of the data used to build the model was from the barrel cortex, the barrel cortex also represents a very well characterized model of cortical processing for simple and controlled sensory stimuli. The initial comparison of population-wise responses in response to accurate thalamic input for single whisker deflections was essential to demonstrating that the model was closer to in vivo, and we were unaware of similar data for nonbarrel somatosensory regions. Moreover, our optogenetic &amp; lesion study demonstrated the capacity to compare and extend studies of canonical cortical processing in the whisker system.”</p>

<p>(5) The authors almost do not show raw spike rasters or firing rates. I am sure most readers would want to decide for themselves whether the model makes sense, and for that, the first thing to do is to look at raster plots and distributions of firing rates. Instead, the authors show comparisons with in vivo data using highly processed, normalized metrics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that better visualizations of the network activity under different conditions is essential for helping the reader assess the work. In addition to raster plots in Video 1, Video 3, Fig 6, Fig 5C, Fig S9a, S16a, we have additionally:</p>
<p>a) Changed the histograms of spontaneous activity in Fig 4G on page 13 to raster plots for the seven column subvolume for two contrasting meta-parameter regimes.</p>
<p>b) Added 4 new videos (Video 6a,b and 8a,b) showing all spontaneous and evoked meta-parameter combinations in hex0 and hex39 of the nbS1:</p>
<p>We have added improved plots showing the distributions of firing rates in the seven column subvolume on page 74:</p>
<p>With more detailed consideration in the Results on page 15:</p>
<p>“Long-tailed population firing rate distributions with means ∼ 1Hz</p>
<p>To study the firing rate distributions of different subpopulations and m-types, we ran 50s simulations for the meta-parameter combinations: [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>: 1.05mM, <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic>: 0.4,<italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic>: 0.3, 0.7 (Figure S4). Different subpopulations showed different sparsity levels (proportion of neurons spiking at least once) ranging from 6.6 to 42.5%. Wohrer et al. (2013) considered in detail the biases and challenges in obtaining ground truth firing rate distributions in vivo, and discuss the wide heterogeneity of reports in different modalities using different recording techniques. They conclude that most evidence points towards longtailed distributions with peaks just below 1Hz. We confirmed that spontaneous firing rate distributions were long-tailed (approximately lognormally distributed) with means on the order of 1Hz for most subpopulations. Importantly the layer-wise means were just below 1Hz in all layers for the <italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic> = 0.3 meta-parameter combination. Moreover, our recent work applying spike sorting to extracellular activity using this meta-parameter combination found spike sorted firing rate distributions to be lognormally distributed and very similar to in vivo distributions obtained using the same probe geometry and spike sorter (Laquitaine et al., 2024).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) While the authors claim that their model with one set of parameters reproduces many experimentally established metrics, that is not entirely what one finds. Instead, they provide different levels of overall stimulation to their model (adjusting the target &quot;P_FR&quot; parameter, with values from 0 to 1, and other parameters), and that influences results. If I get this right (the figures could really be improved with better organization and labeling), simulations with<italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic> closer to 1 provide more realistic firing rate levels for a few different cases, however, <italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic> of 0.3 and possibly above tends to cause highly synchronized activity - what the authors call bursting, but which also could be called epileptic-like activity in the network.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We can now see that the motivation for <italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic> parameter was introduced very briefly in the results and that the results of the calibration and analysis of the spontaneous activity regime are not interpreted in relation to this parameter.</p>
<p>To address this, we have given more detail where it is first introduced in the Results on page 12:</p>
<p>“to account for uncertainty in the firing rate bias during spontaneous activity from extracellular spike sorted recordings…”</p>
<p>We then reconsider that it represents an unknown bias when interpreting the calibration and spontaneous activity results on page 15:</p>
<p>“We reemphasize that the [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic>, <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic> meta-parameters account for uncertainty of in vivo extracellular calcium concentration, the nature of inputs from other brain regions and the bias of extracellularly recorded firing rates. Whilst estimates for [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> are between 1.0 - 1.1mM (Jones and Keep, 1988; Massimini and Amzica, 2001; Amzica et al., 2002; Gonzalez et al., 2022) and estimates for PFR are in the range of 0.1 - 0.3 (Olshausen and Field, 2006), combinations of these parameters supporting in vivo-like stimulus responses in later sections will offer a prediction for the true values of these parameters. Both these later results and our recent analysis of spike sorting bias using this model (Laquitaine et al., 2024) predict a spike sorting bias corresponding to <italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic> ∼ 0.3, confirming the prediction of Olshausen and Field (2006).”</p>
<p>And in relation to the stimulus evoked responses on page 17:</p>
<p>“Specifically, simulations with PFR from 0.1 to 0.5 robustly support realistic stimulus responses, with the middle of this range (0.3) corresponding with estimates of in vivo recording bias; both the previous estimates of Olshausen and Field (2006) and from a spike sorting study using this model (Laquitaine et al., 2024).”</p>
<p>Following these considerations, the remainder of the experiments using the seven column subvolume only use a single meta-parameter on page 19.</p>
<p>For the full nbS1 we further discuss the importance of a P_FR value between 0.1 and 0.3 in the Results on page 26:</p>
<p>“Stable spontaneous activity only emerges in nbS1 at predicted in vivo firing rates</p>
<p>After calibrating the model of extrinsic synaptic input for the seven column subvolume, we tested to what degree the calibration generalizes to the entire nbS1. Notably, this included the addition of mid-range connectivity (Reimann et al., 2024). The total number of local and mid-range synapses in the model was 9138 billion and 4075 billion, i.e., on average full model simulations increased the number of intrinsic synapses onto a neuron by 45%. Particularly, we ran simulations for <italic>P<sub>FR</sub>&lt;/i ∈ [0.1, 0.15, ..., 0.3] using the OU parameters calibrated for the seven column subvolume for [<italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>o</sub></italic> = 1.05mM and <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic> = 0.4. Each of these full nbS1 simulations produced stable non-bursting activity (Figure 8A), except for the simulation for <italic>P<sub>FR</sub>&lt;/i = 0.3, which produced network-wide bursting activity (Video 6). Activity levels in the simulations of spontaneous activity were heterogeneous (Figure 8B, Video 7). In some areas, firing rates were equal to the target <italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic>, whilst in others they increased above the target (Figure 8C). In the more active regions, mean firing rates (averaged over layers) were on the order of 30-35% of the in vivo references for the maximum non-bursting <italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic> simulation (target <italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic> : 0.25). This range of firing rates again fits with the estimate of firing rate bias from our paper studying spike sorting bias (Laquitaine et al., 2024) and the meta-parameter range supporting realistic stimulus responses in the seven column subvolume. This also predicts that the nbS1 cannot sustain higher firing rates without entering a bursting regime.</italic></italic></p>
<p>Finally, we also added to our discussion of biases in extracellular firing rates in the Discussion on page 32:</p>
<p>“This is also inline with our recent work using the model, which estimated a spike sorting bias corresponding to PFR = 0.3 using virtual extracellular electrodes (Laquitaine et al., 2024).”</p>
<p>We also thank the reviewer for pointing out that we did not define the term “bursting” in the main text. We have added the following definition and discussion in the Results on page 15:</p>
<p>“Note that the most correlated meta-parameter combination [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>: 1.1mM, <italic>R<sub>OU</sub></italic>: 0.2, <italic>P<sub>FR</sub></italic>: 1.0 produced network-wide “bursting” activity, which we define as highly synchronous all or nothing events (Video 1). Such activity, which may be characteristic of epileptic activity, can be studied with the model but is not the focus of this study.”</p>
<p>(7) The authors mention that the model is available online, but the &quot;Resource availability&quot; section does not describe that in substantial detail. As they mention in the Abstract, it is only a subvolume that is available. That might be fine, but more detail in appropriate parts of the paper would be useful.</p>
<p>Firstly, we are pleased to say that the full nbS1 model is now available to download, in addition to the seven hexagon subvolume. In the manuscript, we have:</p>
<p>a) Added to the Introduction at the bottom of page 4:</p>
<p>“To provide a framework for further studies and integration of experimental data, the full model is made available with simulation tools, as well as a smaller subvolume with the optional new connectome capturing inhibitory targeting rules from electron microscopy”.</p>
<p>b) Updated the open source panel of Figure 1:</p>
<p>Secondly, we thank the reviewer for noticing that the description of the available model is not well described in the “Resource availability” statement and have addressed this by:</p>
<p>a) Adding the following to the “Resource availability” statement on page 36:</p>
<p>“Both the full nbS1 model and smaller seven hexagon subvolume are available on Harvard Dataverse and Zenodo respectively in SONATA format (Dai et al., 2020) with simulation code. DOIs are listed under the heading ``Final simulatable models'' in the Key resources table. An additional link is provided to the SM-Connectome with instructions on how to use it with the seven hexagon subvolume model.”</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper is a companion to Reimann et al. (2022), presenting a large-scale, data-driven, biophysically detailed model of the non-barrel primary somatosensory cortex (nbS1). To achieve this unprecedented scale of a bottom-up model, approximately 140 times larger than the previous model (Markram et al., 2015), they developed new methods to account for inputs from missing brain areas, among other improvements. Isbister et al. focus on detailing these methodological advancements and describing the model's ability to reproduce in vivo-like spontaneous, stimulus-evoked, and optogenetically modified activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The model generated a series of predictions that are currently impossible in vivo, as summarized in Table S1. Additionally, the tools used in this study are made available online, fostering community-based exploration. Together with the companion paper, this study makes significant contributions by detailing the model's constraints, validations, and potential caveats, which are likely to serve as a basis for advancing further research in this area.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments, and are pleased they appreciate these aspects of the work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>That said, I have several suggestions to improve clarity and strengthen the validation of the model's in vivo relevance.</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) For the stimulus-response simulations, the authors should also reference, analyze, and compare data from O'Connor et al. (2010; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20869600/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20869600/</ext-link>) and Yu et al .(2016; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27749825/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27749825/</ext-link>) in addition to Yu et al. 2019, which is the only data source the authors consider for an awake response. The authors mentioned bias in spike rate measurements, but O'Connor et al. used cell-attached recordings, which do not suffer from activity-based selection bias (in addition, they also performed Ca2+ imaging of L2/3). This was done in the exact same task as Yu et al., 2019, and they recorded from over 100 neurons across layers. Combining this data with Yu et al., 2019 would provide a comprehensive view of activity across layers and inhibitory cell types. Additionally, Yu et al. (2016) recorded VPM neurons in the same task, alongside whole-cell recordings in L4, showing that L4 PV neurons filter movement-related signals encoded in thalamocortical inputs during active touch. This dataset is more suitable for extracting VPM activity, as it was collected under the same behavior and from the same species (Unlike Diamond et al., 1992, which used anesthetized rats). Furthermore, this filtering is an interesting computation performed by the network the authors modeled. The validation would be significantly strengthened and more biologically interesting if the authors could also reproduce the filtering properties, membrane potential dynamics, and variability in the encoding of touch across neurons, not just the latency (which is likely largely determined by the distance and number of synapses).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these very useful studies. We have taken on board this suggestion for a future model of the mouse barrel cortex.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors mention that in the model, the response of the main activated downstream area was confined to L6. Is this consistent with in vivo observations? Additionally, is there any in vivo characterization of the distance dependence of spiking correlation to validate Figure 8I?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not aware of data confirming the propagation of activity to downstream areas being confined to layer 6 but have considered the connectivity further between these two regions on page 27, as well as studying this further in follow up work:</p>
<p>“Stable propagation of evoked activity through mid-range connectivity only emerges in nbS1 at predicted in vivo firing rates</p>
<p>We repeated the previous single whisker deflection evoked activity experiment in the full model, providing a synchronous thalamic input into the forelimb sub-region (S1FL; Figure 8E; Video 8 &amp; 9). Responses in S1FL were remarkably similar to the ones in the seven column subvolume, including the delays and decays of activity (Figure 8F). However, in addition to a localized primary response in S1FL within 350μm of the stimulus, we found several secondary responses at distal locations (Figure 8E; Video 9), which was suggestive of selective propagation of the stimulus-evoked signal to downstream areas efferently connected by mid-range connectivity. The response of the main activated downstream area (visible in Figure 8E) was confined to L6 (Figure 8G). In a follow up study using the model to explore the propagation of activity between cortical regions (Bolaños-Puchet and Reimann, 2024), it is described how the model contains both a feedforward projection pattern, which projects to principally to synapses in L1 &amp; L23, and a feedback type pattern, which principally projects to synapses in L1 &amp; L6. On visualizing the innervation profile from the stimulated hexagon to the downstream hexagon we can see that we have stimulated a feedback pathway (Figure S16)”</p>
<p>With referenced Figure S16 on page 85:</p>
<p>We did find in vivo evidence of similar layer-wise and distance dependence of correlations in the somatosensory cortex discussed on page 27 of the Results:</p>
<p>“The distance dependence of correlations followed a similar profile to that observed in a dataset characterizing spontaneous activity in the somatosensory cortex (Reyes-Puerta et al., 2015a) (compare red line in Figure 8I with Figure S16). In the in vivo dataset spiking correlation was also low but highest in lower layers, with short “up-states” in spiking activity constrained to L5 &amp; 6 (see Figure 1E,F in (Reyes-Puerta et al., 2015a)). In the model, they are constrained to L6.”</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Across the figures, activity is averaged across neurons within layers and E or I cell types, with a limited description of single-cell type and single-cell responses. Were there any predictions regarding the responses of particular cell types that significantly differ from others in the same layer? Such predictions could be valuable for future investigations and could showcase the advantages of a data-driven, biophysically detailed model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the review for this comment. In addition to new analyses at higher granularity addressed in other comments, we have added the following comparison of stimulus-evoked membrane potential dynamics in different subpopulations for the original connectome and SM-connectome in Figure 7 on page 24.</p>
<p>This gave interesting results discussed in a new subsection on page 26:</p>
<p>“EM targeting trends hyperpolarize Sst+ and HT3aR+ late response, and disinhibit L5/6 E</p>
<p>Studying somatic membrane potentials for different subpopulations in response to whisker deflections shows that PV+, L23E and L4E subpopulations are largely unaffected in the SM-connectome (Figure 7E). Interestingly, Sst+ and 5HT3aR+ subpopulations show a strong hyperpolarization in the late response that isn’t present in the original connectome. Interestingly, this corresponds with a stronger late response in L5/6 E populations, which could be caused by disinhibition due to the Sst+ and 5HT3aR+ hyperpolarization. This could be explored further in follow up studies using our connectome manipulator tool (Pokorny et al., 2024).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) 2.4: Are there caveats to assuming the OU process as a model for missing inputs? Inputs to the cortex are usually correlated and low-dimensional (i.e., communication subspace between cortical regions), but the OU process assumes independent conductance injection. Can (weakly) correlated inputs give rise to different activity regimes in the model? Can you add a discussion on this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that there are caveats to assuming an OU process for the model of missing inputs and have added the following to the Discussion on page 31:</p>
<p>“The calibration framework could optimize per population parameters for other compensation methods, whilst still offering an interpretable spectrum of firing rate regimes at different levels of P<sub>FR</sub>. For example, more realistic compensation schemes could be explored which introduce a) correlations between the inputs received by different neurons and b) compensation distributed across dendrites, as well as at the soma. We predict that such changes would make spontaneous activity more correlated at the lower spontaneous firing rates which supported in vivo like responses (P<sub>FR</sub> : 0.1 − 0.5), which would in turn make stimulus-responses more noise correlated.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) 2.6: The network structure is well characterized in the companion paper, where the authors report that correlations in higher dimensions were driven by a small number of neurons with high participation ratios. It would be interesting to identify which cell types exhibit high node participation in high-dimensional simplices and examine the spiking activity of cells within these motifs. This could generate testable predictions and inform theoretical cell-type-specific point neuron models for excitatory/inhibitory balanced networks and cortical processing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added two supplementary figures to address this suggestion, which are discussed in the Results on Page 16:</p>
<p>“Additionally, we studied the structural effect on the firing rate (here measured as the inverse of the inter-spike interval, ISI, which can be thought of as a proxy of non-zero firing rate). We found that for the connected circuit, the firing rate increases with simplex dimension; in contrast with the disconnected circuit, where this relationship remains flat (see Figure S6 red vs. blue curves and Methods).</p>
<p>This also demonstrates high variability between neurons, in line with biology, both structurally (Towlson et al., 2013; Nigam et al., 2016) and functionally (Wohrer et al., 2013; Buzs´aki and Mizuseki, 2014). We next identified the cell types that are overexpressed in the group of neurons that have the 5% highest values of node participation across dimensions (Figure S7). This could inform theoretical point neuron models with cell-type specificity, for example. We found that while in dimension one (i.e., node degree) this consists mostly of inhibitory cells, in higher dimensions the cell types concentrate in layers 4, 5 and 6, especially for TPC neurons. This is in line with our structural layer-wise findings in Figure 8B in Reimann et al. (2024).”</p>
<p>Which reference new Figures S6 and S7:</p>
<p>With the methodology for S6 described on page 49 of the Methods:</p>
<p>“For any numeric property of neurons, e.g., firing rate, we evaluate the effect of dimension on it by taking weighted averages across dimensions. That is for each dimension k, we take the weighted average of the property across neurons where the weights are given by node participation on dimension k. More precisely, let N be the number of neurons and −→V ∈ RN, be a vector of a property on all the neurons e.g., the vector of firing rates. Then in each dimension k we compute</p>

<p>Where <inline-formula id="sa2equ2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-99693-sa2-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> is the vector of node participation on dimension k for all neurons and ・ is the dot product.</p>
<p>To measure the over and underexpression of the different m-types among those with the highest 5% of values of node participation, we used the hypergeometric distribution to determine the expected distribution of m-types in a random sample of the same size. More precisely, for each dimension k and m-type m, let N<sub>total</sub> be the total number of neurons in the circuit, Nm be the number of neurons of m-type m in the circuit, Ctop be the number of neurons with the highest 5% values of node participation in dimension k, Cm the number of neurons of mtype m among these, and let <italic>P = hypergeom(N<sub>total&lt;/sub&lt;,N<sub>m</sub>,C<sub>top</sub>)</sub></italic> be the hypergeometric distribution.</p>

<p>Minor:</p>
<p>(1) Since the previous model was published in 2015, the neuroscience field has seen significant advancements in single-cell and single-nucleus sequencing, leading to the clustering of transcriptomic cell types in the entire mouse brain. For instance, the Allen Institute has identified ~10 distinct glutamatergic cell types in layer 5, which exceeds the number incorporated into the current model. Could you discuss 1) the relationship between the modeled me-types and these transcriptomic cell types, and 2) how future models will evolve to integrate this new information? If there are gaps in knowledge in order to incorporate some transcriptome cell types into your model, it would be helpful to highlight them so that efforts can be directed toward addressing these areas.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, particularly the idea to describe what types of data would be valuable towards improving the model in future. We have added the following to the Discussion on page 33:</p>
<p>“In our previous work (Roussel et al., 2023) we linked mouse inhibitory me-models to transcriptomic types (t-types) in a whole mouse cortex transcriptomic dataset (Gouwens et al., 2019). This can provide a direct correspondence in future large-scale mouse models. As we model only a single electrical type for pyramidal cells there is no one-to-one correspondence between our me-models and the 10 different pyramidal cell types identified there. We are not currently aware of any method which can recreate the electrical features of different types of pyramidal cells using only generic ion channel models. To achieve the firing pattern behavior of more specific electrical types, usually ion channel kinetics are tweaked, and this would violate the compartmentalization of parameters. In future we hope to build morpho-electric-transcriptomic type (met-type) models by selecting gene-specific ion channel models (Ranjan et al., 2019, 2024) based on the met-type’s gene expression. Data specific to different neuron sections (i.e. soma, AIS, apical/basel dendrites) of different met-types, such as gene expression, distribution of ion channels, and voltage recordings under standard single cell protocols would be particularly useful.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) For the optogenetic manipulation, it would be interesting if the model could reproduce the paradoxical effects (for example, Mahrach et al. reported paradoxical effects caused by PV manipulation in S1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31951197/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31951197/</ext-link>). This seems a more relevant and non-trivial network phenomenon than the V1 manipulation the authors attempted to replicate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable idea. Indeed, our model is able to reproduce paradoxical effects under certain conditions. We added the following new supplementary Figure S12 demonstrating this finding (black arrows).</p>
<p>Which we discuss in the Results on page 22:</p>
<p>“However, at high contrasts, we observed a paradoxical effect of the optogenetic stimulation on L6 PV+ neurons, reducing their activity with increasing stimulation strength (Figure S12B; cf. Mahrach et al. (2020)). This effect did not occur under grey screen conditions (i.e., at contrast 0.0) with a constant background firing rate of 0.2 Hz or 5 Hz respectively (not shown). The individual…”</p>
<p>and added to the Discussion on page 32:</p>
<p>“Also, we predicted a paradoxical effect of optogenetic stimulation on L6 PV+ interneurons, namely a decrease in firing with increased stimulus strength. This is reminiscent of the paradoxical responses found by Mahrach et al. (2020) in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (in L5, but not in L2/3) and barrel cortex (no layer distinction) respectively. While Mahrach et al. (2020) conducted their recordings in awake mice not engaged in any behavior, we observed this effect only when drifting grating patterns with high contrast were presented. Nevertheless, consistent with their findings, we found the effect only in deep but not in superficial layers, and only for PV+ interneurons but not for PCs. Our model could therefore be used to improve the understanding of this paradoxical effect in follow up studies. These examples demonstrate that the approach of modeling entire brain regions can be used to further probe the topics of the original articles and cortical processing.”</p>

<p>(3) Figure 4F is important, but the legend is unclear. What is the unit on the x-axis? The values seem too large to represent per-neuron measurements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you to the reviewer for raising this. Indeed the values are estimated mean numbers of missing number synapses per neuron by population. Such numbers are difficult to estimate but we have further discussed our rationale, justification and consideration of whether these numbers are accurate in the Results, as follows:</p>
<p>“Heterogeneity in synaptic density within and across neuron classes and sections makes estimating the number of missing synapses challenging (DeFelipe and Fariñas, 1992). Changing the assumed synaptic density value of 1.1 synapses/μm would only change the slope of the relationship, however. Estimates of mean number of existing and missing synapses per population were within reasonable ranges; even the larger estimate for L5 E (due to higher dendritic length; Figure S3) was within biological estimates of 13,000 ± 3,500 total afferent synapses (DeFelipe and Fariñas, 1992).”</p>
<p>This text references the new supplementary Figure S3:</p>
<p>Moreover, these numbers represent the number of synapses, rather than the number of connections. The number of connections is usually used for quantifications such as indegree, and are usually much lower.</p>

<p>(4) Including additional subsections or improving the indexing in the Results section could be beneficial. In its current format, it's difficult to distinguish where the model description ends and where the validation begins. Some readers may want to focus more on the validation than other parts, so clearer segmentation would improve readability.</p>

<p>(5) P4. 2nd paragraph. Original vs rewired connectome. The term &quot;rewired connectome&quot; may give the impression that it refers to an artificial manipulation rather than a modification based on the latest data. It might be helpful to use a different term (e.g., SM-connectome as described later in the paper?).</p>

<p>We have adjusted the text in the introduction:</p>
<p>“Additionally, we generated a new connectome which captured recently characterized spatially-specific targeting rules for different inhibitory neuron types (Schneider-Mizell et al., 2023) in the MICrONS electron microscopy dataset (MICrONS-Consortium et al., 2021), such as increased perisomatic targeting by PV+ neurons, and increased targeting of inhibitory populations by VIP+ neurons. Comparing activity to the original connectome gave predictions about the role of these additional targeting rules.”</p>

<p>(6) Figures 7 B, C, D: what is v1/v2? Original vs SM-Connectome?</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this and have corrected the figure to use “Orig” and “SM” consistent with the rest of the figure.</p>

<p>(7) Page 23, 2.10: what is phi?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this inconsistency with the earlier text, and have updated the text to read: “Particularly, we ran simulations for PF R ∈ [0.1, 0.15, ..., 0.3] using the OU para-maters calibrated for the seven column subvolume for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] = 1.05 mM and R<sub>OU</sub> = 0.4.”</p>
