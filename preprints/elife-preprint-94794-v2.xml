<title>Abstract</title><p>Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the cardiac aging phenotype and its susceptibility to injury are far from being fully understood. Although previous literature reports a role of the mitochondrial enzyme arginase-II (Arg-II) in development of heart failure, contradictory results are reported and no systematic analysis of cellular expression and localization of Arg-II in the heart has been performed. Whether and how Arg-II participates in cardiac aging are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate, to our surprise, that Arg-II is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and human patients, but upregulated in non-myocytes of the aging heart, including macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <italic>arg-ii</italic> (<italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that Arg-II mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the above-described cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, Arg-II enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aging is a predominant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Moturi et al., 2022</xref>). Cardiac aging is accompanied by low-grade chronic inflammation termed “inflammaging” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cevenini et al., 2013</xref>), which is linked to gradual development of cardiac fibrosis and heart failure, whereby macrophages, cardiac fibroblasts, and endothelial cells play critical roles in age-associated cardiac remodeling and dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdellatif et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Meschiari et al., 2017</xref>). Studies in experimental animal models and in humans provide evidence demonstrating that aging heart is more vulnerable to stressors such as ischemia/reperfusion injury and myocardial infarction and exhibits less efficient reparative capability after injury as compared to the heart of young individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bujak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mariani et al., 2000</xref>). Even in the heart of apparently healthy individuals of old age, chronic inflammation, cardiomyocyte senescence, cell apoptosis, interstitial/perivascular tissue fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction and endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and cardiac dysfunction either with preserved or reduced ejection fraction rate are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdellatif et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Ruiz-Meana et al., 2020</xref>). Despite the intensive investigation in the past, the underlying causative cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the cardiac aging phenotype and the susceptibility of aging heart to injurious stressors are not fully elucidated, yet. Moreover, most preclinical studies preferentially use relatively juvenile animal models which hardly recapitulate clinical scenario. It is therefore critical to investigate mechanisms of cardiac aging phenotype with a naturally advanced aging animal model.</p>
<p>Research in the past years suggests a wide range of functions of the enzyme arginase, including the cytosolic isoenzyme arginase-I (Arg-I) and the mitochondrial isoenzyme arginase-II (Arg-II) in organismal aging as well as age-related organ structural remodeling and functional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Caldwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2022</xref>). These functions of arginase have been implicated in cardiac and vascular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Xiong, Yepuri, Montani, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yepuri et al., 2012</xref>) and cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jung et al., 2010</xref>). Arg-I, originally found in hepatocytes, plays a crucial role in urea cycle in the liver to remove ammonia from the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sin et al., 2015</xref>), whereas Arg-II is inducible in many cell types under pathological conditions, contributing to chronic tissue inflammation and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Moretto et al., 2019</xref>). Both enzymes are able to catalyze the divalent cation-dependent hydrolysis of L-arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ming et al., 2013</xref>). Studies in the literature including our own, demonstrate that Arg-II is involved in aging process, and promotes organ inflammation and fibrosis and inhibition of arginase or genetic ablation of <italic>arg-ii</italic> slows down aging process and protects against age-associated organ degeneration such as lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>), pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Xiong, Yepuri, Necetin, et al., 2017</xref>) and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Xiong, Yepuri, Montani, et al., 2017</xref>). However, controversial results on expression of arginase and its isoforms at the cellular levels in the heart are reported. While some studies linked Arg-I to the cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jung et al., 2010</xref>), others suggest a role of Arg-II in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heusch et al., 2010</xref>). Even protective functions of Arg-II are suggested in some studies, based on correlation of Arg-II levels with cardiac injury or systemic administration of Arg-II in rat models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, cellular localization of arginase and its isoenzyme in the heart, i.e., expression of arginase in cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes have not been systematically analyzed and confirmed. Finally, whether and how Arg-II participates in cardiac aging and whether it is through cell-autonomous and/or paracrine effects are not known.</p>
<p>Therefore, our current study is aimed to investigate which cell types in the heart express arginase and what enzymatic isoforms. How arginase and this isoenzyme in these cells influence the cardiac aging process and enhance susceptibility of the aging heart to ischemia/reperfusion injury.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Increased <italic>arg-ii</italic> expression in aging heart</title>
<p>In heart from young (3-4 months in age) and old (22-24 months in age) mice, an age-associated increase in <italic>arg-ii</italic> expression in both <italic>wt</italic> male and female mice are observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This age-associated increase in <italic>arg-ii</italic> expression is more pronounced in females than in males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast to <italic>arg-ii</italic>, <italic>arg-i</italic> mRNA expression is very low in the heart (with very high Ct values, data not shown), and no age-dependent changes of <italic>arg-i</italic> gene expression are observed in <italic>wt</italic> and in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice of either gender (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting a specific enhancement of Arg-II in aging heart. Further experiments are thus focused on Arg-II and female mice. We made effort to analyze Arg-II protein levels by immunoblotting in the heart tissues. However, immunoblotting is not sensitive enough to detect Arg-II protein in the heart tissue of either young or old animals. Therefore, further experiments are performed to detect Arg-II proteins at the cellular level with confocal microscopic immunofluorescence staining as described in later sections.</p>

<label>2.</label><title><italic>Arg-ii</italic> ablation reduces cardiac aging phenotype</title>
<p>Next we investigated the impact of <italic>arg-ii</italic> ablation on cardiac phenotype. Masson’s staining reveals an enhanced peri-vascular and interstitial fibrosis in <italic>wt</italic> old mice, which is mitigated in age-matched <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The age-associated increase in cardiac fibrosis and its inhibition by <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> are further confirmed by quantitative measurements of collagen content as assayed by determination of hydroxyproline levels in the heart tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The increased cardiac fibrosis in aging is however, associated with decreased mRNA levels of <italic>collagen-Iα</italic> (<italic>col-Iα</italic>) and <italic>collagen-IIIα</italic> (<italic>col-IIIα</italic>), the major isoforms of pre-collagen in the heart (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

The results demonstrate that age-associated cardiac fibrosis and prevention in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice is due to alterations of translational and/or post-translational regulations including collagen synthesis and/or degradation. Furthermore, an increased density of fibroblasts as characterized by positive staining of PDGF-Rα is observed in <italic>wt</italic> old mice, but not in age-matched <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Interestingly, an age-associated increase in p16<sup>ink4</sup> positive senescent cells in <italic>wt</italic> mouse heart is prevented in the <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>).</p>

<p>Moreover, a significant increase in macrophage marker <italic>f4/80</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and elevated gene expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines such as <italic>mcp1</italic>, <italic>il-1β</italic> and <italic>tnf-α</italic> are observed in aging heart of <italic>wt</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). This age-associated increase in the inflammatory markers and cytokine gene expression (except <italic>tnf-α</italic>) are overall significantly reduced or prevented in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In line with the gene expression of <italic>f4/80</italic>, immunofluorescence staining reveals an age-associated increase in the numbers of F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells in the <italic>wt</italic> mouse heart, which is reduced in the age-matched <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene ablation reduces macrophage accumulation in the aging heart. Interestingly, resident macrophages as characterized by LYVE1<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>) are predominant in the aging heart as compared to the infiltrated CCR2<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>).

<label>3.</label><title>Cellular localization of Arg-II in aging heart</title>
<p>Next, the cellular localization of Arg-II in aging heart are investigated. Since <italic>arg-ii</italic> mRNA levels are upregulated mostly in aged females, heart tissues from old female mice are used mainly for this purpose. To our surprise, confocal co-immunofluorescence staining does not show Arg-II in cardiomyocytes as evidenced by lack of Arg-II staining in troponin T<sup>+</sup>-cells, a specific cardiomyocyte marker (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Arg-II is only found in non-cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In line with this notion, Arg-II is not detectable by immunoblotting in isolated primary cardiomyocytes from old <italic>wt</italic> mice at baseline or after exposure to hypoxia (1 % O<sub>2</sub>, 24 hours, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), a well know strong stimulus for Arg-II expression in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast to cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts isolated from old <italic>wt</italic> mice express Arg-II which is up-regulated by hypoxia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The absence of <italic>arg-ii</italic> mRNA in cardiomyocytes in contrast to fibroblasts isolated from <italic>wt</italic> old mouse hearts is also confirmed with qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The absence of Arg-II in cardiomyocytes are also demonstrated in the heart of other species such as rats in which no staining could be found in the cardiomyocytes (with or without infarction) but in non-cardiomyocytes i.e., cells between myocytes and endocardial cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4B</xref>). The specificity of the antibody against Arg-II was confirmed in the old <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse kidneys in which Arg-II is constitutively expressed in the S3 proximal tubular cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4A</xref>) as demonstrated by our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Again, Arg-II staining could be only found in cells between cardiomyocytes in the old <italic>wt</italic> mouse but not in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4C</xref>). The absence of Arg-II in cardiomyocytes are also confirmed in human heart tissue biopsies (please see the results in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Moreover, Arg-II is detected in Mac-2<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), and PDGF-Rα<sup>+</sup>-fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), but not in α-SMA<sup>+</sup> vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). These results demonstrate that Arg-II in aging mouse heart is mostly expressed in non-cardiomyocytes such as macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Similar to mouse heart, in human heart (obtained from a 66-year-old woman, and a 76-year-old man with no significant cardiac pathology), Arg-II is also absent in cardiomyocytes as proved by lack of co-localization with troponin-T<sup>+</sup>-cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>), and is expressed in CD31<sup>+</sup>-endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), CD68<sup>+</sup>-macrophages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>), and vimentin<sup>+</sup>-(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>) or α-SMA<sup>+</sup>-(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>) fibroblasts/myofibroblasts.

<label>4.</label><title>Role of Arg-II in crosstalk between macrophages and cardiomyocytes through IL-1β</title>
<p>Given that age-associated cardiomyocyte apoptosis is prevented in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice despite absence of Arg-II in the cardiomyocytes, the non-cell-autonomous effects of Arg-II on cardiomyocytes are then investigated. As reported above, macrophage numbers and <italic>il-1β</italic> mRNA expression are increased in aging heart and reduced in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Both immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining confirm that IL-1β protein levels are higher in old <italic>wt</italic> heart tissues when compared to age-matched <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Furthermore, co-immunofluorescence staining reveals that IL-1β is localized in Mac2<sup>+</sup>-macrophages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Taking into account that our previous studies demonstrated a relationship of Arg-II and IL-1β in vascular disease and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>) and in age-associated organ fibrosis such as renal and pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>), and IL-1β has been shown to play a causal role in patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease as shown by CANTOS trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ridker et al., 2017</xref>), we therefore focused on the role of IL-1β in crosstalk between macrophages and cardiac cells such as cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Considering that ablation of <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene specifically reduces the number of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>), we hypothesized that Arg-II in macrophages may prime cardiomyocyte apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, splenic macrophages are isolated from young and old <italic>wt</italic> and age-matched <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, and conditioned medium from the cells are collected. Elevated Arg-II and IL-1β protein levels are observed in old <italic>wt</italic> macrophages as compared to the cells from young animals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> to <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). In line with this finding, IL-1β levels in conditioned medium from old <italic>wt</italic> mouse macrophages are higher as compared to the conditioned medium from young macrophages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>arg-ii</italic> ablation substantially reduces IL-1β levels in the macrophages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>, and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). Importantly, cardiomyocytes isolated from adult (five-months) female <italic>wt</italic> mice as bioassay cells, when incubated with conditioned medium from old (but not from young) <italic>wt</italic> macrophages for 24 hours (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>), display more apoptosis as monitored by TUNEL assay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7G</xref>). This age-associated cardiac damaging effect of macrophages is not observed with <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophage conditioned medium (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7G</xref>), suggesting a role of Arg-II expressing macrophages in mediating cardiomyocyte apoptosis in aging. To further examine whether IL-1β from macrophages is the paracrine mediator for cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the above described experiment is performed in presence of the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-Ra. Indeed, cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by the conditioned medium from old <italic>wt</italic> macrophages is abolished by IL-Ra (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7G</xref>).</p>

<p>Similar results are obtained with Raw264.7 cells, a widely used mouse macrophage model. Raw264.7 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/mL) for 24 hours, show a significant increase in both Arg-II and IL-1β, which is inhibited by silencing <italic>arg-ii</italic> (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5A</xref> to <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5C</xref>), confirming the role of Arg-II in the production of IL-1β in macrophages (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5C</xref>). In agreement with the results shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, conditioned medium from LPS-treated Raw264.7 cells significantly enhances cardiomyocyte apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL staining, which is reduced by either <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene silencing or by IL-1 receptor blocker ILRa (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5E</xref>). It is of note that that LPS alone does not induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis at the concentration tested (data not shown), confirming the role of Arg-II-mediated IL-1β release from macrophages in cardiomyocyte apoptosis.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed relationship between Arg-II and iNOS in regulation of IL-1β production in macrophages. In the human THP1 monocytes in which Arg-II but not iNOS is induced by LPS (100 ng/mL for 24 hours) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Moreover, in the mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages, LPS-induced IL-1β production is inhibited by <italic>inos</italic> deficiency (BMDM<italic><sup>inos-/-</sup></italic> vs BMDM<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

Fig. 6D</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). All together, these results suggest that Arg-II and iNOS are upregulated by LPS independently and iNOS slightly reduces Arg-II expression. Both Arg-II and iNOS are required for maximal IL-1β production upon LPS stimulation as illustrated in <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6G</xref>.</p>

<label>8.</label><title>Arg-II gene ablation reduces ischemic damage in aging heart</title>
<p>To study the specific role of Arg-II in heart ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury during aging, <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments with Langendorff-perfused heart from old <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>arg-ii</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were performed followed by cardiac functional analysis. The experimental protocol of global ischemia/reperfusion is shown in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>. Under normoxic baseline condition, the cardiac functions, i.e., dP/dt<sub>max.</sub> (maximal rate of contraction), dP/dt<sub>min.</sub> (maximal rate of relaxation) and left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) are comparable between <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>arg-ii</italic><sup>−/−</sup> old mice (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl. table 1</xref>). <italic>Arg-ii</italic> ablation improves cardiac function following I/R injury, i.e., the inotropic contractile function as measured by LVDP and dP/dt<sub>max</sub>, lusitropic dP/dt<sub>min</sub> (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>). The post I/R recovery is significantly improved in <italic>arg-ii</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice when compared to age-matched <italic>wt</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>). In addition to functional recovery, infarct size after I/R-injury was analyzed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining in old mice. Under the ischemic/reperfusion condition (20 minutes ischemia and 30 minutes reperfusion), no myocardial infarct was detected (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 8</xref>), while longer ischemia and reperfusion time (30 minutes and 45 minutes respectively) is required to induce myocardial infarct, i.e., 10.5 ± 2.9% in <italic>wt</italic> old mice, which is significantly reduced in the age-matched <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic>mice (3.2 ± 0.9%, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10C</xref> and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10D</xref>). It is to note that following ischemia/reperfusion injury, male mice display cardiac dysfunction, i.e., reduced left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), as well as the inotropic and lusitropic states (expressed as dP/dt max and dP/dt min, respectively) (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>), we also found that old male mice are more prone to I/R injury than age-matched female animals. Specifically, 15 minutes of ischemic time is enough to significantly affect the left ventricle contractile function in the male mice (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9</xref>). As opposite, age-matched old female mice are relatively resistant to I/R injury, and at least 20 min of ischemia are necessary to induce a significant impairment of the contractile function (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). Similar to females, the post I/R recovery of cardiac function is also significantly improved in the male <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice as compared to age-matched <italic>wt</italic> animals. In addition to functional recovery, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining (myocardial infarction) upon I/R-injury in males is significantly reduced in the age-matched male <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9C</xref> and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">9D</xref>). All together, these results reveal a role for Arg-II in heart function impairment during aging in both genders with a higher vulnerability in males (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have reported the presence of both Arg-I and Arg-II isoenzymes in the cardiac tissues of various animal models including feline, pig, rats, rabbit, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gonon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heusch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Steppan et al., 2006</xref>). These isoenzymes have been implicated in cardiac ischemic injury and cardiac aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Xiong, Yepuri, Montani, et al., 2017</xref>). It has been widely assumed that Arg-I and Arg-II are expressed in cardiomyocytes, where they play a role in cardiac injury via a cell-autonomous effect on the cardiomyocytes. However, the cellular localization of arginase isoforms has not been convincingly demonstrated due to the following two reasons: species-specific expression of arginase isoforms and lack of including negative controls with gene knockout samples.</p>
<p>Our current study systematically investigated the expression and cellular localization of the mitochondrial Arg-II in the heart of a natural aging mouse model and in human biopsies. We found an age-associated increase in <italic>arg-ii</italic> but not <italic>arg-i</italic> in heart of male and female mice. Data extracted from a high throughput sequencing database of male mice (no data on females are available, unfortunately) confirms our findings showing the age-dependent enhancement of <italic>arg-ii</italic> but not <italic>arg-i</italic> expression in the heart (GSE201207) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wolff et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that neither <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene expression nor its protein levels were detectable in cardiomyocytes from either young or old mice. Despite increased <italic>arg-ii</italic> mRNA (but not <italic>arg-i</italic> mRNA) expression in the aging heart, mitochondrial Arg-II was absent from cardiomyocytes. This observation aligns with previous findings in vascular endothelial cells from mice and humans, where Arg-II (not Arg-I) is the predominant isoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ming et al., 2004</xref>). It is to note that a previous study reported that Arg-II is exclusively expressed in isolated cardiomyocytes from in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Steppan et al., 2006</xref>). However, we could not confirm this finding. The reason of this discrepancy is not clear. However, we made great effort to confirm the cellular localization of Arg-II in the heart from different species including mice, rats and humans. Importantly negative controls. i.e., <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> samples are always included in our present study avoid any possible background signals. Our experiments confirm that Arg-II could be found only in non-cardiomyocytes but not in cardiomyocytes from different species. The experiments with freshly isolated primary cells also confirm that even under hypoxia, a well know strong stimulus for Arg-II protein levels in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>), no Arg-II protein expression could be detected in the cardiomyocytes but elevated in fibroblasts from old female mice. Furthermore, RT-qPCR could not detect <italic>arg-ii</italic> mRNA in cardiomyocytes but in non-cardiomyocytes. All together, these results demonstrate that Arg-II are not expressed or at negligible levels in cardiomyocytes but expressed in non-cardiomyocytes. Further experiments identified that Arg-II is expressed in macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in aged mouse heart and human cardiac biopsies. These results suggest that Arg-II exerts non-cell-autonomous effects on aging cardiomyocytes.</p>
<p>It is well known that the aging heart is associated with accumulation of senescent cells, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Vakka et al., 2023</xref>). In the current study, we observe that <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are protected from cardiac aging phenotype and reveal a decrease in apoptotic cells, particularly cardiomyocytes but also non-cardiomyocytes. Since cardiomyocytes do not express Arg-II in aging and Arg-II could not even be induced in these cells under hypoxic condition, a non-cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II on cardiomyocyte apoptosis must be involved, meaning that the increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in aging must be due to paracrine effects of other cell types such as macrophages in which Arg-II levels are elevated in aging. It is evident that crosstalk between cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes are critical in cardiac functional changes and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hulsmans et al., 2016</xref>). Substantial evidence demonstrates that immune cells, particularly, monocytes and/or macrophages, are important contributors to cardiac remodeling in aging and disease conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hulsmans et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jimenez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Under acute and chronic ischemic heart disease conditions, blood monocytes can be mobilized from bone marrow and spleen, and recruited into the injury site of the heart where they play an important role in cardiac remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Honold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Swirski et al., 2009</xref>). An increased accumulation of myeloid cells including in aging heart has been reported and contributes to cardiac inflammaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Esfahani et al., 2021</xref>). Besides infiltrated macrophages, tissue resident macrophages also contribute to cardiac inflammation and remodeling in heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Suku et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Weinberger et al., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, we demonstrate that total numbers of macrophages in the heart are significantly increased in aging heart, which is due to both enhanced accumulation of resident tissue macrophages and infiltrated macrophages and both macrophage populations are reduced in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. The enhanced infiltrated macrophages must be due to sustained cardiac injury occurring with aging in the heart accompanied with repairing process which is manifested by resident macrophage proliferation and fibroblast activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Weinberger et al., 2024</xref>). Our previous study demonstrated that Arg-II plays a role in macrophage infiltration in different organ/tissues in high-fat diet and high-cholesterol diet-induced atherosclerosis and obesity mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>). It remains to be investigated whether Arg-II regulates resident macrophage proliferation in the aging heart and what are the underlying mechanisms. Whether infiltrated macrophages can be switched to resident ones and regulated by Arg-II is also an interesting question to be investigated.</p>
<p>As shown above an increased macrophage accumulation in aging heart associates with elevated expression of numerous inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. This age-associated cardiac inflammation is inhibited in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals. Among these inflammatory cytokines, an increase in IL-1β levels in cardiac tissue and macrophages or monocytes/macrophages derived from spleen of old mice are demonstrated accompanied with elevated Arg-II levels as compared to young animals. Importantly, we showed that Arg-II in the aged macrophages enhances IL-1β expression and release mediating cardiomyocyte apoptosis, since the cardiomyocyte apoptosis caused by the aged macrophages is inhibited in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic>mice and prevented by IL-1β receptor antagonist. This results further confirm our previous findings demonstrating a pro-inflammatory role of Arg-II in macrophages in vascular atherosclerosis and high-fat-diet-induced type 2 diabetes mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>). This conclusion is also further supported by the findings with a mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. The question what are the underlying mechanisms that upregulate Arg-II levels in macrophages in aging remains to be investigated. Moreover, we also found increased apoptosis of other cell types in aging heart, which is also prevented in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic>mice. What are these cells, how this cell apoptosis is triggered, and what is the impact on age-associated cardiac vulnerability to stressors require further investigation. Moreover, research has provided evidence that cellular senescence including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and immune cells all contributes to the cardiac aging and age-associated cardiac dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Luan et al., 2024</xref>). Future research shall investigate which cell types are protected from <italic>arg-ii</italic> deficiency from senescence and what are the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>One of the interesting questions is the relationship between Arg-II and iNOS in regulation of IL-1β production in macrophages. Both iNOS and Arg-II (not Arg-I) are highly induced in macrophages in response to several pro-inflammatory stimuli such as LPS, TNFα, and IFN-γ, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bogdan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>) and considered as pro-inflammatory M1-macrophage markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Martinez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>). Since arginase and iNOS share the same metabolic substrate L-arginine, an increase in arginase levels is proposed to decrease intracellular L-arginine bioavailability for iNOS, and in turn to reduce pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chang et al., 1998</xref>). Hence, arginase including the two isoforms Arg-I and Arg-II is regarded as anti-inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Arg-I is indeed associated with M2-anti-inflammatory macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), while Arg-II (but not Arg-I) along with iNOS is enhanced in pro-inflammatory macrophages upon LPS stimulation as shown in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>) and also confirmed in our present study. Importantly, knockout or knockdown of <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene reduces IL-1β production as shown in our present study and decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in vitro and in vivo in various chronic inflammatory disease models and inflammaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atawia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">You et al., 2013</xref>). These results demonstrate that Arg-II, in contrast to Arg-I, exerts pro-inflammatory functions in macrophages. Despite controversies published in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bogdan, 2015</xref>), iNOS is generally considered to exert pro-inflammatory effects in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eslami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yao et al., 2022</xref>). This is confirmed by our present study showing that LPS-stimulated IL-1β production in murine macrophages is inhibited when <italic>inos</italic> is ablated. Since Arg-II promotes IL-1β production and Arg-II levels are increased under <italic>inos</italic>-deficiency condition, one would expect an increased IL-1β production in <italic>inos<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages. This is however not the case. A strong inhibition of IL-1β production in <italic>inos<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages is observed. These results implicate that iNOS promotes IL-1β production independently of Arg-II and the inhibiting effect of IL-1β by <italic>inos</italic> deficiency is dominant and able to counteract Arg-II’s stimulating effect on IL-1β production. On the other hand, the question whether Arg-II promotes IL-1β production through iNOS could also be excluded due to the following reasons. First, in the human THP1 cells in which Arg-II but not iNOS is induced by LPS, ablation of <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene reduces IL-1β mRNA and protein levels; second, both Arg-I and Arg-II is believed to inhibits endothelial NOS-mediated NO synthesis, <italic>arg-ii</italic> deficiency would increase L-arginine bioavailability for NOS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Durante et al., 2007</xref>). Since iNOS induction by LPS is promoting IL-1β production as demonstrated in our current study, an increase in IL-1β production by <italic>arg-ii</italic> deficiency would be expected under this condition. We observe, however, a decreased IL-1β production in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells. Hence, our results demonstrate that Arg-II promotes IL-1β production in macrophages independently of iNOS (This concept is illustrated in the <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6G</xref>). Future study shall further confirm the iNOS-independent stimulating effect on IL-1β production by Arg-II in the <italic>inos<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse model. It remains to be investigated what are the exact molecular mechanisms of IL-1β production promoted by Arg-II and iNOS in macrophages, respectively. Since IL-1β is produced and released via activation of inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agostini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cullen et al., 2015</xref>), whether Arg-II and iNOS promotes macrophage pro-inflammatory responses and IL-1β release through inflammasome activation remains to be studied.</p>
<p>Previous studies suggest that Arg-II exerts both L-arginine metabolizing-dependent and - independent (pleiotropic) effects depending on cell types. For example, in vascular smooth muscle cells in which no NOS existing, even inactive mutant of Arg-II is capable of inducing cell senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>), while in endothelial cells, eNOS-uncoupling, i.e., decreased NO and increased superoxide anion production, is dependent on the L-arginine metabolizing activity of Arg-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yepuri et al., 2012</xref>). It is understandable that endothelial dysfunction caused by enhanced Arg-II levels would reduce coronary perfusion and in turn decrease cardiac contractile function as reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Khan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). Whether Arg-II promotes inflammatory responses in macrophages through the pleiotropic effects remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>It is of note that a study reported that Arg-II is required for IL-10 mediated-inhibition of IL-1β in mouse BMDM upon LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dowling et al., 2021</xref>), which suggests an anti-inflammatory function of Arg-II. The results of our study, however, demonstrate that a pro-inflammatory effect of Arg-II in macrophages. Our findings are supported by the study from another group, which shows decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production including IL-6 and IL-1β in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic>BMDM most likely through suppression of NFκB pathway, since <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> BMDM reveals decreased activation of NFκB and IL-1β levels upon LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Uchida et al., 2023</xref>). Most importantly, our previous study also showed that re-introducing <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene back to the <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic>macrophages markedly enhances LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>), providing further evidence for a pro-inflammatory role of <italic>arg-ii</italic> under LPS stimulation. In support of this conclusion, chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>), inflammaging in lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>), kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huang et al., 2021</xref>) and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Xiong, Yepuri, Necetin, et al., 2017</xref>) of aged animals or acute organ injury such as acute ischemic/reperfusion or cisplatin-induced renal injury are reduced in the <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Uchida et al., 2023</xref>). The discrepant findings between these studies and that with IL-10 may implicate dichotomous functions of Arg-II in macrophages, depending on the experimental context or conditions. Nevertheless, our results strongly implicate a pro-inflammatory role of Arg-II in macrophages in the inflammaging in aging heart.</p>
<p>One of the important features of cardiac aging is fibrosis which is due to chronic inflammation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). There are convincing evidences demonstrating that chronic inflammation facilitates development of myocardial fibrosis in heart failure which is associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lillo et al., 2023</xref>). A crosstalk between macrophages and fibroblasts has been demonstrated to be important for cardiac fibrosis in diseased conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hartupee et al., 2016</xref>). Studies show that monocyte-derived macrophages from bone marrow and spleen are recruited in advanced age, contributing to cardiac fibrosis and myocardial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hulsmans et al., 2018</xref>). In our present study using an in vitro cellular model, we show a pivotal role of Arg-II-expressing macrophages in activation of cardiac fibroblasts in aging heart. First, Arg-II protein is present in the cardiac macrophages and enhanced in monocyte-derived macrophages in aging mice; second, conditioned medium from aged <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages exhibits decreased potential of stimulating cardiac fibroblasts to produce components that are essentially involved in fibrosis such as hydroxyproline, <italic>fibronectin, coll-IIIa,</italic> and <italic>tgfb1.</italic> Interestingly, the enhanced hydroxyproline levels stimulated by old <italic>wt</italic> mouse macrophage-derived conditioned medium is inhibited by the IL-1β receptor blocker, demonstrating a paracrine effect of IL-1β release from aged macrophages on cardiac fibroblast activation. Moreover, the age-associated cardiac fibrosis and increase in fibroblast number in the heart is prevented in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, demonstrating a crosstalk between macrophage and fibroblasts in cardiac aging.</p>
<p>The fact that cardiac fibroblasts in aging heart express elevated Arg-II, indicates a contribution of a cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II in this cell type to cardiac fibrosis in aging. This concept is confirmed by the experiments showing that overexpression of <italic>arg-ii</italic> in cardiac fibroblasts enhances vimentin levels associated with increased expression of <italic>col-IIIa</italic> and mitochondrial ROS generation. Importantly, inhibition of mitochondrial ROS by TEMPO abolished the effect of <italic>arg-ii</italic> overexpression in the fibroblasts, demonstrating that Arg-II exerts its cell-autonomous stimulating effects in fibroblasts through mitochondrial ROS. The role of Arg-II in mitochondrial ROS generation is further confirmed by the results showing that silencing <italic>arg-ii</italic> abolished miROS generation in fibroblasts when Arg-II is upregulated under hypoxic condition. These findings are supported by the studies showing that ROS favors cardiac fibroblast proliferation and activation to produce collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alili et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ohtsu et al., 2005</xref>). With these results, we demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts are activated in aging by a paracrine effect of macrophages, that is mediated by Arg-II / IL-1β and also by a cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II through mtROS.</p>
<p>Endothelial cells play a key role in regulation of blood flow to organs through eNOS pathway, one of the most important regulatory mechanisms in cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Godo et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated a causal role of Arg-II in promotion of vascular endothelial aging through eNOS uncoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yepuri et al., 2012</xref>). In line with this, our current study showed that Arg-II is expressed in the coronary vascular endothelium of old mice and also in human heart. Emerging evidence also suggests that endothelial cells have a significant capacity for plasticity and can change their phenotype, including endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a process that endothelial cells undergoing extensive alterations, including changes in gene and protein expression, loss of the endothelial phenotype, and switch to mesenchymal phenotype such as increased cell migration, proliferation, and increased collagen production, contributing to cardiovascular disease and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Murdoch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zeisberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Although EndMT in cardiac fibrotic models, particularly in pro-atherosclerotic mouse models are at least partially evidenced, it is less known in cardiovascular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Evrard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kidder et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). When compared to young animals, aged <italic>wt</italic> heart tissues show enhanced levels of SNAIL, the master regulator of End-MT process. Moreover, immunofluorescence reveals that CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells also co-express vimentin (mesenchymal marker). No changes of endothelial marker expression such as CD31 and vascular-endothelial cadherin (data not shown) are appreciated, suggesting that partial End-MT occurs during aging. Ablation of <italic>arg-ii</italic> blunts the age-related elevation of both vimentin and SNAIL, thereby reducing the number of CD31<sup>+</sup>/vimentin<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells. This data hints that lower cardiac tissue fibrosis in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> is at least partially contributed by dampened End-MT process. Indeed, conditioned medium from old <italic>wt</italic> macrophages is capable of enhancing mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin, as well as Arg-II protein levels in endothelial cells without changes in endothelial markers such as VE-cadherin, confirming a partial End-MT induced by aged macrophages. Interestingly, this effect of macrophages is prevented when <italic>arg-ii</italic> was ablated. Furthermore, the paracrine effects of the old macrophages on EndMT are prevented by IL-1 receptor antagonist ILRa, demonstrating a role of IL1β from old <italic>wt</italic> macrophages expressing Arg-II in EndMT process. Moreover, Arg-II is expressed and upregulated in endothelial cells with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yepuri et al., 2012</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>arg-ii</italic> in the endothelial cells did not affect the End-MT markers (data not shown), suggesting that Arg-II alone is not sufficient to induce a cell-autonomous effect in End-MT. Finally, we demonstrate that <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice in aging exhibit improved cardiac function and are more resistant to ischemic/reperfusion stress and reveal a better recovery and less myocardial infarct area as compared to the old <italic>wt</italic> animals. This protection against age-related cardiac dysfunction and vulnerability to ischemic stress in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals could be explained by the above described cardiac aging phenotype such as increase in apoptosis of cardiac cells, decrease in macrophage-mediated inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and EndMT, and fibroblast activation.</p>
<p>Previous studies provided sex-related difference in Arg-II levels at both mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Xiong, Yepuri, Montani, et al., 2017</xref>) and protein levels in various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Xiong, Yepuri, Necetin, et al., 2017</xref>). We further confirmed the observation that in female mice, there is a greater age-associated upregulation of <italic>arg-ii</italic> levels in the heart, which is specifically found in non-cardiomyocytes but not in cardiomyocytes. A possible explanation for this sex-specific phenomenon may lie in differences in hormonal patterns between male and female animals throughout the aging process. Indeed, sex hormones, including estrogen and testosterone, have been shown to regulate <italic>arg-ii</italic> expression in various tissues. Estrogen seems to downregulate Arg-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hayashi et al., 2006</xref>). The age-related greater increase in <italic>arg-ii</italic> in the female mice might be due to loss or lack of estrogen in old female animals, which requires further investigation. However, testosterone has been reported to upregulate <italic>arg-ii</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Levillain et al., 2005</xref>). This observation, however, does not seem to support the hypothesis that increased <italic>arg-ii</italic> expression in aged male mouse heart is related to sex hormones. Nevertheless, how age enhances Arg-II in sex-specific manner remains a topic of further investigation. Of note, previous studies showed that sex-related difference in pathological phenotypes in the aging kidney, pancreas, and lung are associated with higher levels of Arg-II in the females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Xiong, Yepuri, Necetin, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). The fact that aged females have higher Arg-II but are more resistant to I/R injury seems contradictory to the detrimental effect of Arg-II in I/R injury. It is presumable that cardiac vulnerability to injuries stressors depends on multiple factors/mechanisms in aging. Other factors/mechanisms associated with sex may prevail and determine the higher sensitivity of male heart to I/R injury, which requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the results of our study show that Arg-II plays a role in cardiac I/R injury also in males.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that age-related upregulation of Arg-II in macrophage, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells contributes to the cardiac aging phenotype. This includes manifestations, such as cardiac inflammatory response, partial EndMT, fibroblast activation, resulting in cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and ultimately, myocardial dysfunction. Moreover, it enhances the vulnerability of aging heart to ischemic/reperfusion injury, primarily through a non-cell-autonomous paracrine release of IL-1β from macrophages acting on cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. This effect is in addition to a cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II in cardiac fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). Future research shall develop the macrophage-specific <italic>arg-ii</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse model to confirm this conclusion with aging animals. Since Arg-II is also expressed in fibroblasts and endothelial cells and exerts cell-autonomous and paracrine functions, aging mouse models with conditional <italic>arg-ii</italic> knockout in the specific cell types would be the next step to elucidate cell-specific function of Arg-II in cardiac aging. In this context, another interesting aspect is the cross-talk between macrophages and vascular SMC in the aging heart. In our present study, we could not detect Arg-II in vascular SMC of mouse heart but in that of human heart. This could be due to the difference in species-specific Arg-II expression in the heart or related to the disease conditions in human heart which is harvested from patients with cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, in the <italic>apoe<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse atherosclerosis model, aortic SMCs do express Arg-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). It is interesting to note that rodents hardly develop atherosclerosis as compared to humans. Whether this could be partly contributed by the different expression of Arg-II in vascular SMC between rodents and humans requires further investigation. In our present study, the aspect of the cross-talk between macrophages and vascular SMC is not studied. Since the crosstalk between macrophages and vascular SMC has been implicated in the context of atherogenesis as reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gong et al., 2025</xref>), further work shall investigate whether Arg-II expressing macrophages could interact with vascular SMC in the coronary arteries in the heart and contribute to the development of coronary artery disease and/or vascular remodelling and the underlying mechanisms. Nevertheless, our study strongly suggests that targeting Arg-II has a wide spectrum of direct and indirect effects on multiple cell types in aging heart including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes, resulting in improved cardiac resistance to ischemia/reperfusion injury, which is due to inhibition of inflammation, fibrosis, and cell apoptosis. Thus, Arg-II shall represent a promising therapeutic target in treatment of age-related cardiac dysfunction and protect heart under diseased conditions.</p>

Genotypes of mice were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>). Offspring of <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic>mice were generated by interbred from hetero/hetero cross. Mice were housed at 23°C with a 12-h-light-dark cycle. Animals were fed a normal chow diet and had free access to water and food. The animals were selected and included in the study according to age, gender, and genotype. Only healthy animals, based on scoring of activity, posture, general appearance (coat, skin), locomotion, eyes/nose, body weight loss, were used. In this study, confounders such as the animal/cage location were controlled. All experimenters were aware of the group allocation at the different stages of the experiments. Male and female mice at the age of 3–4 months (young) or 20–22 months (old) were euthanized under deep anesthesia (i.p. injection of a mixture of ketamine/xylazine 50 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively) and death was confirmed by absence of all the reflexes and by exsanguination. The heart was then isolated and either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C until use or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.0), and then embedded in paraffin for immunofluorescence staining experiments. Experimental work with animals was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Veterinary Office of Fribourg Switzerland (2020-01-FR) and performed in compliance with guidelines on animal experimentation at our institution and in accordance with the updated ARRIVE guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Percie du Sert et al., 2020</xref>).

<title>Langendorff-perfused mouse heart preparation</title>
<p>Ex vivo functional assessments were performed by using an isolated heart system (Langendorff apparatus – EMKA technologies, France). Briefly, after euthanasia as above described, the hearts of <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male and female mice (20–22 months old) were excised, cannulated and retrogradely perfused on the Langendorff system. 150 µL of heparin (2,000 units/ml) was injected 15 minutes before the heart removal to prevent blood coagulation. Hearts trimmed of extracardiac tissue were weighed immediately after surgical removal prior cannulation and heart weight to body weight ratio (HW/BW) was calculated as hypertrophy index. The aorta was cannulated on a shortened and blunted 21-gauge needle and perfusion initiated at a constant pressure of 80 mmHg. The hearts were perfused with a modified Krebs–Henseleit solution composed of (mmol/L): 118 NaCL, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 Glucose, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The fluid was bubbled with a mix of 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C to give a pH of 7.4 and was filtered through an in-line 0.45 μm Sterivex-HV filter before delivery to the heart. A fluid-filled balloon was introduced into the left ventricle through an incision in the left atrial appendage. The ventricular balloon was connected via fluid-filled tubing to a pressure transducer for continuous assessment of ventricular function. The balloon was inflated to yield a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure between 5 to 15 mmHg. Hearts were immersed in warmed perfusate in a jacketed bath maintained at 37°C, and perfusate delivered to the coronary circulation was maintained at the same temperature. After 20 minutes stabilization, hearts were subjected to 15 minutes (males), 20 minutes and 30 minutes (females) of no-flow ischemia followed by 30-45 minutes of reperfusion. Recovery of contraction and relaxation rates (dt/dp<sub>min</sub>) as well as the recovery of the left ventricle developed pressure (LV-DP) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LV-EDP) were measured to investigate tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury. In addition to functional recovery, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was also performed to investigate a potential reduction in infarct size upon I/R-injury in <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals. TTC is a colorless water-soluble dye that is reduced by the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase of living cells into a water-insoluble, light sensitive compound (formazan) that turns healthy/normal tissue deep red. In contrast, damaged/dead tissue remains white showing the absence of living cells, and thereby indicating the infarct region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bederson et al., 1986</xref>). After completing the I/R protocol, heart was carefully removed from the experimental set-up. After a freeze-thaw cycle (−20°C for 1 hour), the heart was cross-sectioned from the apex to the atrioventricular groove into four 2.5 mm thick slices. The slices were first incubated in TTC (20 minutes at 37°C), and then fixed in 10% formalin for 30 minutes. A cover glass was then placed over the tissues and images were acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Redfors et al., 2012</xref>).

<p>For crosstalk experiments of splenic macrophages from <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>arg-ii<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice with cardiac cells, conditioned medium from the isolated splenic macrophages was collected and transferred to cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in 1:1 dilution with the specific cell culture medium for the indicated time. To study effects of IL-1β in the conditioned medium of splenic macrophages (CM-SM), cardiac cells, fibroblasts or endothelial cells were pre-treated with IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra (50 ng/ml) for 2 hours followed by the specific experimental protocols for analysis of cardiac apoptosis, fibroblast activation, and EndMT transition, respectively.</p>
<p>For the experiments with mouse macrophage cell line Raw 264.7, the cells were seeded on six-well plates with a density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well. Upon transduction with rAd expressing <italic>arg-ii<sup>shRNA</sup></italic> (see above) and over-night serum starvation, the mouse macrophages were polarized toward a pro-inflammatory secretion profile by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/mL) for 24 hours. The conditioned medium (CM) from non-treated control and LPS-activated RAW cells (referred to as CM-RAW) was then filtered and transferred onto cardiomyocytes for 24 hours to investigate cell apoptosis. To study effects of IL-1β in CM-RAW on cardiac cells apoptosis, myocytes were pre-treated with IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra (280-RA, R&amp;D systems) for 2 hours.</p>

<title>Hypoxia experiments with murine cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes</title>
<p>Cardiac cells were isolated from <italic>wt</italic> mice according to an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Louch et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, after euthanasia of mice, hearts were excised, cannulated and retrogradely perfused on a Langendorff system. Cells were enzymatically dissociated using a cocktail of collagenase type II, collagenase type IV and protease type XIV. After isolation, cardiomyocytes were separated from the pull of cardiac cells by gravity settling and plated onto laminin-coated coverslips. After 2 hours, the cardiomyocytes were washed to remove non-adhering cells and incubated for 24 hours at 1% oxygen level in a Coy In Vitro Hypoxic Cabinet System (The Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI USA). The rest of cardiac cells were plated on 12-well plates and cultured in DMEM (10% FBS) for 3 days, allowing cardiac fibroblasts to adhere. The fibroblasts were passaged once and subjected to hypoxia as for the cardiomyocytes.</p>

<title>Hypoxia experiments with human cardiac fibroblasts and mitochondrial superoxide detection (MitoSOX staining)</title>
<p>Human cardiac fibroblasts (HCF) from adult human heart tissue were incubated for 48 hours at 1% oxygen level in a Coy In Vitro Hypoxic Cabinet System (The Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI USA). To silence <italic>arg-ii</italic>, HCFs were seeded on 6-cm dishes for 24 hours and transduced first with the rAd at titers of 100 Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) and cultured in the complete medium for 2 days and then in serum-free medium for another 24 hours before experiments. The rAd expressing shRNA targeting <italic>arg-ii</italic> driven by the U6 promoter (rAd/U6-arg-ii-shRNA) and control rAd expressing shRNA targeting lacz (rAd/U6-lacz-shRNA) were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ming et al., 2009</xref>). Mitochondrial superoxide generation was monitored by using MitoSOX. Briefly, the cells were incubated with MitoSOX at the concentration of 1 μmol/L for 30 minutes. After washing, the cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde followed by counterstaining with DAPI and then subjected to imaging through 40× objectives with Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser microscope. To ensure the mitochondria as source of the ROS, cells were treated with Mito TEMPO (10 μmol/L, 1 hour) followed by MitoSOX staining.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Heart tissue or cell lysate preparation, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, antibody incubation, and signal detection were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ming et al., 2012</xref>). To prepare heart homogenates, frozen cardiac tissues were crushed into the fine powder using a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen on ice. A portion of the fine powder was then homogenized (XENOX-Motorhandstück MHX homogenizer) on ice in 150 µl of ice-cold lysis buffer with the following composition: 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.4 % Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), protease inhibitor cocktail (B14002, Bio-Tool) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (B15002; Bio-Tool). Homogenates were centrifuged (Sorvall Legend Micro 17R) at 13,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of supernatants were determined by Lowry method (500-0116, Bio-Rad). Equal amount of protein from each sample was heated at 75°C for 15 minutes in loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Proteins in the SDS-PAGE gel were then transferred to PVDF membranes which are blocked with PBS-Tween-20 supplemented with 5% skimmed milk. The membranes were then incubated with the corresponding primary antibody overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. After washing with blocking buffer, the membranes were then incubated with the corresponding anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Signals were visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences), or the FUSION FX Imaging system (Witec AG) for chemiluminescence, and quantified by Image Studio Lite (5.2, LI-COR Biosciences).

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were presented as mean ± SD. Data distribution was determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and statistical analysis for normally distributed values was performed with Student’s unpaired t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post hoc test. For non-normally distributed values, Mann–Whitney test or the Kruskal–Wallis test were used. Differences in mean values were considered statistically significant at a two tailed <italic>p</italic>-value ≤ 0.05.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Duilio M. Potenza et al. explores the role of Arginase II in cardiac aging, majorly using whole-body arg-ii knock-out mice. In this work, the authors have found that Arg-II exerts non-cell-autonomous effects on aging cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1b from aging macrophages. The authors have used arg II KO mice and an in vitro culture system to study the role of Arg II. Authors have also reported the cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II through mitochondrial ROS in fibroblasts that contribute to cardiac aging. These findings are sufficiently novel in cardiac aging and provide interesting insights. While the phenotypic data seem strong, the mechanistic details are unclear. How Arg II regulates the IL-1b and modulates cardiac aging is still being determined.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides interesting information on the role of Arg II in cardiac aging.</p>
<p>The phenotypic data in the Arg II KO mice is convincing, and the authors have assessed most of the aging-related changes.</p>
<p>The data is supported by an in vitro cell culture system.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript needs more mechanistic details on how Arg II regulates IL-1b and modulates cardiac aging.</p>

<p>This study investigates the role of arginase-II (Arg-II) in cardiac aging. The authors challenge previous assumptions by demonstrating that Arg-II is not expressed in aged cardiomyocytes, but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, specifically macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Using Arg-II knockout mice, they show protection against age-associated cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, apoptosis, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and ischemic injury. Mechanistically, Arg-II promotes IL-1β release from macrophages and increases mitochondrial ROS in fibroblasts, contributing to cardiac aging through both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms.</p>
<p>The study is well-structured and combines genetic models, molecular assays, and histological analyses to support its conclusions. Including both human and mouse samples strengthens the translational relevance of the findings. The authors have addressed most of the reviewers' comments and have made efforts to improve the manuscript by adding experimental data, explanations, and further discussion.</p>
<p>The data convincingly support their conclusions. This work provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of cardiac aging, aligns with growing evidence of non-cell-autonomous contributions to aging-related pathologies, and highlights the importance of intercellular signaling in maintaining cardiac health during aging.</p>
<p>Although the use of cell-specific knockout mouse models would enhance the depth and translational potential of the findings, it is understandable that such an approach would be beyond the scope of a single study. This work lays the groundwork for future investigations into conditional Arg-II knockouts in specific cell types to elucidate the cell-specific roles of Arg-II in cardiac aging.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a solid and impactful study with strong experimental support</p>

<p>The manuscript by Duilio M. Potenza et al. explores the role of Arginase II in cardiac aging, majorly using whole-body arg-ii knock-out mice. In this work, the authors have found that Arg-II exerts non-cell-autonomous effects on aging cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1b from aging macrophages.

The authors have also reported the cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II through mitochondrial ROS in fibroblasts that contribute to cardiac aging. These findings are sufficiently novel in cardiac aging and provide interesting insights. While the phenotypic data seems strong, the mechanistic details are unclear. How Arg II regulates the IL-1b and modulates cardiac aging is still being determined. The authors still need to determine whether Arg II in fibroblasts and endothelial contributes to cardiac fibrosis and cell death. This study also lacks a comprehensive understanding of the pathways modulated by Arg II to regulate cardiac aging.</p>

<p>We sincerely appreciate the valuable feedback provided by the reviewer. It's gratifying to hear that our work provided novel information on the role of arginase-II in cardiac aging which is a complex process involving various cell types and mechanisms. We have devoted considerable effort by performing new experiments to address the reviewer's comments and to delineate more detailed mechanisms of Arg-II in cardiac aging. Please, see below our specific answers to each point of the reviewers.</p>

<p>We made great effort and have performed new experiments in human monocyte cell line (THP1) in which iNOS is not expressed and not inducible by LPS and <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene was knocked out by CRISPR technology. Moreover, murine bone-marrow derived macrophages in which <italic>inos</italic> gene was ablated, is also use for this purpose. We found that in the human THP1 monocytes in which Arg-II but not iNOS is induced by LPS (100 ng/mL for 24 hours) (Suppl. Fig. 6A), mRNA and protein levels of IL-1b precursor are markedly reduced in <italic>arg-ii</italic> knockout THP1<italic><sup><italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic></sup></italic> as compared to the THP1<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic> cells (Suppl. Fig. 6B and 6C), further confirming that Arg-II promotes IL-1b production as also shown in RAW264.7 macrophages (Suppl. Fig. 5A and 5C). Moreover, in the mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages, LPS-induced IL-1b production is inhibited by <italic>inos</italic> deficiency (BMDM<italic><sup>inos-/-</sup></italic> vs BMDM<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic>) (Suppl. Fig. 6D and 6E), while Arg-II levels are slightly enhanced in the BMDM<italic><sup>inos-/-</sup></italic> cells (Suppl. Fig. 6D and 6F). All together, these results suggest that iNOS slightly reduces Arg-II expression. Arg-II and iNOS can be upregulated by LPS independently. Both Arg-II and iNOS are required for IL-1b production upon LPS stimulation as illustrated in Suppl. Fig. 6G. For detailed results and discussion, please see answers to the comments point 2 or point 6 raised by this reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors used whole-body KO mice, and the role of macrophages in cardiac aging is not studied in this model. A macrophage-specific arg II Ko would be a better model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with this comment of the reviewer. Unfortunately, this macrophage specific <italic>arg-ii</italic> knockout animal model is not available, yet. Future research shall develop the macrophage-specific <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model to confirm this conclusion with aging animals. Since Arg-II is also expressed in fibroblasts and endothelial cells and exerts cell-autonomous and paracrine functions, aging mouse models with conditional <italic>arg-ii</italic> knockout in the specific cell types would be the next step to elucidate cell-specific function of Arg-II in cardiac aging. We have pointed out this aspect for future research on page 19, lines 2 to 6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Experiments need to validate the deficiency of Arg II in cardiomyocytes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out by this reviewer in the comment point 10, Arg-II was previously reported to be expressed in isolated cardiomyocytes from in rats (PMID: 16537391). Unfortunately, negative controls. i.e., <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> samples were not included in the study to avoid any possible background signals. We made great effort to investigate whether Arg-II is present in the cardiomyocytes from different species including mice, rats and humans and have included old <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse samples as a negative control. This allows to validate the antibody specificity and background noises beyond any reasonable doubt. The new experiments in Suppl. Fig. 4 confirms the specificity of the antibody against Arg-II in old mouse kidney which is known to express Arg-II in the S3 proximal tubular cells (Huang J, et al. 2021). To exclude the possible species-specific different expression of Arg-II in the cardiomyocytes, aged mouse and rat heart tissues were used for cellular localization of Arg-II by confocal immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Suppl. Fig. 4B and 4C, both species show Arg-II expression only in non-cardiomyocytes (cells between striated cardiomyocytes) (red arrows) but not in striated cardiomyocytes. Even in the rat myocardial infarction tissues, Arg-II was not found in cardiomyocytes but in endocardium cells (Suppl. Fig. 4B). In isolated cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia, a well know strong stimulus for Arg-II protein levels, no Arg-II signals could be detected, while in fibroblasts from the same animals, an elevated Arg-II levels under hypoxia is demonstrated (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, even RT-qPCR could not detect <italic>arg-ii</italic> mRNA in cardiomyocytes but in non-cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5C). All together, these results demonstrate that Arg-II are not expressed or at negligible levels in cardiomyocytes but expressed in non-cardiomyocytes. This new experiments with rat heart are included in the method section on page 20, the 1st paragraph. The results are described on page 7, the 1st paragraph, and discussed on page 12, the 2nd paragraph. Legend to Suppl. Fig. 4 is included in the file “Suppl. figure legend_R”.</p>

<p>The authors have never investigated the possibility of NO involvement in this mice model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As above mentioned, we made great effort and have performed new experiments in human monocyte cell line (THP1) in which iNOS is not expressed and not inducible by LPS and <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene was knocked out by CRISPR technology. Moreover, murine bone-marrow derived macrophages in which <italic>inos</italic> gene was ablated, is also use for this purpose. The results show that Arg-II and iNOS can be upregulated by LPS independent of each other and iNOS slightly reduces Arg-II expression. However, both Arg-II and iNOS are required for IL-1b production upon LPS stimulation. For detailed results and discussion, please see answers to the comments point 2 or point 6 raised by this reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A co-culture system would be appropriate to understand the non-cell-autonomous functions of macrophages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion by this reviewer regarding the co-culture system to test the non-cell autonomous role of Arg-II. We think that our current model, which involves treating cells with conditioned media, is a well-established and effective method for demonstrating the non-cell autonomous role of Arg-II. This approach allows us to observe the effects of Arg-II on surrounding cells through the factors present in the conditioned media released from macrophages. The co-culture system could be considered, if the released factor in the conditioned medium is not stable. This is however not the case. Therefore, we are confident that our experimental model with conditioned medium is sufficiently enough to demonstrate a paracrine effect of cell-cell interaction (please also see answers to the comment point 16.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The Myocardial infarction data shown in the mice model may not be directly linked to cardiac aging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we have introduced and discussed in the manuscript, aging is a predominant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Studies in experimental animal models and in humans provide evidence demonstrating that aging heart is more vulnerable to stressors such as ischemia/reperfusion injury and myocardial infarction as compared to the heart of young individuals. Even in the heart of apparently healthy individuals of old age, chronic inflammation, cardiomyocyte senescence, cell apoptosis, interstitial/perivascular tissue fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction and endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and cardiac dysfunction either with preserved or reduced ejection fraction rate are observed. Our study is aimed to investigate the role of Arg-II in cardiac aging phenotype and age-associated cardiac vulnerability to stressors. Therefore, cardiac functional changes and myocardial infarction in response to ischemia/reperfusion injury are suitable surrogate parameters for the purpose.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The results from this study demonstrated a cell-specific role of mitochondrial enzyme arginase-II (Arg-II) in heart aging and revealed a non-cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells through the crosstalk with macrophages via inflammatory factors, such as by IL-1b, as well as a cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype. These findings highlight the significance of non-cardiomyocytes in the heart and bring new insights into the understanding of pathologies of cardiac aging. It also provides new evidence for the development of therapeutic strategies, such as targeting the ArgII activation in macrophages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We're grateful for the reviewer's positive feedback, acknowledging the significant findings of our study on the role of arginase-II (Arg-II) in cardiac aging. We appreciate this reviewer’s insight into the therapeutic potential of targeting Arg-II activation in macrophages and are excited about the implications for future interventions in age-related cardiac pathologies. Thank you for recognizing the importance of our work in advancing our understanding of cardiac aging and potential therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have several critical concerns, specifically about the mechanism of how Arg-II plays a role in cardiac aging.</p>
<p>My major concerns are:</p>
<p>(1) The authors have shown non-cell-autonomous effects on aging cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1b from aging macrophages. A macrophage-specific Arg-II knock-out mouse model is a suitable and necessary control to establish claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with this comment of the reviewer. Unfortunately, this macrophage specific <italic>arg-ii</italic> knockout animal model is not available, yet. Future research shall develop the macrophage-specific <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model to confirm this conclusion with aging animals. Since Arg-II is also expressed in fibroblasts and endothelial cells and exerts cell-autonomous and paracrine functions, aging mouse models with conditional <italic>arg-ii</italic> knockout in the specific cell types would be the next step to elucidate cell-specific function of Arg-II in cardiac aging. We have pointed out this aspect for future research on page 19, lines 2 to 6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) This study suggests that Arg-II exerts its effect through IL-1b in cardiac ageing. However, all experiments performed to demonstrate the link between ArgII and IL-1β are correlative at best. The underlying molecular mechanism, including transcription factors involved in the regulation of IL-1β by <italic>arg-ii</italic>, has not been demonstrated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate this reviewer’s comment on the aspect! To make it clear, a causal role of Arg-II in promoting IL-1β production in macrophages is evidenced by the experimental results showing that old <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse heart has lower IL-1β levels than the age-matched <italic>wt</italic> mouse heart (Fig. 6A to 6D). We further showed that the cellular IL-1β protein levels and release are reduced in old <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse splenic macrophages as compared to the <italic>wt</italic> cells (Fig. 7A, 7C, and 7D). This result is further confirmed with the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (Suppl. Fig. 5A and suppl. Fig. 5C), in which we demonstrate that silencing <italic>arg-ii</italic> reduces IL-1β levels stimulated with LPS.</p>
<p>According to this reviewer’s comment (see comment point 6), we made further effort to investigate possible involvement of iNOS in Arg-II-regulated IL-1β production in macrophages stimulated with LPS. We performed new experiments in human monocyte cell line (THP1) in which iNOS is not expressed and not inducible by LPS and <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene was knocked out by CRISPR technology in the cells.</p>
<p>Moreover, murine bone-marrow derived macrophages in which <italic>inos</italic> gene was ablated, is also use for this purpose. We found that in the human THP1 monocytes in which Arg-II but not iNOS is induced by LPS (100 ng/mL for 24 hours) (Suppl. Fig. 6A), mRNA and protein levels of IL-1b are markedly reduced in <italic>arg-ii</italic> knockout THP1<italic><sup><italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic></sup></italic> as compared to the THP1<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic> cells (Suppl. Fig. 6B and 6C), further confirming that Arg-II promotes IL-1b production as also shown in RAW264.7 macrophages (Suppl. Fig. 5A and 5C). The results suggest that Arg-II promotes IL-1b production independently of iNOS. Moreover, the role of iNOS in IL-1b production was also studied in the mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages in which <italic>inos</italic> gene is ablated. The results demonstrate that LPS-induced IL-1b production is inhibited by <italic>inos</italic> deficiency (BMDM<italic><sup>inos-/-</sup></italic> vs BMDM<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic>) (Suppl. Fig. 6D and 6E), while Arg-II levels are slightly enhanced in the BMDM<italic><sup>inos-/-</sup></italic> cells (Suppl. Fig. 6D and 6F). Since arginase and iNOS share the same metabolic substrate L-arginine, <italic><sup>inos-/-</sup></italic> is expected to increase IL-1b production. This is however not the case. A strong inhibition of IL-1β production in <italic><sup>inos-/-</sup></italic> macrophages is observed. These results implicate that iNOS promotes IL-1β production independently of Arg-II and the inhibiting effect of IL-1β by <italic>inos</italic> deficiency is dominant and able to counteract Arg-II’s stimulating effect on IL-1β production. Hence, our results demonstrate that Arg-II promotes IL-1β production in macrophages independently of iNOS. All together, these results suggest that iNOS slightly reduces Arg-II expression. Arg-II and iNOS can be upregulated by LPS independently. Both Arg-II and iNOS are required for IL-1b production upon LPS stimulation (This concept is illustrated in the Suppl. Fig. 6G). The new results are described on page 8, the last paragraph and page 9, the 1st paragraph, presented in Suppl. Fig.6. The legend to Suppl. Fig. 6 is described in the file “Supplementary figure legend-R”. The related experimental methods are updated on page 23, the last two paragraphs and page 26 the last paragraph. The results are discussed o page 14, the last paragraph and page 15, the first two paragraphs.</p>

<p>(3) Figure 2: The authors have not validated the whole-body Arg-II knock-out mice for arg-ii ablation.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out this missing information! We have added the information regarding genotyping of the mice in the method section on page 20, first paragraph. Moreover, Fig. 5C also confirms the genotyping of the non-cardiomyocyte cells isolated from <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is unclear why the authors have chosen to focus on IL-1β specifically, among other pro-inflammatory cytokines that were also downregulated in Arg-II-/- mice as demonstrated in Fig. 2A-D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's question, which provides an opportunity to delve deeper into our findings. In our investigation, we observed that aging is accompanied by elevated levels of various proinflammatory markers. Intriguingly, our data revealed that <italic>tnf-α</italic> remained unaffected by the ablation of <italic>arg-ii</italic> during aging in the heart tissues, while <italic>Il-1β</italic> showed a significant reduction in <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals compared to age-matched wild-type (<italic>wt</italic>) mice (Fig. 2). <italic>Mcp1</italic> is however a chemoattractant for macrophages and F4-80 serves as a pan marker for macrophages. Moreover, our previous studies demonstrate a relationship between Arg-II and IL-1β in vascular disease and obesity and age-associated renal and pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, IL-1β has been shown to play a causal role in patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease as shown by CANTOS trials. Therefore, we have focused on IL-1β in this study. We have now explained and strengthened this aspect in the manuscript on page 7, the last two lines and page 8, the 1st paragraph as following:</p>
<p>“Taking into account that our previous studies demonstrated a relationship of Arg-II and IL-1β in vascular disease and obesity (Ming et al., 2012) and in age-associated organ fibrosis such as renal and pulmonary fibrosis (Huang et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2023), and IL-1β has been shown to play a causal role in patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease as shown by CANTOS trials (Ridker et al., 2017), we therefore focused on the role of IL-1β in crosstalk between macrophages and cardiac cells such as cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Although macrophages are shown to be involved in cardiac ageing in the arg-ii mouse model, the authors have not estimated macrophage infiltration and expression of inflammatory or senescence markers in the hearts of these mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for raising this important point! Taking the comments of the reviewer into account, we have performed new experiments, i.e., multiple immunofluorescent staining to analyze the infiltrated (CCR2<sup>+/F4-80<sup>+</sup>) and resident (LYVE1<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup>) macrophage populations and to investigate to which extent that Arg-II affects the infiltrated and resident macrophage populations in the aging heart and whether this is regulated by <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic>. The results show an age-associated increase in the numbers of F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells in the <italic>wt</italic> mouse heart, which is reduced in the age-matched <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals (Fig. 2G). This result is in accordance with the result of <italic>f4/80</italic> gene expression shown in Fig. 2A, demonstrating that <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene ablation reduces macrophage accumulation in the aging heart. Interestingly, resident macrophages as characterized by LYVE1<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup> cells (Fig. 2E and 2H) are predominant in the aging heart as compared to the infiltrated CCR2<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup> cells (Fig. 2F and 2I). The increase in both LYVE1<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup> and CCR2<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup> macrophages in aging heart is reduced in <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Fig. 2E, 2F, 2H, and 2I). These new results are described on page 6, the 1st paragraph, presented in Fig. 2E to 2I, and discussed on page 13, the 2nd, paragraph. The legend to Fig. 2 is revised. The method for this additional experiment is included on page 22, the 1st paragraph.</sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the aged-associated accumulation of the senescence cells as demonstrated by p16<sup>ink4</sup> positive cells is significantly reduced in <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals. This new result is incorporated in the Fig. 1 as Fig. 1G and 1H and described / discussed on page 5, the 2nd paragraph and page 14, the 2nd last sentences of the 1st paragraph. The method of p16<sup>ink4</sup> staining is included in the method section on page 22, the 1st paragraph, line 7. The legend to Fig. 1 is revised accordingly.</p>

Elevated NO and superoxide have been shown to play crucial roles in the etiology of cardiovascular diseases (PMID: 24180388). Therefore, it is important to assess whether Nitric Oxide (NO) is involved in the aging-related phenotype in this mouse model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer's suggestion, we conducted new experiments to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the context of the effect of Arg-II-induced IL-1b production in macrophages. We have addressed this question in the response to the comment point 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Based on the results demonstrated in the study, ablation of Arg-II can be expected to cause a reduction in inflammation-associated phenotypes throughout the body at the multi-organ level. The observed improved cardiac phenotype could be an outcome of whole-body Arg-II ablation. It would be fruitful to develop a cardiac-specific Arg-II knockout mouse model to establish the role of Arg-II in the heart, independent of other organ systems.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the comment of the reviewer on this point. Unfortunately, as explained above (see point 1), it is currently not possible for us to perform the requested experiments, due to lack of cardiac specific <italic>arg-ii</italic>-knockout mouse model. Moreover, such an approach is complicated by the absence of Arg-II in cardiomyocytes and the expression of Arg-II in multiple cells including endothelial cells, fibroblasts and macrophage of different origin (resident and monocyte-derived infiltrating cells). It’s thus difficult to generate a cardiac-specific gene knockout mouse. One shall investigate roles of cell-specific Arg-II in cardiac aging by generating cell-specific <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We appreciate very this important aspect and have discussed issue on page 19, the lines 2 to 6.</p>

<p>(8) Contrary to the findings in this paper, Arg-II has previously been reported to be essential for IL-10-mediated downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β (PMID: 33674584).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for mentioning this study! We have now discussed thoroughly the controversies as the following on page 15, the last paragraph and page 16, the 1st paragraph;</p>
<p>“It is of note that a study reported that Arg-II is required for IL-10 mediated-inhibition of IL-1b in mouse BMDM upon LPS stimulation (Dowling et al., 2021), which suggests an anti-inflammatory function of Arg-II. The results of our present study, however, demonstrate that LPS enhances Arg-II and IL-1b levels in macrophages and knockout or silencing Arg-II reduces IL-1b production and release, demonstrating a pro-inflammatory effect of Arg-II. Our findings are supported by the study from another group, which shows decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production including IL-6 and IL-1b in <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> BMDM most likely through suppression of NFkB pathway, since <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> BMDM reveals decreased activation of NFkB and IL-1b levels upon LPS stimulation (Uchida et al., 2023). Most importantly, our previous study also showed that re-introducing <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene back to the <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> macrophages markedly enhances LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Ming et al., 2012), providing further evidence for a pro-inflammatory role of <italic>arg-ii</italic> under LPS stimulation. In support of this conclusion, chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes (Ming et al., 2012), inflammaging in lung (Zhu et al., 2023), kidney (Huang et al., 2021) and pancreas (Xiong, Yepuri, Necetin, et al., 2017) of aged animals or acute organ injury such as acute ischemic/reperfusion or cisplatin-induced renal injury are reduced in the <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Uchida et al., 2023). The discrepant findings between these studies and that with IL-10 may implicate dichotomous functions of Arg-II in macrophages, depending on the experimental context or conditions. Nevertheless, our results strongly implicate a pro-inflammatory role of Arg-II in macrophages in the inflammaging in aging heart”.</p>

<p>(9) The authors have only performed immunofluorescence-based experiments to show fibrotic and apoptotic phenotypes throughout this study. To verify these findings, we suggest that they additionally perform RT-PCR or western blotting analysis for fibrotic markers and apoptotic markers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The fibrotic aspect was analyzed not only by microscopy but also by using a quantitative biochemical assay such as hydroxyproline content assessment. Hydroxyproline is a major component of collagen and largely restricted to collagen. Therefore, the measurement of hydroxyproline levels can be used as an indicator of collagen content as previous investigated in the lung (Zhu et al., 2023). We have also measured collagen genes expression by RT-qPCR as suggested by the reviewer and found an age-related decline of collagen mRNA expression levels in both <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, suggesting that the age-associated cardiac fibrosis and prevention in <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is due to alterations of translational and/or post-translational regulations, including collagen synthesis and/or degradation. The results are in accordance with that reported by other studies published in the literature. We have pointed out this aspect on page 5, the 2nd paragraph:</p>
<p>“The increased cardiac fibrosis in aging is however, associated with decreased mRNA levels of <italic>collagen-Ia</italic> (<italic>col-Ia</italic>) and <italic>collagen-IIIa</italic> (<italic>col-IIIa</italic>), the major isoforms of pre-collagen in the heart (Suppl. Fig. 2A and 2B), which is a well-known phenomenon in cardiac fibrotic remodelling (Besse et al., 1994; Horn et al., 2016). The results demonstrate that age-associated cardiac fibrosis and prevention in <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is due to alterations of translational and/or post-translational regulations including collagen synthesis and/or degradation”.</p>
<p>The results are presented in Suppl. Fig. 2, legend to Suppl. Fig. 2 is included in the file “Suppl. figure legend_R”. Suppl. table 2 for primers is revised accordingly.</p>
<p>We did not use additional markers to perform apoptotic assays with whole heart, since Fig. 3 shows good evidence that the aging is associated with increased apoptotic cells in the heart and significantly reduced in the <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. The reduction of TUNEL positive (apoptotic) cells in aged <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is mainly due to decrease in apoptotic cardiomyocytes. With the histological analysis, the apoptotic cell types can be well analysed. Moreover, biochemical assay for apoptosis such as caspase-3 cleavage with whole heart tissues can not distinguish apoptotic cell types and may not be sensitive enough for aging heart, due to relatively low numbers of apoptotic cells in aging heart as compared to myocardial infarct model.</p>

<p>(10) Figure 4: arg-ii has previously been reported to be expressed in rat cardiomyocytes (PMID: 16537391). We strongly suggest the authors verify the expression of Arg-II via immunostaining in isolated cardiomyocytes (using published protocols), and by using multiple different cardiomyocyte-specific markers for colocalization studies to prove the lack of arg-ii expression beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out by this reviewer, Arg-II was previously reported to be expressed in isolated cardiomyocytes from in rats (PMID: 16537391). Unfortunately, negative controls. i.e., <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> samples were not included in the study to avoid any possible background signals. We made great effort to investigate whether Arg-II is present in the cardiomyocytes from different species including mice, rats and humans and have included old <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse samples as a negative control. This allows to validate the antibody specificity and background noises beyond any reasonable doubt. The new experiments in Suppl. Fig. 4 confirms the specificity of the antibody against Arg-II in old mouse kidney which is known to express Arg-II in the S3 proximal tubular cells (Huang J, et al. 2021). To exclude the possible species-specific different expression of Arg-II in the cardiomyocytes, aged mouse and rat heart tissues were used for cellular localization of Arg-II by confocal immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Suppl. Fig. 4B and 4C, both species show Arg-II expression only in non-cardiomyocytes (cells between striated cardiomyocytes) (red arrows) but not in striated cardiomyocytes. Even in the rat myocardial infarction tissues, Arg-II was not found in cardiomyocytes but in endocardium cells (Suppl. Fig. 4B). In isolated cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia, a well know strong stimulus for Arg-II protein levels, no Arg-II signals could be detected, while in fibroblasts from the same animals, an elevated Arg-II levels under hypoxia is demonstrated (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, RT-qPCR could not detect <italic>arg-ii</italic> mRNA in cardiomyocytes but in non-cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5C). All together, these results demonstrate that Arg-II are not expressed or at negligible levels in cardiomyocytes but expressed in non-cardiomyocytes. This new experiments with rat heart are included in the method section on page 20, the 1st paragraph. The results are described on page 7, the 1st paragraph, and discussed on page 12, the 2nd paragraph. Legend to Suppl. Fig. 4 is included in the file “Suppl. figure legend_R”.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>IL-1b is a well known pro-inflammatory cytokine that causes apoptosis in various cell types including cardiomyocytes (Shen Y., et al., Tex Heart Inst J. 2015;42:109–116. doi: 10.14503/THIJ-14-4254; Liu Z. et. al., Cardiovasc Diabetol 2015;14,125. doi: 10.1186/s12933-015-0288-y; Li. Z., et al., Sci Adv 2020;6:eaay0589. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aay0589). We appreciate very much the interesting idea of this reviewer to investigate the apoptotic responses of cardiomyocytes from <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to IL-1b. We agree that it is possible that cardiomyocytes from <italic>wt</italic> from <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice react differently to IL-1b, although the cardiomyocytes do not express Arg-II as demonstrated in our present study. If this is true, it must be due to non-cell autonomous effects of different aging microenvironment in the heart or epigenetic modulations of the myocytes. We found that this is a very interesting aspect and requires further extensive investigation. Since our current study focused on the effect of <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> macrophages on cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes, we prefer not to include this suggested aspect in our manuscript and would like to explore it in the following study.</p>

<p>(12) Figures 4-9: It would be interesting to see if the effect of ArgII in cardiac ageing is gender-specific. It is recommended to include experimental data with male mice in addition to the results demonstrated in female mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out in the manuscript, we have focused on female mice, because an age-associated increase in <italic>arg-ii</italic> expression is more pronounced in females than in males (Fig. 1A). As suggested by this reviewer, we performed additional experiments investigating effects of <italic>arg-ii</italic> deficiency in male mice during aging, focusing on pathophysiological outcomes of ischemia/reperfusion injury in ex vivo experiments. The <italic>ex vivo</italic> functional analytic experiments with Langendorff system were performed in aged male mice (see Suppl. Fig. 9). Following ischemia/reperfusion injury, <italic>wt</italic> male mice display reduced left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), as well as the inotropic and lusitropic states (expressed as dP/dt max and dP/dt min, respectively). As previously reported (Murphy et al., 2007), we also found that old male mice are more prone to I/R injury than age-matched female animals. Specifically, 15 minutes of ischemia are enough to significantly affect the left ventricle contractile function in the male mice (Suppl. Fig. 9). As opposite, age-matched old female mice are relatively resistant to I/R injury, and at least 20 min of ischemia are necessary to induce a significant impairment of the contractile function (Fig. 10). Similar to females, the post I/R recovery of cardiac function is also significantly improved in the male <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice as compared to age-matched <italic>wt</italic> animals. In addition to functional recovery, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining (myocardial infarction) upon I/R-injury in males is significantly reduced in the age-matched male <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals (Suppl. Fig. 9C and 9D). All together, these results reveal a role for Arg-II in heart function impairment during aging in both genders with a higher vulnerability to stress in the males. These new results are presented in Suppl. Fig. 9, described on page 10, the last paragraph and page 11. The results are discussed on page 18, the 2nd paragraph as following:</p>
<p>“The fact that aged females have higher Arg-II but are more resistant to I/R injury seems contradictory to the detrimental effect of Arg-II in I/R injury. It is presumable that cardiac vulnerability to injuries stressors depends on multiple factors/mechanisms in aging. Other factors/mechanisms associated with sex may prevail and determine the higher sensitivity of male heart to I/R injury, which requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the results of our study show that Arg-II plays a role in cardiac I/R injury also in males”.</p>

<p>Now it is Fig. 7F and 7G. This is due to our specific experimental procedure. After tissue digestion, cardiomyocytes were plated on laminin-coated dishes. Laminin promotes the adhesion of survived cells. Following plating, we conducted a deep washing process to remove damaged and partially adherent cells. This step ensures that only well-shaped, viable, and strongly adherent cells remain as bioassay cells. These “healthy” cells are then selected for the experiments. the apoptotic cells are removed by washing out, reflecting the high viability of the bioassay cells.

<p>(14) Figure 7J: Please assess whether arg-ii depletion also affects the mtROS phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the suggestion of this reviewer, we performed new experiments which show that human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) exposed to hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>, 48 hours), a known physiological trigger of Arg-II up-regulation, exhibit increased mtROS generation, which involves Arg-II (new Fig. 8M to 8P). We found that Arg-II protein level as well as mtROS (assessed by mitoSOX staining) were both enhanced, accompanied by increased levels of HIF1α (Fig 8M). Moreover, mito-TEMPO pre-incubation reduces mtROS, confirming the mitochondrial origin of the ROS. Silencing of <italic>arg-ii</italic> with rAd-mediated shRNA, significantly reduces mtROS levels demonstrating a role of Arg-II in the production of mitochondrial ROS in cardiac fibroblasts (Fig 8M to 8P). We have included these results on page 9, the last paragraph and discussed the results on page 17, the 1st paragraph. The related method is described on page 26, the 2nd paragraph.

<p>(15) Figure 8A-E: The authors have treated human-origin endothelial cells with mice-origin macrophage-conditioned media. It would be more suitable to treat the endothelial cells with human-origin macrophage-conditioned media.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the concern regarding the use of mouse-origin macrophage-conditioned media on human-origin endothelial cells. It is to note, the biological cross-reactivity of cytokines from one species on cells from a different species has been reported in the literature. It was observed that there is quite a strict threshold of 60% amino acid identity, above which cytokines tend to cross-react and statistically, cytokines would tend to cross-react more often as their % amino acid identity increases (Scheerlinck JPY. Functional and structural comparison of cytokines in different species. Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1999; 72:39-44. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-2427(99)00115-4">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-2427(99)00115-4</ext-link>). Taking IL-1b as an example, the 17.5 kDa mature mouse and human IL-1b share 92% aa sequence identity, suggesting a high cross-reactivity. Indeed, human IL-1b has shown biological cross-reactivity in mouse cells (Ledesma E., et al. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) induces tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression on mouse myeloid multipotent cell line 32D cl3 and inhibits their proliferation. Cytokine. 2004; 26:66-72. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2003.12.009">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2003.12.009</ext-link>). Moreover, our results also support the reported cross-reactivity between human and mouse IL-1b. The CM from mouse macrophage indeed showed biological function in human endothelial cells. The observed effects of the conditioned media from aged wild-type macrophages on endothelial cells were specifically mediated through IL-1β. This conclusion is supported by our data showing that the upregulation induced by the conditioned media was significantly reduced by the addition of an IL-1β receptor blocker.</p>

<p>(16) The co-culture system would be more interesting to test the non-cell autonomous role of Arg II.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion by this reviewer regarding the co-culture system to test the non-cell autonomous role of Arg-II. We believe that our current model, which involves treating cells with conditioned media, is a well-established and effective method for demonstrating the non-cell autonomous role of Arg-II. This approach allows us to observe the effects of Arg-II on surrounding cells through the factors present in the conditioned media. The co-culture system could be considered, if the released factor in the conditioned medium is not stable. This is however not the case. So we are confident that our experimental model with conditioned medium is good enough to demonstrate a paracrine effect of cell-cell interaction.</p>

<p>(1) The current study showed strong evidence demonstrating the key role of cardiac macrophages in pathologies of cardiac aging, particularly, the macrophages (MФ) from the circulating blood (hematogenous). It is known that the heart is among the minority of organs in which substantial numbers of yolk-sac MФ persist in adulthood and play a crucial role in maintaining cardiac function. Thus, the adult mammalian heart contains two separate and discrete cardiac MФ subgroups, i.e., the resident MФs originated from yolk sac-derived progenitors and the hematogenous MФs recruited from circulating blood monocytes. These two subtypes of MФs may play distinctive roles in the aging heart and the response to cardiac injury. The author could extend the discussion on the possibility of the resident MФs in aging hearts, which could be further investigated in the future.</p>

<p>We appreciate the suggestion and agree that it provides valuable insight into the study. Taking the comments of the reviewer 1 into account, we have performed new experiments, i.e., co- immunostaining to analyze the infiltrated (CCR2<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup>) and resident (LYVE1<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup>) macrophage populations and to investigate to which extent that Arg-II affects infiltrated and resident macrophage populations in the aging heart. We found that in line with the gene expression of <italic>f4/80</italic>, immunofluorescence staining reveals an age-associated increase in the numbers of F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells in the <italic>wt</italic> mouse heart, which is reduced in the age-matched <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals (Fig. 2E, F, G), demonstrating that <italic>arg-ii</italic> gene ablation reduces macrophage accumulation in the aging heart. Interestingly, resident macrophages as characterized by LYVE1<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup> cells (Fig. 2E and 2H) are predominant in the aging heart as compared to the infiltrated CCR2<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup> cells (Fig. 2F and 2I). The increase in both LYVE1<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup> and CCR2<sup>+</sup>/F4-80<sup>+</sup> macrophages in aging heart is reduced in <italic>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Fig. 2E, 2F, 2H, and 2I). These new results are described on page 6, the 1st paragraph, presented in Fig. 2E to 2I, and discussed on page 13, the 2nd, paragraph. The legend to Fig. 2 is revised. The method for this additional experiment is included on page 22, the 1st paragraph.</p>

<p>(2) It would be beneficial to the readers if the author could provide some explanation about why ArgII could not be detected in VSMCs in the mouse heart and the species difference between humans and mice. In addition, the author may provide an assumption on the possibility that there may also be a cross-talk between macrophages and VSMCs in the aging heart. A little bit more explanation in the Discussion will be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge and appreciate the suggestion and have discussed these points on page 19 as the following:</p>
<p>“In this context, another interesting aspect is the cross-talk between macrophages and vascular SMC in the aging heart. In our present study, we could not detect Arg-II in vascular SMC of mouse heart but in that of human heart. This could be due to the difference in species-specific Arg-II expression in the heart or related to the disease conditions in human heart which is harvested from patients with cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, in the <italic>apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse atherosclerosis model, aortic SMCs do express Arg-II (Xiong et al., 2013). It is interesting to note that rodents hardly develop atherosclerosis as compared to humans. Whether this could be partly contributed by the different expression of Arg-II in vascular SMC between rodents and humans requires further investigation. In our present study, the aspect of the cross-talk between macrophages and vascular SMC is not studied. Since the crosstalk between macrophages and vascular SMC has been implicated in the context of atherogenesis as reviewed (Gong et al., 2025), further work shall investigate whether Arg-II expressing macrophages could interact with vascular SMC in the coronary arteries in the heart and contribute to the development of coronary artery disease and/or vascular remodelling and the underlying mechanisms“.</p>
