<abstract>
<p>DNA origami technology is a method for designing and constructing nanoscale structures using DNA, and it is being applied across various fields. This technology was advanced by developing the nanospring (NS), a fluorescently visible molecular spring that quantifies forces through its extension and has been used to measure myosin-generated forces. This study aims to measure the force exerted by the kinesin-3 motor protein KIF1A, mutations of which cause KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND) and are associated with reduced force and motility. Unlike kinesin-1, KIF1A detaches easily under perpendicular loads, which can occur in optical tweezers experiments. By applying force parallel to the microtubule using the NS, we were able to precisely measure the stall force even for KAND mutants, for which such measurements are typically challenging. This result highlights the potential of the NS as a new tool for force spectroscopy in biophysics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The kinesin superfamily of microtubule-based motor proteins in humans consists of approximately 45 types and represents a large group of motor proteins with diverse functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Among them, KIF1A, a member of the kinesin-3 subfamily, plays a critical role in the long-distance transport of synaptic vesicle precursors and other cargos in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. This transport is essential for maintaining synaptic activity, supporting neuronal development, and ensuring proper neuronal function. Structurally, KIF1A contains a motor domain that binds to microtubules and hydrolyzes ATP to generate mechanical force, driving movement toward the plus end of microtubules. In recent years, KIF1A has gained significant attention due to the identification of over 100 mutations linked to KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND), a spectrum of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, and progressive neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Single-molecule measurements of KIF1A mutants associated with KAND have developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Precise measurements of the velocity of KIF1A single molecules have been achieved using TIRF microscopy, while optical tweezers have enabled force measurements. These techniques have been used to compare the biophysical properties of KIF1A single molecules with those of its mutants that cause KAND. The motility of the single molecules has been reported to correlate with disease severity, highlighting the importance of single-molecule biophysical measurements into precision medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The velocity of KIF1A has been extensively studied; however, there is still room for improvement in force measurements using optical tweezers. To date, optical tweezers have been used to measure the stall force, defined as the maximum force that a motor can generate when its movement is halted, of various microtubule-based motor proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Since a submicron-sized bead is attached to the kinesin (∼10nm) and force is applied via the bead to the kinesin in this method, the applied force tends to pull it upward, which can sometimes lead to its detachment from the microtubule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Since KIF1A is easier to detach from microtubules compared to conventional kinesin-1, it is more challenging to successfully stall KIF1A in optical tweezer experiments without detachment. Indeed, most of the stalls lasted less than one second, and the force trajectories exhibited sawtooth-like patterns in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To overcome the challenges associated with force measurements in KAND mutants, we employed an alternative approach based on DNA nanotechnology. In a previous study, Iwaki et al. developed a distinct method for force measurement by using programmable DNA origami to construct nanoscale, coil-like springs known as nanosprings (NSs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. These NSs are fluorescently labeled, allowing their extension to be visualized with conventional fluorescence microscopy. Since the force–extension relationship of the NS is pre-calibrated using acoustic force spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the force exerted on the spring can be quantitatively estimated from its measured extension. In this study, we applied the NS method to measure the force generated by single KIF1A molecules, including both wild-type and KAND mutants. Using the NS system, we were able to apply a horizontal load parallel to the microtubule axis to single KIF1A molecules, and clearly observed sustained stalling for several tens of seconds with reduced detachment. Notably, stalling events were also stably observed in KAND mutants such as P305L and V8M, which disrupt critical force-generating regions of the protein (e.g., the K-loop and neck linker) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. We also included the A255V mutant, previously unmeasured in force assays, which is known to affect ATP hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the NS allowed for precise stall force measurement, revealing force differences between KAND mutant homodimers and heterodimers composed of a wild-type and the mutant subunit. These results highlight the advantage of our approach in minimizing the force component perpendicular to the microtubule’s long axis.</p>
<p>In previous single-molecule experiments in kinesin, DNA origami was used to control the number of cooperatively moving kinesin motors, and their velocities have been analyzed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. As a distinct application of DNA-origami-based motor protein systems, in this study, we successfully measured force using only fluorescence imaging. This study is significant in that it extends fluorescence imaging from merely capturing velocity to also allowing the quantification of force. In the field of motor proteins research, measurements of physical quantities related to distance, such as velocity and stepping motion, have rapidly advanced with the development of cutting-edge microscopy techniques like a super-resolution microscopy technology MINFLUX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, enabling their investigation not only in glass chambers but also inside living cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, since both force and velocity are crucial physical parameters to understand the functions of motor proteins, and force-velocity relationships are indeed related to their ATP hydrolysis mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we believe that the development of a new type of force measurement is of great significance in this field. The development of NS-based force measurement, which enables force quantification at the nanoscale, is expected to have significant implications not only in the field of motor protein research but also in the broader study of protein biophysics.</p>

<title>The NS-KIF1A-inert KIF5B complex as a force measurement system</title>
<p>To measure the force generated by single KIF1A molecule, we constructed a complex comprising a KIF1A molecule, an inert KIF5B mutant, and a NS. For KIF1A, the motor domain (amino acid residues 1–393) was used, excluding the C-terminal and cargo-binding domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Since KIF1A does not form stable dimers in the absence of cargo binding domains, a leucine zipper domain was incorporated to stabilize KIF1A dimers, mimicked the activated state of full-length KIF1A, as in the previous study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. As for the inert KIF5B attached to the one end of the NS, it was engineered to remain immobilized on microtubules by introducing the G234A mutation (Methods). This mutant lacks ATP hydrolysis activity and, as a result, does not exhibit motility, allowing it to remain stably attached to microtubules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Both kinesins were equipped with SNAP-tags at their N-termini, which enabled chemical coupling to the NS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; Methods). The inert KIF5B mutant served to anchor the KIF1A–NS complex to a microtubule. This anchoring of the KIF5B to the microtubule allowed a KIF1A to stay near the microtubule, increasing the probability of its binding to the microtubule.</p>

<p>At equilibrium, in the absence of tension applied by KIF1A, the NS, uniformly labeled with 124 Cy3 fluorophores, exhibited a resting length of approximately 300 nm and appeared as a diffraction-limited circular spot in a fluorescence image (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In the presence of ATP, the NS extended as the KIF1A moved against the load, and its fluorescence image became an elongated shape (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To calibrate the pulling force acting on the NS from its extension, the acoustic force spectroscopy (AFS) was used as in the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref> presents the relationship between NS extension and force measured by the AFS, revealing its nonlinear elastic behavior.

<title>Simulation-based evaluation of fluorescence image analysis methods</title>
<p>Before analyzing the fluorescence images of a NS, we generated artificial images that mimic experimental conditions in order to develop a method for estimating the length of a rod-shaped object from its fluorescence image. The artificial images were generated by placing 116 two-dimensional isotropic Gaussian functions aligned along a straight line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), to mimic a DNA calibration rod labeled with 116 fluorescent molecules, as introduced in the following section. The value of the variance in the Gaussian function was determined based on the approximate shape of the point spread function (PSF) of the Cy3 fluorophore (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). While the PSF is, in principle, influenced by the optical system, here it was used as a reference value for generating the artificial images. White noise was then added to the images. When the 116 Gaussian functions were superimposed, they appear as a single bright spot with an elliptical shape (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, top). For this artificial image, we present a comparison of the results obtained using two methods: the Gaussian fitting method and the chain fitting method.</p>

<p>While the Gaussian fitting method provided reasonable results, we considered an alternative approach, called the chain fitting method, to directly estimate the length <italic>L</italic> of the model. In the Gaussian fitting method, proposed in the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the true length <italic>L</italic> of the rod is not included as a parameter in the fitting function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation (1)</xref>). The chain fitting method is designed based on the structure in which fluorescent molecules are arranged in a line, and because the fitting parameters directly include the length <italic>L</italic>, it is expected to provide a more accurate estimation than the Gaussian fitting method. The fluorescence intensity of this model can be described by the following equation:

<title>Experimental validation of the chain fitting method using DNA calibration rods</title>

The length was varied by adjusting the interval between fluorescent dyes. The end-to-end distances between fluorescent molecules were designed to be 398 nm, 501 nm, 599 nm, and 658 nm, respectively. Since the NSs were labeled with 124 Cy3 fluorescent molecules, we considered the fluorescence images obtained from these rods to be similar to those of the NSs.</p>

<title>Observation of stall behavior in wild-type KIF1A</title>
<p>The supplementary movie shows a representative example of the movement of a NS with KIF1A and KIF5B. At first an inert KIF5B is firmly fixed to the microtubule. Then, the diffusive behavior of a KIF1A—attached to the NS, which is anchored to the microtubule via the inert KIF5B—as it searches for a binding site on the microtubule, is observed. Once the KIF1A binds to the microtubule, it starts moving along the microtubule and stretches the spring. When the tension in the NS balances with the maximum force generated by the KIF1A, the extension temporarily halts during the time interval (attachment duration). Eventually, the KIF1A detaches from the microtubule, the tension is released, and the NS returns to its retracted state. This cycle event was repeatedly observed.</p>
<p>The extension of the NS was estimated by the chain fitting method (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">equation (2)</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, bottom). For the event during a time interval (2.8 s ≤ <italic>t</italic> ≤ 21.2 s), the histogram of the spring length was calculated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, left). The histogram exhibits a bimodal Gaussian distribution, with each peak corresponding to the extended and retracted states of the NS shown in the micrographs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> left). <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub> was calculated by averaging the NS extension during the force-plateau periods within each attachment event. The attachment of KIF1A to the microtubule was identified by the marked suppression of angular fluctuations of the NS relative to the microtubule (Methods and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, top), which clearly distinguished the bound state from the diffusive search behavior. Within this attachment duration, the force plateau (stall duration Δ<italic>t</italic>) was detected by analyzing the rate of relative increase in NS’s length (Methods). The mean NS extension over these plateau segments was defined as <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub>.</p>

<p>In our experiments, we analyzed a total of 86 events from 24 KIF1A molecules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, left). From the mean value of <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub> (562 ± 48 nm), the stall force of the wild type KIF1A was estimated to be 4.7 pN (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) by using the force-extension calibration of the NS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). This value is similar to the stall force values of the wild type KIF1A(1-393) measured previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and larger than the detachment force values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.

<title>Stall duration Δ<italic>t</italic></title>
<p>In previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, most of the stalls lasted less than one second, and the force trajectories exhibited sawtooth-like patterns, which was a characteristic feature of force generation by KIF1A unlike kinesin-1, which exhibits clear stalling behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, in our experiments, we observed clear stall states lasting for several tens of seconds, similar to the stalling behavior observed with kinesin-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>).

<p>In a single bead optical tweezers experiment, it was reported that Δ<italic>t</italic> was correlated with the detachment force when the detachment of a KIF1A from the microtubule was likely accelerated by forces applied perpendicular to the microtubule’s long axis (<italic>z</italic>-axis depicted in the schematics of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), due to the contact between a single bead and a underlying microtubule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.

<title>Effect of electrostatic repulsion on force measurement</title>
<p>Because the DNA-based NS is negatively charged, we investigated the effect of its electrostatic repulsion with negatively charged microtubules. This repulsion could potentially promote the detachment of KIF1A from the microtubule, raising a concern for the measurement. To minimize repulsive interactions between the NS and the microtubule, we coated the NS with oligolysine conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) to render the spring electrically neutral (Methods).

Although it has been reported that the landing rate of P305L on microtubules was reduced by 97%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, in this experiment, an inert KIF5B firmly anchored to the microtubule at the end of the NS, which kept the P305L mutant in close proximity to the microtubule, thereby effectively increasing its binding probability. In other words, the anchoring effect enabled clear observation of microtubule binding by the P305L mutant. This high binding rate is one of the advantages of the NS–KIF1A–inert KIF5B complex, when used as a force measurement system.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We measured the force generated by KIF1A using the NSs developed by Iwaki <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Because KIF1A more readily detaches from microtubules compared to kinesin-1, and the <italic>z</italic>-component (refer to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> for the z direction) of the applied forces often causes detachment in optical tweezers experiments, making it difficult to observe its stall behavior. In contrast, by using the NS, we were able to apply load to a single KIF1A molecule solely in the horizontal direction (<italic>x</italic>-axis) along microtubules, enabling clear observation of the stall events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Note that, while performing these measurements, we also improved the image analysis method (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the length of the NS was estimated using the Gaussian fitting method (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation (1)</xref>). In contrast, in the present study, we adopted the chain fitting method (equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">2</xref>)), which allowed for a more direct estimation of the length <italic>L</italic> from the images. Below, we discuss the advantages and future prospects of NS-based force measurements.</p>
<p>In KAND mutants, evolutionary scale model (ESM) scores have been compared with clinical phenotype scores such as the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite (VABS-ABC) scores <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. ESM refers to large-scale protein language models based on Transformer architectures, trained on millions of sequences to predict structure, function, and mutation effects from primary amino acid sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. However, due to the currently low correlation between ESM scores and clinical severity, incorporating biophysical parameters such as velocity and force may provide additional predictive insight, particularly for de novo mutations—a direction already explored in part by a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In the present study, we propose a high-throughput method for accurately measuring the force generated by KIF1A mutants using the NSs. Anchoring a KIF1A–NS complex to the microtubule via an inert KIF5B facilitated the observation of stall events even for KAND-related KIF1A mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), which were otherwise prone to detachment due to the dysfunctions caused by the mutations. Indeed, we successfully measured the stall force of several KAND-associated mutants, including P305L, V8M, and A255V. P305L, V8M, and A255V are representative mutants that primarily impair microtubule binding, force generation near the neck linker, and ATP hydrolysis near the Switch II region, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Notably, stall force measurements for the homodimeric A255V and heterodimeric combinations P305L/WT, V8M/WT, and A255V/WT had not previously been reported using optical tweezers. Building a database of such biophysical measurements will be essential for linking molecular dysfunction to clinical outcomes. The NS-based force assays offer a powerful platform for this purpose. In the Supplementary Information, we additionally compared these three mutants with the REVEL, CADD v1.4, and ESM scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. It is important to further investigate the relationship between stall force and the severity of KAND.</p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, optical tweezers have been the primary method for measuring forces generated by motor proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. An advantage of the NS is that it enables precise investigation of the force exerted by a single motor protein, whereas multiple kinesin molecules may attach to a bead in optical tweezers experiments. Moreover, unlike optical tweezers, which require individual manipulation of each bead and can measure the force of only one motor protein at a time, the NS-based assay allows simultaneous recording and force measurements of multiple NS–KIF1A complexes within the field of view. This results in significantly higher throughput and represents a key advantage over optical tweezers. From the perspective of compatibility with other measurement techniques, the near-infrared laser used in optical tweezers readily causes photobleaching of organic dyes, making single-molecule imaging of dye-labeled proteins challenging. For example, this means that optical tweezers cannot be used simultaneously with MINFLUX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, the NS can also be combined with high-speed AFM or electron microscopy, enabling structural analysis of proteins under quantitatively controlled mechanical load. In fact, although not NSs, DNA origami-based thick filaments with attached myosin have been investigated using AFM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, the DNA origami-based NSs are also expected to be used with AFM.</p>
<p>Although NSs offer several advantages, they also have disadvantages. While the optical trap can be approximated as a linear spring, the NS behaves as a nonlinear spring (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Consequently, fluctuations in its length can sometimes lead to large errors in force measurements. Therefore, it is crucial to adjust the spring stiffness to match the force range generated by the motor protein. In this study, we used NSs with different physical properties from those used in the previous force measurements on myosin VI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Wild-type KIF1A generates a larger stall force than myosin, requiring a different dynamic range for the nonlinear behavior of the spring. Owing to DNA origami technology, the mechanical properties of the NS can be tuned to match the appropriate force range for measuring molecular stiffness.</p>
<p>The reason why the stall force exhibits a wide range of values may be not only the non-linearity of the NS, but also the complexity of the underlying kinetics of a single KIF1A, such as step-back events (e.g., the green arrow in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Indeed, analysis of the Δ<italic>t</italic> distribution (Fig. 6) suggests that the motion during stall events can be characterized by two (or more) reaction rate constants (Supplementary Information). Determining the detailed chemical reaction model underlying these stall events will be an important subject for future studies.</p>
<p>With the recent development of the super-resolution microscope MINFLUX, live-cell tracking of single fluorescent molecules has become possible, enabling the precise observation of kinesin-1 stepping motion in living cells with nanometer spatial and millisecond temporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To date, models of chemo-mechanical energy conversion in motor proteins have been proposed based on the load dependence of their stepping motion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The intracellular environment is highly crowded with biomolecules and also contains active fluctuations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, resulting in complex viscoelastic properties and an inhomogeneous refractive index. This leads to challenges in using optical tweezers, such as accurately estimating the trap stiffness of laser-trapped vesicles in cells. On the other hand, the NSs offer a method of measuring force solely through fluorescence imaging, providing a potential solution to this problem. In relation to cellular applications, the NSs have already been used as force sensors to visualize the dynamics of integrins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Expanding such applications, the introduction of the NS–kinesin complex into living cells offers a promising approach to uncover the load-dependent dynamics of kinesin in its native environment.</p>

To generate this construct, a human KIF1A(1–393)-LZ-6His construct named pSN672 (addgene #177362)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> was modified as follows: SNAP-tag cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with high fidelity PCR enzyme (Prime STAR MAX, Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan, Cat#R045), using pSNAP-tag(T7)-2 vector (NEB, N9181S) as a template. Then PCR product added with XhoI sites at the both ends was inserted into XhoI site of the plasmid pSN672 by using In-Fusion® HD Cloning Kit (Takara Bio Inc, Cat#639649). This KIF1A (1–393)-LZ-SNAP-6His construct was then used as template to generate the 3 aberrant motors by site-directed mutagenesis using the KOD Plus mutagenesis kit (TOYOBO, Cat#SMK-101).

Colonies were picked and cultured in 10 mL LB medium supplemented with ampicillin overnight. Next morning, the culture was transferred to 750 mL of 2.5×YT (20 g/L Tryptone, 12.5 g/L Yeast Extract, 6.5 g/L NaCl) supplemented with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 100 µg/mL ampicillin in 2 L flasks and shaken at 37°C. Two flasks were routinely prepared. When OD600 reached 0.6, the flasks were cooled in ice-cold water for 30 minutes, then isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to the cooled culture to final concentration of 0.2 mM to induce expression.

<title>Preparation of nanosprings (NSs) and DNA calibration rod</title>
<p>NSs were designed using caDNAno software, as described in the method from the reference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Briefly, NSs were designed by introducing a negative superhelical strain into a four-helix bundle arranged on a square lattice. To impose the torsional strain, two additional nucleotides were periodically inserted every 32 bp in the upper pair of helices, while two nucleotides were deleted at the corresponding positions in the lower pair of helices. This design yielded a uniform coil structure with a diameter of ∼35 nm. For the kinesin-NS conjugation, 32-base single stranded DNA (ssDNA) handles (handle 32A and 32B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S2</xref>) were extended from both ends of the NS. To construct the NS, 10 nM scaffold (p8064, tilibit nanosystems) was mixed with 100 nM core staples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S3</xref>), 100 nM handle staples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S2</xref>) and 12.4 mM Cy3-labeled antihandle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S4</xref>). The folding reaction was carried out in folding buffer (5 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA and 14 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) with rapid heating to 80°C and cooling in single degree steps to 60°C over 2 h followed by additional cooling in single degree steps to 25°C over another 24 h. DNA calibration rods were also prepared as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.

The folding reaction was carried out in folding buffer (5 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA and 14 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and the heating and cooling condition was the same as that for the NS. The folded DNA nanostructures were purified by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Briefly, 15%–45% (v/v) gradient glycerol solutions in buffer A (1×TE buffer containing 11 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) were made, and the glycerol fractions containing monomeric nanostructures were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The concentration of the nanostructures was determined with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and the solution was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. To minimize electrostatic interference between NSs and microtubules, NSs were coated with oligolysine conjugated to polyethylene glycol (K10 PEG5K, purchased from Alamanda Polymers)<sup>42</sup> as follows. 10 microliters of 4.2 nM NSs were mixed with 0.45 µL of K10–PEG5K at a concentration corresponding to an N:P ratio (ratio of nitrogen in amines to phosphates in DNA) of 0.5:1.

<title>Single molecule experiment on kinesin-NS conjugates</title>

Unless otherwise noted, the assay buffer was the SRP90 buffer supplemented with 20 µM Taxol, 0.4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (131-14572, FUJIFILM), and 0.2 mg/mL casein (C5890-500G, Sigma-Aldrich). Microtubules were diluted in the buffer (without casein), and flowed into the chamber, allowing them to attach to the glass surface of the chamber through non-specific interaction during a 5-minute incubation. Then, the chamber was incubated with the blocking buffer (assay buffer containing 0.5 mg/mL casein) for 5 minutes to prevent nonspecific binding, during which microtubules that did not adhere to the glass surface were washed away using the blocking buffer. Next, the assay buffer containing kinesin-NS conjugates was flowed into the chamber, followed by a 5-minute incubation to allow the kinesin-NS conjugates to attach to the microtubules. Finally, the assay buffer, additionally supplemented with 1 mM ATP, 3 mg/mL glucose, 0.1 mg/mL glucose oxidase, and 0.02 mg/mL catalase, was flowed into the chamber. Note that the latter three regents are an oxygen scavenger system for fluorescence antifade protection. This step allowed for the removal of kinesin-NS conjugates that had not attached to the microtubules. Finally, to prevent the evaporation of the buffer inside the chamber during the experiment, the open ends of the flow chamber were sealed with clear nail polish.

The Mann–Whitney U test was used for comparing <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub> between w/o PEG and w/PEG, and for comparing Δ<italic>t</italic> between homozygous and heterozygous mutant combinations. The Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to compare <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub> across WT/WT, mutant/mutant, and mutant/WT combinations for each KIF1A mutant (P305L, V8M, A255V), followed by Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study uses a novel DNA origami nanospring to measure the stall force and other mechanical parameters of the kinesin-3 family member, KIF1A, using light microscopy. The key is to use SNAP tags to tether a defined nanospring between a motor-dead mutant of KIF5B and the KIF1A to be integrated. The mutant KIF5B binds tightly to a subunit of the microtubule without stepping, thus creating resistance to the processive advancement of the active KIF1A. The nanospring is conjugated with 124 Cy3 dyes, which allows it to be imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Acoustic force spectroscopy was used to measure the relationship between the extension of the NS and force as a calibration. Two different fitting methods are described to measure the length of the extension of the NS from its initial diffraction-limited spot. By measuring the extension of the NS during an experiment, the authors can determine the stall force. The attachment duration of the active motor is measured from the suppression of lateral movement that occurs when the KIF1A is attached and moving. There are numerous advantages of this technology for the study of single molecules of kinesin over previous studies using optical tweezers. First, it can be done using simple fluorescence microscopy and does not require the level of sophistication and expense needed to construct an optical tweezer apparatus. Second, the force that is experienced by the moving KIF1A is parallel to the plane of the microtubule. This regime can be achieved using a dual beam optical tweezer set-up, but in the more commonly used single-beam set-up, much of the force experienced by the kinesin is perpendicular to the microtubule. Recent studies have shown markedly different mechanical behaviors of kinesin when interrogated by the two different optical tweezer configurations. The data in the current manuscript are consistent with those obtained using the dual-beam optical tweezer set-up. In addition, the authors study the mechanical behavior of several mutants of KIF1A that are associated with KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The technique should be cheaper and less technically challenging than optical tweezer microscopy to measure the mechanical parameters of molecular motors. The method is described in sufficient detail to allow its use in other labs. It should have a higher throughput than other methods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The experimenter does not get a &quot;real-time&quot; view of the data as it is collected, which you get from the screen of an optical tweezer set-up. Rather, you have to put the data through the fitting routines to determine the length of the nanospring in order to generate the graphs of extension (force) vs time. No attempts were made to analyze the periods where the motor is actually moving to determine step-size or force-velocity relationships.</p>

<p>I am satisfied with the revision made by the authors in response to my first round of criticisms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work is important in my view because it complements other single-molecule mechanics approaches, in particular optical trapping, which inevitably exerts off-axis loads. The nanospring method has its own weaknesses (individual steps cannot be seen), but it brings new clarity to our picture of KIF1A and will influence future thinking on the kinesins-3 and on kinesins in general.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>By tethering single copies of the kinesin-3 dimer under test via a DNA nanospring to a strong binding mutant dimer of kinesin-1, the forces developed and experienced by the motor are constrained into a single axis, parallel to the microtubule axis. The method is imaging-based which should improve accessibility. In principle, at least, several single-motor molecules can be simultaneously tested. The arrangement ensures that only single molecules can contribute. Controls establish that the DNA nanospring is not itself interacting appreciably with the microtubule. Forces are convincingly calibrated and reading the length of the nanospring by fitting to the oblate fluorescent spot is carefully validated. The excursions of the wild type KIF1A leucine zipper-stabilised dimer are compared with those of neuropathic KIF1A mutants. These mutants can walk to a stall plateau, but the force is much reduced. The forces from mutant/WT heterodimers are also reduced.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The tethered nanospring method has some weaknesses; it only allows the stall force to be measured in the case that a stall plateau is achieved, and the thermal noise means that individual steps are not apparent. The nanospring does not behave like a Hookean spring - instead linearly increasing force is reported by exponentially smaller extensions of the nanospring under tension. The estimated stall force for Kif1A (3.8 pN) is in line with measurements made using 3 bead optical trapping, but those earlier measurements were not of a stall plateau, but rather of limiting termination (detachment) force, without a stall plateau.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have successfully addressed my previous criticisms.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for the careful reading of our manuscript and for the constructive comments. We have provided responses to each of the comments below.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate Reviewer #1’s accurate public review of our study on the kinesin motor using the DNA origami nanospring (NS). With respect to the strengths, we fully agree with Reviewer #1’s comments. Regarding the weakness, we would like to respond as follows.</p>
<p>It is true that, unlike optical tweezers, our method does not provide real-time data display. Optical tweezers enable real-time observation and manipulation of kinesin molecules at arbitrary time points. Achieving real-time observation and manipulation is indeed an important challenge for the future development of the NS technique. On the other hand, Iwaki et al. (our co-corresponding author) has already investigated dynamic properties of motor proteins under load, such as step size and force–velocity relationship of myosin VI using NS. We are now preparing high spatiotemporal resolution microscopy experiments on the KIF1A system to measure its step size and force–velocity relationship, which inherently require such resolution.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 Public Review</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the constructive comments of Reviewer #2, which have strengthened both the presentation and interpretation of our results.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Reviewer #2 for providing a highly accurate assessment of the strengths of our experiments. Regarding the weaknesses, we would like to respond as follows. First, Iwaki et al. (our co-corresponding author) have already succeeded in observing the stepping motion of myosin VI using the nanospring (NS) in their previous work. We are also currently preparing high spatiotemporal resolution microscopy experiments to observe the stepping motion of KIF1A in our system. Second, while it is true that the NS does not follow Hooke’s law, it is possible to design and construct NSs with an appropriate dynamic range by tuning the spring constant to match the forces exerted by protein molecules. Finally, we agree that our first observation of the stall plateau in KIF1A using the NS is a meaningful achievement. However, with respect to the suggestion that “increasing validity requires also studying kinesin-1,” we have a somewhat different perspective. The validity of the NS method has already been thoroughly examined in the previous work on myosin VI by Iwaki et al., where results were compared with those obtained using optical tweezers. Moreover, the focus of this manuscript is on KAND caused by KIF1A mutations. From this perspective, although we appreciate the suggestion, we consider it important to keep the present study focused on KIF1A and its implications for KAND.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors detect the attachments that occur during a processive run by KIF1A by monitoring the suppression of the angular fluctuations of the fluorescent signal and plot this, for example, in Figure 3a as the Length of the NS (which presumably is a readout of force) vs time. This interval includes the time when the KIF1A is actively moving along the MT and when it is stalled. It would be interesting to know the actual stall time of the motor in order to be able to calculate a detachment rate constant. For attachment periods such as the first example highlighted in pink in Figure 3a, the stall time is pretty much equal to the attachment time since the motor is moving so fast and the stall period is so long. However, for short attachment times such as the fifth pink interval shown in this same figure or the traces with the mutant KIF1As in Figure 4 this is not so. Can the authors institute a program to identify the periods where the motor has stretched the NS spring to the point where it stalls, and then calculate this time in order to do an exponential fit to the &quot;dwell time distribution&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>By introducing another criterion (see Methods, “Rate of relative increase in NS’s length”), the attachment duration was separated into the two time regions noted by the reviewer. After reanalyzing all the data, we evaluated only the stall duration this time. As a result, the estimated stall-force values became more reliable and accurate. The dwell time analysis of was performed and included in the supplementary material for WT KIF1A, for which sufficient data were available.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The histogram of stall events in Figure 3b is quite broad. Please discuss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The newly added distributions from individual molecules (Fig. 3b) show that the variety in the stall force distribution is not due to multiple molecules, but is primarily an intrinsic property of single KIF1A molecules reflecting the complex kinetics of KIF1A under load, including occasional backward steps and reattachments. In addition, because the nanospring is a non-linear spring, a disadvantage is that even small fluctuations in extension can result in a substantial deviation in the measured stall force. These points have been added to the Discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 3c, it is clear that for attachment times greater than 5s the attachment duration is independent of the Lstall, but this is not so clear for the short attachment durations. Some of this may relate to the fact that you're measuring attachment durations and not stall or dwell times as described in my first comment. Do you feel this is due to less precision in measuring the &quot;attachment duration&quot; during the short attachments, or just simply that more data is needed here? I assume that you do not want to imply that there is a load-dependence of the attachment durations here? Perhaps an expanded view of the data set from 0-10 seconds would clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in our response to comment (1), the stall durations were separated from the attachment durations. This improved the measurement accuracy and revealed that and are uncorrelated (Fig. 3c). We appreciate this constructive comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Off-axis forces are described as 'upward', 'perpendicular', and 'horizontal'. Consider referring to off-axis force, and if necessary, defining the direction of the force(s) relative to the axis of the immobilised MT. If necessary, a cartoon of XYZ axes might be added to F1c?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>An XZ axis was added to the schematic in Fig. 1c.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) If I understand correctly, stall forces are calculated by averaging the entire region in which the angular fluctuation is reduced below a threshold. In cases like the 3rd and 7th events on the trace in F1a, this will reduce the average. Perhaps consider separately averaging the later time points in each stall event? Perhaps also consider correlating the angular fluctuation signals and the spring length signal? Some fluctuations during stall plateaus might indicate slip back and re-engage events?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Instead of separately averaging the later time points in each stall event, we separated the stall force duration from the overall attachment duration (Fig. 3). This allowed us to obtain more accurate stall force values. The relationship between the NS length and the angular fluctuation during KIF1A slip-back events differed among individual stall events, and no clear trend was observed. Two representative examples are shown in the Author response image 1.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Please describe all relevant methods fully instead of referencing previous work. For example, nanospring preparation refers readers to reference 21 (which in turn references an earlier paper).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We revised the Methods section to include the procedures described in the previous reference, and we added the sequence information of the DNA origami to the supplementary information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Were any experiments tried at reduced ATP concentration?</p>
<p>(5) Were any data obtained from WT KIF5B? For kinesin-1, stall plateau forces of &gt;7 pN are obtained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This study focused on comparing the stall forces of wild-type and KAND-related mutant KIF1A molecules under physiological ATP conditions, as our main goal was to characterize the disease-relevant phenotypes. Experiments at reduced ATP concentrations and with WT KIF5B are indeed important future directions but are beyond the scope of the present study. These follow-up experiments are currently in progress.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 1b, consider showing the attachment to the mutant KIF5B, and reversing the orientation so it corresponds to Figure 1c.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>KIF1A and KIF5B share the same binding method, so to indicate that the schematic in Fig. 1b represents both, we replaced ‘KIF1A’ with ‘Kinesin’.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 3d, add force axis. In general, please re-check all force axes. In Supplement S3, the stall plateau labels appear well above their corresponding axis ticks. In Figure 4, several mutants appear to be stalling at well over 5 pN, yet Table 1 gives a much lower value. Presumably, this reflects averaging effects?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the force axis to Fig. 3d. Besides, we corrected Fig. S3 and Fig. 4 because there were errors in the conversion from length to force. As the reviewer pointed out, the apparent discrepancy between the force values in Fig. 4 and Table 1 arises mainly from averaging effects.</p>
