<abstract>
<p>To better understand cognitive processes, it is essential to examine the interplay between periodic (oscillatory) and aperiodic electrophysiological brain activity. In this study, we aim to clarify how the periodic and aperiodic electrophysiological components respectively reflect the cognitive processes involved in working memory. Fiftyseven participants performed an n-back task while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. The analysis of both components of the EEG spectrum during task performance indicate that both periodic and aperiodic activities exhibit distinct taskrelated spatiotemporal dynamics that are closely related to cognitive demands. The results indicate that the substantial changes traditionally attributed to theta oscillations in working memory tasks are, in fact, due to shifts in the spectral slope of aperiodic activity. This suggests that the modulation of aperiodic activity associated with cognitive control processes may provide a more sensitive index of cognitive state changes than previously recognised. To validate our findings, we also used these analysis methods in another working memory task, which showed similar patterns of periodic and aperiodic activity. Our findings challenge the conventional understanding of theta oscillations in cognitive processing and question the routine practice of EEG baseline correction in time-frequency analysis, which may obscure significant modulations in continuous working memory tasks. Consequently, the inclusion of aperiodic activity as a fundamental component of EEG analysis is critical to the accurate representation of the neural basis of cognition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Working memory is a crucial cognitive ability that enables goal-directed behaviour and higher cognitive function. It involves the ability to maintain and manipulate information in the absence of sensory stimuli in support of an ongoing task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baddeley, 2012</xref>) and is dependent on a complex set of cognitive processes and neural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wager and Smith, 2003</xref>). Due to its core role in cognition, working memory has been an object of intense research interest in cognitive neuroscience including electroencephalography (EEG). This method allows for time-frequency analysis of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cohen, 2014</xref>), which typically focuses on changes within predefined frequency bands. One frequently used experimental paradigm for studying working memory mechanisms using time-frequency analysis is the n-back task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This task integrates key working memory processes such as encoding, maintenance, updating, and recall of stored information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Owen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gevins et al., 1997</xref>). Power spectra dynamics in this ongoing working memory task are typically attributed to oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coleman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pesonen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen and Huang, 2016</xref>). Theta oscillations (4–8 Hz) are often shown to play a significant role in cognitive control and working memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palomäki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scharinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pesonen et al., 2007</xref>), while event-related responses in the alpha (6–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) range have been linked to attention and other cognitive processes, related to working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Krause et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gevins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coleman et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Schematic representation of the n-back task.</title>
<p>The n-back working memory task was conducted in two distinct modalities: visuospatial and verbal. In the 2-back condition, participants had to identify whether the current stimulus matched the one presented two steps previously. In the visuospatial modality, the target was a spatial location, whereas in the verbal modality, the target was a letter. In the 0-back condition participants’ task was to respond to a predefined target, with the type of target corresponding to the task modality. Target stimuli are highlighted in orange.</p></caption>

<p>EEG power spectra are characterised by 1<italic>/f</italic> power scaling, i.e. power decreases as frequency increases, introducing the aperiodic component into the analytical framework. This component complicates interpretation of the results by potentially obscuring changes in periodic (oscillatory) activity, as it represents a continuous spectrum of activity that does not conform to discrete oscillatory patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cohen, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Donoghue et al., 2020b</xref>). To overcome this challenge and to improve the clarity of task-related changes in time-frequency analysis, baseline correction is often used.</p>
<p>Baseline correction aims to normalise the data by subtracting the aperiodic background in order to isolate and examine the oscillatory dynamics more clearly. However, there are two main problems with the use of baseline correction. First, the n-back task requires continuous cognitive processes such as information maintenance during inter-trial-interval, most commonly used to estimate baseline activity, resulting in no neutral (pre-stimulus) baseline activity to which to compare stimulus-related processing and responses. Second, the use of baseline correction methods (implicitly) assumes that aperiodic activity remains stable over time and is dismissed as background noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gyurkovics et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Merkin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Donoghue et al., 2020b</xref>), and therefore its dynamics are not taken into account.</p>
<p>Recent studies investigating task-related fluctuations in aperiodic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Virtue-Griffiths et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akbarian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kałamała et al., 2024</xref>) have shown that ignoring these dynamics can distort oscillatory measurements and obscure important physiological and behavioural information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gyurkovics et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Donoghue et al., 2020a</xref>). Thus, subtracting baseline activity removes important information, whereas not doing so makes it difficult to observe significant task-related changes. Our aim is to reassess previous interpretations obtained through conventional EEG analysis methods by investigating the respective contributions of aperiodic and periodic (oscillatory) activity to the overall power spectrum dynamics (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) during the n-back task, without losing important information that baseline correction might introduce.</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 2.</label>
<caption><title>Schematic of the analysis.</title>
<p>The time domain data were first transformed into the time-frequency domain by convolution with superlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Moca et al., 2021</xref>). Next, the periodic and aperiodic components of the power spectrum density were estimated for each time point using FOOOF (Fitting Oscillations and One-Over-F) algorithm (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Donoghue et al., 2020b</xref>). The aperiodic component was further separated into the slope (exponent) and offset components.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The common approach to time-frequency analysis assumes that the observed peaks in the measured power spectrum mainly reflect modulations of periodic activity. In fact, the presence of power in a particular frequency band is not necessarily indicative of oscillatory dynamics, as aperiodic activity can make up a significant proportion of the observed power spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bullock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Donoghue et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">2022</xref>). Computa-tional modelling has suggested that the aperiodic activity measured by EEG reflects the balance between excitation and inhibition (E:I) of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lim and Goldman, 2013</xref>), which is essential for efficient cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmad et al., 2022</xref>). Aperiodic activity spans the entire frequency range, varies continuously, and can be described by a linear slope when plotted in semi-logarithmic space (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Donoghue et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">He, 2014</xref>). A steeper slope indicates higher power at low frequencies, often associated with more intense cognitive processing, while a flatter slope signals more even power distribution across frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kałamała et al., 2024</xref>), possibly indicating a less engaged brain, weaker E:I balance and lower cognitive performance, including working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akbarian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kałamała et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lendner et al., 2023</xref>). Variations in aperiodic slope have been found to be modulated by age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dave et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Merkin et al., 2023</xref>) and mental state (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Donoghue et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Podvalny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Waschke et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, task-related changes in overall power, typically interpreted as oscillatory dynamics, may be significantly co-modulated by the aperiodic slope shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akbarian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Virtue-Griffiths et al., 2022</xref>) Given these recent demonstrations of the functional role of aperiodic activity and its dynamics, it’s methodologically imperative to carefully parameterise both periodic and aperiodic spectral features of an EEG before interpreting time-frequency analysis results.</p>
<p>In this study, we aim to explore the distinct role of the aperiodic component in the n-back task and investigate possible differences between aperiodic and periodic components in relation to the cognitive demands of the task. This focus on the aperiodic component offers a novel perspective on working memory mechanisms. Furthermore, we question the influence of commonly used baseline correction methods on the measurement of oscillatory activity, which is in line with the investigation of aperiodic activity dynamics. Unaccounted-for aperiodic activity might have biased the measures of oscillatory dynamics reported in previous n-back studies, while its own dynamics were not investigated.</p>
<p>The study’s main objective is to investigate whether the dynamics of aperiodic activity in the n-back task are influenced by memory load, stimulus type, or modality. We expect to replicate a steepening aperiodic slope after the stimulus onset, as previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akbarian et al. (2023)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Virtue-Griffiths et al. (2022)</xref>.</p>
<p>Our study builds on previous research by using high temporal resolution data to investigate the dynamics of the aperiodic slope in two modalities (visuospatial/verbal). Additionally, in contrast to other n-back studies that examine peristimulus intervals using discrete time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akbarian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kałamała et al., 2024</xref>), we analyse the activity at each time point within this range, offering a more detailed perspective. It is important not to overlook possible fluctuations in the aperiodic slope that may occur in short time periods, as they may provide valuable insights into the dynamics of aperiodic activity during the continuous working memory task.</p>
<p>We hypothesised that the aperiodic slope would be modulated by the processing demands of the n-back task, and that this modulation would vary according to differences in load and stimulus type. We did not expect modality-dependent differences in aperiodic activity, as the modulation of the post-stimulus slope suggests a global inhibitory response in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The reason for our focused examination of aperiodic activity is its potential to redefine our understanding of cognitive workload and efficiency in working memory tasks. Additionally, we aim to provide a novel perspective on the dynamic interplay between aperiodic and periodic activities during the n-back task. By distinguishing between these two types of activities, this study addresses the baseline correction problem inherent in continuous tasks and the evolving nature of aperiodic activity. Our research aims to fill a critical gap in the existing literature by dissecting the unique contributions of aperiodic and periodic activities.</p>
<p>To test the generalisability of our findings, we applied our method on two additional studies. First, to see whether results could be replicated on an equivalent task, we analysed a publicly available dataset in which middle-aged participants performed a verbal n-back task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nakuci et al., 2023</xref>). Second, to explore whether results can be replicated on a different task, we analysed data from an item-recognition task (Sternberg, 1969) in which participants were shown a set of visual stimuli, asked to maintain their color, position or both over a short delay, and report whether the probe shown after the delay matched the items in memory. This allowed us to investigate whether the initial findings generalise to different working memory tasks.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We analysed the EEG data from the visuospatial and verbal n-back tasks. We transformed the data into the time-frequency domain by convolving it with super-lets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Moca et al., 2021</xref>). Subsequently, we applied the FOOOF (Fitting Oscillations and One-Over-F) algorithm (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Donoghue et al., 2020b</xref>) to decompose the activity into periodic and aperiodic components (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Changes in aperiodic activity appear as theta activity in baseline corrected time-frequency plots</title>
<p>As the first step of our analysis, we compared periodic and aperiodic activity with baseline-corrected time-frequency activity. In the baseline-corrected time-frequency plot, we observed a decrease in alpha and beta power up to 1 second post-stimulus, while theta power increased from 0 seconds post-stimulus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Figure S11</xref>). The observed pattern was minimally affected by the choice of baseline (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). Notably, when we examined periodic activity, we only observed changes in alpha and beta, while theta activity was absent, presumably because it reflected aperiodic activity rather than oscillations.</p>

<p>Illustration of the effect of baseline correction and FOOOF decomposition on EEG time-frequency analysis. (<bold>A</bold>) “Raw” total power from time-frequency decomposition is difficult to interpret due to the 1<italic>/f</italic> power scaling of EEG power spectra (here representing average data across subjects, channels and conditions). In panel <bold>B</bold> we applied baseline correction (decibel conversion) using a pre-stimulus interval of -0.5 to -0.2 seconds for comparison. The baseline correction showed a significant decrease in alpha and beta power from 0 to 1 second and a concomitant increase in theta power lasting up to 2 seconds. The observed changes were very similar across different choices of baseline correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1</xref>). However, it’s unclear from the baseline-corrected data whether the changes in theta power are oscillatory or aperiodic. Separation into periodic (<bold>C</bold>) and aperiodic (<bold>D</bold>) components shows that changes in theta power are due to changes in aperiodic activity.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>To further confirm the absence of theta in periodic activity across our sample, we examined individual power spectra (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Despite considerable heterogeneity among participants, we observed a distinct theta peak in only two participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Periodic activity changes with working memory load, stimulus type and modality</title>
<p>Next, we examined the differences in periodic activity as a function of task conditions. We observed a decrease in the alpha and beta bands of periodic activity in the 2-back compared to the 0-back condition over the entire trial period and over the entire scalp (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, we found a greater decrease in alpha and beta power in response to targets compared to non-targets. In addition, we observed a correlation between beta power and reaction times in central channels. This correlation was positive in the early period (up to 0.5 seconds post-stimulus) and negative in the late period (1–2 seconds post-stimulus). Finally, we observed an interaction between modality and stimulus type in the time period from 0.5 to 1 second post-stimulus, reflecting a greater difference between target and non-target stimuli in the verbal task in the alpha and beta bands compared to the visuospatial task (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<p>Significant values are highlighted on the heatmap and marked with yellow circles on the topographies. Only factors with significant differences are shown. A p-value was interpreted as significant if it was significant in at least 3 channels or 3 time points (see Methods for details). Note that there are small discrepancies between significant values on heatmaps and topographies due to averaging across time or channels. A significant difference was observed between the 2-back and 0-back conditions, with a reduction in activity in the 2-back condition, particularly in the alpha and beta frequency bands, starting at 0.5 seconds post-stimulus. The differences between stimulus types were most evident from 0.3 to 1 second post-stimulus, with decreased activity for targets compared to non-targets across the whole scalp. Additionally, a smaller effect of the modality × stimulus type interaction was observed from 0.6 to 1 second post-stimulus (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3</xref> for detailed visualisation of the interaction). Associations with reaction times were significant in the beta band across central channels. These associations exhibited a positive correlation in the early phase (0 to 0.5 seconds) and a negative correlation in the later phase (1 to 1.5 seconds).</p></caption>

<title>Aperiodic activity has frontal and parietal components</title>
<p>We analysed the aperiodic activity separately for the parameters offset and exponent (slope). We observed two distinct components (peaks) in the time course of the exponent (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The first component peaked at around 0.3 s after stimulus onset and was most pronounced in frontal channels, whereas the second component peaked at around 0.7 s post-stimulus and was most pronounced in parietal channels. The exponent exhibited significant differences between stimulus types (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Specifically, the exponent was larger for targets at approximately 0.3 seconds and for non-targets at approximately 0.7 seconds post-stimulus. We observed no other differences between conditions.

<title>Aperiodic activity does not reflect event-related potentials</title>
<p>To ensure that the aperiodic activity identified in our study did not simply reflect event-related potentials (ERPs), we systematically removed evoked activity from the data prior to conducting the time-frequency analysis. We then performed a correlation analysis between the topographies of ERPs and aperiodic activity for each time point, condition, and participant. We found the correlation between ERPs and aperiodic activity to be consistently low, with a value of approximately 0.25 or lower (see <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>). This was observed throughout the entire time period examined.</p>
<p>In addition, we performed FOOOF decomposition on data that did not undergo ERP subtraction.

<title>Replication confirms main findings</title>
<p>To ensure the generalisability of the findings, we repeated all analyses using two additional datasets. First we analysed a publicly available dataset from a previously published study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nakuci et al. (2023)</xref>, in which participants performed a verbal n-back task with three load levels (0-, 1-, 2-back). Next, we analysed the data from an item-recognition task.</p>
<p>In both analyses, we were able to replicate the main findings previously reported, namely the task-related modulation of periodic alpha and beta activity and the task-related changes in aperiodic activity. In the baseline-corrected data, we observed a decrease in alpha and beta power accompanied by an increase in theta power (<xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Figure S11B</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Theta oscillations were not evident in the grand average periodic activity (<xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Figure S11C</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref rid="figS24" ref-type="fig">Figure S24</xref>) and were only detected in two participants in the n-back task (<xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12</xref>). In the item-recognition task, theta oscillations were present in approximately one-third of the participants (<xref rid="figS23" ref-type="fig">Figure S23</xref>).

<p>Similar to the n-back task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">Figure S11</xref>), a decrease in alpha power is observed following instruction and stimuli presentation (up to 0.8 seconds) and continues throughout the retention period, up to 2.8 seconds post-stimulus (<bold>B</bold>). This is followed by a decrease in alpha and beta power during probe presentation, which is likely indicative of a motor response. Simultaneously, there is an increase in theta power, which is most pronounced during stimulus presentation (up to 0.8 seconds) and again after probe presentation (after 2.8 seconds). The FOOOF decomposition indicates that theta activity is predominantly aperiodic (<bold>C, D</bold>).

<p>Regarding aperiodic activity, we observed frontal and parietal/occipital components in both tasks. In the item-recognition task, these components were clearly observable only for the offset parameter, whereas for the exponent, the two components were not clearly distinguishable, likely due to lower spatial resolution (32 channels). In both tasks, aperiodic activity was modulated by task demands, with an increase in aperiodic slope following stimuli presentation and following response (<xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Figure S15</xref>, <xref rid="figS21" ref-type="fig">Figure S21</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between periodic and aperiodic neural activity during the n-back task. EEG data recorded from 57 participants performing both 0-back and 2-back tasks in visuospatial and verbal modalities were analysed to distinguish these two components within the EEG frequency spectrum. The analysis shows the presence of periodic activity in the alpha/beta frequency range prior to stimulus onset, which modulates according to task demands. Furthermore, our results show that theta activity appears to be largely a consequence of the effect of baseline correction on aperiodic activity, which also exhibits its own task-related dynamics. This insight is crucial for the interpretation of EEG results, especially for continuous tasks such as the n-back, which require sustained working memory engagement. In addition to the interplay between the periodic and aperiodic EEG activity, the study expands on the findings of stimulus-induced spectral slope shift by identifying two neural components within the aperiodic activity. These aperiodic components are distinguished by their frontal and posterior topographic locations. Additionally, we observed task-dependent differences, including a slightly different slope modulation in non-target compared to target trials. However, we did not find any differences between modalities. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of the neural dynamics involved in cognitive processes during a continuous working memory task.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Disentangling periodic and aperiodic components in EEG activity: avoiding baseline correction</title>
<p>Our analysis of the EEG data shows that when baseline correction is applied to the total EEG activity, changes in alpha, beta and theta activity are observed following stimulus presentation compared to the pre-stimulus interval (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In particular, there is a significant increase in theta power after the stimulus, while a decrease in power in the alpha-beta spectrum is observed for some time after the stimulus presentation. These findings are consistent with previous n-back studies reporting that the presentation of both target and non-target stimuli elicits long-lasting increases in theta power and decreases in alpha/beta power at stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palomäki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Krause et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coleman et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Omitting baseline correction and decomposing the total EEG activity into periodic and aperiodic components provides a more nuanced insight into the dynamics of the spectra, showing that alpha and beta activities remain oscillatory while the theta activity “disappears” from the periodic component. We find that the apparent theta activity, rather than oscillatory activity, reflects changes in the aperiodic component, which is manifested as a post-stimulus increase in theta power under baseline correction in time-frequency analysis of the full EEG spectrum. Given our current understanding of aperiodic activity, specifically based on the findings of post-stimulus slope steepening in the context of increased cognitive demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akbarian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Virtue-Griffiths et al., 2022</xref>), our results suggests that the change in theta-range activ-ity is a result of aperiodic slope modulation rather than a significant increase in oscillatory activity within the theta band. In contrast, alpha and beta activity remain present as part of the periodic component throughout the task.</p>
<p>Our results clearly indicate that the classical baseline correction approach can subtract a significant amount of continuous periodic activity, while aperiodic activity is ignored as stationary and may even be misinterpreted as an increase in post-stimulus theta oscillations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>The modulation of periodic activity is concentrated in the alpha and beta bands</title>
<p>When decomposing the EEG signal into periodic and aperiodic components we still observed a significant attenuation in the power of alpha and beta oscillations after stimulus presentation (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This is in line with existing literature that documents the decrease of post-stimulus alpha and beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Krause et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coleman et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, our results support previously reported increased suppressive response that is elicited by target stimuli compared to non-target stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palomäki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Peng et al., 2015</xref>), especially in the alpha range (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). Our findings support existing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pesonen et al., 2007</xref>) by demonstrating that reductions in alpha and beta powers are more pronounced and have longer duration under increased task demands, as is typical of higher loads in n-back tasks (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Consistent with seminal work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gevins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pesonen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Krause et al., 2010</xref>), our data show that working memory load mainly affects alpha/beta power in the parietal-occipital electrodes (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In n-back tasks, diminished alpha power is thought to indicate increased engagement in working memory operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Haegens et al., 2014</xref>). The functional significance of beta oscillations remains a topic of debate, with studies often linking centrally located beta oscillations to the coordination of motor responses (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pavlov and Kotchoubey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pfurtscheller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaiser et al., 2001</xref>). However, recent research indicates that they also play a crucial role in working memory, par-ticularly in supporting the maintenance of memorised information and preventing distractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">HajiHosseini et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, beta oscillations are believed to facilitate the manipulation of stored information, dynamically adjusting to meet task demands and to serve a gating function by inhibiting irrelevant inputs, thus enhancing cognitive efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">ElShafei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The strong correlation between alpha and lower beta range activities in central regions, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, which also aligns with reaction times, indicates that beta activity, typically associated with motor functions, is most pronounced in the central electrodes. We also observed alpha/beta activities in the posterior regions, which support current theories that suggest a collaborative function for alpha and beta oscillations in supporting advanced cognitive functions such as working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scharinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coleman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hanslmayr et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, our analyses show that theta-range activities do not necessarily exhibit an oscillatory characteristic during the n-back task (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). After thorough evaluation at the individual level (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>), we found that only two participants exhibited evident theta peak, while only one participant exhibited pronounced theta and alpha peaks. The majority of participants exhibited alpha peaks, while only two participants displayed a theta peak and no substantial alpha activity. This suggests the presence of a low-frequency activity associated with the cognitive demands of the n-back task which might be related to the same cognitive process, but there is notable between-subject and potential within-subject variability depending on task demands.</p>

<title>Aperiodic activity dynamics and their cognitive implications</title>
<p>Our analysis of aperiodic activity at each time point within the peristimulus interval builds upon prior research that has documented stimulus-induced changes in the aperiodic component, specifically the post-stimulus steepening of the spectral slope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Virtue-Griffiths et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kałamała et al., 2024</xref>). Our data indicate the presence of two components in the dynamics of the aperiodic slope during the n-back task, differentiated both temporally and spatially.</p>
<p>In terms of temporality, the first component appears early in the task cycle, whereas the second component appears at a later stage (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The presence of these components differs between target and non-target stimuli, with a more pronounced difference for the second component (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). While non-target stimuli consistently exhibit a clear second component, in the case of target stimuli, the slope returns to its base-line steepness more quickly, with a significantly reduced or non-existent second slope steepening. This raises the question of whether the two components represent distinct cognitive operations inherent to the n-back task.</p>
<p>We speculate that the second component that emerges with greater prominence following non-target stimuli may be indicative of an elevated state of vigilance. It is uncommon for a target stimulus to be immediately succeeded by another; typically, a non-target stimulus follows. Consequently, participants may become accustomed to a period of ‘rest’ following a target stimulus, as the anticipation for another is low. The increased slope of the aperiodic activity may be indicative of the level of alertness for potential target stimuli. In contrast, after target stimuli, a reduction in alertness follows, leading to a quicker return to baseline, with no significant second increase in slope steepness.</p>
<p>As previously stated, the two aperiodic components also exhibit distinct spatial manifestations. The first component is predominantly observed on the frontal electrodes, wheres the second component is also present in the posterior channels. This difference in topography further supports the hypothesis that the two components reflect different cognitive processes. The activation in the parietal channels may be related to anticipatory mechanisms for the next stimulus, whereas the activation in the frontal channels may be involved in the decision-making process regarding the classification of the previous stimulus as a target.</p>
<p>Overall, our results strongly suggest that solely examining total EEG power or oscillatory dynamics, without distinctively analysing the aperiodic slope dynamics, would overlook a subtle yet potentially significant cognitive processing feature. This feature may be related to distinct working memory processes, which warrants further research.</p>
<p>Importantly, to exclude the possibility that aperiodic activity simply reflects the task-evoked EEG activity (i.e., event-related potentials; ERPs; see <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>), ERPs were subtracted before performing the time-frequency decomposition. We observed low correlations between the ERPs and aperiodic activity (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that the task demands within the n-back paradigm manifest in aperiodic modulations that are distinct from other evoked EEG activity. We also repeated the analysis without subtracting the ERPs (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>, <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>, <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10</xref>), and the results were largely similar. Our findings are consistent with previous research that has consistently observed systematic, stimulus-induced changes in the aperiodic component that are distinct from concurrent stimulus-evoked EEG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kałamała et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Virtue-Griffiths et al., 2022</xref>). Our findings further highlight the importance of acknowledging the unique characteristics of aperiodic activity, particularly in the context of the n-back task.</p>

<title>Interplay of periodic and aperiodic EEG components</title>
<p>The relationship between periodic and aperiodic EEG activities during the n-back task reveals a complicated pattern of cognitive engagement. Following stimulus presentation, our analysis, shows an almost immediate aperiodic slope increase in the fronto-central channels (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), followed by a brief alpha/beta attenuation in the posterior channels (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Both of these features have been associated with inhibitory processes that temporarily disrupt ongoing excitatory activity to allow the brain to engage with the presented stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kałamała et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gevins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pesonen et al., 2007</xref>). Our results show that both the alpha/beta suppression and the aperiodic change in slope are more pronounced after target stimuli compared to non-target stimuli (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These observations may indicate greater cognitive engagement associated with decision-making processes following the onset of the target stimulus.</p>
<p>Further analysis of our data shows a significant difference between the 0-back and 2-back conditions in the periodic component (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), indicating more sustained alpha/beta suppression in the 2-back condition, whereas the aperiodic component did not show such spectral slope differences. Sustained suppression of periodic alpha and beta activity during the 2-back condition may reflect ongoing active engagement in the form of information encoding, retention, and updating. This finding suggests that the periodic and aperiodic components may reflect distinct cognitive processes. The characteristics of the second component in the aperiodic slope after non-target stimuli (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), with no obvious co-occurring processes in the periodic component, further support this idea. It is important to analyse both components to ensure that the processes they reflect are not overlooked.</p>
<p>Our data show a clear distinction between the periodic and aperiodic components in relation to reaction times. Our results support the association between central beta activity and motor planning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Eggermont, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pfurtscheller et al., 1998</xref>), as evidenced by its correlation with reaction times in our analysis of the periodic component (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, our analysis indicates a weak correlation between the dynamics of the aperiodic component and reaction times (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This observation differs from the most commonly reported patterns (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Thuwal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akbarian et al., 2023</xref>), but the evidence remains inconclusive, as some studies have reported contrasting results (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Monchy et al., 2023</xref>). The discrepancy highlights the need for further research to understand how different factors influence the manifestation of the aperiodic component as a reflection of cognitive processes.</p>
<p>Prior studies have consistently reported sustained elevations in theta power during the n-back task (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palomäki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Krause et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pesonen et al., 2007</xref>). These increases, particularly in the frontal cortex, have been linked to various cognitive functions such as attention, information encoding, and cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roux and Uhlhaas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rossi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</xref>). While theta activity can indeed be oscillatory, as demonstrated in some studies, the sustained theta activity observed in our scalp EEG data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) appears predominantly aperiodic, with post-stimulus increases more likely attributable to shifts in spectral slope than to oscillatory changes. Theta activity can represent either oscillatory or aperiodic activity, but careful distinction between these components is necessary to avoid potential misinterpretation of theta dynamics. Nevertheless, previously reported patterns of theta modulation are consistent with the notion that post-stimulus changes in aperiodic activity may reflect enhanced inhibitory control commensurate with task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gao et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Analyses of control data from a previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nakuci et al., 2023</xref>) confirmed our initial results, indicating that similar task-related modulations in alpha and beta periodic activities, as well as aperiodic activity dynamics, can be divided into frontal and parietal components. However, although both aperiodic components were observed in the alternative dataset, their temporal differentiation was less pronounced (<xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Figure S15</xref>, <xref rid="figS17" ref-type="fig">Figure S17</xref>). Notably, in this comparative dataset the exponent was only related to task load, with an increased exponent for the 2-back level, and not to stimulus type (<xref rid="figS16" ref-type="fig">Figure S16</xref>). Furthermore, in the comparative dataset there was an association with reaction times in the parietal channels, more so than in our original dataset. Nevertheless, the results of the replication analysis serve to reinforce the robustness of our insights. In particular, the similarities observed in the modulation of thetalike activity attributed to aperiodic shifts provide a crucial validation of our conclusions regarding the nature of theta activity and the aperiodic component.</p>

<title>Main findings are consistent in the item-recognition task</title>
<p>To test whether our results generalise across different task paradigms, we applied the same methods to the item-recognition task, which showed similar dynamics despite the different mechanisms of memory maintenance and the non-continuous nature of the task. In particular, while changes in the theta band were evident in the baseline corrected data, there were no theta oscillations in the periodic activity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This cross-task confirmation strengthens the robustness of our conclusions across different working memory tasks.</p>

<sec id="s3f">
<title>Theoretical and methodological implications</title>
<p>Our study highlights the need for refined EEG analysis methods that take into account the dynamic nature of both periodic and aperiodic components during cognitive tasks. Our findings indicate a need for a methodological shift in baseline correction techniques, particularly in continuous cognitive tasks where traditional baseline subtraction can obscure significant neural dynamics by misrepresenting aperiodic activity as thetaband oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gyurkovics et al., 2021</xref>). This misrepresentation is of importance, as baseline corrections, designed to normalise data, may inadvertently distort the true nature of neural activities, especially under conditions of sustained cognitive demand. Further investigation is warranted to explore how changes in the aperiodic component’s slope might underlie the commonly observed increases in frontal theta activity, traditionally documented as theta oscillations. In order to validate this hypothesis, future research should extend to a wider range of working memory and cognitive control tasks.</p>
<p>The aperiodic slope dynamics observed during the n-back task in our study align with the E:I balance framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vogels and Abbott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lim and Goldman, 2013</xref>). Specifically, our results suggest that stimulus-induced shifts in the aperiodic slope likely reflect a proportional modulation of ongoing excitatory activities tailored to meet processing demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Virtue-Griffiths et al., 2022</xref>). These adjustments in the post-stimulus aperiodic component may signify enhanced inhibitory control, which has implications for cognitive control capacities previously associated with changes in the frontal theta-band activity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scharinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ratcliffe et al., 2022</xref>). Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that modifications in aperiodic activity following cognitive load could serve as a reliable index of cognitive control mechanisms. Future studies should consider aperiodic dynamics as a potential biomarker for cognitive control, investigating how these measures correlate with traditional indicators and whether they can predict cognitive performance across different task contexts.</p>
<p>To better understand the functional role of the observed second component in the aperiodic activity (second slope steepening) following non-target trials, a study design incorporating a larger dataset with an increased number of target-followed-by-target sequences is essential. This would enable a detailed comparison of aperiodic slope components in scenarios where a target is succeeded by another target versus when it is followed by a non-target, potentially revealing how attentional mechanisms are reset or sustained under different conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, investigating the interplay between aperiodic slope dynamics and theta oscillations in tasks requiring enhanced cognitive control could provide deeper insights into the neural basis of cognitive flexibility and decision-making. It is also imperative to consider individual variations in theta range dynamics and their relationship with aperiodic slope modulation, as this could highlight potential biomarkers for cognitive efficiency or susceptibility to cognitive fatigue.</p>
<p>Finally, our findings challenge the established methodologies and interpretations of EEG-measured cross-frequency coupling, particularly phase-amplitude coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tort et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Van Der Meij et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tseng et al., 2019</xref>). While numerous studies have demonstrated the modulation of gamma amplitude by the phase of theta (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Köster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goodman et al., 2018</xref>), which is believed to organise information in working memory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rajji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brooks et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">McGill and Kieffaber, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goodman et al., 2018</xref>), our findings suggest that theta dynamics, as measured with scalp EEG, are predominantly a result of aperiodic shifts. Consequently, it may not always be appropriate to assume that theta activity is inherently oscillatory when analysing phenomena such as theta-gamma coupling. This observation challenges the traditional interpretation of how theta and gamma activities interact during cognitive processes. To ensure accuracy in future studies of cross-frequency coupling such as theta-gamma coupling, it is crucial to verify that theta activity is truly oscillatory before proceeding with analyses.</p>

<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>The main strength of our study is the replication of key findings by performing the same analyses on two independent samples. Replication of the results in an independent sample of younger individuals performing a standard verbal n-back task extends the generalisability of our findings beyond the original cohort of older adults. Furthermore, replication of these results in the item-recognition task demonstrates the robustness of our conclusions across different task paradigms.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations that need to be considered. First, the task difficulty in the 2-back condition may have been too high. Some participants had to be excluded from the analysis due to poor performance. This exclusion may have reduced the range of cognitive abilities in the sample of older adults, potentially inflating them.</p>
<p>In addition, the higher level of difficulty in the tasks may have influenced the observed differences between the 0-back and 2-back conditions, potentially affecting the magnitude and direction of the reported neural modulations. For our sample of older adults, a simplified 2-back task using a single modality may have been more appropriate. The single modality (verbal, with letters displayed in the centre of the screen) may help to reduce task complexity and align better with the cognitive abilities of older participants. In addition, the dual-modality task imposed time constraints that limited the number of trials for each condition, potentially leading to participant fatigue and reduced data quality.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study highlights the critical importance of distinguishing between the periodic and aperiodic components of the EEG spectrum in order to ensure accurate interpretation of changes traditionally attributed to oscillatory activity. Using the n-back task, we have demonstrated that the aperiodic component, which is often dismissed as mere background noise, reflects important features of cognitive processing. Our findings also challenge the routine practice of baseline correction, which can obscure crucial modulations of aperiodic activity, particularly in continuous cognitive tasks. It is important to note that a considerable proportion of the theta activity commonly observed in scalp EEG may actually be due to shifts in the aperiodic slope. It is therefore essential to independently verify whether the observed theta activity is genuinely oscillatory or primarily aperiodic. This is of utmost importance for accurately deciphering the neural underpinnings of working memory and cognitive control, and indicates a need for a paradigm shift in the analysis and interpretation of EEG data.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s5a">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We analysed EEG recordings from fifty-seven volunteers (nine males) aged 55–78 years (M = 67.4, SD = 6.4), who initially participated in a study on subjective cognitive complaints. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were free from neurological or psychiatric illness or cognitive decline, as assessed by neuropsychological testing prior to study entry. Of these participants, twenty-seven reported subjective cognitive complaints, while thirty did not. Our current study focused exclusively on within-subject comparisons and did not investigate subjective cognitive complaints or between-group differences. We excluded data from 10 participants from all analyses due to poor quality.</p>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Republic of Slovenia (protocol number 0120-128/2019/9; 21.08.2019). All study participants gave written informed consent prior to the initiation of any study-related procedures.</p>

<title>Experimental task and procedure</title>
<p>The participants were instructed to press the left button when the letter or position matched the letter/position n-back trials before (i.e. on target trials), and the right button otherwise (on non-target trials). Some of the stimuli were lures, i.e. stimuli that would have been considered targets in the 1-back condition but appeared during the 2-back condition.</p>
<p>The participants completed the n-back task in two modalities (visuospatial and verbal) with two load conditions (0- and 2-back) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). During the task, participants were presented with white capital letters on a grey background one at a time in one of nine possible positions, in a continuous sequence. Each letter was presented on the screen for 250 ms, followed by a 3000 ms interval during which participants were required to respond. In the verbal task conditions, participants were instructed to memorise the presented letter, whereas in the visuospatial task conditions, participants were asked to memorise the position of the presented letter. The order of modality was counterbalanced across participants.</p>
<p>Each modality always began with the 0-back load condition in which the target stimulus was presented for 10 seconds at the beginning of the block and stayed the same throughout the whole block. The 0-back load condition was followed by a 2-back load condition of the same modality, where participants had to remember each stimulus as it appeared and discern whether it matched the one displayed two trials prior. The 0-back and 2-back load conditions each comprised three 5-minute blocks of continuously presented stimuli. For each modality, the 0-back load condition comprised a total of 201 stimuli, 39 of which were targets, and the 2-back load condition comprised a total of 240 stimuli, 39 of which were targets, and 30 were lures. All stimuli were presented in a pseudorandomised order.</p>
<p>The task began only after participants indicated their readiness by pressing a designated key, after reviewing the instructions and clarifying any doubts with the experimenter. Before each condition, participants completed a practice session consisting of a short block to familiarise themselves with the task demands. The session included a variation of the main task in which participants practised identifying both the target letter and its location, as well as responding to the 2-back challenge for both letters and positions. During the main task, response accuracy and reaction times were recorded by keystroke on the Cedrus response pad (Cedrus Corporation, San Pedro, CA, USA, model RB-540). Participants were instructed to favour accurate responses over fast responses. The participants’ responses were monitored, and only trials with correct responses were included in the EEG analysis.</p>
<p>The stimuli were presented in Helvetica font on a 24-inch LCD screen with a refresh rate of 120 Hz. The stimuli, arranged in a 3 × 3 matrix, spanned approximately 7.22 degrees of both vertical and horizontal visual angles. The task was programmed and executed using PsychoPy 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Peirce et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>EEG data acquisition</title>
<p>We recorded EEG activity using either a BrainAmp MR-plus or ActiChamp amplifier (Brain Products GmbH, Germany). We acquired the recordings with a 64-channel ActiCap plus a reference channel, configured according to the extended 10-10 international system layout. To accommodate all participants, we used two slightly different electrode layouts, differing only in the position of two electrodes. Due to inconsistencies in electrode placement between subjects, we excluded channels AFz, Iz, PO9, and PO10 from the analysis, resulting in a dataset of 63 electrodes (including the reference channel). We grounded the electrode setup at AFz, with FCz serving as the reference. During the EEG recording, we band-pass filtered the signal between 0.1 and 250 (or 1000) Hz with a slope of 12dB/octave and digitised it at a sampling rate of 500, 1000, or 2500 Hz. After time-frequency decomposition, we downsampled the data to 100 Hz.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5d">
<title>EEG data preprocessing</title>
<p>We preprocessed the EEG data using custom MAT-LAB scripts (MathWorks, USA) that integrated functions from EEGLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Delorme and Makeig, 2004</xref>) and ER-PLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lopez-Calderon and Luck, 2014</xref>). High-pass filtering at 0.1 Hz was performed using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter (slope: 12 dB/octave). A Clean-Line filter was then used to reduce power line noise at 50 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mullen, 2012</xref>). Next, we segmented the data into epochs ranging from -1.5 to 2.8 seconds, time-locked to stimulus presentations, followed by baseline correction to remove residual signal drift. Epochs and channels were manually inspected to identify and exclude segments with excessive artefacts. Independent component analysis decomposition was performed using the AMICA algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Palmer et al., 2011</xref>), applied to the data bandpass filtered between 1 and 60 Hz; the solution was later applied to the non-bandpass filtered data. We manually inspected the independent components to identify and remove those representing blinks, horizontal eye movements, muscle noise, line noise, and other artefacts. After the ICA, channel time series reconstruction and channel interpolation were performed, and the data were referenced to the average reference.</p>
<p>Subsequent EEG analyses were conducted only on subjects and conditions that met the required standards, defined as having a minimum of 30 good epochs after cleaning and an accuracy rate of at least 0.6 within a given condition. Exclusion criteria were applied at the level of individual conditions within subjects, rather than excluding entire participants from the analyses. Consequently, only 21% and 10% of participants remained for the visuospatial and verbal lure conditions, respectively. As a result, the lure condition was excluded from all subsequent analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5e">
<title>Estimation of periodic and aperiodic component</title>
<p>First, we excluded trials with incorrect or missing responses from all subsequent analyses. ERPs related to early sensory potentials can affect estimates of aperiodic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>), therefore, average ERPs were removed prior to time-frequency decomposition, as has been previously done in similar studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gyurkovics et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kałamała et al., 2024</xref>). This involved computing ERPs for each subject/condition and then subtracting these ERPs from single-trial data for each subject/condition. For completeness, we also analysed the data without subtracted ERPs.</p>
<p>To estimate both periodic and aperiodic components of EEG activity, we performed time-frequency decomposition using superlets, with a range of frequencies from 3 to 50 Hz, in steps of 1 Hz (width of the base wavelet: 3 cycles, order: linearly spaced from 1 to 20, multiplicative combination of wavelets) as implemented in Fieldtrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>). Superlets, a variant of the Morlet wavelet transformation, involve multiple decompositions with varying cycles, the results of which are combined using a geometric mean to achieve enhanced temporal and spectral resolution, known as ‘super-resolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Moca et al., 2021</xref>). The results of the time-frequency decomposition were averaged for each condition and participant, and then decimated to 100 Hz in order to save space and facilitate further analysis.</p>
<p>We then estimated the periodic and aperiodic components from the decomposed data for each time point, condition, and participant using the FOOOF algorithm from the Python specparam package (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Donoghue et al.,2020b</xref>). To avoid edge artefacts, FOOOF parameters were estimated for a period between -0.5 and 2 seconds around the stimulus. The FOOOF algorithm estimates the frequency spectrum in a semi-log space (i.e. only power is log-transformed) using a set of parameters separately for periodic and aperiodic activity. Specifically, neural power spectra (NPS) over a set of frequencies (F) are described as the sum of the aperiodic and periodic components:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="593835v2_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The aperiodic component is modelled as
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="593835v2_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>b</italic> is the offset, <italic>k</italic> is the knee (bend), and 𝒳 is the exponent (slope).</p>
<p>The periodic component is modelled as a sum of Gaussians:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="593835v2_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Each Gaussian is described by three parameters: <italic>c, a</italic>, and <italic>w</italic>, representing center frequency, power, and bandwidth, respectively.</p>
<p>Fitting was performed using default specparam parameters: peak width limits = 0.5–12.0 Hz, maximum number of peaks to fit = Inf, minimum peak height = 0, peak threshold = 2.0, aperiodic mode = ‘fixed’ (i.e. the knee parameter was set to 0). The outcomes of the analyses conducted with the offset and exponent parameters were found to be highly comparable. Consequently, the results presented in the main text pertain solely to the analyses conducted with the exponent parameter, while those in the Supplement pertain to the offset parameter.</p>
<p>To allow comparisons with full time-frequency power and to facilitate comparisons across participants and conditions, we reconstructed the periodic component in a semi-log space based on the estimated parameters for each participant and condition.</p>
<p>We visually assessed the time-frequency plots, both in their original form and after baseline correction, before performing formal statistical analyses. We compared several types of baseline correction, including: (a) decibel conversion (10 * log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>data/baseline</italic>)), (b) relative change ((<italic>data – baseline</italic>)<italic>/baseline</italic>), (c) normalised change ((<italic>data – baseline</italic>)<italic>/</italic>(<italic>data</italic> + <italic>baseline</italic>)),–(d) absolute change (<italic>data – baseline</italic>). In addition, we considered three baseline periods (relative to stimulus onset): (a) from -500 to -200 ms, (b) from -300 to 0 ms, (b) from -500 to 0 ms.</p>
<p>We also compared time-frequency plots before and after baseline correction with those of periodic and aperiodic activity. Furthermore, we visualised the periodic activity, averaged over time, for each participant (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5f">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We conducted statistical comparisons using linear mixed models with the <italic>fitlme</italic> function in MATLAB. One advantage of using linear mixed models is their ability to accommodate missing data, which improves parameter estimates through partial pooling. We fitted the models as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="593835v2_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Here, <italic>y</italic> refers to the exponent or offset in the case of aperiodic activity and to the log-power in the case of periodic activity. We included reaction times (<italic>rt</italic>) in the model to control for differences between conditions and to assess the relationship between motor response and EEG activity.</p>
<p>To estimate representative reaction times for each participant and condition, we removed reaction times above a <italic>z</italic>-value of 3 and those below 200 ms (within each participant and condition). Next, we fitted an ex-Gaussian distribution to estimate the parameter <italic>µ</italic> using the maximum likelihood method as implemented in the retimes package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Massidda, 2013</xref>). The ex-Gaussian distribution, a positively skewed distribution, is useful for describing reaction time distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balota and Yap, 2011</xref>), and the parameter <italic>µ</italic> can be interpreted as the mode of the distribution.</p>
<p>We fitted models in a mass univariate manner, that is for each channel, frequency (where applicable), and time point separately.</p>
<p>The maximum likelihood method estimated the fixed effects, and the degrees of freedom were approximated using the Satterthwaite equation. The p-values underwent correction using the Benjamini-Yekutieli false discovery rate (FDR) correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001</xref>). Given that under the false discovery rate (FDR) correction, a <italic>q</italic> proportion of significant p-values are false positives, and that EEG effects occur in clusters (in time, frequency, and/or space) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Van Ede and Maris, 2016</xref>), we additionally considered as significant only clusters of p-values that spanned either at least three time points or at least three channels. We set the significance threshold at <italic>α</italic> = .05.</p>
<p>For the purposes of visualisation, p-values were aver-aged across channels (for heatmaps or lines) or across time (for topographies). Consequently, there are some discrepancies between heatmaps/lines and topographies.</p>

<sec id="s5g">
<title>Comparison of aperiodic activity with event-related potentials</title>
<p>To rule out the possibility that aperiodic activity merely reflected evoked potentials, we first removed evoked activity before time-frequency decomposition (as described above). We then computed Pearson correlations between event-related potentials (ERPs) and aperiodic activity across channels for each condition, sub-ject and time point. The results are shown in the Supplement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5h">
<title>Replication: n-back task</title>
<p>To test the generalisability of the results, we performed two replication analyses using two different EEG datasets: an n-back task and an item-recognition task. For the n-back task, we used an EEG dataset from a previously published study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nakuci et al. (2023)</xref>. This dataset includes data from 21 subjects (17 female, mean age 42 ± 12 years) who performed a verbal n-back task (0-, 1-, and 2-back) while being recorded with a 256-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net. The task involved 150 trials per condition, 50 of which were targets. Each stimulus was presented for 400 ms, followed by an interstimulus interval of 2000 ms.</p>
<p>The dataset was used in its preprocessed form, as the unprocessed data was not available. The preprocessing included band-pass filtering, artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mullen et al., 2013</xref>), independent component analysis, channel interpolation, another round of ASR, re-referencing to the average reference, epoching from -1000 to 2000 ms around stimulus presentation, and baseline correction using the prestimulus period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nakuci et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, the data were band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 50 Hz, so we restricted the time-frequency decomposition and FOOOF analysis to frequencies between 3 and 35 Hz.</p>
<p>We carried out all other analytical steps, including time-frequency decomposition, FOOOF analysis, and statistical comparisons, in the same manner as in the primary analysis.</p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in the Supplement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5i">
<title>Replication: item-recognition task</title>
<p>To test generalisability across tasks, we analysed EEG recordings from another study, which included 48 participants (10 male, mean age 23.8 ± 5 years). All participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and were free of neurological or psychiatric illness. Most participants were psychology students at the University of Ljubljana, while the rest responded to invitations sent via email and social media. All participants provided informed consent, approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana.</p>
<p>In this study, we used a Sternberg item-recognition task. In this paradigm, a series of visual target stimuli is presented, followed by a probe stimulus that may or may not be identical to one of the previous targets. Participants’ task is to indicate whether the probe (test) stimulus was part of the initial set (Sternberg, 1969).</p>
<p>The experiment included three task conditions performed under two working memory loads: (1) presentation of two or four stimuli that differed in colour but were displayed in the same location; (2) presentation of two or four stimuli that differed in position but were of the same colour (black); (3) presentation of two or four stimuli that differed in both colour and position (integration). Each condition consisted of 432 trials, with 216 trials per working memory load, divided into 18 blocks of 48 trials each. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups, each performing the task in two of the three conditions, resulting in 32 participants per condition and 16 participants per comparison of conditions. A schematic diagram and a detailed description of the task can be found in <xref rid="figS19" ref-type="fig">Figure S19</xref>.</p>
<p>Stimuli were presented on a 27-inch LCD screen with a refresh rate of 120 Hz. The stimuli were presented on a grey background in the centre of the screen, within a frame 250 pixels wide and 250 pixels high. The stimuli appeared as circles 20 pixels in diameter. When different positions were required, the stimuli were spaced at a distance equal to six times the stimulus radius. The frame spanned approximately 4.05 degrees of vertical and horizontal visual angle, and the diameter of each stimulus spanned approximately 0.32 degrees of visual angle. The task was programmed and ran using PsychoPy 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Peirce et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>For the EEG measurements we used a BrainAmp EEG amplifier (Brain Products GmbH, Germany) and a 32-channel ActiCAP EEG cap, configured according to the international 10/20 system. Participants provided responses using a Cedrus response pad, RB series, model 530. We monitored horizontal eye movements using a camera and a dedicated HEOG channel ([F7— F8]/2). We manually removed trials in which participants tracked the target stimuli with their eyes.</p>
<p>We preprocessed the EEG data using the same pipeline as for the n-back task, except that the data were segmented into epochs ranging from -1700 to 5400 miliseconds, time-locked to the cue presentations. Subsequent EEG analyses were performed in a manner identical to the n-back task, including only epochs with correct responses.</p>

<caption><title>The comparison of different baseline corrections on time-frequency decomposition results in the n-back task.</title>
<p>We compared four types of baseline correction (in columns): (a) decibel conversion (10 <sup><italic>*</italic></sup> log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>data/baseline</italic>)), (b) relative change ((<italic>data – baseline</italic>)<italic>/baseline</italic>), (c) normalised change ((<italic>data – baseline</italic>)<italic>/</italic>(<italic>data</italic>+<italic>baseline</italic>)), (d) absolute change (<italic>data – baseline</italic>). We also considered three baseline periods (in rows): (a) from -500 to -200 ms, (b) from -300 to 0 ms, (b) from -500 to 0 ms. The selection of baseline correction type and period had minimal impact on the outcomes. Among the methods, absolute change correction exhibited a slight reduction in deviations from baseline. Nevertheless, the overall results were qualitatively similar for all baseline corrections. The data presented represent the average across participants, conditions and electrodes.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Schematic representation of the item-recognition task.</title>
<p>In each trial, two or four target stimuli of a given condition were presented sequentially in each half of the visual field while the participant focused on one half. Participants held the relevant visual properties of the stimuli in working memory. This was followed by a probe in which two stimuli were presented, one in each half of the visual field, and participants responded whether the stimulus in the attended half matched one of the previous targets. Each trial began with a fixation cross in the centre of the screen on which participants maintained their gaze. Each trial began with instructions indicating the area of focus and the number of stimuli that would follow. After a blank interval, participants viewed the target stimuli, followed by a maintenance interval and a probe. During this interval, participants indicated whether the probe corresponded to one of the previous targets. Trials were counterbalanced to ensure that an equal number of presentations occurred in both visual fields for each of the conditions and working memory loads. The number of stimuli presented sequentially (i.e., working memory load) was randomised to prevent participants from making predictions.</p></caption>

<p>As with periodic activity, we also observed task-related changes in aperiodic activity. Specifically, the aperiodic slope increased during instruction, stimulus presentation and probe presentation compared to the retention period. The topographies were similar to those of the n-back task, with activity spanning frontal and parietal channels. However, the two components could not be distinguished (see <xref rid="figS22" ref-type="fig">Figure S22</xref>).</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> work explores the timely idea that aperiodic activity in human electrophysiology recordings shows changes in response to task events, which may be relevant for performance, and that these changes could be misinterpreted as oscillatory changes.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Frelih et al. investigated both periodic and aperiodic activity in EEG during working memory tasks. In terms of periodic activity, they found post-stimulus decreases in alpha and beta activity, while in terms of aperiodic activity, they found a bi-phasic post-stimulus steepening of the power spectrum, which was weakly predictive of performance. They conclude that it is crucial to properly distinguish between aperiodic and periodic activity in event-related designs as the former could confound the latter. They also add to the growing body of research highlighting the functional relevance of aperiodic activity in the brain.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a well-written, timely paper that could be of interest to the field of cognitive neuroscience, especially to researchers investigating the functional role of aperiodic activity. The authors describe a well-designed study that looked at both the oscillatory and non-oscillatory aspects of brain activity during a working memory task. The analytic approach is appropriate, as a state-of-the-art toolbox is used to separate these two types of activity. The results support the basic claim of the paper that it is crucial to properly distinguish between aperiodic and periodic activity in event-related designs as the former could confound the latter. They also add to the growing body of research highlighting the functional relevance of aperiodic activity in the brain. Commendably, the authors include replications of their key findings on multiple independent data sets.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors also claim that their results speak to the interplay between oscillatory and non-oscillatory activity, and crucially, that task-related changes in the theta frequency band - often attributed to neural oscillations in the field - are in fact only a by-product of non-oscillatory changes. I believe these claims are too bold and are not supported by compelling evidence in the paper. Some control analyses - e.g., contrasting the scalp topographies of purported theta and non-oscillatory effects - could help strengthen the latter argument, but it may be safest to simply soften these two claims.</p>
<p>In terms of the methodology used, I suggest the authors make it clearer to readers that the primary results were obtained on a sample of middle-aged-to-older-adults, some with subjective cognitive complaints, and note that while stimulus-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) were removed from the data prior to analyses, response-locked ERPs were not. This could potentially confound aperiodic findings. Contrasting the scalp topographies of response-related ERPs and the identified aperiodic components, especially the latter one, could bring some clarity here too.</p>
<p>I also found certain parts of the introduction to be somewhat confusing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Frelih et al investigate the relationship between aperiodic neural activity, as measured by EEG, and working memory performance, and compare this to the more commonly analyzed periodic, and in particular theta, measures that are often associated with such tasks. To do so, they analyze a primary dataset of 57 participants engaging in an n-back task, as well as a replication dataset, and use spectral parameterization to measure periodic and aperiodic features of the data, across time. In doing so, they find both periodic and aperiodic features that relate to the task dynamics, but importantly the aperiodic component appears to explain away what otherwise looks like theta activity in a more traditional analysis. This study, therefore, helps to establish that aperiodic activity is a task-relevant dynamic feature in working memory tasks, and may be the underlying change in many other studies that reported 'theta' changes but did not use methods that could differentiate periodic and aperiodic features.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Key strengths of this paper include that it addresses an important question - that of properly adjudicating which features of EEG recordings relate to working memory tasks - and in doing so provides a compelling answer, with important implications for considering prior work and contributing to understanding the neural underpinnings of working memory. I do not find any significant faults or errors with the design, analysis, and main interpretations as presented by this paper, and as such, find the approach taken to be valid and well-enacted. The use of multiple variants of the working memory task, as well as a replication dataset significantly strengthens this manuscript, by demonstrating a degree of replicability and generalizability. This manuscript is also an important contribution to motivating best practices for analyzing neuro-electrophysiological data, including in relation to using baselining procedures.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, I do not find any obvious weaknesses in this manuscript and its analyses that challenge the key results and conclusions. There are some minor reporting notes, on the methods and conclusions that I believe could be improved (details in the suggestions for authors). One aspect that could be improved is that while the figures demonstrate the main findings convincingly, the results as written could have more detailed quantifications of the analyzed effects (including, for example, more on the model results, effect sizes, and quantifications of the different features), in order to more fully report the dynamics of the analyzed features and to provide the reader with more information on the findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using a specparam (1/f) analysis of task-evoked activity, the authors propose that &quot;substantial changes traditionally attributed to theta oscillations in working memory tasks are, in fact, due to shifts in the spectral slope of aperiodic activity.&quot; This is a very bold and ambitious statement, and the field of event-related EEG would benefit from more critical assessments of the role of aperiodic changes during task events. Unfortunately, the data shown here does not support the main conclusion advanced by the authors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The field of event-related EEG would benefit from more critical assessments of the role of aperiodic changes during task events. The authors perform a number of additional control analyses, including different types of baseline correction, ERP subtraction, as well as replication of the experiment with two additional datasets.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not first show that their first task successfully evoked theta power, nor that specparam is capable of quantifying the background around a short theta burst, nor that theta effects are different between baseline corrected vs. spectral parameterized quantifications.</p>

<p>We would like thank reviewers for your comprehensive and insightful reviews of our manuscript. We highly value your constructive comments and suggestions and are preparing revisions that will enhance both the clarity and robustness of our study. Below is an outline of the changes we will implement in response to the points you raised.</p>
<p>All three reviewers expressed concerns regarding the robustness of our conclusions about the relationship between task-related theta activity and aperiodic changes. We will revise the manuscript to present these conclusions more cautiously, stating that the findings indicate a potential contribution of aperiodic activity to what is traditionally interpreted as theta activity. While our results emphasize the importance of distinguishing between periodic and aperiodic components, further research is necessary to fully understand this relationship. We will conduct additional control analyses, including a comparison of the scalp topographies of theta and aperiodic components, to better understand the relationship between aperiodic and periodic (theta) activity.</p>
<p>In response to Reviewer #1's request for greater transparency in our reporting of methodological details, we will provide key clarifications. We will add a clear statement noting that the primary results are based on data from middle-aged to older adults, some of whom had subjective cognitive complaints (SCC). However, it is important to note that no differences were observed between the SCC group and the control group regarding periodic or aperiodic changes in power. Additionally, the main findings were replicated in a sample of middle-aged adults.</p>
<p>To address potential confounding factors, we will include an analysis contrasting response-related ERPs with the identified aperiodic components. However, we do not entirely agree with the assertion that this will necessarily clarify the results. ERPs are not inherently distinct from aperiodic (or periodic) activity; they may reflect changes in aperiodic (or periodic) power. In our view, examining aperiodic and periodic power, ERPs, or time-frequency decomposition with baseline correction provides different perspectives on the same data. Nonetheless, the combined analyses and their results are intended to guide future researchers toward the most suitable approach for <italic>interpreting</italic> this data.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3 raised concerns regarding the task's effectiveness in evoking theta power and the ability of spectral parameterization method (specparam) to adequately quantify background activity around theta bursts. To address these concerns, we will include additional visualizations demonstrating that the task reliably elicited theta (and delta) activity. Regarding the reviewer's concerns about specparam and theta bursts, it is important to clarify that specparam, in the form we used, does not incorporate time information; rather, it can be applied to any power spectral density (PSD), independent of how the PSD is derived. Specparam’s performance depends on the methods used to estimate frequency content. For time-frequency decomposition, we employed superlets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20539-9">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20539-9</ext-link>), which have been shown to resolve short bursts of activity more effectively than other methods. To our knowledge, superlets provide the highest resolution in terms of both time and frequency. Moreover, to improve stability, we performed spectral parameterization on trial-averaged power (in contrast to the approach in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.77348">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.77348</ext-link>). Nonetheless, we will conduct a simulation to test whether specparam can reliably resolve low-frequency peaks over the 1/f activity.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2 suggested that the manuscript would benefit from a more detailed account of the effects. In response, we will include more detailed quantifications of the analyzed effects, such as model error and R² values.</p>
<p>We believe that the planned revisions will strengthen the manuscript and address the primary concerns raised by the reviewers. We sincerely appreciate your thoughtful feedback and look forward to submitting an improved version of the manuscript soon.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for your time and expertise in reviewing our work.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Andraž Matkovič &amp; Tisa Frelih</p>
