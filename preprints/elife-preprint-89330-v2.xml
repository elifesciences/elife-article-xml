<title>Abstract</title><p>Neural responses evoked by a stimulus reduce upon repetition. While this adaptation allows the sensory system to attend to novel cues, does information about the recurring stimulus, particularly its intensity, get compromised? We explored this issue in the locust olfactory system. We found that locusts’ innate behavioral response to odorants varied with repetition and stimulus intensity. Counter-intuitively, the stimulus-intensity dependent differences became significant only after adaptation had set in. Adaptation altered responses of individual neurons in the antennal lobe (neural network downstream to insect antenna). These response variations to repetitions of the same stimulus were unpredictable and inconsistent across intensities. Although both adaptation and intensity decrements resulted in an overall reduction in spiking activities across neurons, these changes could be disentangled, and information about stimulus intensity was robustly maintained by ensemble neural responses. In sum, these results show how information about odor intensity can be preserved in an adaptation-invariant manner.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to adapt to sensory cues is key to the survival of many living organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The goal of this sensory adaptation is to condense neural responses to a persisting or recurring stimulus in order to focus on novel cues. Such condensed neural responses are thought to increase system efficiency by reducing the metabolic requirements of information encoding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, is sensory information lost when neural responses are condensed during adaptation? While this computational task appears relatively elementary, any solution should satisfy two important requirements. First, attenuation of stimulus-evoked responses due to adaptation should not alter the identity of the stimulus. Second, information regarding the intensity of the stimulus may have to be preserved when odor intensity conveys information of behavioral importance. The latter requirement is paramount when sensory stimuli have different behavioral significance at varying intensities. For example, some odorants are attractive at lower intensities but switch to being aversive beyond certain threshold values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Sensitivity to intensity gradients has to be maintained for sustained periods to allow for navigation towards or away from the stimulus source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Such biological contexts necessitate the preservation of odor intensity information across repeated encounters with the odorant. However, the mechanism by which information about stimulus intensity is robustly maintained is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Sensory adaptation occurs over both long- and short-time scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Long-term adaptation requires gene transcription and protein translation that occurs on the time scale of hours to days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, whereas short-term adaptation occurs on a millisecond to minute time scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Short-term adaptation results from a wide range of mechanisms with prominent models in the olfactory system being vesicle depletion and facilitation of lateral inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. While both vesicle depletion and lateral inhibition are likely to occur in the olfactory system, these complementary mechanisms will manifest in two different, but testable, outcomes. Vesicle depletion will impact the most prominent neurons with elevated odor-evoked responses, whereas facilitation of lateral inhibition would progressively suppress activity in the relatively weak responders. Irrespective of which mechanisms underlie olfactory adaptation, the neural responses evoked by a stimulus will change over time and across repeated encounters. This raises the question: Does adaptation then corrupt or alter information regarding the odorant?</p>
<p>The ambiguity that neural adaptation introduces has been documented in visual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and auditory systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Prior studies have shown that odor identity is robustly maintained by the spatiotemporally patterned neural responses and can allow precise recognition across repeated encounters with the odorant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. But is intensity information corrupted by the changes in neural activity due to sensory adaptation? Both reductions in stimulus intensity and sensory adaptation lead to a reduction in the overall spiking responses in most neural circuits. Can these neural response variations due to neural adaptation and intensity decrements be disentangled? We sought to examine this in the relatively simple insect olfactory system.</p>
<p>Our results show that odor intensity changes result in subtle variations in the overall combination of activated neurons. While sensory adaptation results in an overall reduction in the population neural responses, the activated ensemble is robustly maintained to allow simultaneous and precise decoding of odor identity and intensity. Using an innate behavioral assay, we show that physiological adaptation coincided with enhanced behavioral differentiation between odorant intensities. Thus, our work reveals a simple but elegant approach to achieving adaptation-invariant intensity coding and recognition in the insect olfactory system.</p>

<title>Behavioral responses to an odorant vary with repetition and intensity</title>
    <p>We began by examining how behavioral responses change with repetitions of an odorant. We used an innate behavioral assay where the presentation of certain odorants triggered an appetitive palp-opening response (POR) in starved locusts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). Typically, these palps are used to grab food such as a blade of grass and can also be triggered when locusts encounter certain food-related odorants. Hence, it has been used as a measure of the appetitiveness of an odorant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. For this study, we regarded the probability of an odor eliciting a POR (p(POR)) as an indicator for stimulus perception. The baseline p(POR), in the absence of any olfactory stimuli, was negligible. Further, presentations of puffs of paraffin oil (control) evoked only weak palp-opening responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). Note that the p(POR) was computed by averaging the behavioral responses across locusts for each trial or repetition number (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b–d</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that the p(POR) systematically increased with repetitions of the same odorant and stabilized after about five stimulus presentations.</p>

    <p>Previous results have shown that the POR is a function of both stimulus identity and intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, we presented each locust with randomized blocks of the same odorant at either high (H, 1% v/v) or low (L, 0.1% v/v) intensities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Our results indicate that the p(PORs) evoked by high and low stimulus intensities of an odorant were significantly different for all four odorants in our panel. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>; p ≤ 0.05; one-sided t-test). Notably, the behavioral responses to high and low concentration exposures of the same odorant were not significantly different in the earlier trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>; p &gt; 0.05 for hex, iaa, and oct; one-sided t-test). However, the p(POR) became significantly different during the later trials (p ≤ 0.05 for all four odorants; one-sided t-test; trials six through ten). In other words, high and low stimulus intensities were more behaviorally discriminable in the later trials. Hence, these results counterintuitively suggest that behavioral responses to an odorant at two different intensities were different after multiple encounters with the same stimulus.</p>

<title>Odor-evoked response adaptation leads to complex changes in individual neurons</title>
<p>How do neural responses change as a function of stimulus repetition? To understand this, we examined the odor-evoked responses of individual projection neurons (PNs) in the locust antennal lobe as different odorants at two different intensities were repeatedly presented (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Odor-evoked responses in individual PNs varied subtly across trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In general, most PN responses to the odorant were stronger in the first trial and reduced during later trials of the same stimulus. Notably, the changes in PN responses in two different blocks of trials, where the same odorant was presented, showed repeatable changes in odor-evoked spiking patterns and the overall response strength (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">

<caption><title>Ensemble neural activity systematically changes across repeated encounters with an odorant.</title>
<p><bold>(a)</bold> Schematic of the olfactory stimulation protocol. Each block consisted of twenty-five trials with a four-second odor pulse delivered in each trial. The inter-trial interval was 60 s. Two datasets were collected. Each dataset consisted of five randomized blocks of four odorants (dataset 1: hex (H), hex (L), oct (H), oct (L), hex (H)-repeat; dataset 2: iaa (H), iaa (L), bza (H), bza (L), iaa (H)-repeat). A fifteen-minute no-odor stimulation period separated blocks of trials.</p>

Spiking activities are shown for twenty-five trials (rows) with earlier trials shown at the top and later trials at the bottom. The shaded region indicates the four-second odor stimulation period, and the identity of the stimulus is indicated in each plot.</p>
<p><bold>(c)</bold> Raster plots are shown for four representative PNs during two blocks of trials. The same odorant was presented in both blocks. Note that spiking activity changes are repeatable across the block of trials.</p>
<p><bold>(d)</bold> Schematic showing how vesicular depletion and lateral inhibition facilitation models would change spiking activity in individual neurons. The Y-axis represents the change in response over trials (25<sup>th</sup> trial response – 1<sup>st</sup> trial response). Positive numbers indicate that the last trial had a stronger response, hence the response increase. Negative numbers indicate that the first trial had a stronger response, hence response reduction. Along the x-axis, the response in the first trial is shown. Vesicular depletion should impact the strongly activated neurons more, whereas lateral inhibition facilitation should progressively suppress weak responders.</p>
<p><bold>(e)</bold> Following the schematic in <bold><italic>panel d</italic></bold>, response changes observed in PNs are shown. All PNs were included in this plot. Different colors and symbols are used to denote the identity of the odorant and its intensity (low-intensity trials – triangles and high-intensity trials – circles). As can be noted, the R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> values are∼ 0.48-0.56 indicating that the vesicle depletion facilitation model captures the adaptation trends in our datasets to a certain extent.</p>
<p><bold>(f)</bold> Changes in PN spiking activity over trials during high-intensity odor exposures (y-axis) are plotted against response changes observed for the same PN during low-intensity exposures of the same odorant. The poor correlation values (hex, R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>=0.17; oct, R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>=0.12; iaa R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>=0.21; bza R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>=0.08) indicate that reductions in neural response amplitude for one odor intensity do not model reductions in response amplitude for another odor intensity.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we examined how individual PNs adapted during stimulus repetitions. Based on existing literature, two widely considered models of adaptation in the olfactory system are vesicular depletion and facilitation of lateral inhibition. While the vesicular depletion model predicts that the strongest firing neurons would adapt the most, in the lateral inhibition facilitation model the weakly activated neurons would progressively be suppressed more (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). To test these two opposing but complementary theories, we calculated the total change in the total spike counts observed during the 25<sup>th</sup> and first odor presentations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, <italic>y-axis;</italic> positive values indicate stronger response in the later trial and hence response facilitation, whereas negative values indicate reduction of odor-evoked responses). We plotted these response changes against the spike response observed in the first trial (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, <italic>x-axis</italic>). If vesicular depletion was the predominant form of adaptation, there would be a negative correlation with the response strength in the first trial. Whereas a positive correlation would indicate that lateral inhibition was the predominant form of adaptation. As can be noted, across both datasets with two concentrations of the four odorants tested, the vesicle depletion hypothesis appeared to capture some of the adaptation dynamics in our datasets (<italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.48, 0.56, respectively).</p>
<p>Are trial-to-trial changes in stimulus-evoked neural responses at two different concentrations of the same odorant correlated? If this is the case, then it would be reasonable to expect neurons that adapt more at the higher concentration to also change in a similar fashion at a lower concentration and <italic>vice versa</italic>. To assess this, we calculated and plotted the change in spike counts for each PN at both high and low concentrations of the same odorant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Notably, the PNs with the greatest response change during repetitions of the higher-intensity odor exposures were not the ones that adapted heavily when encountering the same stimulus at a lower intensity (<italic>R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup></italic> = 0.17 (hex), 0.12 (oct), 0.21 (iaa), 0.08 (bza)). In sum, these results indicate that change due to adaptation in individual neurons is not a simple function of their response strength. Further, how individual neurons adapt is a function of both odor identity and intensity.</p>

<p>Are the response reductions during stimulus repetition comparable to those observed with stimulus intensity decrements? To determine this, we plotted the total spike counts summed across all PNs over the entire stimulus presentation duration and plotted it as a function of the trial number (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). We compared the changes over trials with the total spike counts observed during the high (H) and low (L) intensities of the same odorant. Notably, the total PN ensemble spike counts decreased due to both stimulus intensity reduction and repetition of the stimulus. Do these results indicate that adaptation could potentially confound information regarding stimulus intensity?</p>

<title>Adaptation-invariant encoding of odor intensity</title>
<p>Could the information regarding stimulus intensity be robustly encoded in the population neural responses? As noted earlier, both spiking activities in individual neurons and the volume of spikes at the ensemble level vary across trials. If adaptation alters the overall spiking activity amplitude (i.e., vector length; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), while changes in stimulus intensity alter the combination of activated neurons (i.e., vector direction; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), then information about odor identity and intensity can be preserved in an adaptation-invariant fashion. To test whether the recorded ensemble of neurons in our datasets encoded information in such an adaptation-invariant fashion, we first visualized the high-dimensional neural activities in each trial using a dimensionality reduction approach (see <bold>Methods</bold>). We plotted the ensemble responses in each 50 ms time bin during the odor presentation time window (4 s) and linked them based on the order of their occurrence to generate trial-by-trial odor response trajectories (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c, d</xref>). Note that each trial generated a single loop response trajectory after dimensionality reduction. Further, neural responses in different trials evoked closed-loop trajectories that systematically reduced in length with increasing repetition but maintained their direction, indicating that the combination of neurons activated was mostly conserved. Different odorants evoked responses that were markedly different in the combination of activated neurons, and therefore, their response trajectories were oriented in different directions. Notably, different concentrations of the same odorant also generated response trajectories that subtly varied in direction. As a direct consequence, even though the overall spiking activities reduced over trials, the odor response trajectories reliably maintained their direction in all the trials. Hence, information about odor identity and intensity was robustly maintained across all trials.</p>

<p>To quantify these observations, we performed a correlation analysis using high-dimensional PN response vectors. If a similar combination of PNs (high-dimensional activity vectors) were activated in two different trials, then their correlation would be high. Correlations across different trials and concentrations of the same odorant are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>. Confirming results from the dimensionality reduction analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), we found odor-evoked responses across different trials of an odorant at a particular intensity were highly correlated (diagonal blocks on each panel). The similarity between odor-evoked responses evoked by different concentrations of the same odorant was considerably less correlated (off-diagonal blocks). A hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the odor-evoked responses were nicely clustered based on odor identity and then by intensity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). These observations were further corroborated by a classification analysis (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<p>In sum, our results reveal that a combinatorial code could encode information regarding odor identity and intensity in an adaptation-invariant fashion.

<title>Neural response suppression vs. behavioral output facilitation</title>
<p>Neural responses evoked by an odorant reduced with repetition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, as we noted earlier, the behavioral responses increased upon stimulus repetition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This negative correlation is evident when the neural responses (total spiking activities evoked across neurons) was plotted against the behavioral POR response probability during a particular trial (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This negative correlation between neural suppression and behavioral enhancement was observed for all odorants and both concentrations examined. It is worth noting that the last trial of the high-intensity exposure evoked neural responses that were comparable in strength to the first trial of the low-intensity exposure of the same stimulus. Yet, the behavioral responses observed during these two trials were markedly different. Hence, our results also indicate that the probability of the POR response is not simply a function of the total number of spikes elicited.</p>

<title>Neural and behavioral changes due to adaptation are odor-specific</title>
<p>Finally, we wondered if the neural response reduction and behavioral enhancements were a global, non-specific state change in the olfactory system brought about by the repetition of any odorant, or are the observed neural and behavioral response changes odor-specific. To examine this, we used a ‘catch-trial paradigm.’ (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>) In these sets of experiments, we repeatedly presented an odorant to induce adaptation. After a substantial reduction in the neural response or stabilization of the behavioral response, a deviant or catch stimulus was presented. Persistence of the observed reduction in neural responses and enhancement in behavioral responses when the catch stimulus is introduced would reveal that the adaptation-induced changes are not odor-specific.</p>

<p>We used the catch-trial experiments with two different catch stimuli. Our neural recordings reveal that when iaa (ester) was used as the catch stimulus after repeated presentations of hex (alcohol), the neural response strength recovered and increased to an overall higher spike count (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). The observed catch-iaa response strength matched the unadapted response level to iaa when it was separately presented following a 15-minute reset window (i.e., <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>, trial# 31). In contrast, when apple (a complex mixture) was used as the catch stimulus, the neural responses did not recover to higher levels indicating significant cross-adaptation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). Nevertheless, in both cases, the ensemble responses evoked by the catch stimulus were highly similar to the unadapted responses it usually generates (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). Therefore, these results indicate that there is stimulus specificity to the adaptation-induced changes in neural responses and that cross-adaptation does not corrupt the identity of the deviant stimulus.</p>
<p>Behaviorally, we chose odor pairs where the component odorants had markedly different levels of POR responses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). Repeated presentations of an odorant (bza or iaa) increased the p(POR) across the locusts as observed before (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>). Notably, when the catch stimulus was presented, the behavioral responses dropped close to the first-trial p(POR) elicited by that odorant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>; dotted line). These findings were also observed when the recurring and catch odorants were switched (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, these neural and behavioral results indicate that the observed neural and behavioral response changes brought about by the repeated encounters with an odorant are at least partially odor-specific and are not global, non-specific changes in the olfactory system.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sensory systems often have to deal with constraints that are of an opposing nature. For example, the ability to maintain stable representations is key to robust recognition of sensory stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Often, variations in the external environment, such as humidity and temperature, may introduce changes in neural responses that have to be filtered out to preserve the identity of the stimuli. Additionally, the strength or intensity of the stimulus can also change widely. Compressing or even removing these variations might be necessary to recognize an odorant independent of its intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Alternately, in certain cases, it might also become important to maintain some of these variations so they can be exploited for guiding or altering the behavioral response. As an example, it might be worth noting that many chemicals that are pleasant at lower intensities can become repelling or even harmful to the organism at extremely high intensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Hence, the behavioral responses should accordingly vary with intensity. Further, many organisms have shown that they can follow an odorant to its source (source localization). Such behaviors are of ecological importance as they allow the organisms to find the food source or potential mates. In all these cases, it becomes important to maintain variations with stimulus intensity to ensure the organisms are able to approach the odor source. In our earlier studies, we have focused on examining how robust odor recognition is achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Here, we examined the latter problem of how to maintain information about the stimulus intensity while the responses in the neural circuits are becoming weaker due to adaptation.</p>
<p>Consistent with earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, our data revealed that the response of individual projection neurons in the antennal lobe varied with the repetition of the same stimulus. While a reduction in odor-evoked responses was observed in many neurons, an increase in spiking activity and changes in temporal firing patterns were also observed. Notably, these changes were not random but highly repeatable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Hence, these results indicate that the effect of adaptation in a neural circuit is highly consistent and reliable.</p>
<p>In addition to spike rate reduction, oscillatory synchronization, and inter-neuronal coherence build up in the locust antennal lobe over repeated encounters with an odorant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. This short-term memory was not observed in the antenna but endured in the antennal lobe for several minutes after the termination of the stimulus. Similar results were also reported in the mouse olfactory bulb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The inputs from sensory neurons were shown to be consistent across repetition, whereas the outputs of the olfactory bulb were systematically reduced with stimulus repetition. These results suggest that loci of short-term adaptation, at least when the stimulus is discontinuous and recurring, are in the antennal lobe/olfactory bulb circuitry. Although the precise mechanism for achieving the same is not fully understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>What is the computational significance of this neural adaptation? Sensory adaptation has been implicated in several important computations such as high-pass filtering, matching neural response to stimulus statistics, generating sparser codes, and optimal representations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. In the olfactory system, adaptation has also been suggested to stabilize neural representation such that recognition of odor identity from ensemble neural responses improved after repeated encounters with the stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, adaptation also introduces a potential confound whereby the absolute neural response strength becomes an unreliable indicator of stimulus strength. Our results extend these earlier studies by revealing how this potential confound could be resolved in the olfactory system.</p>
<p>Increases in stimulus intensity have also been shown to result in higher response amplitudes in firing neurons and the recruitment of additional activated neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. While our results show that this is indeed true, we also found that several neurons responded preferentially during the lower concentration exposures but did not respond when the higher intensity of the same stimulus was presented (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>). Hence, the activated combination of neurons differed both with stimulus identity and intensity. Furthermore, even though adaptation reduced the overall spiking activities across neurons, the combination of neurons activated was robustly maintained. In other words, the population response vector direction (determined by the combination of neurons activated) was consistent. Only the vector length (determined by the total spikes across neurons) was reduced with the repetition of the stimulus. This simple approach was sufficient to encode the information about the odor intensity in an adaptation-invariant fashion. Additionally, since equivalent information about stimulus identity and intensity was preserved with fewer spikes, neural adaptation can be considered as a method of optimizing the neural representation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p>Does the observed persistence of concentration information in the neural activities after adaptation translate to observable differences in behavioral outcomes? Using an innate palp-opening response (POR), we examined how behavioral responses varied with stimulus repetition. Unlike the neural responses, we found that the PORs increased with repetition and, after about five trials, settled into odor-specific levels of responses. Notably, the PORs in the later trials were significantly higher for higher stimulus intensities for most of the odorants used. No such changes were observed during repeated presentation of paraffin oil (the solvent used for diluting odorants; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). This suggests that the increases in behavioral responses with repetition were driven by the presence of the olfactory stimuli and not just the mechanical component (i.e. flow or pressure changes associated with stimulus presentations). Furthermore, our results showed that locusts are better able to behaviorally differentiate stimulus intensity after adaptation.</p>
<p>Alternately, adaptation due to the repetition of an odorant could alter the perceived intensity of the recurring odorant or other related test odorants. The compromise of stimulus intensity information due to adaptation has been observed in behavioral discrimination tasks in rats and even in psychophysical studies in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Such a result can arise when the combinatorial response patterns evoked by the adapting and the test stimulus have significant overlap. However, our results indicate that when changes in odor intensities alter the combination of neurons activated, it is feasible to maintain information about odor intensity levels in a robust fashion.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the anticorrelated link between neural suppression and behavioral enhancements (called ‘repetition priming’) is well established in other animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. How can weaker neural responses lead to enhanced behavioral outcomes? Our results indicate that the antennal lobe neural responses in later trials were not sharpened by pruning out weaker responses (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>). The weakening of the response strength could potentially lead to a sparser response in the downstream mushroom body. In addition, as we noted earlier, neural response synchrony increases with stimulus repetition. Whether weaker but synchronized activity in neurons drives sparser and more selective responses which then produce enhanced behavioral outcomes remains to be carefully examined.</p>

<title>Odor stimulation</title>
<p>For delivering odorants, we followed a protocol described in our earlier work. Briefly, odorants were diluted in paraffin oil to either 1% or 0.1% concentration (v/v) and sealed in glass bottles (60 ml) with an air inlet and outlet. A pneumatic picopump (WPI Inc., PV-820) was used to displace a constant volume (0.1 L/min) of the static headspace above the diluted odor-mineral oil mixture into a desiccated carrier air stream (0.75 L/min) directed toward one of the locust’s antennae. A vacuum funnel placed behind the locust preparation continuously removed the delivered odors.</p>
<p>The first set of experiments included multiple blocks, with twenty-five trials each, when one odorant at one intensity was repeatedly presented. Each trial in the block included a four-second stimulus presentation window. The inter-stimulus interval (between trials) was 60 seconds. Different odorants at different intensities were repeatedly presented in different blocks. A 15-minute window, when no stimulus was presented, separated two consecutive blocks of trials. This window was included to reset any short-term memory that may have formed due to repeated presentation of the same stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The second set of experiments involved two blocks of trials. The first block of trials included 30 trials, and the second block consisted of ten trials. In the first 25 trials of block 1, hexanol at 1% v/v was repeatedly presented. In the 26<sup>th</sup> trial, a puff of either isoamyl acetate 1% v/v or apple 1% v/v (a ‘deviant’ odorant) was presented. In trials 27-30, hexanol at 1% v/v was again presented. This was followed by a 15-minute reset window when no stimulus was presented. In the second block of ten trials (trials 31-40), the deviant stimulus was repeatedly presented. All inter-stimulus intervals (between trials) were 60 seconds, and all odor presentations were four seconds long.</p>

Extracellular multiunit recordings of projection neurons (PNs) were performed with a 16-channel, 4x4 silicon probe (NeuroNexus) that was superficially inserted in the antennal lobe (AL).

<p>We first organized neural response data as a three-way array (Neuron × Time × Trials; the stimulus information was also blended into the trial dimension) and then employed a direct 3-way tensor decomposition approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Here, the 3-D data cube was approximated using three loading matrices, A, B, and C, with elements <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>if</italic></sub>(neuron dimension), <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>jf</italic></sub> (time dimension), and <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>kf</italic></sub> (trial dimension). <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>ijk</italic></sub> was the residual element (see the equation below). The tri-linear model was found using alternating least squares.
<disp-formula id="eqn2">

</disp-formula>
where <italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>, <italic>k</italic> denote the three different dimensions, and <italic>F</italic> indicates the total number of factors used for the analysis that was determined by the core consistency diagnostics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. In our case, when <italic>F</italic> = 3, the core consistency was above 50 %, while it dropped to below 40% when <italic>F</italic> = 4. Therefore, we used three factors for our data decomposition.</p>

<title>Trial-to-trial odor trajectory</title>
<p>For this analysis, we first reconstructed the dataset by computing the outer product of the loading matrices that were obtained by the tensor decomposition. The reconstructed 3-D tensor was then unfolded into a concatenated matrix (i.e., along the trial dimension). After unfolding, the ensemble projection neuron responses were arranged as time series data of <italic>n</italic> dimensions (where <italic>n</italic> is the number of neurons) and <italic>m</italic> steps (the number of 50 ms time bins × the number of trials). Note that only the projection neuron activities during the four-second stimulus presentation window in each trial were used for this analysis. The ensemble projection neuron response vectors (in a given 50 ms time bin) were projected onto the three eigenvectors of the response covariance matrix that accounted for the most variance in the dataset, using principal component analysis. Finally, the low-dimensional points were connected in a temporal order to visualize neural response trajectories to different stimuli on a trial-to-trial basis. All trajectory plots shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> were generated after smoothing with a 3-point running average low-pass filter.</p>

<sec id="s5g">
<title>Neural response similarity and dendrogram analysis</title>
<p>First, we calculated the summed spike counts during the 4 s odor presentation window for each projection neuron. Then, the correlation similarity between two spike count profiles across projection neurons was calculated using <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref>. Similarly, in this analysis, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>x<sub>j</sub></italic> represent a <italic>n</italic> × 1 vector (<italic>n</italic> = 80 for hex-2oct; <italic>n</italic> = 81 for iaa-bza) for trial <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, respectively. The dendrogram was generated by hierarchical clustering of all stimulus identities, intensities, and individual trials based on the correlation distance. The dendrogram was created in such a way that the furthest pairwise distance between any two samples assigned to an individual cluster was minimized.</p>

<title>Behavior experiments</title>
<p>Experiments were performed on post-fifth instar locusts of either sex that were starved for approximately 24 hours. All behavioral experiments occurred between 10 am and 2 pm. The protocols for the innate behavioral preference experiments and palp tracking used in this study were published in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, where the locusts’ thorax and legs were immobilized in custom casings that permitted the locusts’ head, and most notably, their palps and antennae, to freely gesticulate. The odor delivery setup and stimulus sequences for the single odorants were similar to the ones described for the electrophysiological experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Any palp movement that occurred within 15 seconds of the odor stimulus onset was considered a palp-opening response (POR). All data were hand-scored. Refer to Supplementary Video 1 for a representative trial showing the POR response of a locust to hexanol (1% v/v) presentation.</p>

<caption><title>Classification analysis confirms robust adaptation-invariant odor recognition using ensemble neural activity patterns.</title>
<p>Results from classification analysis are shown for the two datasets: hexanol–octanol at different concentrations (dataset 1; 80 PNs), and isoamyl acetate and benzaldehyde (dataset 2; 81 PNs). A one-nearest neighbor approach with correlation distance was used for predicting odor labels. We did a leave-one-trial-out validation. The true odor label is shown along the x-axis, and the predicted odor label is shown along the y-axis. As can be noted, the class labels for every single trial were correctly predicted in both datasets. The result after class labels were shuffled is also shown for comparison. These results strongly support our conclusion that odor intensity information is preserved, and odor concentration can be recognized independent of adaptation.</p>

<p>This study addresses an <bold>important</bold> question in sensory neuroscience: how the olfactory system distinguishes decreases in stimulus intensity from decreases in neural responses due to adaptation. Based on a combination of electrophysiological and behavioral analyses, <bold>solid</bold> evidence establishes that neural coding changes differently between intensity reductions and adaptation, with intensity changes altering which neurons are activated while adaptation preserves the active ensemble but reduces response magnitude. Intriguingly, behavioral responses tend to increase as the neural responses decrease, suggesting that core features of the odor response persist through adaptation. While the experimental results are <bold>convincing</bold> overall, the conclusions will be strengthened by future work recording behavior and neural dynamics in the same animals.</p>

<p>The authors use electrophysiological and behavioral measurements to examine how animals could reliably determine odor intensity/concentration across repeated experience. Because stimulus repetition leads to short-term adaptation evidenced by reduced overall firing rates in the antennal lobe and firing rates are otherwise concentration-dependent, there could be an ambiguity in sensory coding between reduced concentration or more recent experience. This would have a negative impact on the animal's ability to generate adaptive behavioral responses that depend odor intensities. The authors conclude that changes in concentration alter the constituent neurons contributing to the neural population response, whereas adaptation maintains the 'activated ensemble' but with scaled firing rates. This provides a neural coding account of the ability to distinguish odor concentrations even after extended experience. Additional analyses attempt to distinguish hypothesized circuit mechanisms for adaptation. A larger point that runs through the manuscript is that overall spiking activity has an inconsistent relationship with behavior and that the structure of population activity may be the more appropriate feature to consider.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the dissociation of effects of odor concentration and adaptation on olfactory system population codes was not previously demonstrated. This is a significant contribution that improves on any simple model based on overall spiking activity. The primary result is most strikingly supported by visualization of a principal components analysis in Figure 4. Additional experiments and analysis complement and provide context for this finding regarding the relationship between neural population changes and behavior. There are some natural limitations on the interpretation of these data imposed by the methodology.</p>
<p>(1) Because individual recordings do not acquire a sufficient cell population to carry our population analyses, the cells must be combined into pseudopopulations for many analyses. This is common practice but it limits the ability to test the repeatability of findings across animals or populations. One potential additional solution would be to subsample the pseudopopulation, which would reveal the importance of individual sampled cells in the overall result. The utility of this additional testing is suggested by, for example, the benzaldehyde responses in supplementary figure 5, where two cells differentiate high and low concentration responses and would be expected to strongly impact correlation and classifier analyses.</p>
<p>(2) I do not think the analysis in Figure 2e can be strongly interpreted in terms of the vesicle depletion model. The hard diagonal bound on the lower part of each scatter plot indicates that features of the data/analysis necessarily exclude data in the lower left quadrant. I think this could be possibly explained by a floor effect wherein lower-response neurons cannot possibly express a large deltaResponse. To strengthen this case, one would need to devise a control analysis for the case where neural responses are simply all going as far down as they can go.</p>
<p>(3) Very minor, but it is confusing and not well-described how the error is computed in Figure 1f. One can imagine that the mean p(POR) is arrived at by averaging the binary values across locusts. Is this the case? If so, the same estimation of variance could be applied to Figures 1d and e</p>

This is a significant contribution that improves on any simple model based on overall spiking activity. The primary result is most strikingly supported by visualization of a principal components analysis in Figure 4. However, there are some weaknesses in the data and analyses that limit confidence in the overall conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for evaluating our work and highlighting its strengths and deficiencies. We have revised the manuscript with expanded behavioral datasets and additional analyses that we believe convincingly support our conclusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Behavioral work interpreted to demonstrate discrimination of different odor concentrations yields inconsistent results. Only two of the four odorants follow the pattern that is emphasized in the text (Figure 1F). Though it's a priori unlikely that animals are incapable of distinguishing odor concentrations at any stage in adaptation, the evidence presented is not sufficient to reach this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have expanded our dataset and now show that the behavioral response is significantly different for high and low concentration exposures of the same odorant. This was observed for all four odorants in our study (refer to Revised Fig. 1F).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While conclusions center on concepts related to the combination of activated neurons or the &quot;active ensemble&quot;, this specific level of description is not directly demonstrated in any part of the results. We see individual neural responses and dimensional reduction analyses, but we are unable to assess to what extent the activated ensemble is maintained across experience.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have done several additional analyses (see provisional response). Notably, we have corroborated our dimensionality reduction and correlation analysis results with a quantitative classification analysis that convincingly demonstrates that odor identity and intensity of the odorant can be decoded from the ensemble neural activity, and this could be achieved in an adaptation-invariant fashion (refer to Revised Supplementary Fig. 4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) There is little information about the variance or statistical strength of results described at the population level. While the PCA presents a compelling picture, the central point that concentration changes and adaptation alter population responses across separable dimensions is not demonstrated quantitatively. The correlation analysis that might partially address this question is presented to be visually interpreted with no additional testing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included a plot that compares the odor-evoked responses across all neurons (mean ± variance) at both intensity levels for each odorant (Revised Supplementary Fig. 5). This plot clearly shows how the ensemble neural activity profile varies with odor intensity and how these response patterns are robustly maintained across trials.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Results are often presented separately for each odor stimulus or for separate datasets including two odor stimuli. An effort should be made to characterize patterns of results across all odor stimuli and their statistical reliability. This concern arises throughout all data presentations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We had to incorporate a 15-minute window between presentations of odorants to reset adaptation. Due to this, we were unable to extracellularly record from all four odorants at two intensities from a single experiment (~ 3.5 hours of recording for just 2 odorants at two intensities with one odorant at higher intensity repeated at the end; Fig. 2a). Therefore, we recorded two datasets. Each dataset captured the responses of ~80 PNs to two odorants at two intensities, one odorant at the higher concentration repeated at the end of the experiment to show repeatability of changes due to adaptation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The relevance of the inconclusive analysis of inferred adaptation mechanisms in Figure 2d-f and the single experiment including a complex mixture in Figure 7 to the motivating questions for this study are unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 2d-f has been revised. While we agree that the adaptation mechanisms are not fully clear, there is a trend that the most active PNs are the neurons that change the most across trials. This change and the response in the first trial are negatively correlated, indicating that vesicle depletion could be an important contributor to the observed results. However, neurons that adapt strongly at higher intensities are not the ones that adapt at lower intensities. This complicates the understanding of how neural responses vary with intensities and the adaptation that happens due to repetition. This has been highlighted in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding Figure 7, we wanted to examine the odor-specificity of the changes that happen due to repeated encounters of an odorant. Specifically, wondered if the neural response reduction and behavioral enhancements were a global, non-specific state change in the olfactory system brought about by the repetition of any odorant, or are the observed neural and behavioral response changes odor-specific.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Throughout the description of the results, typical standards for statistical reporting (sample size, error bars, etc.) are not followed. This prevents readers from assessing effect sizes and undermines the ability to assign a confidence to any particular conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the manuscript to fix these issues and included sample size and error bars in our plots.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors' main goal was to evaluate how both behavioral responses to odor, and their early sensory representations are modified by repeated exposure to odor, asking whether the process of adaptation is equivalent to reducing the concentration of an odor. They open with behavioral experiments that actually establish that repeated odor presentation increases the likelihood of evoking a behavioral response in their experimental subjects - locusts. They then examine neural activity patterns at the second layer of the olfactory circuit. At the population level, repeated odor exposure reduces total spike counts, but at the level of individual cells there seems to be no consistent guiding principle that describes the adaptation-related changes, and therefore no single mechanism could be identified.</p>
<p>Both population vector analysis and pattern correlation analysis indicate that odor intensity information is preserved through the adaptation process. They make the closely related point that responses to an odor in the adapted state are distinct from responses to lower concentration of the same odor. These analyses are appropriate, but the point could be strengthened by explicitly using some type of classification analysis to quantify the adaptation effects. e.g. a confusion matrix might show if there is a gradual shift in odor representations, or whether there are trials where representations change abruptly.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>One strength is that the work has both behavioral read-out of odor perception and electrophysiological characterization of the sensory inputs and how both change over repeated stimulus presentations. It is particularly interesting that behavioral responses increase while neuronal responses generally decrease. Although the behavioral effect could occur fully downstream of the sensory responses the authors measure, at least those sensory responses retain the core features needed to drive behavior despite being highly adapted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Ultimately no clear conceptual framework arises to understand how PN responses change during adaptation. Neither the mechanism (vesicle depletion versus changes in lateral inhibition) nor even a qualitative description of those changes. Perhaps this is because much of the analysis is focused on the entire population response, while perhaps different mechanisms operate on different cells making it difficult to understand things at the single PN level.</p>
<p>From the x-axis scale in Fig 2e,f it appeared to me that they do not observe many strong PN responses to these stimuli, everything being &lt; 10 spikes/sec. So perhaps a clearer effect would be observed if they managed to find the stronger responding PNs than captured in this dataset.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his/her evaluation of our work. Indeed, our work does not clarify the mechanism that underlies the adaptation over trials, and how this mechanism accounts for adaptation that is observed at two different intensities of the same odorant. However, as we highlight in the revised manuscript, there is some evidence for the vesicle depletion hypothesis. For the plots shown in Fig. 2, the firing rates were calculated after averaging across time bins and trials. Hence, the lower firing rates. The peak firing rates of the most active neurons are ~100 Hz. So, we are certain that we are collecting responses from a representative ensemble of neurons in this circuit.</p>

<p>a. While the &quot;learning curve&quot; of the POR is nicely described, the behavior itself receives very little description. What are the kinematics of the movement, and do these vary with repetition? Is the POR all-or-nothing or does it vary trial to trial?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The behavioral responses were monitored in unconditioned/untrained locusts. Hence, these are innate responses to the odorants. These innate responses are usually brief and occur after the onset of the stimulus. However, there is variability across locusts and trials (refer Revised Supplementary Fig. 1). When the same odorant is conditioned with food reward, the POR responses become more stereotyped and occur rapidly within a few hundred milliseconds.</p>

<p>b. What are the reaction times? This can constrain what time window is relevant in the neural responses. E.g., if the reaction time is 500 ms, then only the first 500 ms of the ensemble response deserves close scrutiny. Later spikes cannot contribute.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting point. We had done this analysis for conditioned POR responses. For innate POR, as we noted earlier, there is variability across locusts. Many responses occur rapidly after odor onset (&lt;1 s), while some responses do occur later during odor presentation and in some cases after odor termination. It is important to note that these dynamical aspects of the POR response, while super interesting, should occur at a much faster time scale compared to the adaptation that we are reporting across trials or repeated encounters of an odorant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c. The behavioral methods are lacking some key information. While references are given to previous work, the reader should not be obligated to look at other papers to answer basic questions: how was the response measured? Video tracking? Hand scored?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and apologize for the oversight. We have revised the methods and added a video to show the POR responses. Videos were hand-scored.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>d. Can we be sure that this is an odor response? Although airflow out of the olfactometer is ongoing throughout the experiment, opening and closing valves usually creates pressure jumps that are likely to activate mechanosensors in the antennae.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Interesting. We have added a new Supplementary Fig. 2 that shows that the POR to even presentations of paraffin oil (solvent; control) is negligible.  This should confirm that the POR is a behavioral response to the odorant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all other potential confounds identified by the reviewer are present for every odorant and every concentration presented.  However, the POR varies in an odor-identity and intensity-specific manner.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>e. What is the baseline rate of PORs in the absence of stimuli?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Almost zero.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>f. What can you say about the purpose of the POR? I lack an intuition for why a fly would wiggle the maxillary palps. This is a question that is probably impossible to answer definitively, but even a speculative explanation would help the reader better understand.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The locusts use these finger-like maxillary palps to grab a grass blade while eating. Hence, we believe that this might be a preparatory response to feeding. We have noted that the PORs are elicited more by food-related odorants. Hence, we think it is a measure of odor appetitiveness. This has been added to the manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) Physiology</p>
<p>a. Does stimulus repetition affect &quot;spontaneous&quot; activity (i.e., firing in the interstimulus interval? To study this question, in Figures 2b and c, it would be valuable to display more of the prestimulus period, and a quantification of the stability or lability of the inter-stimulus activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Done. Yes, the spontaneous activity does appear to change in an odor-specific manner. We have done some detailed analysis of the same in this preprint:</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. When does the response change stabilize? While the authors compare repetition 1 to repetition 25, from the rasters it appears that the changes have largely stabilized after the 3rd or 4th repetition. In Figure 5, there is a clear difference between repetition 1-3 or so and the rest. Are successive repetitions more similar than more temporally-separated repetitions (e.g., is rep 13 more similar to 14 than to 17?). I was not able to judge this based on the dendrograms of Figure 5. If the responses do stabilize at it appears, it would be more informative to focus on the dynamics of the first few repetitions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer makes an astute observation. Yes, the changes in firing rates are larger in the first three trials (Fig. 3c). The ensemble activity patterns, though, are relatively stable across all trials as indicated by the PCA plots and classification analysis results.</p>

<p>c. How do temporal dynamics change? Locust PNs have richly varied temporal dynamics, but how these may be affected is not clear. The across-population average is poorly suited to capture this feature of the activity. For example, the PNs often have an early transient response, and these appear to be timed differently across the population. These structures will be obscured in a cross population average. Looking at the rasters, it looks like the initial transient changes its timing (e.g., PN40 responses move earlier; PN33 responses move later.). Quantification of latency to first spike after stimulus may make a useful measure of the dynamics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted earlier, to keep our story simple in this manuscript, we have only focused on the variations across trials (i.e., much slower response dynamics). We did this as we are not recording neural and behavioral responses from the same locust. We plan to do this and directly compare the neural and behavioral dynamics in the same locust.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>d.How legitimate is the link between POR and physiology? While their changes can show a nice correlation, the fact the data were taken from separate animals makes them less compelling than they would be otherwise. How feasible is it to capture POR and physiology in the same prep?</p>
<p>This would be most helpful, but I suspect may be too technically challenging to be within scope.</p>

<p>The antennal lobe activity in the input about the volatile chemicals encountered by the locust. The POR is a behavioral output. Hence, we believe that examining the correlation between the olfactory system's input and output is a valid approach. However, we have only compared the mean trends in neural and behavioral datasets, and dynamics on a much slower timescale. We are currently developing the capability to record neural responses in behaving animals. This turned out to be a bit more challenging than we had envisioned. We plan to do fine-grained comparisons of the neural and behavioral dynamics, recommended by this reviewer, in those preparations.</p>
<p>Further, we will also be able to examine whether the variability in behavioral responses could be predicted from neural activity changes in that prep.</p>
