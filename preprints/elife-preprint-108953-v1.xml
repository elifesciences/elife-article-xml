<abstract><p>Enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) is a major bacterial enteropathogen causing diarrhea among children in developing countries. Here, we found that EPEC induced isolated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in epithelial cells, triggered by extracellular ATP (eATP). These responses were dependent on type III secretion (T3S) and down-regulated by the bacterial secreted protease EspC, consistent with eATP released by the T3S translocon. By performing high speed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we uncovered that at the onset of infection, low eATP levels triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responses involving the whole cell but showing the small amplitude and fast kinetics usually associated with local Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. The findings, supported by theoretical modeling, evocate a conceptual shift whereby low amounts of inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) induced by low eATP levels and subsequent moderate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release enable the fast coordination of IP<sub>3</sub> receptor cluster activation throughout the cell. Importantly, these yet undescribed coordinated fast responses occurred over prolonged time periods and defined a cell state with dampened activation of the pro-inflammatory transcriptional activator NF-kB associated with a decrease in its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine modification.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>EPEC are diarrheagenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that cause significant morbidity and mortality in children under two years of age. While infection rates have significantly declined in industrialized nations, EPEC remains a major public health concern in low-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lozer et al., 2013</xref>). EPEC form attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on intestinal epithelial cells and lack the ability to produce Shiga toxins or heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Croxen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gomes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hazen et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of EPEC to form A/E lesions is determined by the locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE), a large genomic pathogenicity island that encodes the essential genetic elements required for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>). The LEE region of EPEC (E2348/69) encodes components of the type III secretion system (T3SS), a molecular apparatus that translocate at least 25 bacterial effector proteins into the host cell. The EPEC type III secretion system (T3SS) consists of a basal body and a needle-like structure, resembling those found in <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic>, but with a distinct sheath-like extension at the needle tip, primarily composed of EspA, and about ten times longer than the T3SS needles from other bacterial species. This EspA filament acts as a molecular bridge, extending from the bacterium to the host cell membrane, allowing insertion of the EspB and EspD translocon components into the host cell membrane, enabling type III effectors injection in the cell cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Creasey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Monjarás Feria et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sal-Man et al., 2012</xref>). Osmoprotection assays suggest that the translocon forms a pore with an internal diameter ranging between 3 to 5 nm, allowing the passage of unfolded effector proteins into the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>). However, the T3SS translocon shows weak pore-forming activity during EPEC infection of epithelial cells, presumably because it forms a sealed conduct between the T3SS and host cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Guignot et al., 2016</xref>). EspC, a secreted serine protease from the autotransporter family, targets EspA and EspD and down-regulates pore formation activity associated with cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guignot et al., 2015</xref>). EPEC T3SS effector proteins translocated into host cells lead are responsible for attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions and intimate bacterial adhesion to the host cells associated with the formation of an actin-rich pedestal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen &amp; Frankel, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The detection of pathogenic bacteria by intestinal epithelial cells plays an important role in initiating pro-inflammatory responses. Recognition of bacterial surface components by pattern recognition receptors triggers pro-inflammatory signaling pathways involving the transcriptional activator NF-κB and the production of cytokines such as interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Edwards et al., 2011</xref>). However, EPEC suppresses these signaling pathways early in infection through the coordinated action of several T3SS effector proteins. Among the first translocated T3SS effectors, Tir interacts with TNF-α receptor-associated factors (TRAF2 and TRAF6), recruiting the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mills et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ruchaud-Sparagano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). Several non-LEE T3SS effectors, including NleE, NleB, NleH1, NleH2, NleC, and NleD, further contribute to inhibiting NF-κB and MAPK signaling. NleE and NleB stabilize the interaction between NFκB and its inhibitory subunit IκB, preventing its degradation, thereby keeping NFκB in an inactive state. The ability of NleE to inhibit NFκB signaling depends on its S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). NleE-mediated methylation of TAB2/3 prevents IKK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). NleB selectively blocks NFκB activation through GlcNAcylation of the TNF-α receptor (TNFR) adaptor protein and TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD) (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pearson et al., 2013</xref>). The T3SS effectors NleH1, NleH2 and NleC also interfere with NFκB nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gao et al., 2009</xref>). NleC specifically cleaves P65 RelA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Giogha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ruchaud-Sparagano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yen et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, NleF has been implicated in the activation of NF-κB, underscoring the complexity of the regulation of inflammation during bacterial infection and suggesting the timing of various T3SS effectors’ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pallett et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar complexity applies to T3SS effectors regulating cell death and survival pathways during EPEC infection of epithelial cells. Tir was found to elicit a rapid Ca²⁺ influx across the host cell membrane, through the activation of a host plasma membrane Ca²⁺ channel, the mechanosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) leading to pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhong et al., 2022</xref>). However, the NleA effector, blocks the delivery of TRPV2 channels to the cell surface, thereby dampening Tir-induced Ca²⁺ influx. The effector NleF also directly binds caspase-4 to inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by EPEC pili (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abul-Milh et al., 2001</xref>). However, the NleD and NleB effectors inhibit this pathway by cleaving JNK and GlcNAcylating the death domain adaptor proteins TRADD and FADD, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baruch, Gur-Arie, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pearson et al., 2013</xref>). While EspC prevents cytotoxicity linked to pore-formation by the T3SS translocon during the early EPEC infection phases, it was shown to promote intrinsic apoptosis through increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calpain activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Serapio-Palacios &amp; Navarro-Garcia, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Central to inflammation and cell death / survival pathways induced by EPEC, bacterial-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals have been a matter of debate. EPEC infection is known to perturb host Ca²⁺ signaling, but the source and sequence of Ca²⁺ signals during infection remain controversial. EPEC was shown to induce Ca²⁺ influx associated with a loss of mitochondrial membranes permeability leading to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ramachandran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhong et al., 2022</xref>), but was also reported to trigger IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca²⁺ release possibly involved in bacterial-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baldwin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baldwin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Foubister et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bain et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the characteristics and implications of EPEC-induced Ca²⁺ responses in epithelial cells. We characterized yet undescribed Ca²⁺ signals induced by EPEC and low ATP levels, presenting the fast dynamics and small amplitude of local Ca²⁺ responses but involving large cell area. We found that these responses likely result from the coordination of elementary responses via rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca²⁺ release over large cell area, challenging generally admitted concepts on Ca²⁺ diffusion. Importantly, we show that these newly described responses have functional implications by dampening the cell ability to respond to inflammatory signals.</p>

<title>EPEC induces Ca<sup>²⁺</sup> responses that depend on Type III secretion-mediated eATP release</title>
<p>Despite their critical role in cellular processes key to bacterial infection, EPEC-induced Ca²⁺ responses remain to be characterized. We therefore set up to perform a detailed single cell imaging of Ca²⁺ responses elicited by cells infected by EPEC.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, EPEC induced Ca²⁺ transients often corresponding to a single peak of varying amplitude detected over several minutes, with a median corresponding to 6.2 ± 0.8% of the maximal histamine response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A</xref>, B). These Ca²⁺ responses were dependent on a functional T3SS, since they were not observed for the T3SS-deficient <italic>escN</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A</xref>, C). Only 40 ± 4.7 % of cells, however, elicited responses when challenged wild-type EPEC at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 bacteria per cell, a value that raised to 76 ± 4.8 % when using a high MOI of 80 bacteria per cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast, even at the low MOI, more than 83 % of cells showed actin pedestals, indicating that Ca²⁺ responses were elicited only in a fraction of cells targeted by EPEC-type T3SS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1D</xref>, E). The frequency of Ca²⁺ responses per cell increased over the incubation time with an average frequency of responses per cell raising by 6.9 to 8.3-fold from the first to the last 30 min of EPEC challenge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). This increased frequency suggested the accumulation of an agonist in the extracellular medium during the course of the infection triggering IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca²⁺ release. When pooling all single cell responses, we could observe a steady increase in the average cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of the cell population, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ramachandran et al., 2020</xref>; Figs. S1B). However, when performing single cell imaging, we did not observe an increase in cytosolic Ca²⁺ basal levels even at high MOI after 2 hours incubation with wild-type bacteria (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Together, these results suggest that EPEC induces isolated Ca²⁺ responses that depend on the T3SS for the release of limiting amounts of a Ca²⁺ agonist.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>EPEC-mediated Ca²⁺ responses depend on ATP released in the extracellular medium via the T3SS translocon</title>
<p>In previous works, we showed that the EPEC T3SS translocon forms pores in host cell plasma membranes that were down-regulated by the bacterial secreted serine protease EspC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Guignot et al., 2016</xref>). We posit that low amounts of ATP released in the extracellular medium by the T3SS translocon were responsible for the isolated Ca²⁺ responses of reduced amplitude elicited by EPEC. According to this view, by removing T3SS translocons from host cell membranes, EspC would down-regulate EPEC-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling explaining the low ratio of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responding cells relative to cells forming actin pedestals.</p>
<p>Consistent with this and as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A-C</xref>, an <italic>espC</italic> mutant induced more Ca²⁺ responses than wild-type EPEC, with 94 ± 3% responding cells and a frequency of 10.5 ± 1.2 responses per cell over the 60 min analysis, compared 40 ± 4.7% responding cells and less than 2 responses per cell for the <italic>espC</italic> mutant and wild-type EPEC, respectively. Also, the average amplitude of Ca²⁺ responses induced by the <italic>espC</italic> mutant was higher than that of wild-type EPEC, suggesting more eATP release (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Accordingly, cell treatment with Suramin, an inhibitor of purinergic receptors, abolished Ca²⁺ responses induced by the wild-type and <italic>espC</italic> mutant strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2B</xref>, C). As expected for ATP-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, sample treatment with EGTA, a cell impermeant chelator of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not decrease the percent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responding cells triggered by wild-type EPEC or the <italic>espC</italic> mutant (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). The frequency of responses per cell was also not inhibited and even appear to increase upon EGTA-treatment in cells challenged with wild-type EPEC and the <italic>espC</italic> mutant (Figs. S2B, C). In control experiments, Suramin treatment did not affect actin pedestal structures induced by these strains (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

<p>Together, these results suggest that Ca²⁺ responses induced by EPEC are mediated by ATP released in the extracellular medium via pores formed by the T3SS translocon and are down-regulated by EspC.</p>

<title>EPEC induces coordinated Ca²⁺ responses from single IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters</title>
<p>We previously showed that <italic>Shigella</italic> induced local Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses dependent on the T3SS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (Tran Van Nhieu et al., 2013), suggesting that insertion of the Type III translocon was responsible bacterial-induced local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. We therefore set up to investigate whether EPEC could also trigger T3SS-dependent local Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses.</p>
<p>To explore this, we performed rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging at a frequency of 57 ms acquisition per frame to sample elementary Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, by performing high speed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we detected fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases associated with cell challenge with EPEC. These fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses did not correspond to other responses previously reported since they involved the whole cell or a large cell area but show a small amplitude and fast dynamics usually associated with local Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). As observed for the ATP-dependent responses shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, the <italic>espC</italic> mutant triggered a higher percent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responding cells than wild-type EPEC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Also, the response amplitude was higher for the <italic>espC</italic> mutant with an average amplitude corresponding to 7.7 ± 0.4 % (mean ± SEM) of the maximal agonist response, compared to 5.4 ± 0.4 % (mean ± SEM) for wild-type EPEC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These responses occurred repeatedly at a high frequency of up to 4.5 responses per minute during several minutes following bacterial challenge (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>) and were dependent on Type III Secretion, as evidenced by the lack of response in cells infected with the <italic>ΔescN</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). EPEC-induced fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release since they were inhibited by U73122, a PLC inhibitor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). These similarities with the EPEC-induced eATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses suggested that the atypical fast responses were triggered by low amounts of ATP released in the extracellular medium following insertion in host cell plasma membranes of discrete numbers of EPEC T3SS translocons. Consistently, these atypical EPEC-induced fast responses were abolished in the presence of the ATP receptor inhibitor Suramin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C</xref>, D).</p>

<title>EPEC-induced fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are triggered by low ATP levels</title>
<p>Previous studies have described local Ca²⁺ increases triggered by sub-maximal agonist concentrations and leading to limited IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. These local Ca²⁺ responses are typically small, of short durations and localized to subcellular regions. Among these, the so-called “Blips” correspond to elementary events of opening of a single IP<sub>3</sub> receptor channel usually lasting between 50 and 100 ms, whereas “Puffs” involve the synchronized activation of multiple IP<sub>3</sub> receptor channels in localized clusters and last several hundreds of ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Swillens et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast to these described local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, EPEC-induced fast and small responses could occur throughout the cell, suggesting the coordination of elementary responses over large cell area. Since our findings suggested that these responses were elicited by minute amounts of eATP released by a discrete number of T3SS translocons, we investigated whether low ATP levels could elicit similar responses.</p>
<p>HeLa cells treated with 150 nM ATP showed Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses that were indistinguishable from fast responses elicited by EPEC, with an average percent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responding cells of 61.2 ± 5.8 (median ± SEM) and a frequency of 3.9 responses per cell over 60 seconds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4A</xref>, C and S4A, B). These fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses had an amplitude that did not exceed 10 % of the maximal agonist response, and occurred over several minutes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). As observed for EPEC, fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses induced by low ATP levels involved the whole cell or large cell area encompassing the nuclear and perinuclear area and corresponding to at least 30 % of the cell area as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>. In this large area, all ROIs corresponding to 1 square micron showed a superimposable profile, as illustrated by traces in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. More detailed scrutinizing showed that in their initial mounting phase, these fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were created by the opening of discrete clusters involving an area of ca. 0.04 μm<sup>2</sup> that had a transient activity, or possibly were highly mobile, since they were seldom detected at a similar location for three consecutive 22 ms acquisition frames (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). These discrete clusters showed similar Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics suggesting the coordination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release of single IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters throughout the area that we will hereafter termed CCRICs for “<underline>C</underline>oordinated <underline>C</underline>a<sup>2+</sup> <underline>R</underline>esponses from IP<sub>3</sub>R <underline>C</underline>lusters”. Treatment with BAPTA-AM to chelate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> led to a complete inhibition of CCRICs (N = 3, n &gt; 150 cells; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses could still be detected upon cell treatment with EGTA-AM consistent with its lower k<sub>on</sub> rate for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but with a significant inhibition of the percentage of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responding cells as well as of the frequency of responses per cell, suggesting that coordination could occur via Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A-C</xref>). Local responses elicited by these ATP concentrations could also be detected often occurring at the cell periphery (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4B</xref>, red region and 4C, red arrow). While the CCRICs area and the peripheral puff area showed spatially segregated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses at the onset of the elicitation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, peaks 1, 3 and 2, 4), this spatial segregation appeared to blur over the duration of the experiment with peaks integrating responses from the whole cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, green and red dashed lanes).</p>

<p>In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, low ATP levels lead to low IP<sub>3</sub> levels activating a limited number of IP<sub>3</sub> clusters, opening stochastically and releasing small amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In a given area of the cell, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> variation integrates Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from clusters within this area, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusing from or to other cell area. For a given response, the initially firing cluster is contained in an area characterized by the highest Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak amplitude (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, blue and green arrows) that dampens in a distal area (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, blue and green arrowheads). If the density of IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters is low, as expected for ER compartment at the cell periphery, the spatial segregation of the initial firing cluster and resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion to other area is clearly detected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In instances, however, the model predicts temporally coordinated responses of similar amplitude, suggesting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from secondary clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, black arrow). For both type of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, a large value of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion coefficient of 100 μm<sup>2</sup> / s is a key parameter that needs to be taken into account in the model. While it is generally admitted that Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffuses very slowly due to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers in the cell (∼30 μm<sup>2</sup>/s), the low levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released by CCRICs may not be subjected to the diffusion limitations observed at higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, because of the relative moderate affinity of buffers for Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p>If the IP<sub>3</sub>R cluster density is high, as expected in the large perinuclear and nuclear area corresponding to the bulk of the ER, the coordination between individual clusters is very fast (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). As a result, the identification of initial firing clusters goes beyond the technical capacities of the imaging set-up, and ROI within this area show comparable profiles of fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Upon prolonged incubation with increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and sensitization of IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters, the coordination of responses linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release becomes predominant throughout the cell (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings indicate that the novel Ca²⁺ response pattern is not exclusive to EPEC infection and can be replicated by low levels of eATP, suggesting a broader physiological relevance. From an immunological perspective, CCRICs may therefore play a critical role in various signaling pathways during bacterial infection.</p>

<title>Low eATP levels dampen NF-κB activation</title>
<p>eATP is a well-characterized danger signal contributing to the elicitation of pro-inflammatory signals in various tissues in response to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Savio et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies linked intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling and NF-κB activation, a key transcription factor that triggers inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Smedler et al., 2014</xref>).

As expected from the IκB-α results, TNF-α induced the phosphorylation of the NF-κB P65 subunit and ATP led to a delay and decrease in P65 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report here the characterization of CCRICs, corresponding to yet undescribed Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses showing the rapid kinetics and small amplitude of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses but coordinated over large cell area. We found that CCRICs implicate the rapid coordination of IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters in large cell area, challenging established concepts in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling field.</p>
<p>Ca²⁺ diffusion in the cytosol is regulated by mobile and immobile Ca²⁺-binding proteins acting as buffers and forming localized microdomains with steep Ca²⁺ concentration gradients. At the mouth of an open IP₃R channel, Ca²⁺ concentration can reach 100 μM, while just 1–2 μm away, it may drop below 1 μM. Diffusion is restricted by Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers with K<sub>D</sub>’s that are generally lower than this concentration. Consequently, Ca²⁺ signaling is generally admitted to be spatially restricted, typically influencing regions within approximately 5 μm of the release site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Foskett et al., 2007</xref>). The distribution of Ca²⁺-binding proteins and the spatial arrangement of release channels allow IP₃R-mediated [Ca²⁺]<sub>i</sub> signals to exhibit diverse spatial and temporal properties, making this system highly adaptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vandeput et al., 2007</xref>). High-resolution optical imaging of fluorescent Ca²⁺ indicators in intact cells indicates that IP₃-mediated [Ca²⁺]<sub>i</sub> signals are structured levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Foskett et al., 2007</xref>). At low IP₃ levels, individual IP₃R opens stochastically at discrete release sites, causing localized elevations in cytoplasmic [Ca²⁺]. At higher IP₃ levels, Ca²⁺ release spreads between IP₃R clusters, propagating waves that travel at tens of microns per second, coordinating intracellular signaling ultimately leading to a global Ca²⁺ response. In reference models describing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, cell regions with a high IP<sub>3</sub>R density initiate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response from which Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves propagate with a diffusion coefficient of 10 – 30 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Falcke et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to these described global and local Ca²⁺ responses, we found CCRICs to be highly temporally coordinated over large area, suggesting the fast diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. While challenging generally admitted concepts on the poor diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, this view is fully supported by our theoretical modeling implicating the fast diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with a diffusion coefficient of at least 100 μm<sup>2</sup>/s that can be expected at low cytoplasmic [Ca²⁺]. Indeed, at these low Ca²⁺ concentrations not exceeding a few hundreds nM, the majority of Ca²⁺ buffers are not expected to efficiently bind to Ca²⁺ and to significantly interfere with Ca²⁺ diffusion because of their relative low affinity.</p>
<p>We found that CCRICs implicate a large cell area including the nuclear and perinuclar area, while local Ca²⁺ responses were detected at small area of the cell periphery. The large CCRIC area likely involves the bulk of the endoplasmic reticulum, while peripheral area may contain smaller ER compartments. In our model considering fast Ca2+ diffusion when buffers are far from saturation, the higher density of IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters in the CCRIC area accounts for the high coordination of the responses, relative to the lack of coordination in peripheral area where lower IP<sub>3</sub>R density is expected.</p>
<p>We showed that a low dose of eATP triggering CCRICs delayed and dampened NF-κB activation linked to a reduction in O-GlcNAcylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit. One major open question is the mechanism by which CCRICS down-regulate NF-κB activation. NF-κB activity can be modulated by O-GlcNAcylation, a reversible glycosylation modification catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu &amp; Ramakrishnan, 2021</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that Ca²⁺ signals activate Ca²⁺-regulated enzymes like CaMKII, which in turn phosphorylates and activate OGT, promotes O-GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>). In other studies, OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation could modulate NF-κB signaling pathway (X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dong et al., 2023</xref>). O-GlcNAcylation of P65 could also inhibit its interaction with IκB-α, promote p65 nuclear translocation and increase NF-κB transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu &amp; Ramakrishnan, 2021</xref>). Reduced O-GlcNAcylation of P65 at residues S550 and S551 was shown to result in decreased NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Motolani et al., 2023</xref>). These findings are in line with our results suggesting that CCRICs elicited by low-level eATP, downregulate p65 O-GlcNAcylation and NF-κB activation, possibly by modulating OGT activity or OGT-p65 interactions. Reduced O-GlcNAcylation of p65 may affect its phosphorylation patterns indirectly, perhaps by altering the interaction of NF-κB with kinases or phosphatases involved in its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Özcan et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that eATP differentially regulate inflammatory signaling pathways in epithelial cells by dampening NF-κB activation at low levels and stimulating its activation at high concentrations. These results extend the key role of eATP from a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) to a fine-tuner of inflammatory responses depending on its concentration.</p>

Cells were preloaded with the fluorescent indicator dye Cal-520 (AAT #21130) for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by two PBS washes and one time with DMEM. And placed coverslips, imaging was performed in an observation chamber in DMEM without phenol red, supplemented with 25 mM HEPES. Following a 3-minute baseline acquisition, add the required bacteria strains and OD600 into the chamber. Following a 10-minute incubation at room temperature to allow bacterial attachment. Imaging was then carried out at 35°C using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted fluorescence microscope with a 60× objective for 1h of infection. Fluorescence signals were acquired 485 nm with excitation and 535 nm emission parameters. Image control and data acquisition were managed by Simple32 software (Compix Inc.), depending on the experiment requirement, imaging at 22ms, 57ms or 10 sec acquisition intervals. 3 μM of Histamine and 2 μM of ionomycin were applied to check the ability of cells to show calcium response. Images were captured using a CMOS camera (Hamamatsu) and analyzed using the same software.</p>

<title>Modelling</title>
<p>We develop a fully stochastic spatial model to simulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release dynamics from IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters in a two-dimensional representation of a HeLa cell. The simulation domain measures 10 × 10 µm<sup>2</sup> and is discretized into a 20 × 20 grid of compartments (0.5 × 0.5 µm<sup>2</sup> each), each representing a cytosolic subvolume of 10<sup>-16</sup> L. Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange between the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and the cytosol occurs through IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated release, SERCA uptake, and ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak, following the framework by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Voorsluijs et al., 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ornelas-Guevara et al., 2023</xref>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion is implemented stochastically as a kinetic process between adjacent compartments (Kraus et al., 1996), with a diffusion coefficient of 100 µm<sup>2</sup>/s to reflect moderate endogenous buffering. Each IP<sub>3</sub>R cluster functions as a single unit with four possible states: Open (O), Closed (C) and two Inhibited states (i1, and i2), transitioning in response to local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and [IP<sub>3</sub>]. This phenomenological description captures key characteristics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs and their transition to global signals via Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and Calcium Induced Calcium Release.</p>
<p>We perform all simulations using the Gillespie algorithm, where each event, reaction or diffusion, is selected stochastically based on its propensity. See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7">Supplementary Methods</xref> for complete model equations and parameter values.</p>

<title>Western Blot analysis</title>
<p>To obtain total cell extracts, cells were lysed in sample buffer 1x (62.5 mM Tris pH=8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled at 95°C for 5 minutes. Proteins from total lysates were separated by SDS PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.45μM AmershamTM ProtranTM). Western Blot analysis was performed according to standard procedure using the following primary antibodies: IkappaBalpha (OZYME, 9424S), Phospho-IκB-α (OZYME, 9424S), NF-kappaB p65 (OZYME, 9246S), Phospho-NF-kappaB p65 (OZYME, 3033S), HSP90 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies sc-13119). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (Cytiva) and anti-rabbit (Sigma) were used as secondary antibodies.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation assays</title>
<p>HeLa cells were seeded in 150 cm<sup>2</sup> dishes (7.4 × 10⁶ cells/dish) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were pretreated with 20 µM BAPTA for 30 minutes at room temperature where indicated, then stimulated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α alone or in combination with 150 nM ATP for an additional 12 minutes. After treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM NaF and 1 mM Na₃VO₄, lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA), and incubated on a rotating wheel at 4°C for 1 hour. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were incubated with 5 µL of anti-NF-kB p65 antibody (Abcam, ab16502) for 2 hours at 4°C with rotation, followed by overnight incubation with pre-equilibrated protein A/G beads. Immunocomplexes were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with PBS, then eluted in Laemmli buffer by boiling at 100°C for 5 minutes. Input and IP samples were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against O-GlcNAc (Abcam, ab2739), anti-NF-kB p65 (OZYME, 9246S), and Actin (OZYME, 4967).</p>

<p>Following previous modeling studies of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Voorsluijs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ornelas-Guevara et al. 2023</xref>), we implement a fully stochastic model of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using the Gillespie algorithm. The model captures IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters, SERCA-mediated reuptake, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak, and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion. The simulated HeLa cell is represented as a 10 × 10 µm<sup>2</sup> square, discretized into a 20 × 20 grid. Each compartment (0.5 × 0.5 µm<sup>2</sup>) corresponds to a cytosolic volume of 10<sup>-16</sup> L.</p>
<p>Each IP<sub>3</sub>R cluster is represented as a single unit with four discrete states: Open (<bold>O</bold>), Closed (<bold>C</bold>), and two inhibited states (<bold>i₁</bold>, <bold>i₂</bold>). The transition from <bold>C</bold> to <bold>O</bold> depend on both [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and [IP<sub>3</sub>], while the transition from <bold>O</bold> to <bold>i1</bold> depends on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], following the model described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ornelas-Guevara et al., 2023</xref> (see <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>).

<p>This study reports <bold>important</bold> advances in our understanding of how enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) interacts at the intestinal interface. <bold>Solid</bold> data describe a novel model of spatially coordinated calcium signaling to modulate NF-kB activation; additional data and clarification of methods would improve the strength of these conclusions. These findings, which integrate imaging, genetics, and computational modeling, provide a new way to consider host-pathogen interactions in EPEC infections that may lead to improved therapies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their article, Guo and coworkers investigate the Ca²⁺ signaling responses induced by Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in epithelial cells and how these responses regulate NF-κB activation. The authors show that EPEC induces rapid, spatially coordinated Ca²⁺ transients mediated by extracellular ATP released through the type III secretion system (T3SS). Using high-speed Ca²⁺ imaging and stochastic modeling, they propose that low ATP levels trigger &quot;Coordinated Ca²⁺ Responses from IP₃R Clusters&quot; (CCRICs) via fast Ca²⁺ diffusion and Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release. These responses may dampen TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation through Ca²⁺-dependent modulation of O-GlcNAcylation of p65. The interdisciplinary work suggests a new perspective on calcium-mediated immune response by combining quantitative imaging, bacterial genetics, and computational modeling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study provides a new concept for host responses to bacterial infections and introduces the concept of Coordinated Ca²⁺ Responses from IP₃R Clusters (CCRICs) as synchronized, whole-cell-scale Ca²⁺ transients with the fast kinetics typical of local events. This is elegantly done by an interdisciplinary approach using quantitative measurements and mechanistic modelling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The effect of coordination by fast diffusion for small eATP concentrations is explained by the resulting low Ca2+ concentration that is not as strongly affected by calcium buffers compared to higher concentrations. While I agree with this statement on the relative level, CICR is based on the resulting absolute concentration at neighboring IP3Rs (to activate them). Thus, I do not fully agree with the explanation, or at least would expect to use the modelling approach to demonstrate this effect. Simulations for different activation and buffer concentrations could strengthen this point and exclude potential inhibition of channels at higher stimulation levels.</p>
<p>In this respect, I would also include the details of the modelling, such as implementation environment, parameters, and benchmarking. The description in the Supplementary Methods is very similar to the description in the main text. In terms of reproducibility, it would be important to at least provide simulation parameters, and providing the code would align with the emerging standards for reproducible science.</p>
<p>(2) Quantitative characterization of CCRICs:</p>
<p>The paper would benefit from a clearer definition of the term CCRICs and quantitative descriptors like duration, amplitude distribution, frequency, and spatial extent (also in relation to the comment on the EGTA measurements below). Furthermore, it remains unclear to me whether CCRICs represent a population of rapidly propagating micro-waves or truly simultaneous events. Maybe kymographs or wave-front propagation analyses (at least from simulations if experimental resolution is too bad) would strengthen this point.</p>
<p>(3) Specificity of pharmacological tools:</p>
<p>Suramin and U73122 are known to have off-target effects. Control experiments using alternative P2 receptor antagonists like PPADS or inactive U73343 analogs would strengthen the causal link.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors of this study are trying to resolve how cellular infection by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) subverts cellular signaling pathways to promote infection and dampen immune responses. Specifically, alteration in calcium dynamics has been evidenced in the prior literature as a potential initiator of these adaptations, and this study provides ideas and mechanistic detail as to how cellular calcium dynamics may be subverted by pathogens.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The clear strengths of this paper relate to the new ideas inherent in the proposed hypothesis and their support from the experimental approaches used. Overall, the proposed work provides new ideas in this area, which will benefit from further investigation. Certainly, this is an interesting and challenging paradigm to pick apart mechanistically, and is important for improving treatments from intestinal infections.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional insight is needed in three specific areas to convincingly support the conclusions drawn by the authors. These three areas are: first, a better description of the infection-associated calcium signals. Second, a mechanistic definition of the relevant purinoceptors versus other pathways to increase cellular calcium. Third, an effort to show that the proposed pathways have relevance in a polarized epithelial cell.</p>
