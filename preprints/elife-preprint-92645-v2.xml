<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease with a high prevalence in the elderly population, but our understanding of its mechanisms remains incomplete. Analysis of serum exosomal small RNA sequencing data from clinical patients and gene expression data from OA patient serum and cartilage obtained from the GEO database revealed a common dysregulated miRNA, miRNA-199b-5p. In vitro cell experiments demonstrated that miRNA-199b-5p inhibits chondrocyte vitality and promotes extracellular matrix degradation. Conversely, inhibition of miRNA-199b-5p under inflammatory conditions exhibited protective effects against damage. Local viral injection of miRNA-199b-5p into mice induced a decrease in pain threshold and OA-like changes. In an OA model, inhibition of miRNA-199b-5p alleviated the pathological progression of OA. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation identified <italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic> as potential target genes of miRNA-199b-5p. Thus, these results indicated that miRNA-199b-5p/<italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic> axis might be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of OA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease characterized by the deterioration of articular cartilage and affecting all components of the joint, including the synovium, subchondral bone, and meniscus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Knee OA (KOA) is the leading cause of disability and increased living costs among elderly patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Currently, the treatment options for osteoarthritis are limited to symptomatic relief and joint replacement. However, the insufficient relief of symptoms, potential medication side effects, and the economic burden and complications associated with joint replacement surgeries have prompted the need to identify new, effective, and safe treatment methods and explore unknown targets for individuals with KOA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that are distributed in body fluids such as serum and play a crucial biological role by delivering molecules such as MicroRNAs (miRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. They serve as vital carriers for intercellular communication and transfer of genetic information. MiRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs ranging from 18 to 24 nucleotides in length, which exert inhibitory effects on the expression of target genes through interactions with mRNA. Studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play a crucial role as a pathogenic factor in osteoarthritis (OA). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> For instance, miR-199b-5p was found to contribute to the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells <sup>6</sup>LJanother miR-140 showed cartilage-specific expression, and its expression was significantly reduced in OA cartilage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup><sup>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.Recently,intra-articular injection of antisense oligonucleotides of miR-181a-5p produced chondroprotective effects in OA mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we initially screened miR-199b-5p as a potential key miRNA based on clinical data by detecting differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs. To elucidate the role and function of miR-199b-5p, we investigated its impact on chondrocytes and identified its molecular targets through <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. Furthermore, we explored its role <italic>in vivo</italic>. Hence, this article not only identifies miR-199b-5p as a potential micro-target for KOA but also provides a potential strategy for future identification of new molecular drugs.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Identification and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs in serum exosomes</title>
<p>To investigate the dysregulated miRNAs in serum exosomes of KOA patients, we extracted exosomal miRNAs from serum and performed sequencing. Serum samples from 15 patients with KOA and 10 healthy subjects were collected (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). After extraction, the serum exosomes were observed under transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis, revealing a diameter ranging from approximately 70 to 150 nm (Fig. S1A, B). Furthermore, the surface marker proteins CD9, CD63, and CD81 were found to be expressed on the exosomes (Fig. S1C). Next, we performed sequencing of miRNAs in serum exosomes.</p>
<p>The results showed that 88 miRNAs were up-regulated and 89 miRNAs were downregulated in KOA patients compared with the control group based on fold change &gt; 1.5 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). Afterwards, we performed bioinformatics Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses on these differentially expressed miRNA. Among the top 5 enriched results of up-regulated differentially expressed miRNAs, the CC (Cell GO:0044297, intracellular GO:0005622, and cytoplasm GO:0005737) GO terms were notable. The MF (Translation activator activity GO:0008494, binding to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes GO:0031624, and possessing transferase activity GO:0016740) GO terms and BP (Cell differentiation GO:0045595 and the stabilization of mRNA through 3’-UTR mediation GO:0070935) GO terms were also significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The top 10 enriched KEGG pathways, PI3K-AKT signaling, Ras signaling, apoptosis, and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis are considered to be of significant importance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The analysis of the top 5 down-regulated differential miRNAs reveals interesting findings. the CC (Cell GO:0005623, intracellular GO:0005622) GO terms were particularly noteworthy. The MF (RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity and sequence-specific DNA binding GO:0000981) GO terms, as well as the BP (collagen-activated signaling pathway GO:0038065) GO terms, were also deemed significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Moreover, the analysis of the top 10 enriched KEGG pathways revealed a strong association with the Hedgehog signaling pathway, pluripotency of stem cells, and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-keratan sulfate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Dysregulated serum exosomal miRNAs were found to be expressed in both serum and cartilage</title>
<p>Subsequently, we aimed to investigate whether these dysregulated miRNAs in serum exosomes show differential expression in other affected sites or tissues of KOA. Leveraging the KOA patient cartilage and serum sequencing data available in the GEO database, we compared our dysregulated miRNA list with the datasets. Remarkably, we identified 169 miRNAs that exhibited differential expression in the serum of KOA patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting their involvement in the disease. Moreover, these miRNAs were also found to be expressed in KOA patient cartilage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This robust validation reinforces the reliability of our data. Consequently, we proceeded with further screening of differentially expressed genes.</p>

<title>miRNA-199b-5p has been identified as a potential target molecule in KOA</title>
<p>Based on the P-value and exosomal expression, combined with the results of our additional experiments (Fig. S5). Five miRNAs (hsa-mir-3168, hsa-mir-1296-5p, hsa-mir-15b-3p, hsa-mir-338-3p and hsa-mir-199b-5p) were selected to further research and validated in independent human samples by RT-qPCR (hsa-mir-199b-5p, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; hsa-mir-3168, <italic>p</italic>=0.33; hsa-mir-15b-3p, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; hsa-mir-338-3p, <italic>p</italic>=0.20 and hsa-mir-1296-5p, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). To further explore the functional roles of these miRNAs, we established a mouse model of KOA to evaluate their expression in the joints. Due to species differences, the corresponding sequence of mir-1296-5p could not be identified in the mouse model. we examined the expression of miR-199b-5p (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.01), miR-15b-3p (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05) and miR-338-3p (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05) in mouse joint tissue samples (control <italic>vs.</italic> M-0.5) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The results showed that only the expression trend of miR-199b-5p was consistent between the clinical samples and the mouse arthritis model. Therefore, we selected miR-199b-5p as the target for our subsequent research.</p>

<title>miR-199b-5p mimic inhibits the cell viability and extracellular matrix (ECM) of chondrocytes while the inhibitor restores LPS-induced chondrocytes damage</title>
<p>We first extracted mouse primary chondrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). In vitro experiments showed that overexpression miR-199b-5p inhibited the viability of chondrocytes(<italic>p</italic>&lt;<italic>0.01</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, Fig. S2). we also find miR-199b-5p mimic increased the mRNA expressions of <italic>MMP3</italic> (<italic>p=</italic>0.09) and <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> (<italic>p&lt;0.05</italic>) and decreased the mRNA expression of <italic>COL2A1</italic>(<italic>p</italic>=0.05), <italic>AGGRECAN</italic> (p=0.20) and <italic>SOX9</italic> (<italic>p</italic>=0.22), which are often used as the biomarkers of chondrocytes ECM metabolic balance.

<p>To explore the effect of miR-199b-5p under pathological conditions, an LPS-stimulated inflammation chondrocyte cell model was established. We examined the effect of LPS at 5, 10, and 15 μg/ml on cell viability and found that cell viability was significantly decreased at 15 μg/ml(<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). Next, we chose 15 μg/ml of LPS to establish a chondrocyte injury model. The CCK-8 assay showed that miR-199b-5p inhibitor reversed the decrease of cell viability caused by LPS (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>).

<title>miR-199b-5p mimic induces inflammation in normal mice, and miR-199b-5p inhibitor alleviates symptoms in KOA mice</title>
<p>Now, we want to know the vivo role of miRNA-199b-5p. Firstly, we screened Adneovirus (AD) and utilized High-AD as a vector to either overexpress or inhibit the expression of miR-199b-5p(Fig. S3). In normal mice, miR-199b-5p mimic was injected to the joint of mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and a decrease in pain threshold was found (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Four weeks later, serum <italic>IFN-</italic><sub>γ</sub> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and <italic>TNF-</italic><sub>α</sub> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) were also significantly increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). The injection of miR-199b-5p mimic in mouse joints resulted in a slight decrease in Safranine staining, although it did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). Additionally, the articular surface μCT image showed slight erosion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). interestingly, the level of serum inflammation in the miR-199b-5p inhibitor injection group was significantly decreased compared with the mimic group (<italic>IFN-</italic><sub>γ</sub>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; <italic>TNF-</italic><sub>α</sub>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). These results indicated that intra-articular injection of miR-199b-5p mimic induced inflammation response in normal mice.</p>

<p>Followingly, we established an MIA-induced KOA model to further investigate the role of miR-199b-5p (Fig. S4).

<title><italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic> are two potential target genes of miR-199b-5p</title>
<p>In order to investigate the underlying mechanism of miRNA-199b-5p, we utilized five widely used miRNA target gene prediction tools, namely miRWalk, miRDB, TarBase, starbase, and TargetScan, to identify potential target genes. Consequently, we identified six putative target genes of miRNA-199b-5p (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).

Notably, we observed corresponding changes in the expression of <italic>Fzd6</italic> and <italic>Gcnt2</italic> up-on miR-199b-5p overexpression and under-expression. Moreover, we predicted potential binding sites for miRNA-199b-5p within the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of these two target genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E, F</xref>) and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-199b-5p can potentially bind to and suppress the expression of both <italic>Gcnt2</italic> (P &lt; 0.01) and <italic>Fzd6</italic> (P &lt; 0.01) <italic>via</italic> their complementary sequences (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G, H</xref>).

Besides being positionally conserved, the sequence conservation between hsa_miR-199b-5p and mmu_miR-199b-5p was as high as 95.65%, indicating a good sequence conservation (Fig. S6).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we found differential expression of <italic>Fzd6</italic> in both synovial tissue data (GDS5401) and chondrocyte data (GDS3758) from KOA patients in the GEO profile (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I, J</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we initially performed sequencing of serum exosomal miRNAs from clinical patients and identified 177 dysregulated miRNAs. Subsequently, through comparison with GEO data, we found that 169 miRNAs were expressed in both KOA serum and cartilage. Following a screening process, miR-199b-5p was selected for further experiments. In cell-based assays, we discovered that miR-199b-5p can influence the viability of chondrocytes and cytokine-mediated extracellular matrix metabolism. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated that it can induce inflammation and abnormal pain threshold in normal mice. Importantly, inhibition of miR-199b-5p alleviated the pathological symptoms of KOA. Finally, these effects were achieved by potential targeting <italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Thus, our findings demonstrated that miR-199b-5p might be a novel potential therapeutic target for OA prevention and treatment.</p>

<p>miRNAs function as regulators of gene expression in biological processes by regulate mRNA translation by specifically binding to the 3′UTRs of target mRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Exosomes are rich in miRNAs, and various cells can secrete exosomes to target cells under physiological and pathological conditions, which function as delivery vehicles for miRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup><sup>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. There is evidence suggesting that miRNAs can participate in various cellular processes (inflammation, cell viability, ECM dysregulation) and signaling pathways (Hedgehog signaling, PI3K-AKT signaling) relevant to OA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup><sup>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Our differential miRNA enrichment analysis also strongly supports the correlation with these findings.</p>
<p>In cancer research, overexpression of miR-199b-5p can inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo by targeting DDR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, exogenous miR-199b-5p inhibited the growth of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and promoted the differentiation of bone MSCs into chondrocytes by targeting the <italic>JAG1</italic> pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup><sup>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Our functional experiments showed that overexpression of miR-199b-5p reduced chondrocyte viability and the expression of anabolic factors such as COL2A1, AGGREGN, and SOX9. It also increased inflammation levels and decreased pain thresholds in control mice. Although no pathological changes were observed in the articular cartilage of control mice, a similar study demonstrated that pathological cartilage changes only occurred after six months in mice with miR-211 and miR-204 knockout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, we speculate that the time of overexpression of miR-199b-5p in our experiment was too short, so it only caused inflammation and pain threshold response. To best of our knowledge, this is the initial investigation documenting the involvement of miR-199b-5p in KOA.</p>
<p><italic>Fzd6</italic> is known to be up-regulated during the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and can be regulated by miR-194-5p to activate the WNT signaling pathway, thereby promoting osteogenic differentiation of MSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. <italic>Gcnt2</italic> has been found to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhance migration and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Our findings indicate that miR-199b-5p plays a crucial role in KOA by potential targeting <italic>Fzd6</italic> and <italic>Gcnt2</italic>. However, whether miR-199b-5p truly functions through <italic>Fzd6</italic> and/or <italic>Gcnt2</italic> requires genetic knockdown of <italic>Fzd6</italic> and <italic>Gcnt2</italic> in the presence of miR-199b-5p. Future research should further explore the roles and mechanisms of <italic>Fzd6</italic> and <italic>Gcnt2</italic> in the context of KOA.</p>
<p>This study also has some limitations. We initially detected serum exosomes miRNA and later examined the miRNA through <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment and animal study. However, whether the miRNAs targeting the joints have the same role as the serum exosome miRNAs or blood miRNA has not been clear. We also performed direct intra-articular injection of adenoviral vectors. The intra-articular injection can reduce the exposure of extra-articular tissue, thereby minimizing the associated side effects and improving targeting. In this study, the chondrocyte experiments were conducted in a 2D manner, which may lead to chondrocyte de-differentiation and thus may weaken the conclusion of the chondrocyte response to the treatments. Therefore, in the future study, we will adopt 3D culture system for experiments. Besides, more in vivo study such as gene knockout mice study can be used in the future study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that miR-199b-5p is elevated in osteoarthritis and may affect cell viability and related cytokines by potential targeting <italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic>. Overexpression of miR-199b-5p induced OA-like pathological changes in normal mice and inhibiting miR-199b-5p alleviated symptoms in KOA mice, suggesting it may be a target for treatment of OA. Through human clinical trials, cell experiments, and animal models, we not only identified a new OA-related miR-199b-5p but also examined the biological function of miR-199b-5p in OA.</p>

(C) The Western blot analysis of symbolic surface markers of isolated exosomes from the serum of participants.</p>
<p>Fig S2. Fluorescence of Adenovirus-Infected Chondrocytes. Fig S3. Expression of adenovirus in mouse knee joint.</p>
<p>Fig S4. Establishment of KOA model in mice by injection of MIA. (A) Behavioral detection of animal thermal pain threshold. (B) Microscopic observation of the surface of the mouse knee joint. (C) Safranin-fast green staining and semiquantitative scoring of articular cartilage. (D) 3D reconstruction images of joints from μCT scans. *<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, <italic>n</italic>=6.</p>
<p>Fig S5. Venn diagram showing differentially expressed miRNAs in the OA group compared with healthy patients and patients who recovered after acupuncture treatment.</p>
<p>Fig S6. Comparative analysis of sequence conservatism between human and mouse. (A) By using the sequence information of mmu_miRNA-199b-5p, we located the position of its human homologous sequence in the UCSC database. (B) Based on the positional information and the source gene, we further aligned this position with the closest miRNA in miRbase. (C) We compared the sequences of hsa_miR-199b-5p and mmu_miR-199b-5p.(D) Conservation analysis was performed to compare the sequence conservation of miR-199b-5p.</p>
<p>Fig S7. Primary mice chondrocytes we cultured (P1) and the secondary generation cells (P2) we used in the following experiment.</p>
<p>Supplement file8. We predicted the potential binding sites of miRNA-199b-5p in the 3’-untranslated regions (UTRs) of two target genes, Fzd6 and Gcnt2, in both human and mouse.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The Authors identified miR-199b-5p is a potential OA target gene using serum exosomal small RNA-seq from human healthy and OA patients. Their RNA-seq results were further compared with publicly available datasets to validate their finding of miR-199b-5p. In vitro chondrocyte culture with miR-199b-5p mimic/inhibitor and in vivo animal models were used to evaluate the function of miR-199b-5p in OA. The possible genes that were potentially regulated by miR-199b-5p were also predicted (i.e., Fzd6 and Gcnt2) and then validated by using Luciferase assays.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Strong in vivo animal models including pain tests.</p>
<p>
(2) Validate the binding of miR-199b-5p with Fzd6 and binding of miR-199b-5p with Gcnt2</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my concerns.</p>

<p>The data presented in this manuscript is not solid enough to support their conclusions. There are several questions that need to be addressed to improve the quality of this study.</p>
<p>The following questions that need to be addressed to improve the quality of the study.</p>
<p>(1) Exosomes were characterized by electron microscopy and western blot analysis (for CD9, 264 CD63, and CD81). However, figure S1 only showed two sample WB results and there is no positive and negative control as well as the confused not clear WB figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We acknowledge that a comprehensive identification of extracellular vesicles should include both positive and negative samples. However, in some of the initial studies we referenced, the positive and negative control were not mentioned1;2. In our study, we identified extracellular vesicles using a combination of electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and marker detection of exosomes. We agree that having negative samples would make our results more convincing, and we will include a negative control group in our future experiments. Additionally, we have provided clearer images in the revised version. (supplemental fig1 A)</p>

<p>(2) The sequencing of miRNAs in serum exosomes showed that 88 miRNAs were upregulated and 89 miRNAs were downregulated in KOA patients compared with the control group based on fold change &gt; 1.5 and p &lt; 0.05. Figure 2 legend did not clearly elucidate what those represent and why the authors chose those five miRNAs to further validate although they did mention it with several words in line 108 'based on the p-value and exosomal'.</p>

<p>In fact, our study included two additional groups: the acupuncture treatment group (4 weeks of continuous acupuncture treatment) and the waiting treatment group (no intervention, followed by acupuncture treatment after 4 weeks), in addition to the healthy control and knee osteoarthritis (OA) patient groups. After comparing these four groups, we found that 11 genes (hsa-miR-504-3p, hsa-miR-1915-3p, hsa-miR-103a-2-5p, hsa-miR-887-3p, hsa-miR-1228-5p, hsa-miR-34c-3p, hsa-miR-3168, hsa-miR-518e-3p, hsa-miR-1296-5p, hsa-miR-338-3p, and hsa-miR-199b-5p) were upregulated in KOA patients but downregulated after acupuncture treatment, with no change in the waiting treatment group. Additionally, 7 genes (hsa-miR-448, hsa-miR-514a-3p, hsa-miR-4440, hsa-let-7f-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let-7d-5p, and hsa-miR-15b-3p) were downregulated in KOA patients but upregulated after acupuncture treatment, with no change in the waiting treatment group. Considering the improvement in clinical symptoms of KOA patients after acupuncture treatment, we believe that these 18 genes are of significant value. Based on overall expression abundance and species specificity, we finally selected 5 genes, namely the 5 genes mentioned in this article. Regarding this result, we have already included it in the supplementary fig5(fig. S5).</p>

<p>(3) In Figure 3 legend and methods, the authors did not mention how they performed the cell viability assay. What cell had been used? How long were they treated and all the details? Other figure legends have the same problem without detailed information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions. In Figure 3, cell viability was determined using the CCK-8 assay. We used second-generation chondrocytes for this analysis. The chondrocytes were obtained from young mice aged 3-5 days after birth. The cartilage tissues were extracted, and the cells were cultured in complete medium after digestion with collagenase. The detailed description of the cell viability assay, cell culture procedures, specific timing, and treatment methods of the cells used can be found in our revised manuscript.

<p>(4) The authors claimed that Gcnt2 and Fzd6 are two target genes of miR-199b-5p. However, there is no convincing evidence such as western blot to support their bioinformatics prediction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the current study, we first identified six potential target genes by intersecting the predicted targets obtained from six bioinformatics websites. Subsequently, q-PCR was employed to test all six genes, revealing two genes with significant changes, namely Fzd6 and Gcnt2. We then predicted the binding sites of these genes and validated their existence through luciferase assays. Moreover, we examined the expression of these two potential targets in human KOA samples using a human database and found them to be expressed specifically in the samples. These results suggest that Fzd6 and Gcnt2 are potential target genes for KOA. However, we didn’t do western blot assay to verify the results. Based on your suggestions, we have further discussed the limitations of our study in this regard and proposed future research strategies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) To verify the binding site on 3'UTR of two potential targets, the authors designed a mouse sequence for luciferase assay, but not sure if it is the same when using a human sequence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank for your great advice. We carried out the comparative analysis of sequence conservatism between human and mouse, and find the binding site on 3'UTR matches to human sequence very well. The sequence conservation between hsa_miR-199b-5p and mmu_miR-199b-5p was as high as 95.65%. We added the methods and results in the revised manuscript. (page9, line181-184; page17, line361-365) (supplemental fig6).</p>
<p>In detail: Firstly, the sequence information of mmu_miRNA-199b-5p was used to locate the human homologous sequence in the UCSC database. The homologous sequence was found to be located in the human genome at chr9:128244721-128244830 (supplemental fig6 A). Based on this positional information and the source gene, a further comparison was conducted in miRbase to identify the nearest miRNA at the position of the human genome. It was discovered that hsa_miR-199b-5p is positionally conserved and located at chr9:128244721-128244830 (supplemental fig6 B). The sequence of hsa_miR-199b-5p was obtained from the miRbase database (supplemental fig6 C), and a comparative analysis was performed between the sequences of humans and mouse (supplemental fig6 D). Besides being positionally conserved, the sequence conservation between hsa_miR-199b-5p and mmu_miR-199b-5p was as high as 95.65%, indicating a good sequence conservation.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for positive comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors may overinterpret their results. The current work shows the possible bindings between miR-199b-5p and Fzd6 as well as bindings between miR-199b-5p and Gcnt2. However, whether miR-199b-5p truly functions through Fzd6 and/or Gcnt2 requires genetic knockdown of Fzd6 and Gcnt2 in the presence of miR-199b-5p.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we employed a comprehensive approach by integrating data from six bioinformatics databases to identify potential target genes for miR-199b-5p. Subsequent qPCR analysis revealed significant changes in two genes, Fzd6 and Gcnt2. We then utilized luciferase assays to validate the predicted binding sites and confirmed the interaction between miR-199b-5p and these genes. Additionally, we examined the expression profiles of these potential target genes in human KOA samples using a human database, which unveiled distinct expression patterns.</p>
<p>While our findings suggest that Fzd6 and Gcnt2 may serve as potential target genes for miR-199b-5p, we acknowledge the necessity for further experimental validation and in-depth functional characterization. Building upon your insightful recommendations, we have thoroughly addressed the research limitations and proposed potential research strategies for future investigations in our discussion.

<p>(2) In vitro chondrocyte experiments were conducted in a 2D manner, which led to chondrocyte de-differentiation and thus may not represent the chondrocyte response to the treatments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We admit that 3D culture system will be more accurate and reliable. However, according to Liu Qianqian et al researches3, the 2D culture systems were also used and work well. Besides, the second-generation primary mice chondrocytes we used in the current study did not exhibit a significant dedifferentiated morphology. So, considering the experiment condition in our lab, we chose the second-generation cultured primary mouse chondrocytes in the whole process of cell experiment. To show the reliability of the cells, we provided more pictures in the supplement fig 7(fig. S7) In the future study, we will adopt 3D culture system for experiments. Thank you for your advices and we have added this limitation in the revised manuscript. (page11，line237-240)</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I would like to thank the authors for investigating the functional role of miR-199b-5p in knee OA. While this study has the potential to provide valuable knowledge to the fields of miRNAs and joint diseases, significant improvements in several areas are required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your constructive comments, and we have made a substantial improvement to the manuscript. We thank all the reviewers for their advice as well as their criticisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) According to the Authors, miR-199b-5p is identified by the results from their own miRNA-sequencing as well as comparison with other publicly available datasets (both synovium and cartilage datasets). It is unclear to me why the synovium dataset was used here as it appears that the entire manuscript was mainly focused on chondrocytes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. As we are aware, cartilage degradation is the initial pathological change in knee osteoarthritis (KOA), which subsequently leads to other pathological changes such as synovial inflammation4. These factors are interrelated, and current research on KOA encompasses cartilage, synovium, and system inflammation et al. Therefore, when we identified a large number of dysregulated miRNAs in extracellular vesicles isolated from serum, it was crucial to determine whether these dysregulated miRNAs were also altered in cartilage or synovium. To address this, we compared our findings with publicly available databases and found a higher overlap with the cartilage cell dataset, including miRNA-199b. Consequently, we decided to focus our subsequent investigations on cartilage-related research.</p>

<p>(2) Also, 169 of 177 differentially expressed exosome miRNAs were intersected with differentially expressed miRNAs from OA cartilage datasets. It is surprising that in the 5 selected miRNAs for further qRT-PCR validation, 3 out of 5 were not in the exosome miRNA dataset (i.e., hsa-mir-1296-5p, hsa-mir-15b-3p, and hsa-mir-338-3p; page 5, line 109 and Fig. 1B). Isn't that selecting the miRNAs that both differently expressed in exosome and cartilage datasets for validation more essential? Furthermore, from the Authors' exosome miRNA dataset, only 5 out of 15 KOA patients actually exhibited up-regulated miR-199b-5p vs. health controls. Please elaborate on how the target was determined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In fact, our study included two additional groups: the acupuncture treatment group (4 weeks of continuous acupuncture treatment) and the waiting treatment group (no intervention, followed by acupuncture treatment after 4 weeks), in addition to the healthy control and knee osteoarthritis (OA) patient groups. After comparing these four groups, we found that 11 genes (hsa-miR-504-3p, hsa-miR-1915-3p, hsa-miR-103a-2-5p, hsa-miR-887-3p, hsa-miR-1228-5p, hsa-miR-34c-3p, hsa-miR-3168, hsa-miR-518e-3p, hsa-miR-1296-5p, hsa-miR-338-3p, and hsa-miR-199b-5p) were upregulated in KOA patients but downregulated after acupuncture treatment, with no change in the waiting treatment group. Additionally, 7 genes (hsa-miR-448, hsa-miR-514a-3p, hsa-miR-4440, hsa-let-7f-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let-7d-5p, and hsa-miR-15b-3p) were downregulated in KOA patients but upregulated after acupuncture treatment, with no change in the waiting treatment group. Considering the improvement in clinical symptoms of KOA patients after acupuncture treatment, we believe that these 18 genes are of significant value. Based on overall expression abundance and species specificity, we finally selected 5 genes, namely the 5 genes mentioned in this article. Regarding this result, we have already included it in the supplementary fig5(fig. S5).</p>

<p>(3) There is also a lack of description for bioinformatic analysis regarding how miRNA sequencing datasets were analyzed. What R/python packages or algorithms were used? What were the QC criteria?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion caused. We have now included a clear description of the method employed, and R was utilized for this data analysis (revised in Page14, Line301-305). To ensure consistency, we compared our findings with publicly available human serum data from the database (GSE105027) using a fold change threshold of &gt; 1.5 and a significance level of p &lt; 0.05. In the cartilage data (GSE175961), we observed a list of miRNAs with shared expression patterns, yet the precise differential values could not be determined.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Another major concern is the chondrocyte culture method. Chondrocytes should be cultured in a 3D manner (i.e., a 3D pellet culture system or a micro mass culture method). 2D cultured chondrocytes tend to de-differentiate into MSC-like cells and thus lose their chondrocyte phenotype. This is evident from Fig. 3B and C. Cells started to spread out and only a few cells were positive for COL2A1 with a deep brown staining color. Thus, the results from the in vitro studies may not be representative of chondrocyte response to the treatments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We admit that 3D culture system will be more accurate and reliable. However, according to Liu Qianqian et al researches3, the 2D culture systems were also used and work well. Besides, the second-generation primary mice chondrocytes we used in the current study did not exhibit a significant dedifferentiated morphology. So, considering the experiment condition in our lab, we chose the second-generation cultured primary mouse chondrocytes in the whole process of cell experiment. To show the reliability of the cells, we provided more pictures in the supplement fig 7(fig. S7) In the future study, we will adopt 3D culture system for experiments. Thank you for your advices and we have added this limitation in the revised manuscript. (page11, line237-240)</p>

<p>We apologize for any confusion caused. Figures 4E and 4F represent the Safranin Fast Green Staining staining of the joint after the administration of miR-199b-5p inhibitor and mimic under physiological conditions. As you can see, there is minimal difference between these four images. There is no statistically significant difference. However, in Figures 5E and 5F, the MIA-induced KOA model was utilized, and noticeable differences can be observed after the administration of the inhibitor and mimic. In the revised version, we have emphasized that Figures 4E and 4F represent the results under physiological conditions, not under the MIA-induced model. (page 7, line 146-151)</p>

<p>Figure 4 G represents control, vehicle control, inhibitor, and mimic groups, while Figure 5 G represents model, model+vehicle control, model+inhibitor, and model+mimic groups. From Figure 4G, it can be observed that the simulator group showed the most obvious erosion appearance, while the inhibitor group did not exhibit this phenomenon5. From Figure 5G, it can be seen that the model group and model+mimic group exhibited the most pronounced erosion appearance, while the model+inhibitor group showed the best recovery. To highlight the pathological changes in the erosion appearance, we marked the typical locations with red arrows in the images for easy comparison and reading by the readers (Fig. 4G; Fig. 5G). We also made corresponding textual modifications in the original manuscript to address these findings (page 7, line 150-151; page 8, line 160-161). In addition, the 3D reconstruction of micro-CT is based on the synthesis of these cross-sectional images.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any lack of clarity in the original text. In fact, we utilized targets to predict potential binding sites. Specifically, for the mouse species, we predicted that the 3'UTR of Fzd6 binds with miR-199b-5p at positions 2483-2490, 3244-3251, 3303-3309, and 3854-3860, while the 3'UTR of Gcnt2 binds with miR-199b-5p at positions 2755-2762 and 4144-4151. In the revised version, we provide a detailed description of the methodology used for predicting these sites and offer an elaborate explanation of the results. (pages16, line352)</p>
<p>Additionally, to demonstrate consistency with human binding sites, we not only predicted the binding sites of human miR with these two target genes but also found a high conservation of up to 95.65% between the human and mouse sequences of miR-199b-5p. We have included this information in the supplementary materials (Fig. S6).
In Fig. 6E-F, we presented the potential binding sites between miR-199b-5p and Gcnt2, as well as between miR-199b-5p and Fzd6. In addition, we provide the predicted binding of human sequence to illustrate the binding sites. Furthermore, the predicted binding of human miR-199b-5p with fzd6 and gcnt2 showed a high degree of consistency. (The fluorescent labeling in the following text indicates the potential predicted binding sites.) (Supplement file 8)</p>

<p>(12) Page 10-11, Line 222-223: &quot;Our findings indicate that miR-199b-5p plays a crucial role in KOA by targeting Fzd6 and Gcnt2&quot;. This is an overstatement.

Whether miR-199b-5p truly functions through Fzd6 and/or Gcnt2 requires genetic knockdown of Fzd6 and Gcnt2 in the presence of miR-199b-5p.
