<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>African trypanosomes are the causative agents of neglected tropical diseases affecting both humans and livestock. Disease control is highly challenging due to an increasing number of drug treatment failures. African trypanosomes are extracellular, blood-borne parasites that mainly rely on glycolysis for their energy metabolism within the mammalian host. Trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes are therefore of interest for the development of trypanocidal drugs. Here, we report the serendipitous discovery of a camelid single-domain antibody (sdAb aka Nanobody) that selectively inhibits the enzymatic activity of trypanosomatid (but not host) pyruvate kinases through an allosteric mechanism. By combining enzyme kinetics, biophysics, structural biology, and transgenic parasite survival assays, we provide a proof-of-principle that the sdAb-mediated enzyme inhibition negatively impacts parasite fitness and growth. We propose that these results pinpoint a site of vulnerability on trypanosomatid pyruvate kinases that may be exploited for the design of novel chemotherapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) comprise a wide variety of communicable diseases that are prevalent in (sub)tropical regions and affect more than 1 billion people worldwide. It is becoming increasingly clear that NTDs constitute a major health threat in both developing and developed countries, with those living in poverty being especially vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hunter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Picado et al., 2019</xref>). NTDs are typically characterized by a low mortality and high morbidity, which results in a severe impact on the quality of life and economic productivity of those affected. In recent times, NTD control has become more complicated by globalization, human migration, climate change and the altered distribution of disease-transmitting vectors (including mosquitoes, flies, and ticks). Consequently, even currently unaffected areas (including the Western world) are confronted with the (re-)emergence of NTDs. The WHO has listed 20 NTDs that should be tackled in the interest of global health and well-being (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en">www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en</ext-link>). Three of these are caused by trypanosomatids, a group of flagellated, single-celled eukaryotic organisms comprising parasites of the <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> genera.</p>
<p>To be effective, the battle against trypanosomatids requires a concerted approach including vaccination, drug treatment and vector control. However, the development of an effective vaccine against these parasites is thwarted by sophisticated immune-evasion strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pays et al., 2023</xref>), while vector control may be hampered due to resistance of the insect vector to insecticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Field et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, chemotherapy is an essential pillar for clinical management, control and/or elimination. Unfortunately, an alarming number of reports describe treatment failure or parasite resistance to the currently available drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Rycker et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, there is a dire need for alternative compounds, preferably with novel modes of action and/or designed based on mechanistic insights of the target’s structure-function relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Field et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Rycker et al., 2018</xref>). African trypanosomes, the causative agents of human and animal African trypanosomiasis (HAT and AAT, respectively), are extracellular parasites that have a bipartite life cycle involving tsetse flies and mammals as hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Radwanska et al., 2018</xref>). Within the latter, the predominant parasite form is called the bloodstream form (BSF) which, as the name suggests, resides mainly inside the host bloodstream. The BSF also colonizes sites such as the lymphatics, the skin, brain, testes, adipose tissue, and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Trindade et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Caljon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Capewell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Krüger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mabille et al., 2022</xref>). Given its niche, the BSF has steady access to high blood glucose concentrations (∼5 mM) and has evolved to exclusively rely on glycolysis to power its metabolism. For this reason, trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes (of which most are localized in organelles called glycosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Szöör et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haanstra et al., 2016</xref>); <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) have received much interest and attention as targets for the development of trypanocidal compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bakker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Verlinde et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Haanstra and Bakker, 2015</xref>). Indeed, informed by computational models of trypanosomal glycolysis, RNAi experiments have shown that a reduction in glycolytic flux induces growth impairment and eventually leads to parasite death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Albert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Haanstra et al., 2011</xref>). This principle was recently successfully exploited by McNae, Kinkead, Malik and co-workers, who developed a novel and selective small-molecule inhibitor of the trypanosomal glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McNae et al., 2021</xref>). The compound impairs PFK activity via an allosteric mechanism and was validated to lead to parasite death <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as in an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model.</p>

<caption><title>Structure-function relationship of trypanosomatid PYKs.</title><p>(A.) Schematic representation of a trypanosome, with a focus on their glycosome biochemistry. PYK catalyzes the last reaction of the trypanosomal glycolysis and is located outside of the glycosomes. (B.) The PYK monomer with the different domains color-coded and the domain boundaries shown. The pivot point for the AC core rotation (residues 430-433) is indicated by a magenta arrow. The substrate and effector binding sites are highlighted by yellow and cyan boxes, respectively. (C.) Schematic representation of the “rock and lock” model. The different PYK domains are color-coded as in panel (B.). In the absence of substrates (PEP and ADP) and effectors (F26BP or F16BP), trypanosomatid PYKs reside in a T-state (red box). The binding of substrates causes the enzyme to “rock” (R-state boxed in yellow). This consists of several structural rearrangements across the entire PYK tetramer that involve i) AC-core rotation of 6°-8° (with residues 430-434 as a pivot point), ii) closing of the lid domain (rotation of 30°-40°), iii) stabilisation of the AA’ dimer interfaces, and iv) flipping of the Arg311 side chain as part of remodeling the catalytic pocket for substrate accommodation. The binding of effectors to PYK’s C domain generates a “lock” in addition to the “rock”. This prompts the enzyme to adopt a conformation primed for e<italic>Z</italic>cient catalysis (R-state boxed in blue); this involves i) the 6°-8° AC-core rotation, ii) stabilisation of the CC’ dimer interfaces, and iii) the Arg311 flip. The presence of substrates and effectors “rock and lock” the enzyme in the R-state (green box). The ribbon representations in the inset are the tetramer structures of T and R state PYK, superposed on the four pivot points. The AA’ and CC’ dimer interfaces are indicated by dashed lines. All structures and schematics were based on the crystal structures of apo and holo <italic>Tco</italic>PYK (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pinto Torres et al., 2020</xref>).</p></caption>

<p>Here, we describe an allosteric mechanism for the inhibition of trypanosomatid pyruvate kinases (PYKs), which was identified through a camelid single-domain antibody (sdAb aka Nanobody) raised against <italic>T. congolense</italic> PYK (<italic>Tco</italic>PYK). We previously reported that <italic>Tco</italic>PYK operates via the so-called “rock and lock” model, which provides the molecular basis for the allosteric regulation of trypanosomatid PYKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pinto Torres et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, panels B and C</xref>). By using a combination of enzyme kinetics assays, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and macromolecular X-ray crystallography (MX), we demonstrate that one of the sdAbs (sdAb42) raised against <italic>Tco</italic>PYK is a potent inhibitor that impairs enzyme function by selectively binding and stabilizing the enzyme’s inactive T state. Perturbation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) further reveals that the sdAb42 epitope contains residues that are characterized by i) a high allosteric coupling intensity to the active site and ii) critical components of the allosteric communication pathway between the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK effector and active sites. In addition, we show that the inhibitory mechanism of sdAb42 applies to trypanosomatid PYKs in general, as its epitope is highly conserved among <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites. Finally, we provide evidence that the production of sdAb42 as an “intrabody” (intracellularly produced sdAb) undermines parasite growth in transgenic <italic>T. brucei</italic> lines.</p>

<title>sdAb42 is a potent and selective <bold><italic>Tco</italic></bold>PYK inhibitor</title>
<p>We previously identified <italic>Tco</italic>PYK as a biomarker for the detection of active <italic>T. congolense</italic> infections by immuno-assays, using a pair of camelid sdAbs (sdAb42 and sdAb44) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pinto Torres et al., 2018</xref>). Because the target of these two sdAbs is a trypanosomal glycolytic enzyme, we sought to investigate whether they had the potential to inhibit <italic>Tco</italic>PYK enzymatic activity. While complexation of <italic>Tco</italic>PYK with sdAb44 and a negative control sdAb (BCII10) have no impact, the addition of increasing sdAb42 concentrations severely reduces (and even completely abolishes) enzymatic activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, the inhibition displayed by sdAb42 is selective for <italic>Tco</italic>PYK as no effect on the enzymatic activity of human PYK could be observed (even at a 1,000-fold sdAb excess, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In conclusion, sdAb42 appears to be a potent, selective <italic>Tco</italic>PYK inhibitor.</p>

<title>sdAb42 impairs <bold><italic>Tco</italic></bold>PYK activity by selectively binding and stabilising the enzyme’s inactive T state</title>
<p>To gain insights into the structural basis for the selective inhibition of <italic>Tco</italic>PYK by sdAb42, the high-resolution structure of the sdAb42:<italic>Tco</italic>PYK complex was determined through MX. A general overview of the crystal structure reveals that four sdAb42 molecules are bound to the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK tetramer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), which is in accordance with the stoichiometry in solution, previously determined via analytical gel filtration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pinto Torres et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the epitope of a single sdAb42 spans a region across two <italic>Tco</italic>PYK subunits linked together along the AA’ dimer interface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). While CDR3 contacts residues from both subunits, CDR1 and CDR2 each exclusively interact with amino acids from the A’ and A subunit domains, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). Interactions are also provided by the flexible <italic>Tco</italic>PYK B domain, although these could not be observed in all copies of the asymmetric unit as not all B domains could be built due to lack of electron density. A comparison of the conformation of sdAb42-bound <italic>Tco</italic>PYK to the enzyme’s R state structure and an inspection of the tell-tale features of T and R state trypanosomatid PYK conformations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) show that the enzyme resides in its inactive T state when interacting with sdAb42 (the signature Arg311 flip is displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on the above-mentioned sdAb42:<italic>Tco</italic>PYK crystal structure, we hypothesised that sdAb42 inhibits <italic>Tco</italic>PYK activity by selectively binding and stabilizing the enzyme’s inactive T state. A first finding that supports this idea is that the sdAb42 epitope is significantly distorted when <italic>Tco</italic>PYK transitions from the T to the R state (C<italic>a</italic> RMSD of 3.70 Å, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Second, we were also able to crystallise the sdAb42:<italic>Tco</italic>PYK complex in the presence of sulfate, which acts as a phosphate mimic that can bind both the active and effector sites of trypanosomatid PYKs. As a result, sulfate binding has the potential to initiate the “rock and lock”, thereby ushering the transition from the inactive T to the active R state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tulloch et al., 2008</xref>). A detailed inspection of the electron density revealed the presence of sulfate molecules in the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK effector site at the positions usually occupied by the phosphoryl groups of the cognate effector molecules fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Supplementary Figure 8). Despite the presence of these sulfates, <italic>Tco</italic>PYK clearly remains in a T state conformation when bound by sdAb42. Third, thermal unfolding followed by CD spectroscopy shows that sdAb42 significantly stabilises apo <italic>Tco</italic>PYK (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In accordance with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pinto Torres et al., 2020</xref>), apo <italic>Tco</italic>PYK displays an apparent melting temperature (T<sub>m,app</sub>) of ∼46°C. The binding of sdAb42 leads to a remarkable increase in the enzyme’s thermal stability (LlT<sub>m,app</sub> = 10.3°C).</p>
<p>When taken together, the data strongly indicate that sdAb42 impairs <italic>Tco</italic>PYK activity by selectively binding and stabilising the enzyme’s inactive T state.</p>

<title>The sdAb42 epitope contains residues that are critical for the allosteric communication between the enzyme’s effector and active sites</title>
<p>To better understand the mechanistic basis of <italic>Tco</italic>PYK inhibition by sdAb42, we performed <italic>in silico</italic> perturbation analyses, which allows i) prediction of allosteric correlations between residue pairs, ii) prediction of residues with a high allosteric coupling intensity (ACI) to the active site (and thus allosteric sites or “allosteric hotspots”), iii) identification of allosteric communication pathways between an enzyme’s active site and known effector sites, and iv) identification of critical residues within these pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The ACI predictions performed on the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK T and R state tetramer structures reveal that the sdAb42 epitope largely coincides with an “allosteric hotspot” located on the enzyme’s surface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Especially the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK residues contacted by sdAb42’s CDR1 (Arg20, Ser44, Val348, Ile352) display high ACI values (&gt; 0.75) implying that a perturbation of these residues will have a high probability of propagating to the active site and, hence, affecting enzyme activity. Interestingly, the ACI values of these residues are higher in the T state compared to the R state tetramer, which implies that the allosteric coupling between the sdAb42-recognized “allosteric hotspot” and the enzyme’s active site appears to be stronger in the T state conformation.</p>

<p>Next, we employed perturbation analysis to identify the allosteric communication pathway between the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK active site and the F16BP/F26BP effector binding pocket and its constituting critical residues. This unveiled an intriguing disparity with regards to the allosteric communication pathways in the enzyme’s T and R state conformations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In the TcoPYK T state tetramer, the allosteric pathways can be defined as “intersubunit” since they run from the effector site in one subunit to the active site of a second subunit across the AA’ interface. These pathways involve Arg311 and residues of the AA’ interface, consistent with their roles in the “rock and lock” mechanism during which conformational changes along intermonomer interfaces allow <italic>Tco</italic>PYK to transition from the T into the R state upon substrate/effector binding. Some of the pathways’ critical residues are closely connected to the sdAb42 epitope: Ala21, Asn22, Ile350, and Cys351. In contrast, the R state communication pathways link up the active and effector sites within individual monomers and can thus be considered as “intrasubunit”. This results in a different set of critical residues, which no longer run past the sdAb42 epitope, hence explaining the lower ACI values of this site in the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK R state structure.</p>

<title>The sdAb42 epitope is conserved in trypanosomatid pyruvate kinases</title>
<p>Given that trypanosomatid PYKs display a high degree of sequence identity (at least 70%; Supplementary Figure 9), we assessed whether the “allosteric hotspot” identified through perturbation analysis and the overlapping sdAb42 epitope would be conserved across <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p>

<p>Given that the three enzymes operate via the “rock and lock” mechanism, it could be expected that the sdAb42 inhibition mechanism applies to all trypanosomatid PYKs. Indeed, the addition of sdAb42 to <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK and <italic>Lme</italic>PYK also impairs enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).

<title>sdAb42 displays slow-binding inhibition kinetics against “rocking and locking” trypanosomatid PYKs</title>
<p>The inhibition data shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref> were performed by incubating the apo enzymes with sdAb42 prior to the addition of substrate and effector molecules. Based on our current working hypothesis and the relatively high a<italic>Z</italic>nity of sdAb42 toward trypanosomatid PYKs, this would readily lock the enzymes in their T state with very little to no chance of reverting back to the R state conformation. In a more realistic setting, the enzymes would be surrounded by substrate and effector molecules prior to their encounter with an exogeneous inhibitor. Consequently, the enzymes would be involved in their kinetic cycle by continuously transitioning between the T and R states. Hence, under such circumstances, we would expect that sdAb42 binding is delayed until the enzymes return to their T state conformation. Moreover, for inhibition to occur, this binding event must take place before the enzymes cycle back to the R state.</p>
<p>To explore the inhibition behavior of sdAb42 in more detail, we performed the kinetic experiments by saturating the trypanosomatid PYKs with fixed effector concentrations prior to the addition of fixed, saturating substrate concentrations and increasing amounts of sdAb42. A careful inspection of the collected activity curves reveals the presence of biphasic features in the early phases, which is exacerbated with increasing inhibitor concentrations (especially pronounced for <italic>Tco</italic>PYK; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, top inset). Such biphasic behavior is typical for so-called “slow-binding inhibition”, which can indeed be explained by the requirement of a <italic>Tco</italic>PYK R- to T-state transition prior to sdAb42-mediated enzyme inhibition, thereby supporting the above-mentioned hypothesis. While a full quantitative analysis of the slow-binding kinetics displayed by sdAb42 is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, the collected data sets allow for the determination of IC<sub>50</sub>-values by only considering the rates at longer time ranges when the slow phase of inhibition has come into effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, bottom inset). In this way we find that, while sdAb42 inhibits <italic>Tco</italic>PYK with an IC<sub>50</sub> of ∼350 nM, the IC<sub>50</sub>-values for <italic>Lme</italic>PYK and <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK are increased 2- to 3-fold, respectively.

<title>The production of sdAb42 as an “intrabody” induces a growth defect in a <italic>T. brucei</italic> model</title>
<p>Next, the impact of the sdAb42-mediated allosteric inhibition mechanism on parasite growth was investigated as a proof of concept. To this end, sdAb42 was used as an “intrabody” by generating transgenic parasite lines capable of producing sdAb42 inside the parasite cytosol. The experimental design consisted of integrating a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible expression cassette in the 18S rRNA locus, in which sdAb42 is C-terminally fused to mCherry such that cytosolic sdAb42 protein levels may be followed by fluorescence. The same approach was employed to generate a negative control line expressing sdAb BCII10. Since genetic engineering and culturing of <italic>T. congolense</italic> is notoriously di<italic>Z</italic>cult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Awuah-Mensah et al., 2021</xref>), we opted to perform our experiments in <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</p>
<p>The data presented in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> clearly demonstrate that i) the intrabodies could successfully be produced upon Tet induction and that ii) sdAb42 appears to induce a growth defect in a dose-dependent manner while BCII10 does not. A rapid loss of sdAb42 intrabody was noted, resulting in heterogenous <italic>in situ</italic> expression levels. To investigate the effect of sdAb levels on growth burden more thoroughly, a large-scale experiment was performed in which low and high intrabody expressing monoclonal lines were obtained by single cell sorting followed by growth curve analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This reveals that increasing sdAb42 expression levels lead to larger growth defects, supporting a positive correlation between intrabody levels and impaired fitness (Pearson correlation, r = 0.95; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). As expected, BCII10 levels have no impact on parasite growth (Pearson correlation, r = -0.72), even at median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values that are significantly higher compared to those seen for the sdAb42 lines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). In addition, we observed that, while sdAb BCII10 levels remain stable over time, sdAb42 levels decrease rapidly (Supplementary Figure 10). We suspect that this is the result of a parasite defense mechanism at the translational but not transcriptional level (sdAb42 transcript levels remain stable, data not shown) to specifically counter sdAb42 (but not BCII10) production. We interpret this finding as additional evidence for the detrimental effect of the sdAb42 intrabody on parasite growth.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The chemotherapeutic targeting of enzymes involved in energy metabolism has long shown promise in the battle against parasitic protists. Especially enzymes and transporters involved in glycolysis are of interest for drug development purposes for two main reasons. First, many parasitic protists heavily rely on glycolysis within their vertebrate hosts to sustain their energy metabolism: <italic>Giardia</italic> spp. trophozoites, <italic>Trichomonas</italic> spp., <italic>Entamoeba</italic> spp. trophozoites, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. intraerythrocytic stages, <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp., <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> spp. BSFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Upcroft and Upcroft, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Saunders et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alam et al., 2014</xref>). Second, the glycolytic enzymes and transporters are su<italic>Z</italic>ciently different from their vertebrate host homologs such that they may be specifically targeted. Recent work on <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> demonstrates that achieving parasite killing by inhibiting glycolysis remains a viable avenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McNae et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Khan et al., 2023</xref>). Regarding trypanosomes, although the inhibition of glycolytic flux has been an area of intense research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bakker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Verlinde et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Haanstra and Bakker, 2015</xref>; ?), there is a clear need for novel compound classes with novel modes of action and/or designed based on mechanistic insights in the target’s structure-function relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Field et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Rycker et al., 2018</xref>). In this paper, we report the serendipitous discovery of a camelid sdAb (sdAb42) that allosterically inhibits the enzymatic activity of trypanosomatid PYKs.</p>
<p>sdAb42 was originally identified within a diagnostic context, in which its target <italic>Tco</italic>PYK was shown to be a reliable biomarker for the detection of active <italic>T. congolense</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pinto Torres et al., 2018</xref>). Besides possessing a diagnostic potential, our data now demonstrate that sdAb42 selectively and potently inhibits <italic>Tco</italic>PYK enzymatic activity. A thorough structural investigation reveals that this inhibition proceeds through an allosteric mechanism, in which sdAb42 selectively binds the enzyme’s inactive T state, thereby “locking<italic>” Tco</italic>PYK in a catalytically inactive conformation. An explanation for the latter is provided through ACI analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), which suggests that the epitope targeted by sdAb42 is an “allosteric hotspot” in the AA’ intersubunit communication pathway required for the “rocking and locking” of trypanosomatid PYKs. In other words, the binding of sdAb42 to this AA’ intersubunit site is proposed to prevent <italic>Tco</italic>PYK from “rocking and locking” into its active R state conformation. Interestingly, the location of this “allosteric hotspot” is reminiscent of the binding site for free amino acids found in human PYKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chaneton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, various amino acids have been shown to be allosteric regulators of human PYK activity. However, in contrast to human PYKs, trypanosomatid PYKs seem to be largely unresponsive to the allosteric regulation of enzyme activity by free amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Callens et al., 1991</xref>). This resonates with the previous finding that PYKs from different species have evolved different allosteric strategies to regulate enzyme activity and that these differences could be exploited in drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Morgan et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The “allosteric hotspot” targeted by sdAb42 is well conserved among trypanosomatids, which would suggest that this sdAb has the potential to inhibit other trypanosomatid PYKs. Indeed, the data presented here show that sdAb42 also blocks the enzymatic activity of <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK and <italic>Lme</italic>PYK (two ref erence enzymes for studying the structure-function relationship of trypanosomatid PYKs, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>)), albeit with a lower e<italic>Z</italic>ciency in comparison to <italic>Tco</italic>PYK. The explana-tion for these observations is two-fold. First, while most residues constituting the epitope are identical among the three investigated PYKs, the differences (Ile352Val and Lys43Gln/Val348Ala/Ile352Leu in <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK and <italic>Lme</italic>PYK, respectively) seem su<italic>Z</italic>cient to cause the a<italic>Z</italic>nity to drop 40-fold. Second, the kinetic data recorded for experiments in which the trypanosomatid PYKs were first saturated with substrate and effector molecules prior to sdAb42 addition reveal that sdAb42 operates through a “slow-binding inhibition” mechanism. Given that sdAb42 selectively binds and locks the enzyme’s inactive T state, these data can be explained by the idea that sdAb42 can only bind to trypanosomatid PYKs after having undergone an R- to T-state transition. In that respect, the intrinsic e<italic>Z</italic>ciency with which individual trypanosomatid PYKs cycle between R- and T-states is likely to impact sdAb42-mediate enzyme inhibition.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the data demonstrate that sdAb42 inhibits three trypanosomatid PYKs through the same allosteric mechanism, of which the potency most likely depends on a combination of binding a<italic>Z</italic>nity and intrinsic enzyme dynamics. This probably also explains why the use of sdAb42 as an “intrabody” in a <italic>T. brucei</italic> model generates a growth defect instead of completely killing off the parasite. Our results indicate that intracellular sdAb42 production impairs parasite growth in a dose-dependent manner, which we interpret as follows: increasingly higher intracellular sdAb42 levels lead to a higher degree of <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK complexation and inhibition, which in turn reduces the glycolytic flux (and/or lead to toxic accumulation of upstream glycolytic intermediates due to the lack of appropriate activity regulation mechanisms in enzymes such as hexokinase and PFK), thereby negatively impacting parasite fitness. The interplay between a lower binding a<italic>Z</italic>nity for <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK and the slow-binding inhibition mode necessitates that relatively high intracellular sdAb42 concentrations need to be reached to fully block all intracellular <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK activity, as suggested by the <italic>in vitro</italic> IC<sub>50</sub> measurements (<italic>Tbr</italic>PYK IC<sub>50</sub> ∼1400 nM). Earlier work by Albert and colleagues suggests that achieving trypanosome death through <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK inhibition would require an 88% reduction in the enzyme’s V<sub>max</sub>, thereby resulting in lowering the glycolytic flux below 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Albert et al., 2005</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that trypanosomes cannot survive more than 12h in a situation wherein their ATP synthesis flux is reduced by harvesting only 1 instead of 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Helfert et al., 2001</xref>). Hence, it has been proposed that novel trypanosomatid PYK inhibitors should be used in concert with inhibitors of trypanosomatid glucose transporters and PFK to achieve synergistic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Haanstra et al., 2011</xref>). However, the high intracellular sdAb42 levels required to instill an 88% reduction in TbrPYK’s V<sub>max</sub> are unlikely to be reached within this model system. Especially since we observed that the transgenic parasite lines appear to specifically counter sdAb42 production (but not of the BCII10 control). Interestingly, this counter-selection does not occur at the transcript, but at the protein level. While the exact mechanism remains unknown, trypanosomes are known to mainly regulate gene expression through extensive post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Clayton, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>To conclude, the results presented here subscribe to the potential of antibodies (or fragments thereof) as drug discovery tools. Antibodies (and camelid sdAbs especially) are known for their ability to “freeze out” specific conformations of highly dynamic antigens, thereby exposing target sites of interest, which could be exploited for rational drug design (the development of so-called “chemo-superiors”, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lawson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Khamrui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">van Dongen et al., 2019</xref>)). The current proof-of-principle study illustrates that sdAb42 pinpoints a site of vulnerability on trypanosomatid PYKs that may be exploited for the design of novel chemotherapeutics.</p>

To evaluate the inhibitory properties of sdAb42, sdAb44 and sdAb BCII10 on <italic>Tco</italic>PYK, an enzymatic assay was performed with ADP and PEP concentrations of 2.5 mM and 5 mM, respectively. Fifty <italic>µ</italic>l samples containing 88.8 nM (5 <italic>µ</italic>g ml<sup>-1</sup>) <italic>Tco</italic>PYK pre-mixed with varying sdAb molar ratios (TcoPYK-sdAb: 4:0, 4:1, 4:2, 4:4, 4:6) were incubated for at least 5 minutes at 25°C in buffer 1 (50 mM TEA buffer pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM F16BP) prior to the addition of 50 <italic>µ</italic>l of buffer 2 (50 mM TEA buffer pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM ADP, 10 mM PEP, 2 mM NADH and 6.4 U LDH). Assay measurements were performed by following the decrease of the NADH absorbance at 340 nm, always ensuring that the PYK-catalyzed conversion of ADP and PEP to ATP and pyruvate is rate limiting. The activity was expressed as relative activity (in %), where values from samples containing only the enzyme (<italic>Tco</italic>PYK:sdAb at a ratio of 4:0) were taken as the 100% activity. To evaluate a possible inhibitory effect of sdAb42 and sdAb44 on human PYKs, an enzymatic assay was performed with the four human PYK isoforms: skeletal muscle M1 (M1PYK), muscle M2 (M2PYK), liver (LPYK) and red blood cells (RPYK). M1PYK, M2PYK, LPYK and RPYK were diluted in PBS-CM (PBS without Mg<sup>+2</sup>) to the following final concentrations: 10 <italic>µ</italic>g ml<sup>-1</sup> (∼170 nM for HM1PYK, HLPYK and HRPYK) and 40 <italic>µ</italic>g ml<sup>-1</sup> (∼690 nM for HM2PYK). 25 <italic>µ</italic>l of each enzyme was mixed with 25 <italic>µ</italic>l sdAb42 (100 <italic>µ</italic>g ml<sup>-1</sup>, ∼6.1 <italic>µ</italic>M) or sdAb44 (100 <italic>µ</italic>g ml<sup>-1</sup>, ∼6.4 <italic>µ</italic>M).

<p>Slow binding kinetics assays were performed using a similar experimental set-up with the important difference that the trypanosomatid PYKs were saturated with fixed effector concentrations prior to the addition of fixed, saturating substrate concentrations and increasing amounts of sdAb42.

<title>Cumulative growth curve</title>
<p>Induced and non-induced cultures were seeded in duplicate in a 24-well plate at a density of 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells ml<sup>-1</sup> in 1 ml HMI-9 medium supplemented with HYG and G-418. For ten consecutive days, cells were counted using an improved Neubauer hematocytometer and subcultured in a 1:5 dilution. Based on the daily subculture and expansion rate, a cumulative growth curve was generated.</p>

<title>Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)</title>
<p>After five days of induction, 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells from an exponential growth phase were washed once in PBS and RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN blood RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. A one-Step SYBR green real-time PCR using primers targeting sdAb42 or sdAb BCII10 and the reference gene <italic>TERT</italic> was performed (primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 5). Normalised mRNA expression was calculated by the LlC<sub>t</sub>-method.</p>

<title>Whole-cell lysates and western blotting</title>
<p>Whole-cell lysates were prepared five days after induction, by washing 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells in exponential growth phase twice with PBS and resuspending in 15 <italic>µ</italic>l of 4% SDS. Lysates were diluted 1:1 with 2× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) supplemented with 54 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> DTT. Standard western blots were performed by separating samples through gel electrophoresis and transferring to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Intrabody expression was detected using an anti-HA HRP conjugated antibody (Genscript) and imaged employing chemiluminescence with the Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) in the Vilber Fusion FX imaging system.</p>

<sec id="s4h6">
<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Intrabody expression was measured at days 2, 4, 7 and 9 of the parasite growth curve. For this, 1 ml of each culture was collected, centrifuged for 20 sec at 20,000 g and resuspended in 500 <italic>µ</italic>l HMI-9 medium supplemented with HygB, G-418, Tet and 5% BD Via-Probe cell viability solution containing 7-AAD (BD Biosciences). After a 15 min incubation at 37°C, suspensions were centrifuged and resuspended in 500 <italic>µ</italic>l HMI-9 medium. Intrabody expression levels were measured as mCherry fluorescence by flow cytometry using a BD FACSMelody (BD Biosciences). Data were analysed using the FlowLogic software version 7.3. The mCherry median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was determined for viable parasites within a selective FSC/SSC gate with exclusion of 7AAD+ cells.</p>

<title>Epiluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>Five days after induction, 5×10<sup>6</sup> exponentially growing cells were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 100 <italic>µ</italic>l PBS and spotted on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips. After a 30 min incubation at ambient temperature, cells were fixed for 30 min by adding 400 <italic>µ</italic>l of 4% paraformaldehyde. Cover slips were washed three times with 1 ml PBS and mounted on microscopy slides with Fluoroshield mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were taken with the Axio Observer Z1 (Zeiss) at 60× and 100× magnifications. Image analysis was done using ImageJ software version 1.52.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h8">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed in Prism version 8.4.1. For cumulative growth curves, a simple linear regression was modelled for each group, and the resulting slopes were compared using Brown-Forsythe ANOVA and Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparison tests. Using non-linear regression, a one-phase decay model was fitted on the MFI and using the extra-sum-of-squares F test it was tested whether a single curve could fit both groups. Differences in MFI of the sdAb BCII10 clone was tested by means of a repeated measures one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.</p>

<p>This work presents <bold>valuable</bold> data demonstrating that a camelid single-domain antibody can selectively inhibit a key glycolytic enzyme in trypanosomes via an allosteric mechanism. The claim that this information can be exploited for the design of novel chemotherapeutics is <bold>incomplete</bold> and limited by the modest effects on parasite growth, as well as the lack of evidence for cellular target engagement in vivo.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identified nanobodies that were specific for the trypanosomal enzyme pyruvate kinase in previous work seeking diagnostic tools. They have shown that a site involved in the allosteric regulation of the enzyme is targeted by the nanobody and using elegant structural approaches to pinpoint where binding occurs, opening the way to the design of small molecules that could also target this site.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The structural work shows the binding of a nanobody to a specific site on Trypanosoma congolense pyruvate kinase and provides a good explanation as to how binding inhibits enzyme activity. The authors go on to show that by expressing the nanobodies within the parasites they can get some inhibition of growth, which albeit rather weak, they provide a case on how this could point to targeting the same site with small molecules as potential trypanocidal drugs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The impact on growth is rather marginal. Although explanations are offered on the reasons for that, including the high turnover rate of the expressed nanobody and the difficulty in achieving the high levels of inhibition of pyruvate kinase required to impact energy production sufficiently to kill parasites, this aspect of the work doesn't offer great support to developing small molecule inhibitors of the same site.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, the authors show that the camelid single-chain antibody sdAb42 selectivity inhibits Trypanosome pyruvate kinase (PYK) but not human PYK. Through the determination of the crystal structure and biophysical experiments, the authors show that the nanobody binds to the inactive T-state of the enzyme, and in silico analysis shows that the binding site coincides with an allosteric hotspot, suggesting that nanobody binding may affect the enzyme active site. Binding to the T-state of the enzyme is further supported by non-linear inhibition kinetics. PYK is an important enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, and inhibition is likely to have an impact on organisms such a trypanosomes, that heavily rely on glycolysis for their energy production. The nanobody was generated against Trypanosoma congolense PYK, but for technical reasons the authors progressed to testing its impact on cell viability in Trypanosoma brucei brucei. First, they show that sdA42 is able to inhibit Tbb PYK, albeit with lower potency. Cell-based experiments next show that expression of sdA42 has a modest, and dose-dependent effect on the growth rate of Tbb. The authors conclude that their data indicates that targeting this allosteric site affects cell growth and is a valuable new option for the development of new chemotherapeutics for trypanosomatid diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work clearly shows that sdA42A inhibits Trypanosome and Leishmania PYK selectively, with no inhibition of the human orthologue. The crystal structure clearly identifies the binding site of the nanobody, and the accompanying analysis supports that the antibody acts as an allosteric inhibitor of PYK, by locking the enzyme in its apo state (T-state).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The most impactful claim of this work is that sdAb42-mediated inhibition of PYK negatively affects parasite growth and that this presents an opportunity to develop novel chemotherapeutics for trypanosomatid diseases. For the following reasons I think this claim is not sufficiently supported:</p>
<p>- The authors do not provide evidence of target-engagement in cells, i.e. they do not show that sdA42A binds to, or inhibits, Tbb PYK in cells and/or do not provide a functional output consistent with PYK inhibition (e.g. effect on ATP production). Measuring the extent of target engagement and inhibition is important to draw conclusions from the modest effect on growth.</p>
<p>- The authors do not explore the selectivity of sdA42A in cells. Potentially sdA42A may cross-react with other proteins in cells, which would confound interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>- sdA42A only affects minor growth inhibition in Tbb. The growth defect is used as the main evidence to support targeting this site with chemotherapeutics, however based on the very modest effect on the parasites, one could reasonably claim that PYK is actually not a good drug target. The strongest effect on growth is seen for the high expressor clone in Figure 4a, however here the uninduced cells show an unusual profile, with a sudden increase in growth rate after 4 days, something that is not seen for any of the other control plots. This unexplained observation accentuates the growth difference between induced and uninduced, and the growth differences seen in all other experiments, including those with the highest expressors (clones 54 and 55) are much more modest. The loss of expression of sdA42A over time is presented as a reason for the limited effect, and used to further support the hypothesis that targeting the allosteric site is a suitable avenue for the development of new drugs. However, strong evidence for this is missing.</p>
<p>- For chemotherapeutic interventions to be possible, a ligandable site is required. There is no analysis provided of the antibody binding site to indicate that small molecule binding is indeed feasible.</p>
<p>(2) The authors comment on the modest growth inhibition, and refer to the need to achieve over 88% reduction in Vmax of PYK to see a strong effect, something that may or may not be achieved in the cell-based model (no target-engagement or functional readout provided). The slow binding model and switch of species are also raised as potential explanations. While these may be plausible explanations, they are not tested which leaves us with limited evidence to support targeting the allosteric site on PYK.</p>
<p>(3) The evidence to support an allosteric mechanism is derived from structural studies, including the in silico allosteric network predictions. Unfortunately, standard enzyme kinetics mode of inhibition studies are missing. Such studies could distinguish uncompetitive from non-competitive behaviour and strengthen the claim that sdAb42 locks the enzyme complex in the apo form.</p>
<p>(4) As general comment, the graphical representation of the data could be improved in line with recent recommendations: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/5114d8e9/webinar-report-transforming-data-visualisation-to-improve-transparency-and-reproducibility">https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/5114d8e9/webinar-report-transforming-data-visualisation-to-improve-transparency-and-reproducibility</ext-link>.</p>
<p>- Bar-charts for potency are ideally presented as dot plots, showing the individual data points, or box plots with datapoints shown.</p>
<p>- Images in Figure 7 show significant heterogeneity of nanobody expression, but the extent of this can not be gleaned from Figure 7B. It would be much better to use box plots or violin plots for each cell line on this figure panel. The same applies to Figure 10.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Out of the 20 Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) highlighted by the WHO, three are caused by members of the trypanosomatids, namely Leishmanaisis, Trypanosomiasis, and Chagas disease. Trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes including pyruvate kinase (PyK) have long been recognised as potential targets. In this important study, single-chain camelid antibodies have been developed as novel and potent inhibitors of PyK from the T, congolense. To gain structural insight into the mode of action, binding was further characterised by biophysical and structural methods, including crystal structure determination of the enzyme-nanobody complex. The results revealed a novel allosteric mechanism/pathway with significant potential for the future development of novel drugs targeting allosteric and/or cryptic binding sites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper covers an important area of science towards the development of novel therapies for three of the Neglected Tropical Diseases. The manuscript is very clearly written with excellent graphics making it accessible to a wide readership beyond experts. Particular strengths are the wide range of experimental and computational techniques applied to an important biological problem. The use of nanobodies in all areas from biophysical binding experiments and X-ray crystallography to in-vivo studies is particularly impressive. This is likely to inspire researchers from many areas to consider the use of nanobodies in their fields.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is no particular weakness, but I think the computational analysis of allostery, which basically relies on a single server could have been more detailed.</p>
