<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) is a devastating neurological disorder that results in moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, and a lack of language development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cecil et al., 2001</xref>; deGrauw et al., 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Farr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Salomons et al., 2003</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>SLC6A8</italic> gene reduces or eliminates creatine transporter (CRT, SLC6A8) production and impairs creatine (Cr) uptake, preventing brain Cr accumulation. Individuals with CTD may have mild generalized muscular atrophy, dysmorphic facial features, microcephaly, and gastrointestinal disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Stockler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">van de Kamp et al., 2014</xref>). This neglected disorder has been estimated to cause between 1-3% of all X- linked ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">van de Kamp et al., 2014</xref>) and about 1% of cases with ID of unknown etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clark et al., 2006</xref>). Currently there is no efficient treatment for CTD, and the affected males require lifelong familial or institutional care, representing a significant economic burden for both the individual and the society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fernandes-Pires and Braissant, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The lack of functional CRT in the brain represents a significant roadblock in improving the clinical outcome of CTD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ohtsuki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">van de Kamp et al., 2014</xref>). Several combinations of nutritional supplements or Cr precursors l-arginine and l-glycine, have been studied as therapeutic approaches for CTD, but they have shown limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bruun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Valayannopoulos et al., 2013</xref>), compelling development of alternative strategies for treatment of CTD. Mechanistic understanding of how and where Cr functions in the brain is poorly documented although would be crucial to develop efficient therapies. While several rodent models of CTD have been developed, most studies focused on the description of behavioral and cognitive deficits caused by a lack of brain Cr and have not investigated the molecular underpinnings of this disorder. In addition, while these models do appear to recapitulate the phenotype of humans with CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baroncelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duran-Trio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Skelton et al., 2011</xref>), the important translational gap between rodents and humans needs to be addressed. In the case of this disorder, human post-mortem samples may be difficult to obtain and frequently lack proper controls, thus limiting the investigation of molecular mechanisms. Thus, there is a great need for a relevant biological model to bridge the translational gap in our understanding of CTD. The generation of a comprehensive human model system, recapitulating some of the clinical features of CTD and providing translationally relevant data, would be a significant advancement in our potential to explore the molecular pathomechanism of CTD and validate treatment methodologies. The recent development of specific brain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides such a possibility.</p>
<p>In the present work we have generated iPSCs from fibroblasts of three CTD patients, using previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nassor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pavoni et al., 2018</xref>). We examined the morphology, mRNA expression, and proteomic profile of the obtained brain organoids. Several pathways have been identified related to brain development that are altered in CTD derived brain organoids. Transfecting a functional <italic>SLC6A8</italic> gene into CTD patient-derived iPSCs rescued Cr uptake and normalized much of the proteomic and other pathological features. This study establishes for the first time the use of human CTD brain organoids as a high-fidelity model for understanding the pathophysiology of this devastating disease. The use of human brain organoids from CTD patients is technically innovative and, together with the proteomic studies, provides new information on the cellular basis of cerebral Cr and the molecular mechanism underlying the onset of the CTD phenotype. Here we also provide a database of the cell-specific alterations in CTD-related molecular pathways of translational value, relevant for treatment design.</p>

<title><bold>Generation and characterization of CTD brain organoids</bold></title>
<p>To develop CTD brain organoids, we generated iPS cell lines from the fibroblasts of three CTD patients (CTD 1-4, CTD 2-3 and CTD 3-7). Control iPSCs were derived from the fibroblasts of three healthy volunteers (BJ, SP and PK(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pavoni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Roux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Trotier-Faurion et al., 2013</xref>)). All <italic>SLC6A8</italic> gene mutations and the disease phenotypes were described in detail by Valayannopoulos <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Valayannopoulos et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that all iPSC lines expressed the pluripotency factors SOX2, NANOG, and OCT4, unlike fibroblasts (Fig S1A), as well as the pluripotency marker cell surface antigens SSEA4 and TRA1-60 (Fig S1B). In addition, the iPSC lines generated all three embryonic germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm) in teratoma formation (Fig S1C). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-D</xref>, basal Cr levels (0) were 4 to 8 times lower in CTD-derived iPSCs compared with control iPSCs. To confirm the reduced Cr uptake, we supplemented iPSCs with 25, 75, or 125 µM of Cr. Healthy iPSCs exhibited a dose- dependent Cr uptake (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). However, the amount of Cr in CTD-derived iPSCs was similar at any concentration of Cr-supplemented media, further demonstrating the lack of a functional SLC6A8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). These experiments clearly demonstrated that the CRT is necessary for Cr uptake into patient- derived iPSCs.</p>

<p>To examine the specific role of the CRT, we generated CTD-rescue iPSCs by transfecting a functional <italic>SLC6A8</italic> gene into the CTD patient-derived iPSCs. We used a transposon-based stable system for expressing <italic>SLC6A8</italic> along with green fluorescent protein (eGFP) for the selection and cloning of the transporter-expressing iPSCs (Fig S2A and B). The CTD-rescue iPSCs transported Cr from the media, even exceeding the uptake rate seen in the healthy control-derived iPSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-D</xref>).</p>
<p>Healthy and CTD patient-derived iPSCs were differentiated into brain organoids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). In agreement with our previous results, as well as those in the literature(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nassor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pavoni et al., 2018</xref>), the iPSC-derived brain organoids showed an expression pattern consistent with a telencephalic regionalization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). When following the organoid development, there were no differences in the growth pattern or diameter of healthy and CTD brain organoids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). We assessed the intra and interproduction variability of the generated organoid models by comparing the size of the brain organoids in the different experiments (Fig S3) and found an intraproduction variation of 9 to 27%, and an interproduction variability of 13%.</p>
<p>Consistent with the iPSCs, CTD brain organoids had reduced Cr levels at basal conditions (0) and when supplemented with 75 µM Cr media (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H and I</xref>). We also used iPSCs from CTD patients stably expressing a functional SLC6A8 protein and derived brain organoids from these cells. SLC6A8 expressing brain organoids showed GFP fluorescence in the whole area of the organoid (Fig S2C). The basal Cr concentration in SLC6A8 expressing brain organoids was comparable with the organoids obtained from healthy controls. Further, media Cr supplementation increased the intracellular Cr levels in these organoids, suggesting that they have a functional SLC6A8 protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H and I</xref>). These experiments demonstrated that the CTD-derived brain organoids exhibit a functional deficit in creatine uptake, and this deficiency can be overcome by the re-establishment of a functional CRT.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>CTD brain organoids show dysregulation of neurogenesis</title>
<p>To explore the potential cell-specific changes associated with CTD pathology, we examined the expression of several neuronal and developmental markers in the brain organoids using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, IHC identified major cellular markers both in the two months old healthy-derived and CTD-derived organoids. Brain organoids expressed markers for neural progenitor cells (SOX2 and PAX6), intermediate progenitors (β-III tubulin), immature neurons (TBR1), mature neurons (MAP2 and NeuN), and astrocytes GFAP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Distinct SOX2 and PAX6 positive progenitor cells were distributed surrounding ventricle-like structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). In addition, brain organoids expressed the post-synaptic marker PSD95 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Although all markers were observed in both groups, there were noticeable differences in the morphology of the CTD organoids compared with the control. The expression of progenitor cell markers SOX2 and PAX6 in the healthy and CTD brain organoids showed that the ventricle-like structures were less organized and defined in the CTD brain organoids.</p>

<p>These morphological studies were extended by examining mRNA expression levels of specific marker genes. Consistent with the morphological alterations, CTD organoids had lower mRNA expression of the neural progenitor markers SOX2 (0.0061&lt;p&lt;0.0408) and PAX6 (0.0001&lt;p&lt;0.0019), compared with the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). To determine if this led to dysregulated differentiation of progenitor cells, we quantified the mRNA expression of GABAergic (GABBR1) and glutamatergic (GRIA2) markers. We found a significant reduction in the mRNA expression of the GABAergic [GABBR1 (p=0.0392)] and glutamatergic markers [GRIA2 (0.0041&lt;p&lt;0.0487), as well as of vGluT1 (0.0001&lt;p&lt;0.0241)], in the CTD brain organoids, compared with controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). These findings suggest that a loss of progenitor cells (SOX2+, PAX6+) leads to dysregulation of neuronal differentiation with reduction of GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron generation.</p>
<p>Next, we characterized the impact of loss of SOX2 and PAX6 progenitor cells on synapse formation by measuring mRNA expression levels of PSD95 and CREB in the brain organoids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). We found a significant down regulation of PSD95 and CREB mRNA in CTD brain organoids, as compared to the controls (0.0011&lt;p&lt;0.0060 and p=0.0433, respectively). Together, these results suggest that CTD brain organoids are well organized, showing the diversity of cell types but demonstrate a deficient neurogenesis. These findings are consistent with the data in a murine CTD model showing a decrease in synaptic markers associated with cognitive deficit(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ullio-Gamboa et al., 2019</xref>) as well as the reduced mRNA expression of SOX2 seen here (Fig S4).</p>

<p>To identify the enriched pathways altered in CTD brain organoids, absolute GSEA was performed on the following three pairs of conditions: Healthy (BJ) vs brain organoids from CTD patient (CTD1_4); Healthy (BJ) vs brain organoids from CTD patient (CTD2_3); Healthy (BJ) vs iPSC brain organoids from CTD patient (CTD3_7). The analysis identified that 22, 199, 10, 388, and 323 pathways derived from c2, c3, c4, c5, and c7, respectively, are significantly enriched in BJ vs CTD1_4; 32, 199, 8, 416, and 498 pathways derived from c2, c3, c4, c5, and c7 are significantly enriched in BJ vs CTD2_3; and 26, 182, 8, 474, and 541 pathways derived from c2, c3, c4, c5, and c7 are significantly enriched in BJ vs CTD3_7.

<p>The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) webtool was used to further examine the significant enrichments of protein-protein interactions and establish pathways involved in CTD pathophysiology. The connections between the top proteins involved in the clinical features of CTD patients are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>. We focused on GSK3β pathway because this key kinase is implicated in many cellular processes such as neurogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Ser9 phosphorylation in GSK3β is known to inhibit the kinase activity. We systematically analyzed the level of inactive kinase by immunoblot with a specific antibody. There was a significant reduction in Ser9-phosphorylation in GSK3β in CTD brain organoids compared with healthy brain organoids (0.0034&lt;p&lt;0.0426) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and B</xref>) as well as a significant reduction in SOX2 abundance in the same CTD brain organoids (p=0.0146) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C and D</xref>). Moreover, we confirmed the increased abundance of two proteins highlighted by proteomics analysis, PAK1 (p=0.0034) and MAP1B (p=0.0331), with an additional healthy cell line (SP) and new productions of CTD brain organoids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E-H</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to establish a new translational model for CTD to better characterize the pathophysiology of this disease. We generated brain organoids derived from iPSCs of CTD patients. As predicted, the iPSCs and brain organoids from CTD patients were not able to transport Cr into the cells from the media. The iPSC-derived CTD brain organoids showed similar size and cell type diversity to those obtained from healthy donors, however, they showed decreased expression of neurogenesis- related markers. Normal brain organoids are composed of mature and developing neurons, as well as astrocytes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nassor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pavoni et al., 2018</xref>). The organoids derived from CTD patients show a similar composition with neural progenitor cells located in ventricle-like structures marked by SOX2 and PAX6, and immature and mature neurons marked by TBR1 and NeuN that have migrated from the ventricles. The transcription factors (SOX2 and PAX6) are critical regulators of neuronal stem cell differentiation and proliferation, ensuring the successful process of neurogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cimadamore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Manuel et al., 2015</xref>). SOX2 mutations are associated with intellectual disabilities(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dennert et al., 2017</xref>), seizures and defective hippocampal development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mercurio et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the decreased expression of the progenitor markers, we show that CTD-derived organoids have reduced expression of GABAergic (GABBR1), glutamatergic (GRIA2) and postsynaptic (PSD95) markers, suggesting a reduction in synaptogenesis. This is in agreement with our findings in <italic>Slc6a8</italic> knockout (<italic>Slc6a8<sup>-/y</sup></italic>) mice that showed reduced mRNA expression of PSD95 and CREB(Ullio- Gamboa et al., 2019). Reduced cortical spine density and reductions in protein levels of several synaptic markers have been observed in the brains of <italic>Slc6a8<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Duran-Trio et al., 2022</xref>). Thus our CTD brain organoid model recapitulates the altered neurogenesis seen in murine CTD models and this impaired neurogenesis may lead to the cognitive deficits in CTD. Udobi <italic>et al</italic> showed that developmental deletion of the <italic>Slc6a8</italic> gene in mice is necessary to gain the same cognitive deficits seen in the constitutive <italic>Slc6a8<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice, providing further evidence for the importance of Cr in brain development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Udobi et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings are in agreement with previous observations in Down syndrome, showing the defect in neurogenesis and consequently the diminished proliferation and decreased expression of layer II and IV markers in cortical neurons in the subcortical regions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tang et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed proteomic analysis to identify proteins and molecular pathways that may be disrupted in CTD. Organoids from CTD patients showed altered expression of several proteins compared with normal brain organoids. We highlighted 32 proteins with altered abundance in comparison with healthy brain organoids. Among these 32 proteins, 21 proteins have already been related to autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, neurodevelopmental disorders, and epileptic encephalopathies (Table S6). These altered, relevant protein expression patterns indicate that CTD brain organoids may appropriately reflect the molecular physiopathology of the patients. We used a stepwise regression statistical model and ENRICHR analysis to reveal that two key pathways, GSK3β and SRC, were altered in CTD brain organoids. The search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes (STRING) web tool confirmed that the two pathways were associated to the most abundant proteins involved in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p>Next, we performed a functional study on the relationship between GSK3β and neurogenesis deficit in CTD organoids. GSK3β is a constitutively active key kinase, negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser9(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>). GSK3, having a broad range of substrates, regulates a wide spectrum of cellular processes, including neurogenesis, neuronal polarization, and axon growth during brain development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>). This regulation occurs either by direct action or through transcriptional modulations. As an example, active GSK3β directly modulates microtubule dynamics by phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rippin and Eldar-Finkelman, 2021</xref>), such as MAP1B which was highlighted in our proteomic analysis. MAP1B in turn participates in the regulation of the structure and physiology of dendritic spines in glutamatergic synapses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tortosa et al., 2011</xref>). GSK3β can also modulate gene expression by controlling the level, nuclear localization and the DNA binding of transcription factors, thus indirectly regulating neurogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>). As an example, the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a substrate of GSK3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>). Thus, the overactivation of GSK3β in CTD brain organoids is consistent with our observations in a CTD mouse model, where we showed that CREB was downregulated at the transcriptional level(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ullio-Gamboa et al., 2019</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that modulation of GSK3β activity can regulate neural progenitor homeostasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dohare et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Guyot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jurado-Arjona et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kim et al., 2009</xref>) and GSK3 is also implicated in energy homeostasis, apoptosis and autophagy, as well as in interactions with neurodegeneration-linked proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The overactivation of GSK3β in our CTD brain organoids was associated with a decreased level of neural progenitor and synaptic markers as compared to the normal organoids. We document here that this phenotype is rescued by the re-establishment of a functional SLC6A8 transporter, restoring Cr uptake in the CTD brain organoids. The introduction of a functional Cr transporter in the CTD-rescue organoids leads to a reduction of GSK3β activation, a restoration of the SOX2 progenitor marker level, as well as of the highlighted proteins link to intellectual disabilities such as PAK1 and MAP1B. Alterations in GSK3 activity have been associated with many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, and neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism spectrum disorders(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rizk et al., 2021</xref>). Although the link between creatine level and GSK3β activation needs to be further examined, modulation of GSK3β activity may represent an interesting target for the treatment of this devastating intellectual disability disease.</p>
<p>In summary, our iPSC-derived brain organoid model recapitulate the key features of the neurodevelopmental deficits observed in CTD patients. We examined morphological and mRNA expression alterations potentially connected to the pathology of CTD. The extensive proteomics analysis pointed out 32 proteins linked to the GSK3β and SRC cascades and 21 proteins potentially associated with the clinical features of CTD patients. Using targeted molecular methodologies, we demonstrated that the altered GSK3β pathway most likely has a significant role in the mechanisms leading to a defective neurogenesis in the CTD brain organoids. The main findings of our study in CTD brain organoids are schematically summarized in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. We suggest that the human cellular organoid model presented here helps to understand the pathogenesis of CTD, and particularly the impact of the decreased creatine uptake into the brain on the regulation of proteins associated with the clinical features of CTD patients. Analysis of protein expression expand the knowledge about the consequences of CRT deletion and the effects of Cr replenishment, revealing new information on the molecular mechanism underlying the onset of CTD phenotype. We provide a database of the cell- specific alterations in molecular pathways of translational value relevant for treatment design. We believe that this new model of CTD patient-derived brain organoids represents an important translatable tool to examine potential treatment modalities. We generated CTD brain organoids from three families. As all patients’ mutations in this study are a deletion of one amino acid, it could be interesting to generate CTD brain organoids from cells with other types of mutations to evaluate their impact on the CTD pathophysiology.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic presentation of the main findings of the study.</title>
<p>The decrease in cerebral creatine pool could favor the accumulation of the dephosphorylated form of GSK3β, making it more active. This kinase has many targets in the cell, including transcription factors whose activity it can modulate. This modulation will in turn modify the expression of genes, which can influence several cellular processes: the reorganization of microtubules with the regulation of MAP1B, synaptic function, and neurogenesis thus affecting the functionality of brain cells and consequently cognitive functions. The alteration of neurons could also be explained by a mitochondrial dysfunction due to the decrease of creatine levels and the modulation of GSK3β activity, which is known to regulate mitochondrial activity.</p></caption>

<p>The full length <italic>SLC6A8</italic> cDNA was purchased from Addgene (pDONR221_SLC6A8, #131915) and cloned into an eGFP containing Sleeping Beauty transposon vector (p10-CAG-SLC6A8-IRES2-eGFP), where the SLC6A8 and eGFP were connected by an IRES2 sequence, providing simultaneous, but independent expression of the two proteins.</p>
<p>The p10-CAG-SLC6A8-IRES2-eGFP vector was electroporated together with the SB 100X transposase(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mátés et al., 2009</xref>) into control and disease related iPSC lines in Amaxa® 4D- Nucleofector® using P4 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector® X Kit (Lonza) with the CM133 program. After 7 days of transfection each clone was sorted based on the GFP fluorescence using BD FACSAria™ Cell Sorter then plated onto Matrigel®-coated plates (Corning), in mTeSR1 (Stem Cell Technologies) medium containing 10 µM Y27632-2HCl (Selleckchem). Stabilized SLC6A8 and eGFP expressing clones were expanded and screened for GFP expression and for pluripotency by measuring SSEA4- APC expression by flow cytometry. The cells were labeled with anti-human SSEA-4 APC-conjugated antibody (1:100, R&amp;D Systems) at 37°C for 30 minutes. Propidium iodide (ThermoFisher Scientific) staining was employed for gating out the positively labelled dead cells. A control measurement with isotype-matched control (1:100, R&amp;D Systems) was included. For selecting clones of SLC6A8 and eGFP expressing iPSC lines, single cell suspensions were prepared using Accutase and then the GFP expressing single cells were plated in Matrigel®-coated 96-well plates in mTeSR1 medium containing 10 µM Y27632-2HCl, using BD FACSAria™ Cell Sorter. The clones were expanded in mTeSR1 medium. Surviving clones used for further experiments were selected based on pluripotent morphology and bright GFP fluorescence.</p>

<p>We followed the protocol published by Lancaster &amp; Knoblich with minor modifications from Pavoni <italic>et al</italic> and Nassor <italic>et al</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nassor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pavoni et al., 2018</xref>). At day 0, iPSCs were dissociated and counted. Hanging drops of 20 µl of embryoid body medium containing 15000 cells per drop were cultured on a Petri dish cover to allow them to aggregate before being collected and placed in a well of a non-treated 24-well plate (Sarstedt). Media changes, neural induction and neural differentiation were performed following the published protocol(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nassor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pavoni et al., 2018</xref>) with the use of an organoid embedding sheet for the matrigel embedding step (STEMCELL Technologies).

<title>Creatine uptake and quantification</title>
<p>iPSCs were passaged using accumax (Sigma) and seeded at 300,000 cells/well in a 6-well plate. When iPSC reached confluence, they were incubated with or without Cr-supplemented medium for 1h, then harvested using accumax. Cr levels were quantified using Cr quantification kit (Sigma, MAK079), either the colorimetric or fluorometric version of the kit. For the colorimetric test, absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a BioTek Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). For the fluorometric test, fluorescence intensity (λex = 535nm, λem = 587 nm) was measured with a SpectraMax M5 Multimode Plate Reader (Molecular Devices).Brain organoids were incubated with or without Cr-supplemented medium for 6h. Cr levels were quantified using the same method as for iPSCs, with the exception of lysis for which Precellys Evolution tissue homogenizer (Bertin) was used. Cr levels in samples were normalized by total protein quantification (Bradford assay).</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Brain organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 45 min. After two washes in PBS, organoids were moved to 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4°C. Organoids were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and flash frozen at -80°C. Sections (20 µm) were cut with a cryostat (HM560 Microm Microtech). After permeabilisation with 0.3% Triton and blocking with 2% goat serum (Gibco, 16210064) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), sections were incubated for 1h with the following primary antibodies: SOX2 1:100 (Abcam, ab93689), PAX6 1:100 (Sigma-Aldrich, AMAb91372), βIII-tubulin 1:500 (Sigma-Aldrich, T8578), TBR1 1:100 (Abcam, ab31940), PSD95 1:500 (Sigma-Aldrich, MABN68), NeuN 1:100 (Sigma-Aldrich, MAB377), MAP2 1:100 (Sigma-Aldrich, ZRB2290), GFAP 1:200 (Sigma-Aldrich, G3893). After PBS washes, DAPI (100-1000 ng/ml) and secondary antibodies labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 1:500 (Invitrogen, #A-11037, #A-11029) were incubated for 1h.

<title>RNA extraction, RT-PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from brain organoids with RNeasy Plus Universal Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen) and Precellys Evolution tissue homogenizer (Bertin). The concentration and purity of RNA samples were checked using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer at 260 and 280Lnm (NanoDrop Technologies); the A260/280 ratio ranged from 1.8 to 2.2. OneLμg of total RNA was converted to cDNA using random primers in a volume of 20Lμl using an RT2 HT first stand kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was diluted with sterile water to a final volume of 200LμL. Quantitative expression of markers were determined using 2Lµl of diluted cDNA for each primer (Table S7) set at 10LµM using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad) in a final volume of 12Lµl. Thermocycling was carried out in CFX96 RT-PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) using SYBR green fluorescence detection. The amplification cycle used was as follows: 10Lmin at 95L°C, followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95L°C for 15Ls, 60L°C for 60Ls and 72L°C for 30Ls to reinitialize the cycle again. The specificity of each reaction was also assessed by melting curve analysis to ensure primer specificity. Relative gene expression values were calculated as 2<sup>−ΔCT</sup>, where ΔCT is the difference between the cycle threshold (CT) values for genes of interest and housekeeping gene (GAPDH).</p>

<title>Proteolysis and mass spectrometry analysis</title>
<p>Total pelleted cell material was supplemented with lithium dodecyl sulfate lysis buffer (Invitrogen) following the ratio of 25 µl of buffer per mg of material. Glass and silica beads (200 mg) were added to each sample, which was then subjected to 10 cycles of bead beating at 10,000 rpm for 30 sec followed by 30 sec halt with a Precellys device (Bertin technologies) as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hayoun et al., 2019</xref>). The supernatants were transferred to a new tube and incubated at 99°C for 5 min. A volume of 20 µl of each sample was loaded on a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel. Then, the proteins were separated by a short electrophoresis migration (5 min) at 200 V on with MES/SDS 1X (Invitrogen) as running buffer. Gels were stained for 5 min with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Thermo) and then washed overnight with water with gentle agitation. The polyacrylamide band containing the whole proteome from each sample was excised, treated, and proteolyzed with trypsin as recommended(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rubiano-Labrador et al., 2014</xref>). Peptides (300 ng) were analyzed by liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (LC−MS/MS) using an Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system coupled to a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) operated essentially as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Klein et al., 2016</xref>) Peptides were eluted from the reverse phase chromatography column for 90 min with an acetonitrile gradient and the mass spectrometer was operated in Top20 mode, with a 10 s dynamic exclusion time for the analysis of fragmented peptides.</p>

<title>Raw data normalization and filtering</title>
<p>To identify the proteins differentially abundant between healthy and IPSC-CTD derived brain organoids, raw proteomic data were normalized and filtered using an in-house script constructed using R programming language. Briefly, the Variance Stabilizing Normalization (VSN)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Motakis et al., 2006</xref>) was applied to normalize the data and remove the background noise.

<title>Identification of key proteins associated with key features of CTD patients</title>
<p>The GSEA and frequency analysis (top 90-percentile cut-off) identified 142 differentially expressed proteins occurring frequently across all enriched pathways. To further reduce the set of available proteins, the most abundant proteins with spectral count higher than 10 were selected, and the fold change CTD brain organoids in comparison with healthy brain organoids was determined. Proteins with fold change ≥ 3 were considered as upregulated and fold change ≤ -3 as downregulated. This abundance and fold change analysis identified 32 abundant proteins as significantly up- or downregulated in CTD brain organoids in comparison with health organoids and in potential relation with cognitive functions. In order to identify potential functions of the differentially expressed proteins, the 32 proteins significantly altered in CTD brain organoids in comparison with health organoids were subjected to a disease-related pathway analysis carried out using Enrichr followed by a frequency analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kuleshov et al., 2016</xref>) focusing on the following sets : BioCarta_2016, Elsevier_Pathway_Collection, GO_Biological_Process_2021, GO_Molecular_Function_2021, KEGG_2021_Human, MSigDB_Hallmark_2020, WikiPathways_2021_Human, ClinVar_2019, DisGeNET, Jensen_DISEASES, OMIM_Disease.

<p>The raw data generated by MS/MS was normalized and filtered. The proteins significantly altered in the three CTD-derived cerebral organoids in comparison with healthy cerebral organoids were identified using modification of the R package for ROTS. Absolute GSEA was performed in order to identify the enriched pathways in CTD-derived brain organoids in comparison with healthy cerebral organoids and the list of enriched genes was identified. Their recurrence or frequency in other pathways among all studied gene sets was searched. The frequency analysis identified 142 differentially expressed proteins occurring frequently across all enriched pathways. The 142 proteins identified were then subjected to a disease-related pathway analysis carried out using Enrichr followed by a frequency analysis in order to identify potential functions of the differentially expressed proteins. To further reduce the set of available proteins, the 142 proteins identified from the GSEA and the Frequency analysis were then sorted according to fold change; the most abundant proteins with fold change (-3&lt;FOLD change&gt;+3) and a sc higher than 10 were retained. 32 most altered and abundant proteins were found to be significantly altered in CTD-derived cerebral organoids compared to normal organoids.</p>

<p>This well written and designed study by Broca-Brisson et al describes the generation of a new in vitro model for creatine transporter deficiency (CTD), making use of human brain organoid cultures derived from CTD patients. This new model will certainly prove itself very useful to better understand this genetic disease essentially affecting CNS. As CTD has no satisfactory treatment so far (despite more than 20 years of research), this new model will also be very useful to design and develop new treatments.</p>
<p>In particular, through the use of immunohistochemistry, real time PCR, and proteomics combined with integrative bioinformatic and statistical analysis, authors provide very interesting new information on the brain pathways affected in CTD (e.g. neurogenesis with down-regulation of SOX2 and PAX6 but up-regulation of GSK3b; and proteins involved in autistic spectrum, epilepsies or intellectual disabilities).</p>

<p>In their recent manuscript, Broca-Brisson et al. deliver a multidisciplinary approach to investigate creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) using human-derived brain organoids. The authors have provided a compelling CTD human brain organoid model using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from individuals with CTD. This model shows distinct differences in creatine uptake between organoids originating from CTD patients and their healthy counterparts. Furthermore, the researchers effectively restored creatine uptake by reintroducing the wild-type CRT in the iPSCs.</p>
<p>The team used advanced molecular biology techniques and sophisticated mass spectrometry to identify changes in protein regulation within these CTD brain organoids. They propose an intriguing theory linking reduced creatine uptake to abnormalities in the GSK3β kinase pathway and mitochondrial function, which might underlie intellectual disability seen in CTD patients.</p>
<p>
This study is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear and concise explanations of the experiments. The authors present an important idea: a dysfunction in just one protein transporter (CRT) can cause significant biochemical changes in the brain. Their findings are well-presented and backed by high-quality figures and comprehensive data analysis.</p>
<p>There are only minor suggestions for improvement in this manuscript. The authors strongly link creatine uptake, the GSK3β pathway, and intellectual disability. Enhancing this claim with data on phosphorylation differences between organoids derived from healthy individuals and those from CTD patients could solidify this foundation and facilitate a more holistic understanding of the disease. In addition, the in vitro model based on organoids might be closer than other experimental setups; however, proving that those differences are also present in vivo would greatly benefit the story.</p>
<p>There is also some uncertainty around the rescue experiment using the exogenous SLC6A8 gene. Could the difference in creatine uptake between the rescue iPSCs and the healthy control be due to CRT overexpression? Higher levels of the transporter may explain the elevated levels of intracellular creatine. Thus, a comparison using Western blotting experiments could be a valuable addition to evaluating the expression levels of this protein.</p>
<p>Overall, this study provides valuable insights into CTD and potential therapeutic targets. It enriches our understanding of CTD and opens up new avenues for future research in this field.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p>Question 1: While the CTD human brain organoids show a decrease in Cr (in absence of Cr in the culture medium) as compared to control organoids (4 times less), they are not devoid of Cr. Do these organoids express the two enzymes allowing Cr synthesis (AGAT and GAMT), and in which brain cell types? If yes, how to explain the decrease in Cr in the CTD organoids?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is a lack of functional CRT in the CTD human brain organoids. The basal level of creatine in CTD human brain organoid is significantly lower than in healthy human brain organoids. The intracerebral creatine synthesis is due to different expression of the AGAT and GAMT enzymes and relies on functional CRT for the transport of the GAA intermediate. Literature pointed out that both enzymes are rarely co-expressed (Braissant et al., 2001, PMID: 11165387) meaning that GAA intermediate needs to be transported by CRT to neurons for complete creatine synthesis. Even if we evidenced a slight mRNA expression of AGAT and GAMT enzymes, the creatine synthesis is not effective since the GAA intermediate could not be transported in cell expressing GAMT due to the non-functional creatine transporter in the CTD human brain organoids.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 2. The rescue experiment, re-establishing a functional Cr transporter (CRT or SLC6A8) in the CTD human brain organoids, is very interesting, as this may help the design and development of new treatments for CTD. However, authors claim that the functional CRT expressed in the rescued CTD organoids was expressed in each cell. This may be a difficulty in the development of new CTD treatments, as CRT should be expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, but not in astrocytes. Authors may want to comment on this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As shown in Figure S2C, the whole brain organoid in the rescue experiment shows the expression of the GFP protein, thus also the co-expressed wild-type CRT. In these experiments, we did not make a detailed cellular characterization of the rescued organoids, and this may be the aim of a separate study that will carry out experiments for an exact characterization of the cell-specific CRT expression and function in the rescued brain organoids. Accordingly, we corrected in the revised version of manuscript the statement on page 6 to the following: “SLC6A8 expressing brain organoids showed GFP fluorescence in the whole area of the organoid (Fig S2C).”</p>

<list-item><p>Authors may precise in their introduction (lines 60-61) that, while creatine (Cr) supplementation is not effective to treat CTD male patients, a proportion of female CTD patients is responsive to Cr supplementation (due to the differential inactivation of one of the X chromosome depending on the cells).</p>

<p>Treating CTD appears simple: transport creatine into the brain cells. In individuals with creatine synthesis disorders, increasing brain creatine levels thanks to oral supplementation of creatine monohydrate and/or precursors improves neurodevelopmental outcomes. This task has proven more daunting than expected in CTD since oral creatine supplementation does not increase brain creatine concentrations.  Literature and more specially data reported by Van de Kamp “X-linked creatine transporter deficiency: clinical aspects and pathophysiology. J Inhert Metab Dis 37 (5):715-733) describes 3 females CTD patients without improvement of clinical outcomes. Bruun et al., 2018 “Treatment outcome of creatine transporter deficiency: international restrospective cohort study: Metab. Brain Dis: 33:875-884 reports 2/3 CTD females with improvement of clinical outcome. Taken together the sentence has been modified in the revised version of the manuscript as follows: “Several combinations of nutritional supplements or Cr precursors l-arginine and l-glycine, have been studied as therapeutic approaches for CTD, but they have shown limited success (Bruun et al., 2018, Valayannopoulos et al., 2013) (lines 61-63, Page 4)</p>

<p>There are only minor suggestions for improvement in this manuscript. The authors strongly link creatine uptake, the GSK3β pathway, and intellectual disability. Enhancing this claim with data on phosphorylation differences between organoids derived from healthy individuals and those from CTD patients could solidify this foundation and facilitate a more holistic understanding of the disease. In addition, the in vitro model based on organoids might be closer than other experimental setups; however, proving that those differences are also present in vivo would greatly benefit the story.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As shown in Fig 6A-B, GSK3β is less phosphorylated on Ser9 in CTD brain organoids compared to healthy organoids, indicating that GSK3β is more active in organoids with reduced creatine levels. Studying the level of GSK3β phosphorylation in the mouse brain could be part of next experiments and another story.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There is also some uncertainty around the rescue experiment using the exogenous SLC6A8 gene. Could the difference in creatine uptake between the rescue iPSCs and the healthy control be due to CRT overexpression? Higher levels of the transporter may explain the elevated levels of intracellular creatine. Thus, a comparison using Western blotting experiments could be a valuable addition to evaluating the expression levels of this protein.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the rescue experiment, we used a vector where SLC6A8 and eGFP were connected by an IRES2 sequence, providing simultaneous, but independent expression of the two proteins. CTD-rescue iPSC clones were selected based on high eGFP fluorescence. These clones probably have several copies of transgene in their genome, which could result in a higher abundance of SLC6A8 compared with healthy iPSCs. The difference in creatine uptake between the CTD-rescue iPSCs and the healthy control is probably due to CRT overexpression. However, there are no satisfactory anti-SLC6A8 antibodies commercially available to quantify CRT by western-blot. We would like to add that, although creatine uptake is higher in CTD-rescue iPSCs than in healthy control, the basal level of creatine (which corresponds to culture conditions for the rest of the experiments) is similar.</p>

<p>Overall, this study provides valuable insights into CTD and potential therapeutic targets. It enriches our understanding of CTD and opens up new avenues for future research in this field.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words and hope this study will be useful for other researchers in the CTD field.</p>
