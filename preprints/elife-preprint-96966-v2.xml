<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic>, a cellulolytic thermophilic anaerobe, is considered by many to be a prime candidate for the realization of consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) and is known as an industry standard for biofuel production. <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> is among the best biomass degraders identified to date in nature and produces ethanol as one of its main products. Many studies have helped increase ethanol titers in this microbe, however ethanol production using <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> is still not economically viable. Therefore, a better understanding of its ethanol synthesis pathway is required. The main pathway for ethanol production in <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> involves the bifunctional aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE). To better understand the function of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain a 3.28 Å structure of the AdhE complex. This high-resolution structure, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, provides insight into the substrate channeling of the toxic intermediate acetaldehyde, indicates the potential role of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE to regulate activity and cofactor pools, and establishes a basis for future engineering studies. The containment strategy found in this enzyme offers a template that could be replicated in other systems where toxic intermediates need to be sequestered to increase the production of valuable biochemicals.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>Changed Title
We have modified Figure 1A to zoom in on one compact and extended spirosome that we have identified from each C. thermocellum sample. We have included triangles of the same size and shape to indicate the proximity of a turn of a helix, showing that the identified compact spirosomes have a tighter conformation than extended spirosomes.
We have created a new supplemental figure with spirosomes circled for all of the experimental conditions for C. thermocellum (Supplemental figure 1). We have added a reference to supplemental figure 1 in the text to direct the reader to these images.
We included the pictures of the theoretical compact spirosomes, as generated from the 8-mer of E. coli AdhE (6AHC) to address the possibility of rosettes. We have now indicated in the text that there were 6.7% of the particles in the compact conformation, which is less than seen by negative stain. We further mentioned that the compact spirosome is less compact than that seen in E. coli. We added a sentence to the discussion about the possibility of contaminating E. coli spirosomes (though this is very unlikely) in our compact spirosome analysis: While these compact spirosomes
could result from expression in E. coli, though this is very unlikely, we also identified compact spirosomes in a native C. thermocellum lysate, which would not have similar contamination
issues.
We have added the following sentences to the discussion to address this comment: This could potentially be due to the diXerences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In previous studies, compact spirosomes have only been isolated from Gram-negatives while solely
extended spirosomes have been isolated from Gram-positives. Furthermore, while the compact spirosomes can transition to extended in the presence of cofactors, the reverse has not been previously observed with an extended spirosome.
We are unsure as to what needs to be corrected in the figure 7 legend based on this comment.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most attractive substrates for sustainable production of second-generation biofuels and other bioproducts (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is emerging as a promising process to reduce costs by combining biomass solubilization and fermentation in one step without added enzymes (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Due to its ability to quickly solubilize and utilize cellulose, <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic> is an ideal candidate organism for CBP and has previously been engineered to produce ethanol at high yield (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, ethanol production using <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> is not yet an economical process due to limited titers (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The main pathway for ethanol production in <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> involves the bifunctional aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE), a gene that is often modified in strains selected for alcohol tolerance and other selective pressures, indicating its crucial role in <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> metabolism (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). AdhE functions in the anaerobic fermentation pathway and contains two domains: an aldehyde dehydrogenase domain (ALDH) for the reduction of acetyl-CoA to acetaldehyde and an alcohol dehydrogenase domain (ADH) to reduce acetaldehyde to ethanol. Both reduction processes natively use NADH as a cofactor and are reversible in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> as a cofactor. Because AdhE is part of the native ethanol production pathway in many anaerobic bacteria, it is a key target protein in many biofuels and biochemicals-related studies (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
<p>Structurally, AdhE is an intriguing protein as it forms large, filamentous helical ultrastructures termed spirosomes, that could be necessary for function (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In the case of <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE, spirosome formation seems vital for the forward reaction of acetyl-CoA to ethanol, while the reverse reaction is not impacted by the disruption of the ultrastructures (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Prior structural studies on the <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE complex captured both the extended and compact forms of the spirosome, with some biochemical evidence that the extended form was required for the reduction of acetyl-CoA to ethanol (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Because <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE and <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE have 62% sequence identity, we first aimed to determine the similarity between the AdhE from <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. To further understand the AdhE from <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to capture the structure of the spirosome ultrastructure in both its extended and compact forms. We further analyzed the results of our 3.28 Å extended <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE in combination with channel prediction software and molecular dynamics simulations. We determined that the native state of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> spirosome is extended (different from that of other structurally characterized AdhEs) and contains an enclosed channel between the ALDH and ADH active sites. In modeling the compact spirosome, we found that this channel leaks acetaldehyde to the bulk phase, which indicates that the extended spirosome might be crucial for toxic aldehyde intermediate channeling.</p>

<title>Results and Discussions</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Spirosome conformation is determined by intrinsic sequence and local environment, but not by expression host</title>
<p>A fundamental aspect of this work was determining if the local environment of AdhE affected the formation of the spirosome and its conformation (extended <italic>vs</italic>. compact). This was especially important given that our structural studies utilized <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE heterologously expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Based on negative stain TEM data shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, we found that spirosomes maintained the same conformation between endogenous and exogenous expression – both primarily extended in the case of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> which represents the majority <italic>apo</italic> conformation of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> spirosome. Intriguingly, the extended conformation of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> spirosome remained unchanged when purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>, even though the native <italic>apo E. coli</italic> AdhE is purified primarily in the compact form (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Since Kessler <italic>et al</italic>. found that the addition of both NAD<sup>+</sup> and FeSO<sub>4</sub> was necessary to transform <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosomes from their compact to their extended forms, we investigated the effects of different reactants that could contribute to the inverse process in the purified, extended <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> spirosome (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). While our results were not as extreme as those of Kessler <italic>et al</italic>., we found that the addition of the forward reactants (NADH, acetyl-CoA, FeSO<sub>4</sub>) led to the compaction of spirosomes. Conversely, the addition of the reverse reactants (NAD<sup>+</sup>, ethanol, CoA, FeSO<sub>4</sub>) to the compact <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosomes resulted in more extended forms. To isolate which substrate was causing this shift, we made negative stained grids of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> spirosomes in the presence of each reactant and found that NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup> were the major determining factors in the conformation of the spirosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Supplemental Figure 1). We also found that the expression host does not impact conformation of the spirosomes but does significantly affect their length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> formed spirosomes that were, on average, approximately 20 nanometers shorter than those found in a native <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> lysate. This equates to spirosomes that contain, on average, approximately five to ten fewer AdhE monomers in the extended spirosome. The shorter average length was due largely to the lack of spirosomes that were longer than 100 nanometers in the exogenous expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This phenomenon has been observed previously with the exogenous expression of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> spirosomes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which also resulted in shorter spirosomes (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>

<title>High-resolution structure of the extended <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE spirosome</title>
<p>To understand why <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE is found in the extended spirosome form and <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE in the compact form, we turned to cryo-EM to obtain a high-resolution structure of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> protein complex to analyze its interfaces as compared to previously published <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosome structures at the molecular level (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

We compared multiple aspects of the protein complex to the previously published <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosome structures, including the interaction interfaces, predicted catalytic active sites, cofactor binding pockets, and potential channels that may connect the two active sites (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>

<title>Structural comparison of spirosome oligomerization interfaces</title>
<p>There are two interfaces that form the spirosome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 F, G</xref>). The first is the buried area located between two molecules of AdhE, in a domain-swapped dimer interface, where one ALDH domain is sandwiched between the ADH and ALDH domains of the second protein. This area contains a wide array of residues involved in the interaction that spans the entire protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The second interface is between the dimer of dimers, here referred to as the tetramer interface. This interface has a much smaller interaction area because it only occurs between two ADH domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Intriguingly, the overall hydrophobicity and electrostatics of these interfaces are similar between the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> extended, <italic>E. coli</italic> extended, and <italic>E. coli</italic> compact structures (Supplemental Figure 2). However, the calculated buried surface area differs between the two <italic>E. coli</italic> dimer interfaces, but not the tetramer interface. Both the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> extended dimer interfaces bury ~5000 Å<sup>2</sup>. While the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> compact dimer interface buries a similar surface area of ~4800 Å<sup>2</sup>, the <italic>E. coli</italic> compact dimer interface buries ~3800 Å<sup>2</sup>. Conversely, all the tetramer interfaces bury ~2000 Å<sup>2</sup>. One would expect the compact structure in <italic>E. coli</italic> to have a larger buried surface area due to it being the predominant form when it is examined without additives, but that is not the case; further corroborating that factors other than buried surface area must impact the <italic>apo</italic> state of the spirosome. Analysis of the residues buried in these interfaces reveals that while many of the residues are identical in the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> extended structures, there are some differences in amino acid type distribution, although nothing that directly indicates control of conformer state (Supplemental Figure 3).</p>
<p>We also examined the salt bridge and hydrogen bond networks between AdhE monomers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We found that more salt bridges form in the extended <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> structure as compared to the extended <italic>E. coli</italic> structure, which suggests that this may be a factor in the stability of extended <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> structure that is not found in the <italic>E. coli</italic> structure. However, when looking between the <italic>E. coli</italic> extended and compact structures, there are two more salt bridges in the extended structure than in the compact structure, which again implies that there might be additional factors impacting the primary form of the spirosome (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). When looking at the hydrogen bonds between molecules, the extended <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> spirosome has a wider variety of hydrogen bonds (44 unique pairs) than the extended <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosome (32 unique pairs), indicating a potentially more stable structure. However, as with the salt bridges, the compact <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosome has fewer hydrogen bonds (17 unique pairs) than the extended structure, which does not explain why the compact form is the primary structure isolated when purified without substrates.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="580662v2_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We also examined areas in the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> structure that align with areas in the <italic>E. coli</italic> structures that have previously been shown to disrupt spirosome formation or with areas in the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> structure that were implicated in spirosome length. For the former in <italic>E. coli</italic>, there are two examples: 1) F670 mutated to either a small non-polar amino acid or a charged amino acid (PDBID 7BVP) and 2) the deletion of residues 446-449, both resulting in spirosome dissociation (PDBID 6TQH) (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>, F670 is a tyrosine, however the hydrophobic pocket that surrounds that residue still exists (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We postulate that the similar shape of tyrosine maintains the integrity of this interaction, resulting in stable spirosomes. Regarding the 446-449 deletion, it occurs in the linker between the two domains of the AdhE monomer. This linker is vital for the domain-swapped structure of the dimer. Thus, deleting four residues, regardless of the identity of those amino acids, should interfere with the dimerization of AdhE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Structural comparison of AdhE active sites</title>
<p>One factor that compaction and extension of the spirosome affects is the active site of both the ALDH and ADH domains. Here, we compare the NAD<sup>+</sup>-occupied <italic>E. coli</italic> site to the empty site of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> structure to determine which residues may interact with NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref>). In a sequence comparison between 25 AdhE proteins that have been previously identified in bacteria, both the ALDH and ADH NAD-pockets seem relatively well-conserved (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). There are a few residues with less than 50% identity (when using <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> as the basis of comparison), such as I119, L204, F496, S605, and M645. However, most of these residues retain similar chemistry at those locations - for example, L204 is a non-polar residue in every bacterium queried. Conversely, the amino acid that corresponds to the F496 position can vary between non-polar, negatively charged, and polar, which is surprising since the phenylalanine at that position stacks with the adenosine moiety of the NAD<sup>+</sup>. These patterns generally held true when the sequence alignment was expanded to 1000 AdhE sequences that were identified through the JGI IMG database (Supplemental Figure 4). Using this larger set of sequences, we also analyzed the D494 position. Prior work has shown that mutating the aspartate to glycine results in a change of co-factor preference from NADH to also include NADPH (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). There were 2.7% of AdhE sequences that had a naturally occurring G at this position, which suggests that there are AdhE proteins that rely on NADPH for their catalysis. We were able to visualize a potentially novel NAD(P)H binding site previously only identified via sequence comparison (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The sequences contained a conserved GxGxxG motif at residues 426-431, which has been shown as involved in nucleotide binding (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Intriguingly, this site does not coincide with either the ALD or ALDH active sites and is therefore less likely to have a catalytic function. However, this motif is located at the interface of two AdhE monomers, indicating that it could have an allosteric role, although further studies are needed to confirm. The three glycines at this position are all over 99% conserved, indicating that they play an important role in the AdhE structure or function.</p>

<p>We also used structure alignments to estimate how both the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> ALDH active sites would accommodate an acetyl-CoA molecule <italic>via</italic> comparison to the structure of the <italic>R. palustris</italic> aldehyde dehydrogenase bound to acetyl-CoA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We observed that the proteins aligned with very little deviation - less than 2 Å RMSD – causing the acetyl-CoA aligned from <italic>R. palustris</italic> to sit in most of the same pocket that the NAD<sup>+</sup> occupies as aligned from <italic>E. coli</italic>. This suggests that the dehydrogenase reaction occurs stepwise to include both the NAD<sup>+</sup> and the acetyl-CoA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>) (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Furthermore, when looking at the surface representation of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> structure, we found that the NAD<sup>+</sup> clashes with the protein, indicating that the pocket might shift to accommodate NADH separate to acetyl-CoA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). In looking at the residues within 3.5 Å of the acetyl-CoA, we identified multiple regions that seem conserved between all three organisms. Interestingly, if we look at the catalytic cysteine, which is covalently linked to the acetyl-CoA in the <italic>R. palustris</italic> structure, we see that the cysteine for both <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> are rotated approximately 120° away from the <italic>R. palustris</italic> position in opposite directions which could be due to the absence of acetyl-CoA in these structures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>) (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>
<p>At the ADH active site, we observe an empty density in the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> extended structure, coordinated between residues that have been implicated in the ADH activity of the protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>, circled in red) (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). As illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, we see that there is density, most probably a water molecule, being coordinated by H734, D844, and C846. D844 and C846 are 100% conserved, while H734 is 92% conserved amongst the 25 sequences that we analyzed. While slightly less well-conserved in the 1000 sequence comparison, all three residues are still highly conserved (H734 is 97.8%, D844 is 98.8%, and C846 is 91.6% conserved; Supplemental Figure 4). Furthermore, this small pocket is within 10 Å of the catalytic iron atom, which increases the probability that this region is important for catalysis. No published structure of the ADH domain contains either acetaldehyde or ethanol at the active site, though the structure of the <italic>Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius</italic> ADH domain (PDBID 3ZDR) contains a glycerol molecule coordinating a divalent metal ion (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The terminal alcohol group of the glycerol molecule was speculated to be similar to that of ethanol, thus the structure may constitute a product mimic (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Further supporting our hypothesis that a water molecule may occupy the observed empty density at the ADH active site in the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> extended structure, two independent MD trajectories, each with two full AdhE molecules including two ADH actives sites, demonstrate hydrogen bonding of at least one water molecule with D844 in essentially every frame (&gt;98%), as well as with H734 (16-31% of the frames) and with C846 (7-66% of frames with both side chain and main chain, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>.</p>

<title>Identification of a channel that confines aldehydes and examination of the dynamics of spirosome ultrastructures</title>
<p>Intermediate channeling has been proposed previously in the <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosome, based on observation of enclosed space within the structure, and has been hypothesized as a functional role to contain reactive aldehydes and therefore limit cytotoxicity (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, direct evidence for the functional role of this putative channel is still lacking. In order to more fully understand the extended spirosome of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>, we employed multiple computational approaches to analyze its structure. First, we used MOLE 2.0 to identify potential channels within the structure of the spirosome, specifically looking for channels that span between the ALDH and ADH active sites (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In all three structures (<italic>E. coli</italic> compact, <italic>E. coli</italic> extended, and <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> extended), as well as a SwissPDB model of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> compact structure, MOLE 2.0 identified a channel that could connect the two active sites. Compelling trends emerge when analyzing the composition of amino acids that line the channel compared to the amino acid composition of the whole protein for both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>. Overall, the channels are more highly conserved than the overall protein: the residues lining the extended channel have 92% homology, and the residues in the compact channel have 97% homology, whereas the overall protein homology is only 62%. When more AdhE sequences are included in the analysis, more variety is seen in the residues lining the channel (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, Supplemental Figure 5). Further examination of the individual amino acids also reveals important trends. First, there is only one lysine in the tunnel in all three structures, showing one of the largest log2-fold changes as compared to the composition of the full protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). This may indicate that the channel is designed to contain reactive aldehydes while avoiding cross-linking with the amine group of the lysine. Second, there is a higher concentration of histidines in the channel in all the structures as compared to the full protein. This is potentially due to the tunnel passing by the catalytic iron in the ALDH domain, which is coordinated by three histidines. Notably, there is a difference in the number of phenylalanines in the channel when compared between the compact and extended structures. The extended structures contain a much higher density of phenylalanines as indicated by the log2-fold change. Finally, we focused on the cysteines present in these channels. In the compact state, only the catalytic cysteine from the ALDH domain is present in the channel. However, in both extended structures, there are two cysteines in the channel: the catalytic cysteine from the ALDH domain and the cysteine in the catalytic pocket from the ADH domain. This could point to the extended spirosome as being the relevant catalytic form because there is a potential path that efficiently connects the active sites.</p>

<p>As a complement to the insights gained from the static structures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with bound acetaldehyde were conducted to investigate the dynamics of the aldehyde intermediate. We examined the effect of spirosome configuration (extended and compact) and species (<italic>C. thermocellum</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>) on residence time of acetaldehyde in the enzyme before escape to the solvent. The starting enzyme configurations for these simulations were the cryo-EM structure of the extended <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> spirosome, a homology model of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> compact spirosome (PDBID 6TQM serves as the template), and <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosomes in extended (6TQH) and compact (6TQM) forms (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). As in 6TQH and 6TQM, all simulation systems comprise two full AdhE units and two additional ADH domains on either side. The aldehyde intermediate is formed at the ALDH active site, thus this constitutes the starting location for acetaldehyde in the simulations. Additional starting points midway between the ALDH and ADH catalytic sites were also generated based on the results from MOLE, namely midway along the MOLE tunnel where the channel was the widest (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, panels A and C). More details for the system construction, acetaldehyde starting points, and simulation details are found in the SI.</p>

<p>Three 200 ns MD simulations were conducted from each starting configuration. The primary conclusion from these is that the residence time for acetaldehyde when the spirosome is in the extended conformation is significantly longer than the compact conformation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>, Supplemental Figure 6E). The significant difference between extended and compact forms presented in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref> could be even larger given that many of the 200 ns simulations ended with acetaldehyde still present within the extended AdhE spirosomes (and thus the true residence time is longer than 200 ns). In addition, the trajectory of the aldehyde tracks quite closely with the channel found by MOLE (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, 7B</xref>). Though the acetaldehyde is sometimes observed to escape AdhE when started in the extended conformation, it typically samples a significant stretch of the path between the ALDH and ADH active sites, occasionally traversing the full distance between the two active sites (Supplementary Movie 1). In contrast, simulations initiated with the spirosome in the compact conformation typically see acetaldehyde leave within 4 ns (ALDH active site starting position) to 30 ns (starting point midway in the channel). For example, in the trajectory represented in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> acetaldehyde leaves within 4 ns. We conducted analogous simulations with the <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE and found the basic conclusions to be analogous to the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE (Supplementary Figure 6).</p>
<p>Taken together, these simulations effectively present a novel and dynamic understanding of intermediate aldehyde channeling in AdhE spirosomes and lend evidence to the hypothesis that the extended spirosome may be the dominant active complex for AdhE spirosomes.</p>
<p>Finally, we turned back to the variability of spirosome conformation observed by negative-stain TEM and searched more closely for the same variability in the cryo-EM data. Initial visual analysis was unable to discern between 2D projections of extended or compact conformations, as the difference was expected to be minute. The abundance of extended spirosomes relative to compact spirosomes confounded computational cross-correlation sorting while simultaneously making it difficult to visually identify compact projections. To address this, we sorted all particles selected by the crYOLO autopicker (which exhibits less bias than template or manual picking) using cryoDRGN (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p>
<p>Correlation between particles visualized graphically in the UMAP (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>) indicated the existence of at least four distinct spirosome conformations. Volumes generated from these particle subgroups indicated the presence of extended, compact, and at least two major intermediate conformations (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). We attempted to refine the isolated classes from cryo-DRGN but encountered extended spirosome contamination in each of the classes. However, we continued searching for compact spirosome projections by generating 2D templates from the <italic>E. coli</italic>, compact AdhE spirosome model (PDBID 6AHC) using cryoSPARC (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>) (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). These templates were then used as a visual reference, which did indeed reveal the presence of compact 2D projections within the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> cryoEM data (6.7% of picked particles were compact) that were previously overlooked (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). The subsequent reconstruction using these particles yielded a 3.93 Å density of the compact AdhE spirosome, although there was evidence of streaking due to preferred orientation issues and low particle numbers. Although the streakiness prevented the successful fitting of a high-resolution molecular model, the density map corroborates the domain orientation of a compact spirosome, as modeled by SWISS-MODEL. There are some intriguing insights into differences between our compact ultrastructure compared to previously reported compact AdhE spirosomes isolated from different species (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Most notably, the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE does not achieve as compact a state, even when isolating the most compact particles. Moreover, the reconstruction of a compact spirosome density corroborates that compact spirosomes observed <italic>via</italic> negative staining are also present in near-native conditions (cryogenically preserved samples). This data confirms that spirosomes have the potential to exist in a spectrum of states that can be captured in a single cryo-EM grid without any additional cofactors to induce conformational changes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, we presented and analyzed a high-resolution structure of the AdhE spirosome from <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>. In comparison to the <italic>apo E. coli</italic> spirosome structure, which purifies in the compact conformation, the <italic>apo C. thermocellum</italic> spirosomes are primarily extended (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Our structural comparison identifies the extended conformation as the more structurally stable form in both the case of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>, which disagrees with the reality of the compact spirosome being the stable, <italic>apo</italic> conformation from <italic>E. coli</italic>. The evidence for the extended spirosome as the more stable form includes the higher number of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between molecules in the extended as compared to the compact. Furthermore, extended spirosomes have a larger buried surface area in the dimer interface than the compact spirosomes (5000 Å<sup>2</sup> compared to 3800 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively), imparting additional stability. Although we could not structurally identify exact features that would predict which conformation was preferred, we have evidence from negative-stain EM experiments that conformation does not rely solely upon the environment: <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> spirosomes are extended in both endogenous and exogenous expression conditions. Therefore, there must be some intrinsic structural elements that contribute to the <italic>apo</italic> state of the spirosome, although we have not found that element in this study. This could potentially be due to the differences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In previous studies, compact spirosomes have only been isolated from Gram-negatives while solely extended spirosomes have been isolated from Gram-positives. Furthermore, while the compact spirosomes can transition to extended in the presence of cofactors, the reverse has not been previously observed with an extended spirosome (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Here, we identified compact spirosomes in our study, although they were largely outnumbered by the more-preferred extended spirosome, which further indicates that the extended structure is more stable for <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>, regardless of expression host. While these compact spirosomes could result from expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is very unlikely, we also identified compact spirosomes in a native <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> lysate, which would not have similar contamination issues. Close examination of the structure revealed a potential novel allosteric NAD(P)H binding site that lies between two monomers of AdhE, identified by a characteristic NAD(P)H binding motif. The GxGxxG motif is highly conserved across 1000 AdhE sequences, indicating its importance in the protein. Further studies will be necessary to fully understand the role of this motif.</p>
<p>The second conclusion of this paper is that intermediate channeling is possible and may be the primary purpose of large, spirosome ultrastructures. An intriguing finding from prior research is that the spirosome is necessary for the acetyl-CoA to acetaldehyde reaction in the ALDH domain, yet unneeded for the reverse reaction or for ADH activity (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Therefore, a channel might be necessary to funnel acetaldehyde away from the ALDH active site to prevent product inhibition in the ALDH site. Prior research identified a similar channel in <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE spirosomes yet did not confirm its role nor characterize the movement of intermediates within the channel (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Here, we identified an enclosed tunnel between an ALDH domain and an ADH domain of two separate proteins in <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> and used MD to examine possible aldehyde channeling. While the channel can be found in both the compact and extended structures, we see that the channel in the compact conformation has areas that are exposed to the cytosol, whereas the extended channel is entirely enclosed. This further supports the idea that the extended spirosome is the active form of AdhE (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). MD simulations further corroborate this, showing that the aldehyde intermediate has a much longer occupation time in the channel of the extended form. Future mutagenesis studies will be needed to confirm whether the spirosome exists to control the reaction flux in high-reactant conditions.</p>
<p>The <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE structure, in combination with molecular dynamics and comparative analysis with the <italic>E. coli</italic> structures, establishes a baseline for further studies using mutagenesis to increase the efficacy of the protein. This work provides insight as to why the spirosome seems to be necessary for only one direction of the reaction, as well as opens new and interesting questions as to why certain variants of AdhE natively exist in different conformations. It also provides a template that could be replicated in other systems where toxic intermediates need to be sequestered to increase the production of valuable biochemicals.</p>

<title>Native C. thermocellum cell growth and isolation</title>
<p>Fermentations were carried out using <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic> strain DSM1313. Cultures were grown in Medium for Thermophilic Clostridia (MTC), using stock solutions to combine with water and the desired carbon source to reach 1x concentration. The medium was prepared as described with cellobiose as the carbon source (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p>
<p>Glycerol stocks were revived in 10 mL serum bottles that were prepared in an anaerobic chamber containing 85% N<sub>2</sub>, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 5% H<sub>2</sub>. Seeds were grown to 0.8-1.0 OD<sub>600</sub> at 55°C and transferred to 100 mL serum bottles. These cultures were grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8-1.0 in approximately 12 hours before the entire contents (10% v/v) were inoculated into 5 g/L cellobiose MTC medium in process control bioreactors for a final working volume of 1 L. All growth medium was prepared at pH 7.0 and maintained at this level for all bioreactor experiments using 2N KOH. Temperature was maintained at 55°C with 50 rpm agitation for bottles and bioreactors. An N<sub>2</sub> environment was maintained through the bioreactor headspace at a rate of 30 mL/min.</p>
<p>Cultures were grown until maximum cell density was reached around 1.2 OD<sub>600</sub> in approximately 8 hours. The entire bioreactor contents were harvested into centrifuge bottles and centrifuged at 8,000 RPM for 20 minutes. The supernatant was removed by decanting. The pellet was then washed with distilled water and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The wash fraction was removed by decanting, and the residual pellet was frozen until use in experiments.</p>
<p>Cells were lysed using a BeadBeater with a 30 seconds on/30 seconds off pattern for 5 minutes in SEC buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) with 1 uL of DNaseI and one tablet of protease inhibitor. Lysate was spun down at 15,000× g to pellet any extra cell debris, then concentrated, and passed through a 0.22 um filter before being loaded directly onto a Superose6 size exclusion column. The fractions that had signal on the FPLC trace were stored at 4C before negative stain grid preparation.</p>

<title>Negative-Stain TEM Sample Preparation and Data Collection</title>
<p>All AdhE proteins were screened for optimal concentrations for negative staining – finding that 0.05 mg/ml was the ideal concentration for protein separation. Grids were glow discharged for 20 seconds at 10 mA before the sample was applied to the grid to incubate for one minute. The excess sample was blotted away before the grid was dipped in a droplet of 2% aqueous uranyl acetate (UA) for 15 seconds. Excess UA was blotted away, and grids were left to dry before storage at room temperature before transmission electron microscopy (TEM) screening. Grids of the <italic>apo</italic> nCthAdhE, CthAdhE, and EcoAdhE were viewed on a Tecnai T20 (FEI/ThermoFisher Scientific) TEM at 50,000x magnification, with 6x6 montages collected using SerialEM (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).

<title>Cryo-EM Data Analysis</title>
<p>Structural analysis was done in Relion 3.1, originally starting with helical processing to create a 3D template for autopicking in single particle analysis, resulting in a 3.8 Å structure that was used for initial model building (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Figures 8 and 9) (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Data from the Krios was also processed in Relion 3.1 using single particle analysis (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).

<title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
<p>Classical MD simulations of 200 ns in length were run in triplicate for the following enzymes: 1) <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE in extended spirosome form, 2) <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE in compact form, 3) <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE in extended form, and 4) <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE in compact form. With the exception of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> in compact form, the starting structures for the enzymes come from cryo-EM structures. The <italic>E. coli</italic> extended and compact forms originate with the structures from Pony <italic>et al</italic>. (PDB codes 6TQH and 6TQM, respectively) (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> compact spirosome was constructed as a homology model by SWISS-MODEL with 6TQM as the template (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The simulation system comprises two full AdhE units and two additional ADH domains on either side, as in 6TQH and 6TQM. Where they appear in the cryo-EM structures, NAD+ and NADH molecules are removed. All three cryo-EM structures contain divalent iron bound at ADH active sites. The position of these cations is maintained, but iron is swapped for zinc in each case. We have chosen to include zinc in each ADH active site, rather than iron, for two primary reasons. The first is that parameters for iron are not included in the standard CHARMM forcefield. Secondly, it has been shown that ADH activity of ADHE can be stimulated in cell extracts to varying degrees, including zinc (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In fact, divalent zinc has been shown to have higher ADH activity than divalent iron in at least one study, leading the authors to conclude that this class of ADH structures should be described as “metal ion-dependent” rather than strictly iron- or zinc-specific (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p>
<p>In the biofuels context, i.e. producing alcohols from acyl-CoA molecules, the aldehyde intermediate is formed at the ALDH active site from acyl-CoA and then travels to the ADH active site where it is reduced to an alcohol. Thus, for our MD simulations, positioning the acetaldehyde intermediate at the ALDH active site most closely approximates the physical situation for intermediate channeling. The placement of acetaldehyde at the ALDH active site was determined by alignment with 5JFM (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Additional starting points midway between the ALDH and ADH catalytic sites were generated based on the results from MOLE, namely choosing starting coordinates midway along the MOLE tunnel where the channel was widest (Supplemental Figure 5F, G) (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, protonation states were determined by the output from H++ server (http://biophysics.cs.vt.edu/H++) at pH 6.0, consistent with the assays performed by Extance <italic>et al</italic>. In addition, the catalytic cysteine residues in ALDH domains (C252 in <italic>C. thermocellum and</italic> C246 in <italic>E. coli</italic>) are deprotonated. The overall charge on the enzymes domains (two, full AdhE molecules and two additional ADH domains) with these protonation states is -42 for <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> systems and -28 for <italic>E. coli</italic> systems; a corresponding number of sodium ions were added to the solution phase to neutralize the overall system. Neither <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> nor <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE contains any disulfide bonds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to investigate the dynamics of water molecules at the ADH active site, 80 ns MD simulations were performed in duplicate of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> extended structure with NADH bound at the ADH active site. Zinc molecules are positioned at each ADH active site, as above.</p>
<p>All simulations were built using CHARMM version 44a1 and simulated with the CHARMM36 force field for the protein, and TIP3P potential for water molecules (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>-<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Topologies and forcefield parameters for acetaldehyde and NADH come from the CHARMM generalized forcefield (CGenFF) version 4.1 (<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).</p>

<title>CryoDRGN Analysis</title>
<p>To evaluate structural heterogeneity evident in the cryoEM data, 959,561 potential spirosome particles were sorted into 2D classes using RELION 3.1 and were exported for analysis with cryoDRGN 0.3.4 (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Particles were downsampled to a 64px box size [5.28 Å/px] and analyzed for 50 epochs with the standard latent space parameter of 8, at which point training converged. Inspection of 20 volumes generated by k-means clustering and resulting UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximate and Projection) visualization of latent space of particle projections suggested the presence of four major conformational classes, which were segmented by Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM, k=4). Of them, only major classes indicative of spirosome formation were retained for further analysis. A fifth class (‘Other’) of unidentifiable “junk” particles and dimers was also identified, and those particles were discarded from further processing. The remaining 858,511 spirosome particles were scaled to 128px box size [2.64 Å/px] and again analyzed for 50 epochs. Major classes indicated by the UMAP clusters were attributed to extended, compact, and transitional state spirosomes by visual confirmation of 3D density volumes generated by k-means clustering and filtered by GMM (k=5).</p>

<title>CryoSPARC Template Generation and Use</title>
<p>The cryoSPARC ‘Create Templates’ utility was used to back project 50 2D classes of the compact <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE spirosome (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). For posterity, 50 back projected 2D classes of the extended <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE spirosome were also generated to serve as a comparison (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Visual inspection indicated sufficient difference between 2D projections of both conformations. The 2D templates of the compact structure were used as a visual reference by which compact classes were hand selected from the heterogenous compact model building described above (Supplemental Table 1). This resulted in the selection of 64,977 particles that were determined to be in the compact state, which were processed in Relion 3.1 as described above. Because the heterogenous dataset was lacking in some projections predicted by the template generation, the resulting 3D density of the compact <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE suffered from some preferred orientation and ultimately achieved a 3.93 Å resolution, as determined by the Relion gold standard FSC.</p>

<p>Clostridium thermocellum serves as a model for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) in lignocellulosic ethanol production. The primary ethanol production pathway involves the enzyme aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE), which exhibits complex regulation, forming long oligomeric structures known as spirosomes.</p>
<p>The present study describes the cryo-EM structure of C. thermocellum AdhE, resolved at 3.28 Å resolution. By integrating cryo-EM data with molecular dynamics simulations, this study showed that the aldehyde intermediate resides longer in the channel of the extended form, supporting the mechanistic model in which the extended spirosome conformation represents the active form of AdhE.</p>
<p>These findings advance the understanding of the function and regulation of AdhE, a key enzyme involved in the ethanol biosynthesis pathway in Clostridium thermocellum, a model organism for ethanol production in consolidated bioprocessing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Ziegler et al, entitled 'Structural characterization and dynamics of AdhE ultrastructure from Clostridium thermocellum: A containment strategy for toxic intermediates?&quot; presents the atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of C. thermocellum AdhE showing that it show dominantly an extended form while E.coli AdhE shows dominantly a compact form. With comparative analysis of their C. thermocellum structure and the previous E.coli AdhE structure, they tried to reveal the mechanism by which C.thermocellum and E.coli show different dominant conformations. In addition, they also analyzed the substrate channel by comparative and computational approaches. Lastly, their computational analysis using CryoDRGN reveals conformational heterogeneity in the sample. Despite this the manuscript is very descriptive and does not provide a mechanistic understanding by which AdhE works, this work will provide structural frame works to further investigate the function and mechanism of AdhE dynamics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript provides the first C. thermocellum (Ct) AdhE structure and comparatively analyzed this structure with E.coli AdhE.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This work is very descriptive and does not provide mechanistic understanding of the function and dynamics of AdhE.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p><italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic> serves as a model for consolidated bioprocess (CBP) in lignocellulosic ethanol production, but yet faces limitations in solid contents and ethanol titers achieved by engineered strains thus far. The primary ethanol production pathway involves the enzyme aldehydealcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE), which forms long oligomeric structures known as spirosomes, previously characterized via the 3.5 Å resolution <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE structure using single-particle cryoEM. The present study describes the cryo-EM structure of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> ortholog, sharing 62% sequence identity with E. coli AdhE, resolved at 3.28 Å resolution. Detailed comparative structural analysis, including the Vibrio cholerae AdhE structure, was conducted. Integrating cryoEM data with molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the aldehyde intermediate resides longer in the channel of the extended form, supporting the hypothesis that the extended spirosome represents the active form of AdhE.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study conducts a comprehensive structural comparative analysis of oligomerization interfaces and the acetaldehyde channel across compact and extended conformations. Structural and computational results suggest the extended spirosome as the most likely active state of AdhE.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The overall resolution of the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> structure is similar to the <italic>E. coli</italic> ortholog, which shares 62% sequence identity, and the oligomerization interfaces and the acetaldehyde channel were previously described.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Ziegler et al, entitled 'Structural characterization and dynamics of AdhE ultrastructure from <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic>: A containment strategy for toxic intermediates?&quot; presents the atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE showing that it show dominantly an extended form while <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE shows dominantly a compact form. With comparative analysis of their <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> structure and the previous <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE structure, they tried to reveal the mechanism by which <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> show diXerent dominant conformations. In addition, they also analyzed the substrate channel by comparative and computational approaches. Lastly, their computational analysis using CryoDRGN reveals conformational heterogeneity in the sample. Although this manuscript suggests a potential mechanism of the diXerent features of AdhEs, this manuscript is very descriptive and does not provide suXicient data to support the authors' conclusions, which may be due to the lack of experimental data to support their findings from the computational analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript provides the first <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> (Ct) AdhE structure and comparatively analyzed this structure with <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Their main conclusions obtained mostly by computational and comparative analysis are not supported by experimental data.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This study describes the first structure of Gram-positive bacterial AdhE spirosomes that are in a native extended conformation. All the previous structures of AdhE spirosomes obtained come from Gram-negative bacterial species with native compact spirosomes (<italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>V. cholerae</italic>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, AdhE spirosomes can be found in two diXerent conformational states, compact and extended, depending on the substrates and cofactors they are bound to.</p>
<p>The high-resolution cryoEM structure of the extended <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE spirosomes produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> in an apo state (without any substrate or cofactors) is compared to the <italic>E. coli</italic> extended and compact AdhE spirosomes structures previously published. The authors have modeled (in Swiss-Model) the structure of compact <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE spirosomes, using <italic>E. coli</italic> compact AdhE spirosome conformation as a template, and performed molecular dynamics simulations. They have identified a channel in which the toxic reaction intermediate aldehyde could transit from the aldehyde dehydrogenase active site to the alcohol dehydrogenase active site, in an analogous manner to <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosomes. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that the extended spirosomes could correspond to the active form of the enzyme.</p>
<p>In this work, the authors speculate that the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE spirosomes could switch from the native extended conformation to a compact conformation, in a way that is inverse of <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosomes. Although attractive, this hypothesis is not supported by the literature. Amazingly, in some Gram-positive bacterial species (<italic>S. pneumoniae, S. sanguinis or C. di8icile</italic>...), AdhE spirosomes are natively extended and have never been observed in a compact conformation. On the opposite, <italic>E. coli</italic> (and other Gram-negative bacteria) native AdhE spirosomes are compact and are able to switch to an extended conformation in the presence of the cofactors (NAD+, coA, and iron). The data presented as they are now are not convincing to confirm the existence of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE spirosomes in a compact conformation.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) The claim of achieving the highest resolution AdhE structure lacks strong support since the E. coli structure was solved at 3.5A, whereas the C. thermocellum was solved at 3.28A. Conducting a local resolution analysis could provide insights into distinct structural interpretations, enhancing the strength of the claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the sentence claiming this as the highest resolution AdhE structure to say, “In this study, we presented and analyzed a high-resolution structure of the AdhE spirosome from <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>.” We have included the local resolution map in Figure 2C – all structural analysis was performed in regions from the center of the molecule, where the highest resolution information was determined.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The comparative structural analysis of the oligomerization interface is thorough, yet it could benefit from greater conciseness. Focusing on highlighting major findings would streamline the presentation and enhance clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We altered a few places in the comparative structural analysis in response to other reviewers. We also divided the main structure section into two subsections (spirosome interfaces and AdhE active sites) to enhance clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors should change the tile containing &quot;?&quot;. Does it mean that the conclusions that the authors made are still in question?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have removed the question mark to indicate that our results point to a channeling mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 1B: Clarify Ct Fwd. Is this adding NADH, and Ct Rev adding NAD+?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This information is described in the text in lines 98-100. It is also at the bottom of figure 1B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 131: Please revise accordingly for clarity: &quot;The extended dimer interfaces&quot; è &quot;The extended E.coli dimer interface&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been edited for clarity. We have added the following sentence resulting to indicate which interfaces that are being discussed: “Both the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> extended dimer interfaces bury ~5000 Å2. While the compact <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> compact dimer interface buries a similar surface area of ~4800 Å2, the <italic>E. coli</italic> dimer interface buries ~3800 Å2.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 133-136: Why that does not seem to be the case? These sentences are not clear what the authors exactly mean.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We altered the text to say, “One would expect the compact structure in <italic>E. coli</italic> to have a larger buried surface area due to it being the predominant form when it is examined without additives, but that is not the case; further corroborating that factors other than buried surface area must impact the <italic>apo</italic> state of the spirosome.” We hope this clarifies our intent.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Line 138-145: The authors should provide a logic for how the diXerent distribution of the charged residues would change the form of AdhE. It may just be a diXerent distribution nothing to do with the conformational change.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>After further analysis of the interface amino acid distribution, we agree that the distribution may have nothing to do with the conformational change. We have changed this section to end with the sentence “Analysis of the residues buried in these interfaces reveals that while many of the residues are identical in the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> extended structures, there are some diXerences in amino acid type distribution, although nothing that directly indicates control of conformer state (Supplemental Figure 3).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Line 169: Kim et al. è Cho et al.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected this error.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Line 122-235: The whole section is just describing the diXerence between Ct and Ec AdhE suggesting that this diXerence may contribute to the conformational diXerence without any evidence. The author cannot say that the diXerences in the interface, active sites cofactor pockets, etc explain why two AdhE (Ct, Ec) have diXerent domain conformers unless they provide experimental data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not conclude that any diXerences we observed structurally were responsible for the conformation change. The purpose of this section was solely to compare the structures to determine if we could find a structural basis for the diXerence between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> conformation – we stated a few times throughout the section and in the discussion that there were no immediate structural reasons for this diXerence in shape. We have added a few sentences in the discussion to address whether Gram-positive vs. Gram-negative is influencing the shape, addressed in reviewer #3 comment #4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Line 237: The whole section &quot;Identification...&quot; analyzed the substrate channel by computational analysis. The author should provide experimental evidence that these residues identified are critical for channeling by generating mutants and measuring their activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that mutagenesis is the next logical step for these results, however it is outside the scope of work of this paper as this study will not be that straightforward. We have included a sentence in the discussion to indicate our plans for further investigation to the channel that says, “Future mutagenesis studies will be needed to confirm whether the spirosome exists to control the reaction flux in high-reactant conditions.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The capacity of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> AdhE spirosomes to switch from a natively extended conformation to a compact conformation is not demonstrated in this manuscript, as it is now. Because this would be the first time that Gram-positive bacterial AdhE spirosomes are observed in a compact conformation, the authors should provide a clear demonstration of their existence by presenting reliable and good images of C. thermocellum compact spirosomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified Figure 1A to zoom in on one compact and extended spirosome that we have identified from each <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> sample. We have included triangles of the same size and shape to indicate the proximity of a turn of a helix, showing that the identified compact spirosomes have a tighter conformation than extended spirosomes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should show at least an image of the compact C. thermocellum spirosomes, that they claim to observe in the presence of NADH or in the forward reaction conditions mentioned in Figure 1. The authors have added diXerent reactants to the extended C. thermocellum spirosomes and visualized their conformation by negative stain. An image of each condition tested would be valuable and would nicely complete the distribution of compact versus extended spirosomes presented in Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have created a new supplemental figure with spirosomes circled for all of the experimental conditions for <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> (Supplemental figure 1). We have added a reference to supplemental figure 1 in the text to direct the reader to these images.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The cryoEM classes presented in Figure 8 are not convincing and could correspond to dimers or rosettes of AdhE or to E. coli endogenous AdhE. CryoEM classes showing longer compact C. thermocellum spirosomes should be shown. The percentage of these compact spirosomes visualized in the micrographs should be added and discussed in the text as it would increase confidence in these findings and confirm that C. thermocellum compact spirosomes exist. Heterologous production of C. thermocellum AdhE in E. coli depleted for its endogenous AdhE would be required to definitively prove that these are compact C. thermocellum AdhE spirosomes in the cryoEM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We included the pictures of the theoretical compact spirosomes, as generated from the 8-mer of <italic>E. coli</italic> AdhE (6AHC) to address the possibility of rosettes. We have now indicated in the text that there were 6.7% of the particles in the compact conformation, which is less than seen by negative stain. We further mentioned that the compact spirosome is less compact than that seen in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We added a sentence to the discussion about the possibility of contaminating <italic>E. coli</italic> spirosomes (though this is very unlikely ) in our compact spirosome analysis: “While these compact spirosomes could result from expression in E. coli, though this is very unlikely, we also identified compact spirosomes in a native <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> lysate, which would not have similar contamination issues.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should include and discuss in the text previous findings (among which Laurenceau et al., 2015...) describing the diXerences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative spirosomes. AdhE spirosomes are natively extended in most Gram-positive bacterial species (S. pneumoniae, S. sanguinis or C. diXicile...), and have never been observed in a compact conformation. On the opposite, E. coli (and other Gram-negative bacteria) native AdhE spirosomes are compact and are able to switch to an extended conformation in the presence of the cofactors (NAD+, coA, and iron).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the following sentences to the discussion to address this comment: “This could potentially be due to the diXerences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In previous studies, compact spirosomes have only been isolated from Gram-negatives while solely extended spirosomes have been isolated from Gram-positives. Furthermore, while the compact spirosomes can transition to extended in the presence of cofactors, the reverse has not been previously observed with an extended spirosome.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors have spotted some diXerences between the E. coli and C. thermocellum structures, that they believe could explain the intrinsic capacity of these spirosomes to be natively extended or compact. It would be interesting to confirm this hypothesis by measuring C. thermocellum extended AdhE spirosome activity and comparing it to E. coli extended spirosomes. The impact of mutations in the regions proposed by the authors to be important in the capacity of C. thermocellum AdhE to be extended (especially the GxGxxG motif and the D494 position) would be appreciated to confirm this hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this would be an interesting avenue of research although it is currently outside the scope of this paper. We are looking into experiments that we can perform where we can track both activity and conformation but have not found an ideal experiment at this time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Many statements and result interpretations are overstated in several parts of the manuscript and would need to be rewritten to balance the absence of clear evidence of C. thermocellum compact spirosomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have shown that we have identified compact spirosomes, addressed in multiple comments above. We have adjusted the language of the paper to indicate more uncertainty that will be followed up in future mutagenesis experiments. However, these mutations are not that simple to identify and this research would require a fairly large study that is better suited for a follow up manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The Figure 7 legend would need to be corrected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are unsure as to what needs to be corrected in the figure 7 legend based on this comment.</p>
