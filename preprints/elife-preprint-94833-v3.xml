<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-Seq) is a widely used technique to explore gene regulatory mechanisms. For most ATAC-Seq data from healthy and diseased tissues such as tumors, chromatin accessibility measurement represents a mixed signal from multiple cell types. In this work, we derive reliable chromatin accessibility marker peaks and reference profiles for most non-malignant cell types frequently observed in the micro-environment of human tumors. We then integrate these data into the EPIC deconvolution framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) to quantify cell-type heterogeneity in bulk ATAC-Seq data. Our EPIC-ATAC tool accurately predicts non-malignant and malignant cell fractions in tumor samples. When applied to a human breast cancer cohort, EPIC-ATAC accurately infers the immune contexture of the main breast cancer subtypes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene regulation is a dynamic process largely determined by the physical access of chromatin-binding factors such as transcription factors (TFs) to regulatory regions of the DNA (<italic>e.g.,</italic> enhancers and promoters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Klemm, Shipony and Greenleaf, 2019</xref>). The genome-wide landscape of chromatin accessibility is essential in the control of cellular identity and cell fate and thus varies in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Klemm, Shipony and Greenleaf, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">K. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Over the last decade, Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-Seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buenrostro <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) has become a reference epigenomic technique to profile chromatin accessibility and the activity of gene regulatory elements in diverse biological contexts including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Luo, Gribskov and Wang, 2022</xref>) and across large cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Corces <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Several optimized ATAC-seq protocols have been developed to improve the quality of ATAC-Seq data and expand its usage to different tissue types. These include the OMNI-ATAC protocol, which leads to cleaner signal and is applicable to frozen samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Corces <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grandi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), as well as the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)-ATAC protocol adapted to FFPE samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">H. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). The reasonable cost and technical advantages of these protocols foreshadow an increased usage of ATAC-Seq in cancer studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grandi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Luo, Gribskov and Wang, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Most biological tissues are composed of multiple cell types. For instance, tumors are complex ecosystems including malignant and stromal cells as well as a large diversity of immune cells. This cellular heterogeneity impacts tumor progression as well as response to immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fridman <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">de Visser and Joyce, 2023</xref>). Most existing ATAC-Seq data from tumors were performed on bulk samples, thereby mixing the signal from both cancer and non-malignant cells. Precisely quantifying the proportions of different cell types in such samples represents a promising way to explore the immune contexture and the composition of the tumor micro-environment (TME) across large cohorts. Carefully assessing cell-type heterogeneity is also important to handle confounding factors in genomic analyses in which samples with different cellular compositions are compared. Recently, single-cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) has been developed to explore cellular heterogeneity with high resolution in complex biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cusanovich <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lareau <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Satpathy <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). However, the resulting data are sensitive to technical noise and such experiments require important resources, which so far limits the use of scATAC-Seq in contrast to bulk ATAC-Seq in the context of large cohorts.</p>
<p>In the past decade, computational deconvolution tools have been developed to predict the proportion of diverse cell types from bulk genomic data obtained from tumor samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Becht <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avila Cobos <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Finotello <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Monaco <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Newman <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sturm <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">H. Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). As described in more details elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avila Cobos <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sturm <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), many of these tools model bulk data as a mixture of reference profiles either coming from purified cell populations or inferred from single-cell genomic data for each cell type. The accuracy of cell-type proportion predictions relies on the quality of these reference profiles as well as on the specificity of cell-type markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avila Cobos <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). A limitation of most deconvolution algorithms is that they do not predict the proportion of cell types that are not present in the reference profiles (hereafter referred to as ‘uncharacterized’ cells). In the context of tumor samples, these uncharacterized cell populations include malignant cells whose molecular profiles differ not only from one cancer type to another, but also from one patient to another even within the same tumor type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Corces <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). To address this limitation, a few tools developed for bulk RNA-Seq data consider uncharacterized cells in their deconvolution framework by using cell-type specific markers not expressed in the uncharacterized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gosink, Petrie and Tsinoremas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clarke, Seol and Clarke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Finotello <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). These tools include EPIC (Estimating the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells) which simultaneously quantifies immune, stromal, vascular as well as uncharacterized cells from bulk tumor samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Racle and Gfeller, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Most deconvolution algorithms have been developed for transcriptomic data (RNA-Seq data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gong and Szustakowski, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Newman <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Finotello <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jimenez-Sanchez, Cast and Miller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Monaco <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">T. Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). More recently they have been proposed for other omics layers such as methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aryee <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Teschendorff <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chakravarthy <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hicks and Irizarry, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rahmani <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arneson, Yang and Wang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">H. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Salas <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Feng <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) or chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">H. Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). For the latter, a specific framework called DeconPeaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">H. Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) was developed to estimate cell-type proportions from bulk ATAC-Seq samples. Deconvolution tools developed initially for RNA-Seq data can also be applied on ATAC-Seq. For example, the popular deconvolution tool, CIBERSORT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Newman <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), in combination with ATAC-Seq profiles, was used to deconvolve leukemic ATAC-Seq samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Corces <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Other methods have been proposed to decompose ATAC-Seq bulk profiles into subpopulation-specific profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burdziak <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) or compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Peng <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). However, these methods have more requisites: (i) the integration of the ATAC-Seq data with single-cell or bulk RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burdziak <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and HIChIP data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) or, (ii) subsequent feature annotation to associate compartments with cell types or biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Peng <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The application of existing bulk ATAC-Seq data deconvolution tools to solid tumors faces some limitations. First, current computational frameworks do not quantify populations of uncharacterized cell types. Second, ATAC-Seq based markers (<italic>i.e.,</italic> chromatin accessible regions called peaks) and reference profiles generated so far have been derived in the context of hematopoietic cell mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Corces <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">H. Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Markers and profiles for major populations of the TME (<italic>e.g.,</italic> stromal and vascular cells) are thus missing. While cell-type specific markers have been identified from scATAC-Seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">K. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), not all TME-relevant cell types are covered (<italic>e.g.</italic>, lack of scATAC-Seq data from neutrophils due to extracellular traps formation). Many of these markers have also not been curated to fulfill the requirements of tools such as EPIC to quantify uncharacterized cells (<italic>i.e.</italic>, markers of a cell-type should not be accessible in other human tissues).</p>
<p>In this study, we collected ATAC-Seq data from pure cell types to identify cell-type specific marker peaks and to build reference profiles from most major non-malignant cell types typically observed in tumors. These data were integrated in the EPIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) framework to perform bulk ATAC-Seq samples deconvolution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Applied on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumor samples, the EPIC-ATAC framework showed accurate predictions of the proportions of non-malignant and malignant cells.</p>

<title>ATAC-Seq data from sorted cell populations reveal cell-type specific marker peaks and reference profiles</title>
<p>A key determinant for accurate predictions of cell-type proportions by most deconvolution tools is the availability of reliable cell-type specific markers and reference profiles. To identify robust chromatin accessibility marker peaks of cell types observed in the tumor microenvironment, we collected 564 samples of sorted cell populations from twelve studies including B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Corces <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Calderon <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">P.

For each cell type, we derived a set of stable peaks observed across samples and studies, <italic>i.e.</italic>, for each study, peaks detected in at least half of the samples were considered, and for each cell type, only peaks detected jointly in all studies were kept (see Materials and Methods, <xref rid="s5a" ref-type="sec">section 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>These peaks were then used to perform pairwise differential analysis to identify marker peaks for each cell type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, box 2). To ensure that the cell-type specific marker peaks are not accessible in other human tissues, we included in the differential analysis ATAC-Seq samples from diverse human tissues from the ENCODE data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">The ENCODE Project Consortium <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rozowsky <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). To select a sufficient number of peaks prior to peak filtering, the top 200 peaks recurrently differentially accessible across all cell-type pairs were selected as cell-type specific markers (see Materials and Methods, <xref rid="s5b" ref-type="sec">section 2</xref>). To filter out markers that could be accessible in other human cell types than those included in our reference profiles, we used the human atlas study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">K. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), which identified modules of open chromatin regions accessible in a comprehensive set of human tissues, and we excluded from our marker list the markers overlapping these modules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, box 3, see Materials and Methods <xref rid="s5b" ref-type="sec">section 2</xref>). The resulting marker peaks specific only to the immune cell types were considered for the deconvolution of PBMC samples (PBMC markers). For the deconvolution of tumor bulk samples, the lists of marker peaks specific to fibroblasts and endothelial cells were added to the PBMC markers. This extended set of markers was further refined based on the correlation patterns of the markers in tumor bulk samples from the diverse solid cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Corces <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), <italic>i.e.</italic>, markers exhibiting the highest correlation patterns in the tumor bulk samples were selected using the <italic>findCorrelation</italic> function from the caret R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kuhn, 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, box 4, see the Material and methods, <xref rid="s5b" ref-type="sec">section 2</xref>). The latter filtering ensures the relevance of the markers in the TME context since cell-type specific TME markers are expected to be correlated in tumor bulk ATAC-Seq measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Qiu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). 716 markers of immune, fibroblasts and endothelial cell types remained after the last filtering (defined as TME markers). Considering the difference in cell types and the different filtering steps applied on the PBMC and TME markers, we recommend to use the TME markers and profiles to deconvolve bulk samples from tumor samples and the PBMC markers and profiles to deconvolve PBMC samples.</p>
<p>To assess the quality and reproducibility of these markers, we first performed principal component analysis (PCA) based on each set of marker peaks. Computing silhouette coefficients based on the cell-type classification and on the study of origin showed that samples clustered by cell type and not by study of origin (averaged silhouette coefficients above 0.45 for cell type and around 0 for study of origin). The representation of the samples based on the first axes of the PCA confirmed this observation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate limited remaining batch effects after data processing and marker selection.</p>
<p>We then used the collected samples to generate chromatin accessibility profiles by computing the average of the normalized counts for each peak in each cell type as well as peak variability in each cell type (see Material and methods) since EPIC uses features variability for the estimation of the cell-type proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> represents the average chromatin accessibility of each marker peak in each cell type of the reference dataset and highlights, as expected, the cell-type specificity of the selected markers (see also Supplementary files 2 and 3), which was confirmed in independent ATAC-Seq data from sorted cells and single-cell ATAC-Seq samples from blood and diverse human tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p>

<title>Annotations of the marker peaks highlight their biological relevance</title>
<p>To characterize the different marker peaks, we annotated them using ChIPseeker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Yu, Wang and He, 2015</xref>). We observed that most of the markers are in distal and intergenic regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), which is expected considering the large proportion of distal regions in the human genome and the fact that such regions have been previously described as highly cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Corces <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). We also noticed that 7% of the PBMC and TME marker peaks are in promoter regions in contrast to 4% when considering matched genomic regions randomly selected in the set of peaks identified prior to the differential analysis (see Material and methods), which suggests enrichment in our marker peaks for important regulatory regions.</p>
<p>To assess the biological relevance of the marker peaks, we associated each marker peak to its nearest gene using ChIP-Enrich based on the “nearest transcription start site (TSS)” locus definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Welch <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) (Supplementary files 4 and 5).

<p>In each set of cell-type specific peaks, we observed an overrepresentation of chromatin binding proteins (CBPs) reported in the JASPAR2022 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Castro-Mondragon <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) (using Signac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Stuart <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) and MonaLisa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Machlab <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) for assessing the overrepresentation) and the ReMap catalog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hammal <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) (using RemapEnrich, see Material and Methods).

Some of these pathways are known to be characteristic of immune responses to inflammatory or tumoral environments. The complete list of enriched pathways is listed in the Supplementary files 6 and 7. Overall, these analyses demonstrate that the proposed cell-type specific marker peaks capture some of the known biological properties associated to each cell type.</p>

<title>EPIC-ATAC integrates the marker peaks and profiles into EPIC to perform bulk ATAC-Seq data deconvolution</title>
<p>The cell-type specific marker peaks and profiles derived from the reference samples were integrated into the EPIC deconvolution tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Racle and Gfeller, 2020</xref>). We will refer to this ATAC-Seq deconvolution framework as EPIC-ATAC. To ensure the compatibility of any input bulk ATAC-Seq dataset with the EPIC-ATAC marker peaks and reference profiles, we provide an option to lift over hg19 datasets to hg38 (using the liftOver R package) as the reference profiles are based on the hg38 reference genome. Subsequently, the features of the input bulk matrix are matched to our reference profiles’ features. To match both sets of features, we determine for each peak of the input bulk matrix the distance to the nearest peak in the reference profiles peaks. Overlapping regions are retained and the feature IDs are matched to their associated nearest peaks. If multiple features are matched to the same reference peak, the counts are summed. Before the estimation of the cell-type proportions, we transform the data following an approach similar to the transcripts per million (TPM) transformation which has been shown to be appropriate to estimate cell fractions from bulk mixtures in RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sturm <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). We normalize the ATAC-Seq counts by dividing counts by the peak lengths as well as samples depth and rescaling counts so that the counts of each sample sum to 10<sup>6</sup>. In RNA-Seq based deconvolution, EPIC uses an estimation of the amount of mRNA in each reference cell type to derive cell proportions while correcting for cell-type-specific mRNA bias. For the ATAC-Seq based deconvolution these values were set to 1 to give similar weights to all cell-types quantifications. Indeed ATAC-Seq measures signal at the DNA level, hence the quantity of DNA within each reference cell type is similar.</p>

<title>EPIC-ATAC accurately estimates immune cell fractions in PBMC ATAC-Seq samples</title>
<p>To test the accuracy of EPIC-ATAC predictions, we first collected PBMCs from five healthy donors. For each donor, half of the cells was used to generate a bulk ATAC-Seq dataset and the other half was used to determine the cellular composition of each sample, <italic>i.e.,</italic> the proportions of monocytes, B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells, by multiparametric flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, see Materials and methods). We then applied EPIC-ATAC to the bulk ATAC-Seq data. The predicted cell fractions are consistent with the cell fractions obtained by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.10). However, the accuracy of the estimations is variable depending on the samples. In particular, one sample (<italic>Sample4</italic>, star shape on <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) exhibits larger discrepancies between EPIC-ATAC predictions and the ground truth. Visualizing our marker peaks in the five PBMC samples (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>) showed that this sample might be an outlier considering that its cellular composition is similar to that of Samples 2 and 5 but this sample shows particularly high ATAC-Seq accessibility at the monocytes and dendritic marker peaks. This could explain why EPIC-ATAC overestimates the proportions of the two populations in this case.</p>

<p>As a second validation, we applied EPIC-ATAC to pseudo-bulk PBMC samples (referred to as the PBMC pseudobulk dataset), generated using three publicly available PBMC scATAC-Seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Granja <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Satpathy <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">10x Genomics, 2021</xref>) (see Material and methods). A high correlation (0.91) between EPIC-ATAC predictions and true cell-type proportions and a low RMSE (0.05) were observed for this dataset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>The accuracy of the predictions obtained with EPIC-ATAC was then compared with the accuracy of other deconvolution approaches which could be used with our reference profiles and marker peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>). To this end, we considered both the DeconPeaker method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">H. Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) originally developed for bulk ATAC-Seq as well as several algorithms developed for bulk RNA-Seq (CIBERSORTx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Newman <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), quanTIseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Finotello <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), ABIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Monaco <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), and MCPcounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Becht <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>)). To enable meaningful comparison across the cell types considered in this work and use the method initially developed for bulk RNA-Seq deconvolution, the marker peaks and profiles derived in this work were used in each of these methods (See Material and methods, <xref rid="s6" ref-type="sec">section 4</xref>). As in EPIC-ATAC, the features of the input bulk matrices were matched to our reference profiles’ features. Having reference profiles/markers and an ATAC-Seq bulk query with matched features was the only requirement of the different deconvolution models to run on ATAC-Seq data with the default methods parameters. DeconPeaker and CIBERSORTx also include the option to define cell-type specific markers and profiles from a set of reference samples. We thus additionally fed our ATAC-Seq samples collection to both algorithms and used the resulting profiles and marker peaks to perform bulk ATAC-Seq deconvolution. The resulting predictions are referred to as DeconPeaker-Custom and CIBERSORTx-Custom.</p>
<p>Many tools displayed high correlation and low RMSE values, similar to those of EPIC-ATAC, and no single tool consistently outperformed the others (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>). The fact that our marker peaks and reference profiles could be used with EPIC-ATAC and other existing tools demonstrates their broad applicability.</p>

<title>EPIC-ATAC accurately predicts fractions of cancer and non-malignant cells in tumor samples</title>
<p>We evaluated the ability of the EPIC-ATAC framework to predict not only immune and stromal cells proportions but also the proportion of cells for which reference profiles are not available (<italic>i.e.,</italic> uncharacterized cells). For this purpose, we considered two previously published scATAC-Seq datasets containing basal cell carcinoma and gynecological cancer samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Satpathy <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Regner <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) as well as the samples from the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) single-cell multiome dataset composed of samples from diverse cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Terekhanova <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). For each dataset, we generated pseudobulks by averaging the chromatin accessibility signal across all cells of each sample (see Material and methods, <xref rid="s5c" ref-type="sec">section 3</xref>). Applying EPIC-ATAC to each dataset shows that this framework can simultaneously predict the proportions of both uncharacterized cells and immune, stromal and vascular cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In basal cell carcinoma and gynecological cancer samples, the proportion of uncharacterized cells can be seen as a proxy of the proportion of cancer cells. In the HTAN dataset, some of the samples also contain cell-types that are neither immune, fibroblasts or endothelial cells nor malignant cells. Hence, the uncharacterized cells in these samples group cancer and normal cells from the tumor site. EPIC-ATAC, in this context, was able to not only estimate the proportion of cell types included in the TME reference profiles but also the proportion of uncharacterized cells in most of the cancer types (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>As for the PBMC datasets, we compared EPIC-ATAC performances to other existing deconvolution tools (see Materials and methods, <xref rid="s6" ref-type="sec">section 4</xref>). For each dataset, EPIC-ATAC led to the highest performances and was the only method to accurately predict the proportion of uncharacterized cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs4-3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="figs4-4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Although quanTIseq also allows users to perform such predictions, the method resulted in lower correlation and higher RMSE values when comparing the estimated and true proportions of the uncharacterized cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs4-4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>
<p>In the EPIC-ATAC and quanTIseq frameworks, predictions correspond to absolute cell-type fractions which include the proportion of uncharacterized cells, <italic>i.e.,</italic> proportions of all cells present in the bulk, while the estimations obtained from the other tools correspond to relative cell fractions, <italic>i.e.,</italic> proportions of cells present in the reference profiles (CIBERSORTx, DeconPeaker) or to scores with arbitrary units (ABIS, MCPcounter) without considering the presence of uncharacterized cells. For the latter group of tools, we fixed the uncharacterized cells estimations to 0. This approach provides a clear and significant advantage to EPIC-ATAC and to quanTIseq (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). For this reason, we conducted a second benchmark excluding the predictions of uncharacterized cell fractions and rescaling both estimations and true proportions to sum to 1 (see Material and methods, <xref rid="s6" ref-type="sec">section 4</xref>). EPIC-ATAC outperformed most of the other methods also when excluding the uncharacterized cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs4-3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="figs4-4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

<title>Accuracy of ATAC-Seq deconvolution is determined by the abundance and specificity of each cell type</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of cell type abundance on the accuracy of ATAC-Seq deconvolution, we evaluated EPIC-ATAC predictions in each major cell type separately in the different benchmarking datasets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). NK cells, endothelial cells, neutrophils or dendritic cells showed lower correlation values. These values can be explained by the fact that these cell types are low-abundant in our benchmarking datasets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). For the endothelial cells and dendritic cells, the RMSE values associated to these cell types remain low. This suggests that while the predictions of EPIC-ATAC might not be precise enough to compare these cell-type proportions between different samples, the cell-type quantification within each sample is reliable. For the NK cells and the neutrophils, we observed more variability with higher RMSE values in some datasets which suggests that the markers and profiles for these cell types might be improved. <xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs5-2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> detail the performances of each tool when considering each cell type separately in the PBMC and the cancer datasets.

<p>To explore the accuracy of ATAC-Seq deconvolution for more related cell types, we evaluated whether EPIC-ATAC could predict the proportions of T-cell subtypes. To this end, we considered naive and non-naive CD8+ as well as naive, helper/memory and regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs). We redefined our list of cell-type specific marker peaks and reference profiles including also these five T-cell subtypes (Supplementary files 8-9, <xref rid="figs5-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3A</xref>) and observed that the markers were conserved in external data (<xref rid="figs5-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3B</xref>). The annotations of the markers associated to the T-cell subtypes are available in Supplementary files 10-13.</p>
<p>We capitalized on the more detailed cell-type annotation of the PBMC datasets as well as the basal cell carcinoma dataset to evaluate the EPIC-ATAC predictions of cell-subtype fractions using these updated markers and profiles. Overall, the correlations observed between the predictions and true proportions of T cells decreased when considering T-cell subtypes rather than CD4+ and CD8+ cell types only (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In particular, low accuracies were obtained for helper/memory CD4+ and naive T-cell subtypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Similar results were obtained using other deconvolution tools (<xref rid="figs5-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 4</xref>).</p>

<title>EPIC-ATAC accurately infers the immune contexture in a bulk ATAC-Seq breast cancer cohort</title>
<p>We applied EPIC-ATAC to a breast cancer cohort of 42 breast ATAC-Seq samples including samples from two breast cancer subtypes, <italic>i.e.,</italic> 35 oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer samples and 7 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kumegawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). No cell sorting was performed in parallel to the chromatin accessibility sequencing. For this reason, the authors used a set of cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs) identified in scATAC-Seq data from similar breast cancer samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kumegawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) and estimated the amount of infiltration of each cell type by averaging the ATAC-Seq signal of each set of cell-type-specific CREs in their samples. We used EPIC-ATAC to estimate the proportions of different cell types of the TME. These predictions were then compared to the metric used by Kumegawa and colleagues in their study to infer levels of infiltration. A high correlation between the two metrics was observed for each cell type (Pearson’s correlation coefficient from 0.5 for myeloid cells to 0.94 for T cells, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

<title>EPIC-ATAC and EPIC RNA-seq based deconvolution have similar accuracy and can complement each other</title>
<p>We compared the accuracy of EPIC when applied on ATAC-Seq data and on RNA-Seq data. For this purpose, we first used single-cell multiomic data which provides for each cell both its chromatin accessibility profile and its gene expression profile. These data were retrieved from the 10X multiome PBMC dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">10x Genomics, 2021</xref>) and the HTAN dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Terekhanova <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) (see Material and methods <xref rid="s5c" ref-type="sec">section 3</xref>). We used EPIC-ATAC to perform ATAC-Seq based deconvolution on the chromatin accessibility levels of the peaks and the original EPIC tool to perform standard RNA-seq deconvolution on the gene expression levels. ATAC-Seq peaks can also be aggregated into gene activity (GA) variables as proxy for gene expression, based on peak distances to each gene. We applied the GA transformation to the pseudobulk data and performed GA-based RNA deconvolution using the original EPIC tool (See Material and methods <xref rid="s6a" ref-type="sec">section 5</xref>). <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A and B</xref> show that EPIC-ATAC performs similarly to the EPIC RNA-seq based deconvolution and outperforms the GA-based RNA deconvolution.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bulk chromatin accessibility profiling of biological tissues like tumors represents a reliable and affordable technology to map the activity of gene regulatory elements across multiple samples in different conditions. Here, we collected ATAC-Seq data from pure cell populations covering major immune and non-immune cell types found in the tumor micro-environment. This enabled us to identify reliable cell-type specific marker peaks and chromatin accessibility profiles for both PBMC and solid tumor sample deconvolution. We integrated these data in the EPIC deconvolution framework to accurately predict the fraction of both malignant and non-malignant cell types from bulk tumor ATAC-Seq samples.</p>
<p>Although not tested in this work, the TME marker peaks and profiles could be used on normal tissues where immune cells are expected to be present. In cases where specific cell types are expected in a sample but are not part of our list of reference profiles (<italic>e.g.,</italic> neuronal cells in brain tumors or tissues other than human PBMCs or tumor samples), custom marker peaks and reference profiles can be provided to EPIC-ATAC to perform cell-type deconvolution. To this end, users should select markers that are cell-type specific, which could be identified using pairwise differential analysis performed on ATAC-Seq data from sorted cells from the populations of interest, following the approach developed in this work (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, see Code availability).</p>
<p>Solid tumors contain large and heterogeneous fractions of cancer cells for which it is challenging to build reference profiles. We show that the EPIC-ATAC framework, in contrast to other existing tools, allows users to accurately predict the proportion of cells not included in the reference profiles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and Supplementary Figure 4). These uncharacterized cells can include cancer cells but also other non-malignant cells. Since the major cell types composing TMEs were included in our reference profiles, the proportion of uncharacterized cells approximates the proportion of the cancer cells in most cases.</p>
<p>For our benchmarking, we provided our reference profiles and markers to each tool that do not provide the option to automatically build new profiles from a set of reference samples. While this allowed us to run deconvolution tools previously developed on RNA-Seq data with their default parameters, we cannot exclude that hyper parametrization could improve the performance of these tools, and we anticipate that the cell-type specific ATAC-Seq profiles and markers curated in this work could help improving bulk ATAC-Seq deconvolution with different tools. Also, for RNA-Seq data deconvolution, some of the methods followed specific pre-processing steps, <italic>e.g.,</italic> the quanTIseq framework removes a manually curated list of noisy genes as well as aberrant immune genes identified in the TCGA data, and ABIS uses immune-specific housekeeping genes. Additional filtering could be explored to improve the performance of deconvolution tools in the context of ATAC-Seq data.</p>
<p>The pseudobulk approach provides unique opportunities to design benchmarks with known cell-type proportions but also comes with some limitations. Indeed, pseudobulks are generated from single-cell data which are noisy and whose cell-type annotation is challenging in particular for closely related cell types. These limitations might lead to chromatin accessibility profiles that deviate from true bulk data and errors in the true cell-type proportions. The evaluation of our method on true bulk ATAC-Seq samples from PBMCs and breast cancer samples supported the accuracy of EPIC-ATAC to deconvolve bulk ATAC-Seq data. In the breast cancer application, the observation of similar immune compositions in TNBC and ER+/HER2- samples as the ones identified in the original paper (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) highlighted that the use of scATAC-Seq data, which are not always available for all cancer types, could be avoided for the estimation of different cell-type infiltration in bulk samples.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the EPIC-ATAC deconvolution resulted in an average absolute error of 8% across cell types. This number is consistent with previous observations in RNA-Seq data deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Considering this uncertainty, the quantification of low frequency populations remains challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jin and Liu, 2021</xref>). Comparing such estimations across samples should be performed with care due to the uncertainty of the predictions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>Another limitation of cell-type deconvolution is often reached when closely related cell types are considered. In the reference-based methods used in this study, this limit was reached when considering T-cell subtypes in the reference profiles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B-C</xref> and Supplementary Figure 12). We thus recommend to use the EPIC-ATAC framework with the markers and reference profiles based on the major cell-type populations. We additionally provide the marker peaks of the T-cell subtypes which could be used to build cell-type specific chromatin accessibility signatures or perform “peak set enrichment analysis” similarly to gene set enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Subramanian <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Such an application could be useful for the annotation of scATAC-Seq data, which often relies on matched RNA-Seq data and for which there is a lack of markers at the peak level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The comparison of EPIC-ATAC applied on ATAC-Seq data with EPIC applied on RNA-Seq data has shown that both modalities led to similar performances and that they could complement each other. Another modality that has been frequently used in the context of bulk sample deconvolution is methylation. Methylation profiling techniques such as methylation arrays are cost effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kaur <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) and DNA methylation signal is highly cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kaur <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Loyfer <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Considering that methylation and chromatin accessibility measure different features of the epigenome, additional analyses comparing and/or complementing ATAC-seq based deconvolution with methylation-based deconvolution could be of interest as future datasets profiling both modalities in the same samples become available.</p>
<p>Another possible application of our marker peaks relies on their annotation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, Supplementary files 4-5), which could be used to expand the list of genes and CBPs associated to each cell type or subtype. For example, the neutrophils marker peaks were enriched for motifs of TFs such as SPI1 (Supplementary file 4), which was not listed in the neutrophil genes in the databases used for annotation but has been reported in previous studies as involved in neutrophils development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Watt <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The annotations related to the set of major cell types and T-cell subtypes are provided in Supplementary files 4-5 and 10-11. Finally, the annotation of marker peaks highlighted pathways involved in immune responses to tumoral environments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Examples of these pathways are the toll-like receptor signaling pathway involved in pathogen-associated and recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns in diverse cell types including B and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Geng <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Javaid and Choi, 2020</xref>), glucan metabolic processes which are known to be related to trained immunity which can lead to anti-tumor phenotype in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kalafati <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) or the Fc-receptor signaling observed in NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bonnema <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sanseviero, 2019</xref>). These observations suggest that our marker peaks contain regulatory regions not only specific to cell types but also adapted to the biological context of solid tumors.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this work, we identified biologically relevant cell-type specific chromatin accessibility markers and profiles for most non-malignant cell types frequently observed in the tumor micro-environment. We capitalized on these markers and profiles to predict cell-type proportions from bulk PBMC and solid tumor ATAC-Seq data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/GfellerLab/EPIC-ATAC">https://github.com/GfellerLab/EPIC-ATAC</ext-link>). Evaluated on diverse tissues, EPIC-ATAC shows reliable predictions of immune, stromal, vascular and cancer cell proportions. With the expected increase of ATAC-Seq studies in cancer, the EPIC-ATAC framework will enable researchers to deconvolve bulk ATAC-Seq data from tumor samples to support the analysis of regulatory processes underlying tumor development, and correlate the TME composition with clinical variables.</p>

The list of the samples and their associated metadata (including cell types and accession number of the study of origin) is provided in Supplementary file 1.

After alignment, reads mapping on chromosome M were excluded. TSS enrichment scores were computed for each sample and used to filter out samples with low quality (criteria of exclusion: TSS score &lt; 5) (See Supplementary file 1 containing the TSS score of each sample). 789 samples (including 564 from our ten reference cell-types) had a TSS score &gt; 5.</p>

<title>Generation of a consensus set of peaks</title>
<p>Peak calling was performed in each sample individually. Peaks were then iteratively collapsed to generate a set of reproducible peaks.

A first peaks collapse was performed at the level of each study of origin, <italic>i.e.,</italic> if peaks identified in distinct samples overlapped (minimum overlap of 1bp between peaks), only the peak with the highest peak calling score was kept.

After this first selection, a second round of peaks collapse was performed at the cell-type level to limit batch effects in downstream analyses. For each cell type, only peaks detected in all the studies of origin were considered. The final list of peaks was then generated by merging each set of reproducible peaks. Peaks located on chromosome Y were excluded from the rest of the analyses.

<p>To identify potential batch effect issues, we run principal component analysis (PCA) based on the cell-type specific peaks after normalizing ATAC-Seq counts using full quantile normalization (FQ-FQ) implemented in the EDASeq R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Risso <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) to correct for depth and GC biases. These data were used to visualize the data in three dimensions using the first axes of the PCA based on the PBMC and TME markers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). We also used the ten first principal components to evaluate distances between samples and compute silhouette coefficients based on the cell type and study of origin classifications as well as to compute the ARI metric comparing the cell-type annotation and the clustering obtained using model based clustering.</p>

<title>Building the reference profiles</title>
<p>It has been previously demonstrated in the context of RNA-Seq based deconvolution approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Racle <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sturm <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) that the transcripts per million (TPM) transformation is appropriate to estimate cell fractions from bulk mixtures. We thus normalized the ATAC-Seq counts of the reference samples using a TPM-like transformation, <italic>i.e.,</italic> dividing counts by peak length, correcting samples counts for depth and rescaling counts so that the counts of each sample sum to 10<sup>6</sup>. We then computed for each peak the median of the TPM-like counts across all samples from each cell type to build the reference profiles of the ten cell types considered in the EPIC-ATAC framework (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In the EPIC algorithm, weights reflecting the variability of each feature of the reference profile can be considered in the constrained least square optimization. We thus also computed the inter-quartile range of the TPM-like counts for each feature in each cell type. Two ATAC-Seq reference profiles are available in the EPIC-ATAC framework: (i) a reference profile containing profiles for B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK, monocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils to deconvolve PBMC samples, and (ii) a reference profile containing profiles for B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts and endothelial cells to deconvolve tumor samples. The reference profiles are available in the EPICATAC R package and the reference profiles restricted to our cell-type specific marker peaks are available in the Supplementary files 2 and 3.</p>

<title>Assessing the reproducibility of the marker peaks signal in independent samples</title>
<p>We evaluated the chromatin accessibility level of the marker peaks in samples that were not included in the peak calling step. Firstly, we considered samples from two independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Ucar <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carvalho <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) providing pure ATAC-Seq data for five immune cell types (<italic>i.e.,</italic> B, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, Monocytes, Macrophages) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). To consider the other cell types, samples that were excluded from the reference dataset due to a low TSS enrichment score were also considered in this validation dataset (Supplementary file 1). Secondly, we collected the data from a single-cell atlas chromatin accessibility from human tissues and considered the cell types included in our reference data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">K. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). We used the cell-type annotations provided in the original study (GEO accession number: GSE184462). The Signac R package ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Stuart <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), 1.9.0) was used to extract fragments counts for each cell and each marker peak and the ATAC-Seq signal of each marker peak was averaged across all cells of each cell type.</p>

<sec id="s5b6">
<title>Annotation of the marker peaks</title>
<p>The cell-type specific markers were annotated using ChIPseeker R package ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Yu, Wang and He, 2015</xref>), version 1.34.1) and the annotation from <italic>TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene</italic> in R to identify the regions in which the marker peaks are (<italic>i.e.,</italic> promoter, intronic regions, etc.) and ChIP-Enrich to associate each peak to the nearest gene TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Welch <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The nearest genes identified were then compared to cell-type marker genes listed in the PanglaoDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Franzén, Gan and Björkegren, 2019</xref>) and CellMarker databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hu <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). PanglaoDB provides an online interface to explore a large collection on single-cell RNA-Seq data as well as a community-curated list of cell-type marker genes. CellMarker is a database providing a large set of curated cell-type markers for more than 400 cell types in human tissues retrieved from a large collection of single-cell studies and flow cytometry, immunostaining or experimental studies. ChIP-Enrich was also used to perform gene set enrichment and identify for each set of cell-type specific peaks potential biological pathways regulated by the marker peaks. The enrichment analysis was performed using the <italic>chipenrich</italic> function (<italic>genesets = &quot;GOBP&quot;, locusdef = &quot;nearest_tss&quot;</italic>) from the chipenrich R package (v2.22.0).</p>
<p>Chromatin accessibility peaks can also be annotated for chromatin binding proteins (CBPs) such as transcription factors (TFs), whose potential binding in the peak region is reported in databases. In our study we chose the JASPAR2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Castro-Mondragon <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) database and the ReMap database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hammal <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the JASPAR2022 database, we assessed, for each cell type, whether the cell-type specific marker peaks were enriched in specific TFs motifs using two TFs enrichment analysis frameworks: Signac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Stuart <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) and MonaLisa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Machlab <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). For the MonaLisa analysis, the cell-types specific markers peaks were categorized in bins of sequences, one bin per cell type (use of the <italic>calcBinnedMotifEnrR</italic> function). To test for an enrichment of motifs, the sequences of each bin were compared to a set of background peaks with similar average size and GC composition obtained by randomly sampling regions in all the peaks identified from the reference dataset. The enrichment test was based on a binomial test. For the Signac analysis, we used the <italic>FindMotif</italic> function to identify over-represented TF motifs in each set of cell-type specific marker peaks (query). This function used a hypergeometric test to compare the number of query peaks containing the motif with the total number of peaks containing the motif in the background regions (matched to have similar GC content, region length and dinucleotide frequencies as the query regions), corresponding in our case to the peaks called in the reference dataset.</p>
<p>The ReMap database associates chromatin binding proteins (CBPs), including TFs, transcriptional coactivators and chromatin-remodeling factors, to their DNA binding regions based on DNA-binding experiments such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). For each association of a CBP to its binding region, the cell type in which the binding has been observed is reported in the ReMap database (biotype). We used the ReMapEnrich R package (version 0.99) to test if the cell-type specific marker peaks are significantly enriched in CBPs-binding regions listed in the ReMap 2022 catalog. We considered the non-redundant peaks catalog from ReMmap 2022, containing non-redundant binding regions for each CBP in each biotype. Similarly to the previously mentioned enrichment methods, we chose the consensus peaks called in the reference samples as universe for the enrichment test. Note that, for each cell type, an enrichment was retained only if the biotype in which the CBP-regions were identified matched the correct cell-type.</p>

<title>ATAC-Seq pseudobulk data from PBMCs and cancer samples</title>
<p>To evaluate the accuracy of our ATAC-Seq deconvolution framework, we generated pseudo-bulk datasets from 6 single-cell datasets:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>PBMC pseudobulk dataset:</bold> combination of three single-cell datasets for PBMCs.
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Dataset 1 corresponds to a scATAC-Seq dataset obtained from Satpathy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Satpathy <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) (GEO accession number: GSE129785). This dataset contains FACS-sorted populations of PBMCs. Since the cells of some cell types came from a unique donor, all the cells of this dataset were aggregated to form one pseudobulk. Ground truth cell fractions were obtained by dividing the number of cells in each cell type by the total number of cells.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dataset 2 (included in the PBMC pseudobulk dataset) was retrieved from Granja <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Granja <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) (GEO accession number GSE139369). B cells, monocytes, dendritic, CD8+, CD4+ T, NK cells, neutrophils from healthy donors were considered. The neutrophil cells came from a single donor. As for dataset 1, we thus aggregated all the cells to generate one pseudobulk. Ground truth cell fractions were obtained by dividing the number of cells in each cell type by the total number of cells.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dataset 3 (included in the PBMC pseudobulk dataset) corresponds to the 10X multiome dataset of PBMC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">10x Genomics, 2021</xref>). Since these data come from one donor, one pseudobulk sample was generated for this dataset. The pseudobulk was generated by averaging the ATAC-Seq signal from all cells from the following cell types: B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, Dendritic cells and monocytes.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p><bold>Basal cell carcinoma dataset:</bold> obtained from the study of Satpathy <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Satpathy <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). This dataset is a scATAC-Seq dataset composed of 13 basal cell carcinoma samples composed of immune (B cells, plasma cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, myeloid cells), stromal (endothelial and fibroblasts) and cancer cells. Plasma cells and cancer cells were both considered as uncharacterized cells (<italic>i.e.,</italic> cell types not included in the reference profiles). Cell annotations were retrieved from the original study.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Gynecological cancer dataset:</bold> obtained from the study of Regner <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Regner <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) (GEO accession number GSE173682). In this study, the authors performed scATAC-Seq on 11 gynecological cancer samples from two tumor sites (<italic>i.e.,</italic> endometrium and ovary) and composed of immune (B cells, NK and T cells grouped under the same cell-type annotation, macrophages, mast cells), stromal (fibroblast, endothelial, smooth muscle) and cancer cells. Mast cells, smooth muscle and cancer cells were considered as uncharacterized cells. Cell annotations were retrieved from the original study.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>HTAN:</bold> obtained from the study of Terekhanova et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Terekhanova <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) from the HTAN DCC Portal. In this study the authors generated an atlas of single-cell multiomic data (RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq profiling for the same cell) for diverse cancer types. We considered the annotation provided by the HTAN consortium. This cell annotation was composed of immune cells (B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages), fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cancer cells and normal cells. The two latter cell groups were considered as part of the uncharacterized cell population.</p></list-item>
</list>
For Basal cell carcinoma, Gynecological cancer and the HTAN datasets, one pseudobulk per sample was generated and ground truth cell fractions were obtained for each sample by dividing the number of cells in each cell type by the total number of cells in the sample.</p>
<p>For each dataset, raw fragments files were downloaded from the respective GEO accession numbers and data were preprocessed using ArchR ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Granja <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), ArchR R package 1.0.2). Cells with TSS score below four were removed. Doublets removal was performed using the <italic>doubletsRemoval</italic> function from ArchR. To match as much as possible real bulk ATAC-seq data processing, peak calling was not performed on each cell type or cell cluster as usually done in scATAC-Seq studies but using all cells for each dataset from the PBMC pseudobulk data or grouping cells by sample for the Basal cell carcinoma, Gynecological cancer and HTAN datasets. Peak calling was performed using MACS2 within the ArchR framework. Fragments counts were extracted using ArchR for each peak called to generate single-cell peak counts matrices. Note that for the HTAN dataset, in some cancer types, less than 15 peaks were in common with our reference profiles peaks. These cancer types were thus not considered in the analysis (GBM, UCEC, CEAD). These matrices were normalized using a TPM-like transformation, <italic>i.e.,</italic> dividing counts by peak length and correcting samples counts for depth. Finally, for each peak, the average of the normalized counts was computed across all the cells for each dataset from the PBMC pseudobulk data and across all the cells of each sample for the Basal cell carcinoma, Gynecological cancer and HTAN datasets. Averaged data were then rescaled so that the sum of counts of each sample sum to 10<sup>6</sup>.</p>

<label>4-</label><title>Benchmarking of the EPIC-ATAC framework against other existing deconvolution tools</title>
<p>The performances of the EPIC-ATAC framework were benchmarked against the following deconvolution tools:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>quanTIseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Finotello <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) is a deconvolution tool using constrained least square regression to deconvolve RNA-Seq bulk samples. No reference profiles are available in this framework to perform ATAC-Seq deconvolution and quanTIseq does not provide the option to automatically build reference profiles from pure bulk samples. quanTIseq was thus run using the reference profiles derived in this work for the EPIC-ATAC framework and the <italic>quanTIseq</italic> function from the quantiseqr R package. Note that the correction for cell-type-specific mRNA content bias was disabled for ATAC-Seq data deconvolution (parameters used in quantiseqr: scaling set to 1 for all cell types and method set to &quot;lsei&quot;).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>DeconPeaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">H. Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) relies on SIMPLS, a variant of partial least square regression to perform bulk RNA-Seq and bulk ATAC-Seq deconvolution. ATAC-Seq reference profiles are available in this deconvolution framework however not all cell types considered in the EPIC-ATAC framework are included in the DeconPeaker reference profiles. This tool was thus run using different reference profiles: (i) the reference profiles derived in this work for the EPIC-ATAC framework (corresponds to “DeconPeaker” or “DeconPeaker_ourmarkers” in our analyses), and (ii) reference profiles automatically generated by DeconPeaker from the sorted reference samples collected in this work (corresponds to “DeconPeaker_Custom” in our analyses). The results of DeconPeaker obtained using its original markers and profiles are also provided for the cell types in common with the cell types considered in this work in <xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs5-2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Deconvolution was run using the deconvolution module deconPeaker (using findctsps with the following parameter: --lib-strategy=ATAC-Seq). DeconPeaker outputs cell-type proportions relative to the total amount of cells from the reference cell types.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CIBERSORTx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Newman <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) is a deconvolution algorithm based on linear support vector regression. CIBERSORTx does not provide ATAC-Seq reference profiles, however it is possible to automatically generate new profiles from a set of pure bulk samples. This tool was thus run using different reference profiles: i) the reference profiles derived in this work for the EPIC-ATAC framework (corresponds to “CIBERSORTx” or “CIBERSORTx_ourMarkers” in our analyses), and ii) reference profiles automatically generated by CIBERSORTx from the sorted reference samples collected in this work (corresponds to “CIBERSORTx_Custom” in our analyses). To run CIBERSORTx, we used the docker container provided by the authors of CIBERSORTx on their website. The algorithm was run using the default options (i.e --absolute FALSE, --rmbatchBmode FALSE and –rmbatchSmode FALSE), which results in cell-type proportions relative to the total amount of cells from the reference cell types.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ABIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Monaco <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) uses robust linear modeling to estimate cell-type proportions in bulk RNA-Seq samples. No ATAC-Seq reference profiles are available in the deconvolution framework. ABIS was run using the EPIC-ATAC reference profiles by using the <italic>rlm</italic> function from the MASS R package (as performed in the deconvolute_abis function from the immunedeconv R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sturm <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>)) to quantify each cell type from the reference profiles. The cell-types quantifications returned by this approach are in arbitrary units. To compare the estimations and the true cell proportions, we scaled the estimations of each sample between 0 and 1 to obtained relative proportions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>MCPcounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Becht <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>): MCPcounter returns scores instead of cell type proportions.</p></list-item>
</list>
The scores were obtained using the <italic>appendSignatures</italic> function from the MCPcounter R package by providing the list of marker peaks specific to each cell type. The cell-type scores are not comparable between cell type, MCPcounter was thus included only in the evaluation of the performances in each cell type separately.</p>
<p>For all the tools, TPM-like data were used as input bulk samples for the deconvolution.</p>
<p>Since CIBERSORTx, ABIS and DeconPeaker do not predict proportions of uncharacterized cells, we performed two benchmarking analyses: (i) including all cell types and (ii) excluding the cell types that are absent from the reference profiles (uncharacterized cells) and rescaling the estimated and true proportions of the immune cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts so that their sum equals 1.</p>

<p>100 pseudobulks were generated from the 10X PBMC multiome dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">10x Genomics, 2021</xref>) based on 3000 cells for each pseudobulk. Cell fractions were defined using the <italic>rdirichlet</italic> function from the <italic>gtools</italic> R package. We also considered pseudobulks built from the HTAN datasets by averaging the signal in all cells belonging to a sample. Three sets of features were extracted from the data, <italic>i.e.,</italic> gene expression features extracted from the RNA-Seq layer, ATAC-Seq peaks and gene activity derived from the ATAC-Seq layer. The same cells were considered for each modality.</p>
<p>Gene activity features were extracted from the single-cell data using ArchR (1.0.2), which considers distal elements and adjusts for large differences in gene size in the gene activity score calculation. Gene activity pseudobulks were built by averaging the gene activity scores across all cells belonging to the pseudobulk. For ATAC-Seq pseudobulk, peaks called using ArchR on all cells form the single-cell ATAC data were considered (see the method section “ATAC-Seq pseudobulk data from PBMCs and cancer samples”) and counts were averaged across all cells of each pseudobulk. For RNA-Seq pseudobulks, counts were also averaged across all cells of each pseudobulk. All aggregated data were depth normalized across each features to 10<sup>6</sup>. Cell-type deconvolution was performed on each pseudobulk using EPIC-ATAC on the peak matrix using our ATAC-Seq marker peaks and reference profiles. The RNA-Seq and gene activity pseudobulks were deconvolved with EPIC.</p>
<p>Bulk ATAC-Seq samples from a PBMC cohort were also obtained from Morandini <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Morandini <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>).

The ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq raw counts were obtained from GEO using the following GEO accession numbers: GSE193140 and GSE193141. As for the previously mentioned datasets, raw counts were normalized using the TPM-like transformation prior to bulk deconvolution. The flow cytometry data were obtained from the supplementary file 7 from the original publication and the data were rescaled as follows: CD4+ and CD8+ T cells proportions were rescaled to sum up to the proportion of T cells and the T cells, B cells and NK cells proportions were rescaled to sum up to the proportion of lymphocytes. All proportions were then rescaled to sum up to 1. EPIC-ATAC was applied on the ATAC-Seq data and EPIC to the RNA-Seq data and the performances of each set of predictions were compared to each other.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Building upon their famous tool for the deconvolution of human transcriptomics data (EPIC), Gabriel et al. implemented a new methodology for the quantification of the cellular composition of samples profiled with Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq). To build a signature for ATAC-seq deconvolution, they first created a compendium of ATAC-seq data and derived chromatin accessibility marker peaks and reference profiles for 12 cell types, encompassing immune cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Then, they coupled this novel signature with the EPIC deconvolution framework based on constrained least-square regression to derive a dedicated tool called EPIC-ATAC. The method was then assessed using real and pseudo-bulk ATAC-seq data from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and, finally, applied to ATAC-seq data from breast cancer tumors to show it accurately quantifies their immune contexture.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the work is of very high quality. The proposed tool is timely; its implementation, characterization, and validation are based on rigorous methodologies and results in robust estimates. The newly-generated, validation data and the code are publicly available and well-documented. Therefore, I believe this work and the associated resources will greatly benefit the scientific community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the benchmarking analysis, EPIC-ATAC was compared also to deconvolution methods that were originally developed for transcriptomics and not for ATAC-seq data. However, the authors described in detail the specific settings used to analyze this different data modality as robustly as possible, and they discussed possible limitations and ideas for future improvement.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript expands the current bulk sequencing data deconvolution toolkit to include ATAC-seq. The EPIC-ATAC tool successfully predicts accurate proportions of immune cells in bulk tumour samples and EPIC-ATAC seems to perform well in benchmarking analyses. The authors achieve their aim of developing a new bulk ATAC-seq deconvolution tool.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript describes simple and understandable experiments to demonstrate the accuracy of EPIC-ATAC. They have also been incredibly thorough with their reference dataset collections and have been robust in their benchmarking endeavours and measured EPIC-ATAC against multiple datasets and tools. This tool will be valuable to the community it serves.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I praise the authors for their impressive work; all my major concerns have been addressed. I believe the revised article is much stronger and will surely raise the interest of a broad readership.</p>
<p>I list in the following a few minor points that the authors might want to consider when finalizing the work:</p>
<p>- It might be helpful for the reader to know if EPIC-ATAC can also be used on tissues different from tumors and PBMC/blood, and how (i.e. which reference should they use).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In the discussion, we have clarified this point as follows:</p>
<p>“Although not tested in this work, the TME marker peaks and profiles could be used on normal tissues where immune cells are expected to be present. In cases where specific cell types are expected in a sample but are not part of our list of reference profiles (e.g., neuronal cells in brain tumors or tissues other than human PBMCs or tumor samples), custom marker peaks and reference profiles can be provided to EPIC-ATAC to perform cell-type deconvolution. To this end, users should select markers that are cell-type specific, which could be identified using pairwise differential analysis performed on ATAC-Seq data from sorted cells from the populations of interest, following the approach developed in this work (Figure 1, see Code availability).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- In Fig 2 the numbers are hard to read as they are too close or overlapping.We have updated Figure 2 to avoid the overlap between the numbers.</p>
<p>- In Fig 5 I see some squared around the sub-panels, but it might be due to the PDF compression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not see these squares on the Figure 5 but have seen such squares on Figure 1. We have checked that all the PDF files uploaded on the eLife submission system do not contain the previously mentioned squares.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- In the Introduction, some &quot;deconvolution concepts&quot; are introduced (e.g. Line 63-65), but not explained/illustrated. It might be helpful to refer to a &quot;didactic&quot; review.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added two references to these sentences in the introduction:</p>
<p>“As described in more details elsewhere (Avila Cobos et al., 2018; Sturm et al., 2019), many of these tools model bulk data as a mixture of reference profiles either coming from purified cell populations or inferred from single-cell genomic data for each cell type.”</p>
