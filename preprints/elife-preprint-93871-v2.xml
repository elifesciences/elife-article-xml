<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Secreted chemokines form concentration gradients in target tissues to control migratory directions and patterns of immune cells in response to inflammatory stimulation; however, how the gradients are formed is much debated. Heparan sulfate (HS) binds to chemokines and modulates their activities. In this study, we investigated the roles of HS in the gradient formation and chemoattractant activity of CCL5 that is known to bind to HS. CCL5 and heparin underwent liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and formed gradient, which was confirmed using CCL5 immobilized on heparin-beads. The biological implication of HS in CCL5 gradient formation was established in CHO-K1 (wild type) and CHO-677 (lacking HS) cells by Transwell assay. The effect of HS on CCL5 chemoattractant activity was further proved by Transwell assay of human peripheral blood cells. Finally, peritoneal injection of the chemokines into mice showed reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells either by mutant CCL5 (lacking heparin binding sequence) or by addition of heparin to wild type CCL5. Our experimental data propose that co-phase separation of CCL5 with HS establishes a specific chemokine concentration gradient to trigger directional cell migration. The results warrant further investigation on other heparin binding chemokines and allows for a more elaborate insight into disease process and new treatment strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gradients of signaling molecules are ubiquitous in embryonic development and cellular activities, modulating cell migration, proliferation, and survival(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Griffith, Sokol et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Yamamoto, Kambayashi et al., 2022</xref>, Yu, Burkhardt et al., 2009). Chemokines, belonging to a ∼45-member family of small (8-12 kDa) proteins, are signaling molecules that can induce distinct cellular chemotaxis in response to inflammatory stimuli in a concentration-dependent gradient(Weber, Hauschild et al., 2013). Chemokines play critical roles in regulating cell migration in a wide range of biological activities, e.g. developmental, homeostatic and inflammatory/pathological processes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Douglas, Dyer et al., 2015</xref>). It is established that chemokines are secreted from source cells and immobilized on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) including heparan sulfate (HS) in the extracellular matrix(Proudfoot, Handel et al., 2003). The interaction of GAG-chemokine forms an immobilized gradient to provide direction to cell movement(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Proudfoot, Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding how these chemokine gradients are formed and maintained is fundamental to identifying how they direct cell migration and proliferation. Straightforward molecular diffusion is often proposed as a possible mechanism(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kicheva, Pantazis et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Schier &amp; Needleman, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). However, it is assumed that more complicated mechanisms are involved, which remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>CCL5 (also known as RANTES, for ‘regulated on <underline>a</underline>ctivation <underline>n</underline>ormal <underline>T</underline> cell <underline>e</underline>xpressed and <underline>s</underline>ecreted’)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Roscic-Mrkic, Fischer et al., 2003</xref>) is an inflammatory chemokine that recruits a wide variety of leukocytes, including monocytes, granulocytes, and T cells, as well as mast cells and dendritic cells, through chemokine gradients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Roy, Mondal et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Weber et al., 2013</xref>). CCL5 is composed 68 amino acids that reversibly self-assembles into high-MW oligomers, up to &gt;600 kDa. This highly basic protein binds heparin with high affinity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Mulloy, 2005</xref>) and the oligomerization of CCL5 for the formation of gradient is modulated by GAGs on cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Proudfoot et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) driven by weak interactions between multivalent biomolecules was shown to be an important mechanism by which mesoscale structures of the condensates can form within the cell(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xue, Gong et al., 2019</xref>) and on the cell surface(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Xue, Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Within phase-separated condensates, biomolecules are often mobile and interchanged between the dense and light phases. Based on reported information and our previous study, we have studied the implications of HS on CCL5 gradient formation and its chemotactic activity. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that co-phase separation of CCL5 with HS establishes specific chemokine concentration gradients for chemotactic activity.</p>

<title>Co-phase separation of CCL5 and heparin</title>
<p>To illustrate the phase separation property of CCL5 in liquid, recombinant protein expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>)(Proudfoot, Power et al., 1996) was labeled with organic dye Cy3 (CCL5-Cy3) and mixed with heparin at different ratios. After 30 min formation of droplets was examined by fluorescence under confocal microscopy. At the ratio of 20:1 CCL5-Cy3 to heparin, few tiny droplets were detected, indicating phase separation. With increased ratio of CCL5-Cy3: heparin to 1:20 (20 μM CCL5-Cy3:1 μM heparin), large and round droplets were formed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref></bold>). Further increases in heparin concentration (ratio 1:50) prevented droplet formation as a “reentrant” behavior. Since heparin is a linear repetitive structure with rich negative charges, the LLPS seems following a similar mechanism as RNA in the phase separation of many RNA binding proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ghosh, Mazarakos et al., 2019</xref>). Longer incubation revealed that the droplets were dynamic and some became fused to form larger droplets (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>) that displayed a quick recovery speed in the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). The heparin-induced phase separation of CCL5 was attenuated at high salt concentrations as illustrated by incubation at different KCl concentrations in KMEI buffer (<bold><xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref></bold>). In comparison, a mutant (A22K-CCL5) with higher positive charge density showed stronger interaction with heparin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Brandner, Rek et al., 2009</xref>) and formed aggregates instead of phase separation with heparin in KMEI buffer (<bold><xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref></bold>). These results indicated that heparin-induced LLPS of CCL5 was based on weak electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged polysaccharide and the basic protein of CCL5, while strong ionic interaction has abolished this effect.</p>

<p>An earlier study showed complex formation of CCL5 with a heparin disaccharide, which proposed the BBXB motif of CCL5 playing essential role in the interaction between the chemokine and the disaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Shaw, Johnson et al., 2004</xref>). In light with this finding, we mutated <sup>44</sup>RKNR<sup>47</sup>, a conserved positively charged BBXB motif of CCL5, to hydrophobic alanine motif <sup>44</sup>AANA<sup>47</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Proudfoot, Fritchley et al., 2001</xref>), which is expected to reduce the interaction with heparin. As anticipated, the phase separation of the mutant <sup>44</sup>AANA<sup>47</sup>-CCL5 in solution containing heparin formed much smaller and fewer droplets in comparison to WT CCL5 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref></bold>). The electrostatic interaction feature was further demonstrated by molecular docking analysis using a tetrasaccharide structure of heparin (<bold><xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref></bold>). The results showed the docking of heparin tetrasaccharide into human CCL5, forming crucial electrostatic contacts at the CCL5 dimer interface, where it packed tightly against Arg 44, Lys45, Arg47 <bold>(<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>)</bold>. In comparison, binding free energy of heparin to the <sup>44</sup>AANA<sup>47</sup>-CCL5 mutant was significantly higher (<bold><xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Heparin dependent phase separation is one essential step for CCL5 gradient formation</title>
<p>To elucidate the intrinsic connection between the heparin-dependent phase separation of CCL5 and its chemotactic activity, we developed an in vitro diffusion assay in which purified His-CCL5-EGFP (400 ng/μL) (<bold><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>) was immobilized on heparin-beads or on Ni-NTA-beads. In 96-well plates, the beads were embedded in the center of Matrigel(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Helen P. Makarenkova, 2009</xref>) and incubated for 12 hr. Diffusion of the His-CCL5-EGFP was monitored by measuring fluorescence intensity along a line interval passing through the bead localized center. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>, His-CCL5-EGFP diffused a considerable distance away from the heparin-beads, forming a long and shallow gradient, whereas His-CCL5-EGFP did not diffuse from the Ni-NTA beads (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). In comparison, <sup>44</sup>AANA<sup>47</sup>-CCL5 binding to the heparin-beads was significantly weaker and did not diffuse (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>, right panel). To exclude the potential effect of EGFP, we repeated the experiment using Cy3-tagged CCL5. In a similar manner, the heparin-beads bound CCL5-Cy3 diffused in Matrigel but not the Ni-NTA beads bound CCL5-Cy3 as revealed by 3D imaging (<bold><xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). These results suggest that heparin beads tethered CCL5 via phase separation, which enables rapid exchange with the external environment leading to diffusion and gradient formation; while the Ni-NTA beads bound CCL5 lacks phase separation, therefore no diffusion.</p>
<p>Next, to test whether the formed chemokine gradients of CCL5-heparin beads contribute to the chemotactic activity, we established an in vitro chemotaxis assay using Transwell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Proudfoot et al., 2003</xref>) in which CCL5 either in heparin-beads or in Ni-beads were placed in the lower chamber (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>) and THP-1 cells were placed in the upper chamber. Again, CCL5-heparin-beads showed robustly higher chemotactic activity (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>), while CCL5-Ni-NTA beads essentially did not induce chemotaxis. In comparison, <sup>44</sup>AANA<sup>47</sup>-CCL5-heparin-beads showed relatively weaker chemotactic activity than WT-CCL5-heparin-beads (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). The dramatic difference in the chemotactic activity of CCL5 between immobilization on heparin-beads or Ni-NTA beads indicate that the chemotactic function is achieved by establishment of a functional gradient rather than just immobilization.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Heparan sulfate dependent CCL5 phase separation and its chemotactic activity</title>
<p>Having seen the functional roles of heparin in CCL5 gradient formation in solution and Matrigel, we wanted to find out whether heparan sulfate (HS) on the cell surface also can phase separate with CCL5 using a pair of well-established cell lines, CHO-K1 (wild type) and CHO-677 (mutant lacking HS). Co-incubation of CCL5-Cy3 with the cells resulted in strong signals on the cell surface of CHO-K1 revealed by confocal microscopy, indicating formation of puncta surrounding the cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). However, CHO-677 completely lacked the signals. The finding was further verified by Z-stack scanning (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Fluorescence recovery of about 40% condensates after photobleaching (FRAP) indicates there is a liquidity of the condensates on CHO-K1(<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). These results indicated that CCL5 formed phase separation with HS on the CHO K1 cell surface, which was not possible in CHO-677 cells lacking HS.</p>
<p>In order to know whether the HS-dependent CCL5 phase separation is essential for the chemotactic activity of CCL5, we established a cell-based chemotaxis assay (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). CHO-K1 cells along with CCL5 was placed in the lower chamber for 1 hr and THP-1 cells was seeded in the upper chamber, separated by a porous membrane. After incubation for 4 hr, THP-1 cells transmigrated into the lower chamber was quantified. The results revealed that both CCL5 alone and CHO-K1 alone had low chemotactic activity; in contrast, CHO-K1 in the presence of CCL5 showed significantly higher chemotactic activity (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). In the same line, the chemotactic activity of CCL5 was much lower when incubated with CHO-677 in the lower chamber. As it was found that higher proportion of heparin reduced phase separation of CCL5 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>), we tested whether this is the case in cells. Indeed, addition of heparin in the incubation of CHO-K1 abolished the phase separation of CCL5-Cy3 on the cells surface (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>, lower panel), accordingly attenuated the chemotactic activity of CCL5 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). When <sup>44</sup>AANA<sup>47</sup>-CCL5 was incubated with CHO-K1 cell, no obvious phase-separated condensates appeared on the cell surface (<bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), and consequently, <sup>44</sup>AANA<sup>47</sup>-CCL5 showed reduced chemotactic activity when incubated with CHO-K1 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>) in comparison with WT CCL5. Thus, we may conclude that HS is essential on the CHO cell surface for phase separation of CCL5 and its chemotaxis function.</p>
<p>Based on the observation that CCL5 forms a concentration gradient on heparin-beads where heparin-driven phase separation enabled CCL5 diffuse, we hypothesized a similar scenario of HS on cells, e.g., CCL5 was immobilized or condensed by HS on the cell surface through phase separation, and gradually diffuse to form a gradient to guide cell migration. To test this conjecture, we transfected the construct of CCL5-EGFP into CHO-K1. The cells were co-cultured with Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ynebrten, Barois et al., 2015</xref>). Released CCL5-EGFP from CHO-K1 cells was readily taken up by nearby HUVEC cells, formed bright phase-separated condensates on the cell surface (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4— figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). With extended incubation, the condensates became fused (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>), in a similar way of CCL5-heparin condensates in solution (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). The FRAP experiment showed reasonable fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, indicating liquid-like properties of the condensates on the cell surface (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). To further illustrate the gradient formation of the CCL5-EGFP condensates, we cultured HUVEC in Matrigel and embedded tiny amounts (about 400 cells) of the CCL5-EGFP transfected CHO-K1 as a source of CCL5-EGFP. Confocal microscopy monitoring found decreased concentration of CCL5-EGFP with increasing distance of HUVEC from the source cells (CCL5-EGFP expressing CHO), confirming that CCL5-EGFP established a gradient by phase separation on its target cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D and E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4— figure supplement 1B and C</xref></bold>). Further, both CHO-K1 and CHO-677 transfected with CCL5-EGFP were analyzed on the same setting. The results show that a gradient was formed in CHO-K1 cells when co-cultured with CCL5-EGFP transfected CHO-K1 in Matrigel, while CHO-677 failed to form the concentration gradient (<bold><xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the chemotactic activity was demonstrated by placing CCL5-EGFP transfected CHO-K1 in a lower chamber and THP-1 in the upper chamber. Counting the transmigrated THP-1 cells showed that the transfected CHO-K1 had stronger chemotactic activity compared with WT-CHO-K1(<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Ex vivo and in vivo demonstration of HS-dependent chemotactic activity of CCL5</title>
<p>To further verify our findings, we placed HUVEC or CHO cells in the lower chamber in the presence of CCL5 and human peripheral blood cells (PBMC) in the upper chamber of the Transwell device to detect transmigration of the inflammatory cells. Quantification of the transmigrated cells into the lower chamber after incubation for 4 hr revealed that neither CCL5 alone nor CHO-677 in the presence of CCL5 showed substantial chemotactic activity; in contrast, HUVEC and CHO-K1 in the presence of CCL5 showed significantly higher chemotactic activity. It should be pointed out that the total PBMC in the 3 blood samples varied dramatically, resulting in the great deviations in the number of transmigrated cells of each sample. Nevertheless, the trend of chemotactic activity under the different conditions is consistent in all samples (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To verify our findings in vivo, wild-type or mutant CCL5 was injected into the peritoneal cavity of Balb/c mice and peritoneal cells recruitment was monitored(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Proudfoot et al., 2003</xref>). Wild-type CCL5 induced a robust increase of total cells in the peritoneal lavage to a level approximately 4-fold over the saline control (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>). In comparison, though <sup>44</sup>AANA<sup>47</sup>-CCL5 group had a higher cell number than saline control, the recruited cells was much less than CCL5. Heparin (1 mg/mL) co-injected with wild-type CCL5 attenuated the recruitment of inflammatory cells, which, again, can be ascribed to the competitive interaction with endogenous HS in binding to CCL5. Overall, these results demonstrate that the phase separation of CCL5 with HS indeed contribute to chemotaxis function of CCL5 in vivo.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has been suggested that an important component of the chemokine-signaling is formation of a haptotactic gradient through immobilization of chemokines on cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)(Helen P. Makarenkova, 2009). Interactions with GAGs facilitate gradient formation of chemokine, providing directional cues for migrating cells. Heparan sulfate (HS) is one member of the GAGs family and ubiquitously expressed on the cells surface of endothelial and epithelial cells, forming glycocalyx(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Simon Davis &amp; Parish, 2013</xref>). It is known that HS (and its analogue heparin) binds to a broad spectrum of cytokines, functioning as a co-receptor to mediate signaling activity of the cytokines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Xie &amp; Li, 2019</xref>). Several inflammatory chemokines, including CCL5, bind to HS/heparin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Proudfoot et al., 2003</xref>); however, the molecular mechanisms of HS in CCL5-induced chemotactic activity has not been reported.</p>
<p>Phase separation is a common mechanism for protein assembly and compartmentalization, and it contributes to a variety of cellular processes, including the formation of membraneless organelles, signaling complexes, the cytoskeleton and numerous other supramolecular assemblies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hyman, Weber et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zbinden, Pérez-Berlanga et al., 2020</xref>). Emerging evidence indicates that biomolecules in phase-separated liquid droplets are mobile and transitorily interact with surrounding molecules(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Nakashima, Vibhute et al., 2019</xref>). CC chemokines are found to occur oligomerization in vivo, which may be modulated by GAGs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Hoogewerf, Kuschert et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, a conserved and positively charged BBXB motif in the CC chemokines is the key to interact with negatively charged GAGs through multivalent weak ionic interactions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Liang, Wenguang et al., 2016</xref>). Between the CCL5 dimers, Structural study revealed that the basic amino acids R44, K45, and R47 create two positively charged regions on the interface of dimer and interact with heparin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lortat-Jacob, Grosdidier et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Using our established liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) method, we demonstrated that CCL5 phases separate on the cell surface via a heparan sulfate (HS) dependent mechanism, which is required for CCL5 chemotaxis. Mutations on the basic amino acids R44, K45, and R47 resulted in loosing binding of CCL5 to heparin beads, accordingly, lost its chemotactic activity. This finding also supports the fact that the phase separation of CCL5 with HS is mediated by weak electrostatic interactions, which facilitates the diffusion of CCL5 in solution to form a gradient.</p>
<p>It is well established that HS constitutes the major component of the glycocalyx on the endothelial cell surface(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Oshima, King et al., 2021</xref>), and our earlier results showed that degradation of endothelial surface HS by heparanase impaired the function of MIP-2/CXCL2 induced leukocyte rolling, adhesion and transmigration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Massena, Christoffersson et al., 2010</xref>). From the finding of this study that the ratio of CCL5: heparin modulated droplets and condensates formation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref></bold>), we may assume that HS on the cell surface should have a sufficient capacity to interact with chemokines, controlling their chemotactic activity and inflammatory cell migration. This assumption is supported by the finding that overexpressing CCL5 in CHO-K1 cells led to higher chemotactic activity, which may represent a scenario of acute inflammatory reaction.</p>
<p>Collectively, our studies provide the first evidence that CCL5 gradient formation and chemotactic activity are dependent on HS. The interaction between CCL5 and HS is through a weak multivalent electrostatic binding, which facilitates LLPS and diffusion of the chemokine (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>). Notably, the results suggest that there may exist a physiological balance between CCL5 and HS, modulating the chemokine activity. This finding supports the hypothesis to develop chemokine-binding HS-mimetics that may competitively interfere with the HS-chemokine binding and phase separation, accordingly modulating inflammatory reactions.</p>

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μL of NaCl (0.9%, lipopolysaccharide-free), 1 mg/ml heparin, 500 nM wild-type CCL5, 500 nM <sup>44</sup>AANA<sup>47</sup>-CCL5 or 500 nM wild-type CCL5 added by 1mg/mL heparin diluted into 200 μL of NaCl (0.9%, lipopolysaccharide-free), respectively. At 18 h post-injection mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the cells in the peritoneal cavity were collected by lavage of 5 mL ice-cold PBS. The total cells collected were counted with automated cell counter (Bodboge, China).</p>

<p>Although the study by Xiaolin Yu et al is largely limited to in vitro data, the results of this study convincingly improve our current understanding of leukocyte migration.</p>
<p>(1) The conclusions of the paper are mostly supported by the data and in the revised manuscript clarification is provided concerning the exact CCL5 forms (without or with a fluorescent label or His-tag) and amounts/concentrations that were used in the individual experiments. This is important since it is known that modification of CCL5 at the N-terminus affects the interactions of CCL5 with the GPCRs CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5 and random labeling using monosuccinimidyl esters (as done by the authors with Cy-3) is targeting lysines. The revised manuscript more clearly indicates for each individual experiment which form is used. However, a discussion on the potential effects of the modifications on CCL5 in the results and discussion sections is still missing.</p>
<p>
(2) In general, authors used high concentrations of CCL5 in their experiments. In their reply to the comments they indicate that at lower CCL5 concentrations no LLPS is detected. This is important information since it may indicate the need for chemokine oligomerization for LLPS. This info should be added to the manuscript and comparison with for instance the obligate monomer CCL7 and another chemokine such as CXCL4 that easily forms oligomers may clarify whether LLPS is controlled by oligomerization.</p>
<p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Yu et al. describe the chemotactic gradient formation for CCL5 bound to - i.e. released from - glycosaminoglycans. The authors provide evidence for phase separation as the driving mechanism behind chemotactic gradient formation. A conclusion towards a general principle behind the finding cannot be drawn since the work focuses on one chemokine only, which is particularly prone to glycan-induced oligomerisation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The principle of phase separation as a driving force behind and thus as an analytical tool for investigating protein interactions with strongly charged biomolecules was originally introduced for protein-nucleic acid interactions. Yu et al. have applied this in their work for the first time for chemokine-heparan sulfate interactions. This opens a novel way to investigate chemokine-glycosaminoglycan interactions in general.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thanks for the encouragement of the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As mentioned above, one of the weaknesses of the current work is the exemplification of the phase separation principle by applying it only to CCL5-heparan sulfate interactions. CCL5 is known to form higher oligomers/aggregates in the presence of glycosaminoglycans, much more than other chemokines. It would therefore have been very interesting to see, if similar results in vitro, in situ, and in vivo could have been obtained by other chemokines of the same class (e.g. CCL2) or another class (like CXCL8).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We share the reviewer’s opinion that to investigate more molecules/cytokines that interact with heparan sulfate in the system should be of interesting. We expect that researchers in the field will adapt the concept to continue the studies on additional molecules. Nevertheless, our earlier study has demonstrated that bFGF was enriched to its receptor and triggered signaling transduction through phase separation with heparan sulfate (PMID: 35236856; doi: 10.1038/s41467-022-28765-z), which supports the concept that phase separation with heparan sulfate on the cell surface may be a common mechanism for heparan sulfate binding proteins. The comment of the reviewer that phase separation is related to oligomerization is demonstrated in (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D), showing that the more easily aggregated mutant, A22K-CCL5, does not undergo phase separation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, the authors have used variously labelled CCL5 (like with the organic dye Cy3 or with EGFP) for various reasons (detection and immobilisation). In the view of this reviewer, it would have been necessary to show that all the labelled chemokines yield identical/similar molecular characteristics as the unlabelled wildtype chemokine (such as heparan sulfate binding and chemotaxis). It is well known that labelling proteins either by chemical tags or by fusion to GFPs can lead to manifestly different molecular and functional characteristics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that labeling may lead to altered property of a protein, thus, we have compared chemotactic activity of CCL5 and CCL5-EGFP (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). To further verify this, we performed additional experiment to compare chemotactic activity between CCL5 and Cy3-CCL5 (see Author response image 1). For the convenience of readers, we have combined the original Figure 2—figure supplement 1 with the new data (Figure R1), which replaced original Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Although the study by Xiaolin Yu et al is largely limited to in vitro data, the results of this study convincingly improve our current understanding of leukocyte migration.</p>
<p>(1) The conclusions of the paper are mostly supported by the data although some clarification is warranted concerning the exact CCL5 forms (without or with a fluorescent label or His-tag) and amounts/concentrations that were used in the individual experiments. This is important since it is known that modification of CCL5 at the N-terminus affects the interactions of CCL5 with the GPCRs CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 and random labeling using monosuccinimidyl esters (as done by the authors with Cy-3) is targeting lysines. Since lysines are important for the GAG-binding properties of CCL5, knowledge of the number and location of the Cy-3 labels on CCL5 is important information for the interpretation of the experimental results with the fluorescently labeled CCL5. Was the His-tag attached to the N- or C-terminus of CCL5? Indicate this for each individual experiment and consider/discuss also potential effects of the modifications on CCL5 in the results and discussion sections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that labeling may lead to altered property of a protein, thus, we have compared chemotactic activity of CCL5 and CCL5-EGFP (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). To further verify this, we performed additional experiment to compare chemotactic activity between CCL5 and Cy3-CCL5 (see Author response image 1). For the convenience of readers, we have combined the original Figure 2—figure supplement 1 with the new data (Author response image 1), which replaced original Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p>
<p>The His-tag is attached to the C-terminus of CCL5, in consideration of the potential impact on the N-terminus.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In general, the authors appear to use high concentrations of CCL5 in their experiments. The reason for this is not clear. Is it because of the effects of the labels on the activity of the protein? In most biological tests (e.g. chemotaxis assays), unmodified CCL5 is active already at low nM concentrations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that the CCL5 concentrations used in our experiments were higher than reported chemotaxis assays and also higher than physiological levels in normal human plasma. In fact, we have performed experiments with lower concentration of CCL5, where the effect of LLPS was not seen though the chemotactic activity of the cytokine was detected. Thus, LLPS-associated chemotactic activity may represent a scenario of acute inflammatory condition when the inflammatory cytokines can increase significantly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) For the statistical analyses of the results, the authors use t-tests. Was it confirmed that data follow a normal distribution prior to using the t-test? If not a non-parametric test should be used and it may affect the conclusions of some experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. As shown in Author response table 1, The Shapiro-Wilk normality test showed that only two control groups (CCL5 and 44AANA47-CCL5+CHO K1) in Figure 3 did not conform to the normal distribution. The error was caused by using microculture to count and calculate when there were very few cells in the microculture. For these two groups, we re-counted 100 μL culture medium to calculate the number of cells. The results were consistent with the positive distribution and significantly different from the experimental group (Author response image 3). The original data for the number of cells chemoattractant by 500 nM CCL5 was revised from 0, 247, 247 to 247, 123, 370 and 500 nM 44AANA47 +CHO-K1 was revised from 1111, 1111, 98 to 740, 494, 617. The revised data does not affect the conclusion.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>See the weaknesses section of the Public Review. In addition, the authors should discuss the X-ray structure of CCL5 in complex with a heparin disaccharide in comparison with their docked structure of CCL5 and a heparin tetrasaccharide.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Our study, in fact, is strongly influenced by the report (Shaw, Johnson et al., 2004) that heparin disaccharide interaction with CCL5, which is highlighted in the text (page5, line100-102).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Clearly indicate in the results section and figure legends (also for the supplementary figures) which form and concentration of CCL5 is used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The relevant missing information is indicated across the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Clearly indicate which GAG was used. Was it heparin or heparan sulfate and what was the length (e.g. average molecular mass if known) or source (company?)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Relevant information is added in the section “Materials and Methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 181: What do you mean exactly with &quot;tiny amounts&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: “tiny amounts” means 400 transfected cells. This is described in the section of Materials and Methods. It is now also indicated in the text and legend to the figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Lines 216-217: This is a very general statement without a link to the presented data. No combination of chemokines is used, in vivo testing is limited (and I agree very difficult). You may consider deleting this sentence (certainly as an opening sentence for the Discussion).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We appreciate very much for the thoughtful suggestion of the reviewer. This sentence is deleted in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Why was 5h used for the in vitro chemotaxis assay? This is extremely long for an assay with THP-1 cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We apologize for the unclear description. The 5 hr includes 1 hr pre- incubation of CCL5 with the cells enable to form phase separation. After transferring the cells into the upper chamber, the actual chemotactic assay was 4 hr. This is clarified in the Materials and Methods section and the legend to each figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Define &quot;Sec&quot; in Sec-CCL5-EGFP and &quot;Dil&quot; in the legend of Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The Sec-CCL5-EGFP should be “CCL5-EGFP’’, which has now been corrected. Dil is a cell membrane red fluorescent probe, which is now defined.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Why are different cell concentrations used in the experiment described in Figure 5?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The samples were from three volunteers who exhibited substantially different concentrations of cells in the blood. The experiment was designed using same amount of blood, so we did not normalize the number of the cell used for the experiment. Regardless of the difference in cell numbers, all three samples showed the same trend.</p>
