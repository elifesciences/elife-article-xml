<title>Abstract</title><p>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes significantly to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), has hindered the development of effective treatments. In this study, we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. Our findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes. RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion. Importantly, inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies. Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.</p>

<title>Significance</title>
<p>This study uncovers the crucial involvement of ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) in the regulation of epithelial and mesenchymal state oscillations in breast cancer cells, which plays a major role in the development of chemoresistant metastasis. By proposing a novel therapeutic strategy targeting the RiBi pathway, the study offers significant potential to enhance treatment efficacy and outcomes for patients with advanced breast cancer. This approach could help overcome the limitations of current chemotherapy options and address the complex challenges posed by EMT-mediated chemoresistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tumor cells exploit the transdifferentiation program of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to acquire aggressive properties, including anchorage-independent survival, invasion, and stemness(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Multiple growth factors (TGFβ, EGF, Wnts, etc), signaling pathways (Smad2/3, PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2, etc), EMT transcription factors (Snail, Twist, Zeb1/2, etc), and hundreds of downstream EMT related genes are involved in the EMT program(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Such complexity leads to a wide spectrum of EMT phenotypes coexisting at different stages of tumors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The EMT-endowed features contribute to tumor heterogeneity, metastasis, and therapy resistance, making EMT an attractive therapeutic target.</p>
<p>Current EMT-targeting strategies focus on blocking EMT stimuli, signaling transduction, or mesenchymal features(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, these approaches may paradoxically promote the reversed process of EMT, mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), which also contributes to malignancy development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Therefore, we proposed that instead of targeting epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype, inhibiting a biological process mediating the transitions of both EMT and MET could effectively overcome the limitations of traditional strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the EMT process in metastatic tumor progression, we previously developed an EMT lineage-tracing model (Tri-PyMT) by combining MMTV-PyMT, Fsp1(S100a4)-Cre, and Rosa26-mTmG transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). This model traces EMT via a permanent RFP-to-GFP fluorescence switch induced by mesenchymal-specific Cre expression. The absence of EMT reporting in metastatic lesions in this model has sparked a lively debate about the proper definition of EMT status in tumor cells and the biological significance of EMT in tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Rheenen’s group also posited that the Fsp1-Cre mediated EMT lineage tracing model might not accurately capture the majority of EMT events in comparison to an E cadherin-CFP model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Although we disagree with this assessment of Fsp1-Cre model’s fidelity in tracing EMT, we acknowledge the limitations of relying on a single EMT marker to investigate the EMT contributions in tumor metastasis. Notably, using the refined EMTracer animal models, Le et al. discovered that N-cadherin+ cells, rather than the Vimintin+ cells, were predominantly enriched in lung metastases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). These findings with different mesenchymal-specific markers underscore the complex nature of the EMT process; metastases formation does not necessarily require the expression of many traditional mesenchymal markers.</p>
<p>The Tri-PyMT model, despite its limitations in comprehensive tracing of metastasis, provides unique opportunities to study EMT’s role in tumor progression and chemoresistance. In particular, the fluorescent marker switch of the established Tri-PyMT cell line reliably reports changes in EMT phenotypes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, we characterized the differential contributions of EMT tumor cells in tumor progression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Importantly, post-EMT(GFP+), mesenchymal tumor cells consistently demonstrated robust chemoresistant features compared to their parental epithelial cells (pre-EMT RFP+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), inspiring us to further study chemoresistance using the Tri-PyMT model.</p>

<title>Cell lines and cell culture</title>
<p>Tri-PyMT cells were established in our lab from primary tumors of MMTV-PyMT/Fsp1-Cre/Rosa26-mTmG transgenic mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). MDA-MB231-LM2 cells were a gift from Dr. Joan Massague. To facilitate <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging, both cell lines were genetically labeled with luciferase by lenti-Puro-Luc. Cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin. A routine assay for Mycoplasma (Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit, ATCC, Cat#30-1012K) was performed to avoid contaminations.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Animals and tumor models</title>
<p>All animal works were performed in accordance with IACUC approved protocols at Weill Cornell Medicine. CB-17 SCID mice were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). For the experimental metastasis model, tumor cells (1.5 ×10<sup>5</sup> cells) were injected through the tail vein in 100 µL of PBS in 10-week-old females. For animals subjected to chemotherapy, Cyclophosphamide (CTX, 100mg/kg, Signa-aldrich, Cat# C0768) was administered once per week, i.p., for 3-4 weeks. BMH21 (25mg/kg, Sellechehem, Cat#S7718) was administrated 5 times/week, i.p., for 3-4 weeks. The progression of lung metastasis tumors was monitored by bioluminescent imaging (BLI) every 3-5 days on the Xenogen IVIS system coupled with analysis software (Living Image; Xenogen).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Flow cytometry and cell sorting</title>
<p>For cultured cells, single-cell suspensions were prepared by trypsinization and neutralizing with the growth medium containing 10% FBS. For the metastatic lungs, cell suspensions were prepared by digesting tissues with an enzyme cocktail containing collagenase IV (1 mg/mL), hyaluronidase (50 units/mL), and DNase I (0.1 mg/mL) in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution containing calcium (HBSS, Gibco) at 37°C for 20-30 minutes. Cells were filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) and stained with anti-Epcam antibody (G8.8, Biolegend) following a standard immunostaining protocol. SYTOX Blue (Invitrogen) was added to the staining tube in the last 5 minutes to facilitate the elimination of dead cells. GFP<sup>+</sup> and RFP<sup>+</sup> cells were detected by their endogenous fluorescence. The stained samples were analyzed using the BD LSRFortessa™ Flow Cytometer coupled with FlowJo_v10 software (FlowJo, LLC). Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a variety of controls including isotype antibodies, and unstained and single-color stained samples for determining appropriate gates, voltages, and compensations required in multivariate flow cytometry.</p>
<p>For fluorescence-activated cell sorting for <italic>in vitro</italic> culture or tail vein injection, we used the Aria II cell sorter coupled with FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). The preparation of cells throughout sorting procedures was under sterile conditions. The purity of subpopulations after sorting was confirmed by analyzing post-sort samples in the sorter again.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>RNA-sequencing analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from sorted RFP+, GFP+, and Double+ Tri-PyMT cells with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). RNA-Seq libraries were constructed and sequenced following standard protocols (Illumina) at the Genomics and Epigenetics Core Facility of WCM. RNA-seq data were analyzed with customized Partek Flow software (Partek Inc). In brief, the RNA-seq data were aligned to the mouse transcriptome reference (mm10) by STAR after pre-alignment QA/QC control. Quantification of gene expression was performed with the annotation model (PartekE/M) and normalized to counts per million (CPM). Differential gene expression was performed with Gene Specific Analysis (GSA) algorithm, which applied multiple statistical models to each gene to account for its varying response to different experimental factors and different data distribution. For heatmap visualizations, Z scores were calculated based on normalized per-gene counts. Algorisms for the biological interpretation of differential expressions between samples such as Gene Set Enrichment Assay (GSEA) and Over-representation assay, are also integrated in Partek Flow platform. Gene sets of interests were downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis</title>
<p>Single-cell suspensions were prepared following protocols from 10X Genomics. RFP+, GFP+, and Double<sup>+</sup> Tri-PyMT cells were sorted by flow cytometry, and cells with &gt;90% viability were submitted for sc-RNAseq at the Genomics and Epigenetics Core Facility of WCM. Single-cell libraries were generated using 10X Genomics Chromium Single-cell 3’ Library RNA-Seq Assays protocols targeting 8,000 cells from each fraction were sequenced on the NovaSeq sequencer (Illumina). The scRNA-seq data were analyzed with the Partek Flow software (Partek Inc), an integrated user-friendly platform for NGS analysis based on the Seurat R package(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). The raw sequencing data were aligned to the modified mouse transcriptome reference (mm10) containing RFP, GFP, PyMT, and Cre genes by STAR. The deduplication of UMIs, filtering of noise signals, and quantification of cell barcodes were performed to generate the single-cell count data. Single-cell QA/QC was then controlled by the total counts of UMIs, detected features, and the percentage of mitochondria genes according to each sample (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref></bold>). The top 20 principal components (PC) were used for tSNE visualization. Differential gene expression analysis, GSEA, Geneset Overrepresentation assay, and Cell Trajectory analysis (Monocle 2 model) are also integrated into the Partek Flow platform (Partek Inc).</p>

<title>Tissue processing, Immunofluorescence, and Microscopy</title>
<p>Lungs bearing metastases were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, followed by 30% sucrose for 2 days, and then embedded in Tissue-tek O.C.T. embedding compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Serial sections (10-20 μm, at least 10 sections) were prepared for immunofluorescent staining. For staining of cultured or sorted cells, cells (2×10<sup>3</sup> cells/well) were seeded in 8-well chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tek, Thermo Fisher) and cultured overnight in the growth medium for staining. Standard immunostaining protocol was performed with fluorescent conjugated primary antibodies. Fluorescent images were obtained using a computerized Zeiss fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer) with Zen 3.0 software (Carl Zeiss Inc.).</p>

<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Cells were homogenized in 1x RIPA lysis buffer (Millipore) with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Samples were boiled in 1x Laemmli buffer and 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and loaded onto 12% gradient Tris-Glycine gels (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed using antibodies as listed in the antibody table.</p>

<title>Cell viability assays</title>
<p>To determine the viability of Tri-PyMT cells under chemotherapy, cells (2×10<sup>3</sup> cells/well) were seeded in 96-well adherent black-walled plates, and treated with a serial concentration of 5-FU, Cisplatin, 4-Hydroperoxy Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Gemcitabine, and Paclitaxel together with BMH21, for 72 hours. After treatment, cell viability was measured with the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). SynergyFinder(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) was employed to analyze and visualize the synergic effects between chemo drugs and BMH21 treatments.</p>

<sec id="s2j">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To determine the sample size of animal experiments, we used power analysis assuming the (difference in means)/(standard deviation) is &gt;2.5. Therefore, all animal experiments were conducted with ≥ 5 mice per group to ensure adequate power between groups by two-sample t-test comparison or ANOVA. Animals were randomized within each experimental group. No blinding was applied in performing experiments. Results were expressed as mean ± SEM. Data distribution in groups and significance between different treatment groups was analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney T test in GraphPad Prism software. P values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Error bars depict SEM, except where indicated otherwise.</p>

<title>Double+ Tri-PyMT cells mark the EMT transitioning phase</title>
<p>In contrast to their persistence in the epithelial state (RFP+) <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), most RFP+ Tri-PyMT cells actively transition to GFP+ <italic>in vitro</italic> in growth medium containing 10% FBS (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref></bold>). As the fluorescent switch is irreversible, GFP+ cells accumulated over generations until a balanced ratio of RFP+/GFP+ is reached. This phenomenon indicates that the Tri-PyMT actively reports the ongoing EMT process in an EMT-promoting culture condition. We observed a subpopulation of cells, which were double positive for RFP and GFP, constituting approximately 2-5% of total cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). We posited that these RFP<sup>+</sup>/GFP<sup>+</sup> (Doub<sup>+</sup>) cells represent tumor cells transitioning from an epithelial to a mesenchymal state, since their fluorescent marker cassette has switched to GFP expression induced by Fsp1-Cre, while pre-existing RFP protein lingers due to its tardy degradation. Indeed, immunoblotting analyses confirmed the association of the double positive fluorescence and a hybrid EMT status. Doub<sup>+</sup> cells expressed intermediate levels of both epithelial (Epcam and E-cadherin) and mesenchymal markers (Vimten) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To further investigate the differential transcriptome in these EMT transitioning cells, we performed bulk RNA sequencing analysis using flow cytometry-sorted RFP<sup>+</sup>, Doub<sup>+</sup>, and GFP<sup>+</sup> Tri-PyMT cells. Consistently, analysis of traditional EMT marker genes revealed that Doub+ cells expressed both epithelial and mesenchymal markers (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S2A</xref></bold>). Differentially expressed genes in Doub+ cells were divided into 4 clusters, Trans_Up, Trans_Down, Epithelial and Mesenchymal markers (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S2B</xref></bold>). Our attention was particularly attracted by upregulated genes within the Trans_Up cluster, as they may represent activated pathways specific in the transitioning phase of EMT.

<title>Ribosome biogenesis pathway is enhanced in the EMT transitioning phase</title>
<p>To gain a deeper understanding of transcriptome alterations and ensure adequate representation of EMT-transitioning cells, RFP<sup>+</sup>, GFP<sup>+</sup>, and Doub<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted simultaneously via flow cytometry; equal numbers of each population were remixed and subject for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis.</p>
<p>The <italic>t</italic>-SNE plot demonstrated two major clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>):</bold> one predominantly expressed epithelial genes, while the other displayed overall mesenchymal phenotypes. Doub+ cells were integrated into the two major clusters, suggesting that the overall single-cell transcriptome may not be sensitive enough to identify tumor cells at the EMT-transitioning phase. We therefore performed cell trajectory analysis (Monocle 2) based on all EMT-related genes (EMTome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>)). Five cell states related to EMT status were identified (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). All of them aligned well with a specific expression pattern of epithelial and mesenchymal marker genes based on AUC values (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>), or individual epithelial/mesenchymal pairs, such as Fsp1/Epcam and Vim/Krt18 (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S3B, S3C</xref>)</bold>. We calculated the EMT pseudotime of each cell and designated State 1 (the complete epithelial state) as the root (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>). Cells were then classified cells into three main categories, Epi (State 1 cells), Trans (State 5&amp;2) and Mes (State 4&amp;3), based on their position within the EMT spectrum (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>). Differential gene expression analysis confirmed that Trans cells gained expression of mesenchymal markers such as Cdh2, Vim, Fn1 and Zeb2, while retaining expression of epithelial markers such as Krt7 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we analyzed the pathway activation in Trans cells by Gene Set Enrichment Assay (GSEA) with the biology process (BP) gene sets of the GO term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Among the 49 overlapped gene sets that represented significantly upregulated pathways when comparing Trans vs. Epi and Trans vs. Mes (P &lt;0.05), six pathways were related to the ribosome or rRNA processing (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S4B</xref></bold>). These findings were in line with the previous bulk RNA sequencing analysis that indicated activation of RiBi pathway in EMT-transitioning (Doub+) cells. Consistently, GSEA using scRNAseq confirmed significant enrichment of RiBi genes in Trans cells compared to cells at Epi or Mes phase (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref></bold>). We further mapped the EMT spectrum of cells based on their EMT pseudotimes or cell states, and correlated them with their RiBi activities. A significant trend of RiBi activation was observed in the trasitioning phase of EMT process (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S3D</xref></bold>). It is worth noting that with the 2-phase classifications (Epi or Mes), the elevated RiBi activity was associated with the transitioning cells still exhibiting overall epithelial phenotypes; RiBi activities diminished as cells completed their transition to the mesenchymal phase. Our data suggests that the elevation of RiBi activities is transcient during EMT.</p>

<title>Ribosome biogenesis pathway was upregulated during MET process</title>
<p>The transient elevation of RiBi during EMT prompted us to ask whether the MET process required the same.

We sorted GFP<sup>+</sup>/Epcam<sup>-</sup> Tri-PyMT cells via flowcytometry and injected them into <italic>Scid</italic> mice via tail vein. Approximately 50% of tumor cells expressed EpCam at 4 weeks post-injection, indicating active MET (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>).

Consistent with the analysis for EMT, we found that tumor cells with epithelial phenotypes displayed elevated RiBi activity (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>), indicating its reactivation during MET process. A significant positive correlation was detected between RiBi gene upregulation and MET pseudotime (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref></bold>). Notably, RiBi activity gradually increased during MET process. These results suggested that upregulated RiBi pathway is equally needed for mesenchymal tumor cells to undergo MET during their outgrowth in the lungs.</p>

<title>Activation of ERK and mTOR signaling pathways are linked to the upregulation of ribosome biogenesis</title>
<p>Ribosome biogenesis was recognized as a crutial factor in cancer pathogenesis a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). To further investigate the signaling pathways responsible for RiBi upregulation in the EMT/MET process, we sorted RFP<sup>+</sup>, Doub<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> Tri-PyMT cells and probed the signaling activations in these cells. In response to serum stimulation, Doub<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited significantly higher levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (p-mTORC1) compared to either RFP<sup>+</sup> or GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). The phosphorylation of Rps6, an essential ribosome protein of the 40S subunit, is regulated by synergistic crosstalk between mTORC1 and ERK signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). We thus explored the status of p-Rps6 and observed a significantly higher level of p-Rps6 in Doub<sup>+</sup> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>).

<p>The primary function of ribosome is to synthesize proteins to support essential biological functions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Indeed, enhanced ribosome activity in Doub+ cells translated into distinct phenotypes in cell growth and nascent protein synthesis. Flow cytometry analysis showed that Doub+ cells possessed enlarged cell sizes compared to RFP<sup>+</sup> or GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). Using the O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) incorporation assay, we found that Doub<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited an increased rate in nascent protein synthesis (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). Another hallmark of ribosome activity is rRNA transcription that occurs in nucleoli. By immunostaining of Fibrillarin, a nucleolar marker(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), we found that the Doub<sup>+</sup> cells had significantly more nucleoli compared to cells in epithelial (RFP<sup>+</sup>) and mesenchymal (GFP<sup>+</sup>) states (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results suggest that the elevation of RiBi pathway in cells at EMT transitioning phase is associated with aberrant activation of ERK and mTOR signalings, which may, in turn, confer nascent protein synthesis capability to tumor cells for completing phenotypic changes.</p>

<title>Suppression of ribosome biogenesis reduced the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells</title>
<p>The transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is mediated by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Small molecules such as BMH21 and CX5461 are specific Pol I inhibitors, which inhibit rRNA transcription and disrupt ribosome assembly(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), providing a specific RiBi targeting strategy.

<p>Fluorescence switch from RFP+ to GFP+ of TriPyMT cells were again employed to investigate the impact of Pol I inhibitors on EMT.

<p>Given that the elevated RiBi activity occurs during MET process as well, we further assessed the impact of Pol I inhibitor on the retrieval of epithelial markers by mesenchymal tumor cells. The regain of EpCam expression by the sorted GFP+/EpCam-Tri-PyMT cells In a 3D culture was measured via flow cytometry. BMH21 significantly prevented the Epcam retrieval by GFP+/Epcam-Tri-PyMT cells, suggesting the impaired MET capability with upon treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). These results laid a foundation for pharmacological inhibition of RiBi pathway to block EMT/MET of tumor cells.</p>
<p>The requirement of RiBi activity during EMT/MET transitioning was also demonstrated by genetically modulating ribosome proteins. As the organelle for protein synthesis, ribosome comprises 4 ribosomal RNAs and approximately 80 structural ribosomal proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Depleting one r-protein usually causes decreases of other r-proteins in the same subunit, and ultimately compromises the overall ribosome assembly(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). We, therefore, employed Lenti-shRNAs targeting Rps24 and Rps28, two essential genes of 40S subunit, to genetically modulate the RiBi pathway in Tri-PyMT cells (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S7A</xref></bold>). Effective knocking-down of Rps24 or Rps28 significantly reduced the number of nucleoli (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S7B</xref></bold>). Accompanying with the downregulated RiBi activities were the impeded EMT (RFP-to-GFP switch) and the similarly reduced MET (regain of Epcam) (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S7C, D</xref></bold>). These results suggested that the elevated RiBi activities are critical for tumor cells to maintain their abilities to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal states.</p>

<p>Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the blockade of EMT by Pol I inhibitor will reduce the EMT-mediated chemoresistance. The combination therapies of Pol I inhibitor and chemo drugs were therefore tested. We treated Tri-PyMT cells, which contain approximately 15% GFP+ cells, with a series of BMH21 concentrations with or without CTX. Cytotoxic assay after 3 days treatment revealed an enhanced sensitivity of tumor cells to the combination therapies (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). Interestingly, BMH21 and CTX exhibited optimal synergy (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). Particularly at concentrations of 100-200 nM, BMH21 showed significant synergy scores with CTX (δ = 11.97). Such low concentrations of BMH21 were approximately 10-20% of the IC50 in Tri-PyMT cells and have also been shown to effectively block the EMT/MET process, suggesting the synergy was likely induced by EMT blockade, rather than cytotoxicity of BMH21. Importantly, the synergic effect between BMH21 and chemotherapy drugs is not limited to CTX. Trends toward synergies were also found with Cisplatin (δ = 7.47), 5FU (δ = 8.62), Doxorubicin (δ = 7.60) and Gemcitabine (δ = 6.03) (<bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref></bold>).

<title>RiBi inhibition diminished chemoresistant metastasis of breast tumor cells in the lung</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Targeting EMT for cancer therapy has been challenging due to the complexity of the EMT process and controversies of promoting MET which also favors tumor progression. Using the EMT-lineage-tracing model, we found an upregulation of RiBi pathway at the transitioning phase of both EMT and MET. Emerging evidence has indicated the association of RiBi pathway and EMT program. It was reported that the elevated rRNA synthesis/RiBi pathway was found to be concomitant with cell cycle arrest induced by TGFβ and to fuel the EMT program in breast tumor cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). A more recent study identified a subpopulation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in which high RiBi activities persisted to maintain their high metastatic potentials(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Interestingly, the RiBi activity was associated with epithelial phenotypes rather than mesenchymal ones in CTCs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Indeed, EMT induction by TGFβ primarily suppressed ribosome gene expression and global translational activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). By employing our unique EMT-lineage-tracing model, we discovered that the RiBi pathway was transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of EMT/MET program. The enhanced activation of RiBi pathway diminished as tumor cells accomplished phenotype changes. In general, a lower RiBi activity was observed in the mesenchymal tumor cells as compared to that in the epithelial ones. Importantly, the involvement of unwonted RiBi activities during both EMT and MET processes makes RiBi a new and better target for overcoming EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis.</p>
<p>Targeting RiBi pathway by RNase Pol I inhibitor impaired the EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells and significantly synergized with common chemotherapeutics. These observations also suggest that malignant cells might require certain ease to “ping pong” between epithelial and mesenchymal states, so that they could adapt themselves to the challenging microenvironment. Of note, some commonly used chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, 5FU, Doxorubicin, etc), although primarily targeting DNA duplications, may also affect RiBi pathway by inhibiting rRNA processing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Therefore, the synergic effects with Pol I inhibitor varied among different combinations. Moreover, RiBi is a process dysregulated in most, if not all, cancers. Its involvement in EMT/MET process make it a feasible targeted pathway for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.</p>

<p>The process of EMT is a major contributor to metastasis and chemoresistance in breast cancer. By using a modified PyMT model that allows the identification of cells undergoing EMT and their decedents via S100A4-Cre mediated recombination of the mTmG allele, Ban et al. tackle a very important question of how tumor metastasis and therapy resistance by EMT can be blocked. They identified that pathways associated with ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) are activated during transition cell states. This finding represents a promising therapeutic target to block any transition from E to M (activated during cell dissemination and invasion) as well as from M to E (activated during metastatic colonization). Inhibition of RiBi-blocked EMT also reduced the establishment of chemoresistance that is associated with an EMT phenotype. Hence, RiBi blockage together with standard chemotherapy showed synergistic effects, resulting in impaired colonization/metastatic outgrowth in an animal model. The study is of great interest and of high clinical relevance as the authors show that blocking the transition from E to M or vice versa targets both aspects of metastasis, dissemination from the primary tumor, and colonization in distant organs.</p>
<p>The study is done with high skill using state-of-the-art technology and the conclusions are convincing and solid, but some aspects require some additional experimental support and clarification. It remains elusive whether blocking of EMT/MET is necessary for the synergistic effect of standard chemotherapy together with RiBi blockage or whether a general growth disadvantage of RiBi-treated cells independent of blocking transition is responsible. How can specific effects on state transition by RiBI block be separated from global effects attributed to overall reduced protein biosynthesis, proliferation etc.? Some other aspects are misleading or need extension.</p>

<p>The current manuscript by Ban et al describes that cells undergoing EMT have increased rRNA synthesis, as analyzed by RNA seq-based gene expression analysis, and that the increased rRNA synthesis provides a therapeutic opportunity to target chemoresistance. The cells utilized in this manuscript were isolated from the authors' Tri-PyMT EMT lineage tracing model published a few years ago which demonstrated that cells undergoing EMT are not the cells that are contributing to metastasis but rather to tumor chemoresistance (Fischer, Nature 2015). This in vivo model has since then been criticized for not capturing all relevant EMT events which the authors also acknowledge in the introduction. The authors therefore reason that they use this lineage tracing model to better understand the role of EMT in chemoresistance.</p>
<p>A major problem with the current manuscript is that the authors present many of their findings as a novel without the proper acknowledgment of previously published literature in particular, Prakash et al., Nature Communications, 2019 and Dermitt, Dev Cell, 2020. In the studies by Prakash, the authors demonstrate that maintaining ongoing rRNA biogenesis is essential for the execution of the EMT program, and thus the ability of cancer cells to become migratory and invasive. Further, Prakash et al showed that blocking rRNA biogenesis with a small molecule inhibitor, CX-5461 (which is also used in the study by Ban et al) specifically inhibits breast cancer growth, invasion, EMT, and metastasis in animal models without significant toxicity to normal tissues. As such a significant revision that is necessary at this time is a rewrite of the manuscript especially the introduction and the discussion to more accurately describe and cite previously published findings and then highlight the current work by Ban et al which nicely builds on the previously published literature as it highlights the contribution of EMT to chemoresistance rather than metastasis. The suggestion for the authors is that they therefore should focus on highlighting the chemotherapy resistance angle as their Tri-PyMT EMT lineage tracing was chosen to test this angle and as such focus on both primary tumor growth and metastasis.</p>
<p>Additional major revisions:</p>
<p>
The authors use the FSP1-Cre Model which in the field has been questioned as to not capture all the relevant EMT events and therefore their findings should be corroborated by another EMT model system.</p>
<p>In the current version of the manuscript, there are no measurements of rRNA synthesis, but the gene expression profiles are used as a proxy for rRNA synthesis. The authors therefore need to include measurements of rRNA synthesis corroborating the RNA sequencing data to support their scientific findings and claims. This can be accomplished by qPCR, Northern blot, or EU staining of the respective sorted cell population. Quantification of rRNA synthesis is also needed for the CX-5461/BMH-21 and silencing studies.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no mechanistic insight as to how rRNA synthesis is increased during EMT, which would also strengthen the manuscript. This could be done through targeted ChIP analysis.</p>
<p>rRNA synthesis has canonically been linked to the cell cycle therefore it will be necessary for the authors to determine the cell cycle state of their respective cell populations throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>Statistics and quantifications are currently missing in several figures and need to be better explained throughout the manuscript to strengthen the scientific rigor of the studies.</p>
<p>Only metastasis studies are shown in the current version of the manuscript. These studies should be complemented with primary tumor studies as the main focus of the paper is the contribution of EMT to chemoresistance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Ban et al. investigated the role of ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its contribution to chemoresistance in breast cancer. They used a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model and scRNA-seq to analyze EMT status and found that RiBi was elevated during both EMT and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) of cancer cells. They further revealed that nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signaling pathways was essential for the completion of RiBi. Inhibiting excessive RiBi impaired EMT and MET capability. More importantly, combinatorial treatment with RiBi inhibitors and chemotherapy drugs reduced metastatic outgrowth of both epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells. These results suggest that targeting the RiBi pathway may be an effective strategy for treating advanced breast cancer with EMT-related chemoresistance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The conclusions of this study are generally supported by the data. However, some weaknesses still exist as mentioned below.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The study predominantly focused on RiBi as a target for overcoming EMT-related chemoresistance. Thus, it will be necessary to provide some canonical outcomes after upregulating ribosome biogenesis, such as translation activity. I would suggest ribosome profiling or puromycin-incorporation assay, or other more suitable experiments.</p>
<p>2. The results were basically obtained from mice and in vitro experiments. While these results provide valuable insights, it will be valuable to validate part of the findings using some tissue samples from patients (e.g. RiBi activity) to determine the clinical relevance and potential therapeutic applications.</p>
<p>3. The results revealed that mTORC1 and ERK mediated RiBi activation. How about mTORC2? It will be informative to evaluate mTORC2 signaling.</p>
<p>4. The results also demonstrated promising synergic effects of Pol I inhibitor (BMH21) and chemotherapy drug (CTX) on chemo-resistant metastasis. How about using the inhibitors of mTORC1 together with CTX?</p>
<p>5. While the results demonstrate the potential efficacy of RiBi inhibitors in reducing metastatic outgrowth, other factors and mechanisms contributing to chemoresistance may exist and need further investigation. I would suggest some discussion about this aspect.</p>
