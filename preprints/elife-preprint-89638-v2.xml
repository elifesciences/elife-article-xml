<title>Abstract</title><sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy, fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) as a <italic>bona fide</italic> tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Human clinical samples and data were used to investigate <italic>PDLIM2</italic> genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPDLIM2) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) including those unleashed by ICIs.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women with a 5-year survival rate of only 22% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Although these outcomes may be improved by immune checkpoint blockade therapy involving the disruption of the binding of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1, also known as CD279) on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as B7-H1 or CD274) on tumor and tumor-associated cells, most lung cancer patients still fail the therapy, with a response rate of only about 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. In general, this revolutionary immunotherapy works better against ‘hot’ tumors, which have abundant TILs, strong immunogenicity and sufficient PD-L1 expression. Unfortunately, most tumors are ‘cold’, with low T-cell infiltration, weak immunogenicity and minimal PD-L1 expression, and show weak response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Cold lung tumors without targetable oncogenic drivers are treated with chemotherapy as the standard approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. However, the response rate to this conventional cancer therapy is also low and resistance often occurs after an initial response, with an overall survival (OS) of about 12-17 months. Given its roles in inducing TILs and immunogenicity, in particular PD-L1 expression, to turn cold tumors hot, chemotherapy can be an ideal candidate for combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to improve therapeutic efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Indeed, combination treatment with ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs shows synergy and better efficacy in both preclinical animal models and clinical trials of lung cancer and other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. However, even with the combination of ICIs and chemotherapy, tumors in animals do not remit completely and the objective response rate (ORR) of lung cancer patients only reaches 33%-49.7%, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of just 5.1-9 months and a median OS of 13-22 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Thus, further improvement over the chemo-immunotherapy is direly needed.</p>
<p>Our recent human and mouse studies have shown that most lung tumors not only have low TILs and decreased PD-L1, but also down-regulate major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), evading recognition and attack by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, including those unleashed by ICIs and/or recruited by chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Following our previous cell line studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], we have established the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein PDLIM2, also known as SLIM or mystique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], as a <italic>bona fide</italic> tumor suppressor and its repression as a causative driver of lung cancer and resistance to ICIs and chemotherapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. While PDLIM2 is epigenetically repressed in human lung cancer, associating with therapeutic resistance and poor prognosis, its global or lung epithelial-specific deletion in mice leads to lung cancer development, chemoresistance, and complete resistance to anti-PD-1 and epigenetic drugs. One most important function of PDLIM2 is to promote the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) RelA (also known as p65), two master transcription factors that function as proto-oncogenes in lung and many other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. PDLIM2 repression in tumor cells thus results in the persistent activation of STAT3 and RelA, leading to MHC-I downregulation and high expression of tumor growth-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. It also leads to strong induction of multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) for acquired chemo-resistance, as chemotherapy further enhances RelA activation for MDR1 transcription in PDLIM2 deficient tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we examined whether and how PDLIM2 can be targeted to treat lung cancer in a faithful mouse model of human lung cancer. In particular, we tested whether systemic administration of nanoparticle-encapsulated PDLIM2-expression plasmids (nanoPDLIM2) could enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and/or chemotherapeutic drugs. We also examined whether PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves genetic deletion and its relationship with epigenetic silencing. These studies indicate that besides epigenetic repression, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) contributes to <italic>PDLIM2</italic> downregulation in about 58% of human lung tumors, and that <italic>Pdlim2</italic> heterozygous deletion (<italic>Pdlim2</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) mice develop spontaneous tumors in lung and other organs. Notably, systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2 reverses the phenotypes caused by PDLIM2 repression and induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most mice without further increasing toxicity when combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings provide a firm basis to combine ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs with PDLIM2-targeted therapy for the treatment of lung and other cancers.</p>

<title>Animals and lung carcinogenesis</title>
<p>We have complied with all relevant ethical regulations for animal testing and research. The animal experiments were performed in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines on the Use of Laboratory Animals. All animals were maintained under pathogen-free conditions and used according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACAUC) of the University of Pittsburgh. <italic>Pdlim2</italic><sup>flx/flx</sup>/<italic>SP-C</italic>-rtTA<sup>tg/−</sup>/(tetO)7CMV-Cre<sup>tg/tg</sup> (ΔSPC) mice under a pure FVB/N background and <italic>Pdlim2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice under a pure BALB/c background have been described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. For lung carcinogenesis, six-to eight-week-old ΔSPC and wild type FVB/N mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with urethane (1 mg/g body weight, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) once a week for six consecutive weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], followed by different treatments as shown in the figures. Mice were euthanized at six weeks post urethane treatment for examination of lung tumors, inflammation, and treatment-induced toxicity. Surface tumors in mouse lungs were counted blinded under a dissecting microscope, and tumor diameters were measured by microcalipers.</p>

<title>Both epigenetic repression and genetic deletion of <italic>PDLIM2</italic> in lung cancer</title>
<p>Using 40% of the expression level in matched normal lung tissues as the cut-off in the analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we found that <italic>PDLIM2</italic> was repressed in over 75% of human lung tumors in a prior study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].

<p>In line with <italic>PDLIM2</italic>’s location on chromosome 8p21.3, a frequent LOH region in lung and other tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], analysis of TCGA database revealed that <italic>PDLIM2</italic> expression was positively associated with its gene copy numbers, and that over 58% of human lung tumors had genetic deletion of the <italic>PDLIM2</italic> gene if copy number variation (CNV) of -0.1 was used as the cut-off for the gene deletion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Further analysis indicated that about 44% of human lung tumors simultaneously harbored the promoter hypermethylation and LOH of the <italic>PDLIM2</italic> gene, and approximately 26% and 14% of them only having the promoter hypermethylation or LOH of the <italic>PDLIM2</italic> gene, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). Around 16% of lung tumors possessed no such epigenetic or genetic alterations in <italic>PDLIM2</italic>. These findings were confirmed by microsatellite and gene-specific PCR-based LOH analysis of human primary lung tumor tissues and cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>E</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1<italic>F</italic></xref>; <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). These data suggested that PDLIM2 repression in lung cancer involves both epigenetic silencing and genetic deletion.</p>
<p>To determine the significance of <italic>PDLIM2</italic> LOH in lung tumors, we examined whether <italic>Pdlim2</italic> heterozygous deletion leads to decreased PDLIM2 expression and spontaneous tumors in mice. Unlike its absolute absence in <italic>Pdlim2</italic> homozygous deletion (<italic>Pdlim2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice, PDLIM2 was detected in the lung of <italic>Pdlim2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, but at a much lower level compared to wild type (WT) mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Importantly, <italic>Pdlim2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, like <italic>Pdlim2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, also developed spontaneous tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>G</italic></xref>). Of note, over 50% of tumors developed in <italic>Pdlim2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Pdlim2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice were lung tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>H</italic></xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1<italic>B</italic></xref>). These data are also highly consistent with the fact that PDLIM2 is ubiquitously expressed under physiological conditions, with the highest level in the lung and lung epithelial cells in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Thus, PDLIM2 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that is particularly important for lung tumor suppression.</p>

<title>Efficacy of systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2 in refractory lung cancer</title>
<p>Although reversal of PDLIM2 epigenetic repression by epigenetic drugs to restore PDLIM2 expression in cancer cells may be used to treat lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], it is logical that this approach cannot be applied to lung tumors involving <italic>PDLIM2</italic> LOH, which accounts for about 58% of all lung cancer cases. To overcome this limitation and expand PDLIM2-targeted therapy to all lung tumors with PDLIM2 repression regardless of the involved mechanisms, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of systemic administration of PDLIM2-expression plasmids encapsulated by the clinically feasible <italic>in vivo</italic>-jetPEI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. To this end, we employed mouse lung tumors induced by urethane, a faithful model of human lung cancer and adenocarcinoma (AC) in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Urethane is a chemical carcinogen present in fermented food, alcoholic beverage and also cigarette smoke, the predominant risk factor accounting for about 90% of human lung cancer cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Like its human counterpart, the murine lung cancer induced by urethane also shares PDLIM2 repression, in addition to their similarities in histology, genetics, molecular biology and immunology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>].

Six weeks post the initial treatment of nanotherapy, mice were euthanized and lung tissues were collected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2<italic>A</italic></xref>).

<title>High tumor specificity and low toxicity of systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2</title>
<p>To characterize the potential new lung cancer therapy, we examined the expression levels of PDLIM2 in lung tumors and several organs, including the liver, kidney, and spleen. Consistent with the treatment efficacy, a high level of PDLIM2 was detected in the lung tumors from mice treated with the PDLIM2 plasmid nanoparticles one week post nanoPDLIM2 treatment, whereas no obvious PDLIM2 was found in the lung tumors from mice treated with the control plasmid nanoparticles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<italic>A</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3<italic>B</italic></xref>). It should be pointed out that the tumor delivery efficiency of PDLIM2-expression or control plasmid nanoparticles was similarly high (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). However, either PDLIM2-expression or control plasmids were hardly detected in other organs/tissues of the same mice, including liver, kidney and spleen. Of note, in the first two days after injection, both empty vector and PDLIM2-expression plasmids were also detected at high levels in those tissues but quickly cleared afterward (data not shown), consistent with the well-documented tumor-specific enrichment of nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>].

<title>Synergy of nanoPDLIM2 with chemotherapy in lung cancer treatment</title>
<p>Given the role of PDLIM2 in inhibiting the expression of cell survival and proliferation genes in tumor cells, which contribute to chemoresistance, we tested whether nanoPDLIM2 increases the efficacy of chemotherapy in the mouse model of lung cancer. Treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel, two chemotherapeutic drugs that are often used together as the first-line treatment for lung and many other cancers, led to significant decrease in tumor number and tumor burden (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Importantly, combination with nanoPDLIM2 further significantly decreased both tumor number and tumor burden, suggesting a promising synergy between PDLIM2 nanotherapy and chemotherapy in lung cancer treatment. Consistently, significantly higher tumor cell apoptosis was detected in mice treated with the combination therapy, in comparison to those with nanoPDLIM2 or chemotherapy alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p>

<p>Another important mechanism contributing to the synergy between these two therapies involves nanoPDLIM2 blockade of the acquired chemoresistance of lung cancer cells. Chemotherapy induced strong RelA activation/nuclear expression and MDR1 expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4<italic>D</italic></xref>). NanoPDLIM2 not only repressed the constitutive activation of RelA in cancer cells but also prevented the strong induction of RelA activation and MDR1 expression by the chemotherapy. Thus, PDLIM2 nanotherapy improves the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy through blocking both intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance of lung cancer cells.</p>

<title>NanoPDLIM2 enhancement of ICI’s efficacy in lung cancer treatment</title>
<p>High expression of cell survival genes also renders tumor cells resistant to the tumoricidal activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), including those unleashed by ICIs. PDLIM2 nanotherapy should also enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, given its ability in suppressing the expression of cell survival genes. Furthermore, NanoPDLIM2 increased the number of TILs and the expression of MHC-I, the most important and core components of immunotherapies including PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<italic>A</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5<italic>B</italic></xref>).

<p>Although it dramatically increases TILs as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], chemotherapy also induced the expression of PD-L1 on cancer cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6<italic>A</italic></xref>), which presumably protects cancer cells from immune attack and thereby restricts further efficacy improvement of its combination with PDLIM2 nanotherapy. But it may increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to PD-1 blockade therapy, particularly in combination with nanoPDLIM2. Indeed, chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade therapy showed a promising synergy in reducing both tumor number and tumor burden in comparison to the individual treatment of chemotherapy or PD-1 blockade therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The synergy was largely blocked when <italic>Pdlim2</italic> was genetically deleted from lung cancer cells (ΔSPC) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6<italic>B</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6<italic>C</italic></xref>), suggesting an important role of PDLIM2 in the combination therapy of chemotherapeutic drugs and anti-PD-1. Whereas PDLIM2 nanotherapy increased MHC-I expression on tumor cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<italic>B</italic></xref>), which is critical for better recognition and killing of tumor cells by CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs, chemotherapy alone or its combination with anti-PD-1 failed to do so (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6<italic>D</italic></xref>). Accordingly, combination of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, like the combination therapies of nanoPDLIM2 and anti-PD-1 or chemotherapeutic drugs, also failed to induce a complete remission of lung tumors in any mice.</p>
<p>Given their overlapping roles in increasing TILs and in particular their complement roles in inducing MHC-I and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, which turn tumors hot and more sensitive to PD-1 blockade, combination of nanoPDLIM2 and chemotherapeutic drugs with anti-PD-1 is expected to show better efficacy compared to combining only two of them. Indeed, combination of all three showed the strongest effect on reducing tumor burden and numbers, and caused complete remission of all lung tumors in 60% of mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6<italic>E</italic></xref>) and much more shrinkage of lung tumors in remaining mice in comparison to those treated with two combined therapies. In line with the high therapeutic efficacy, the triple combination therapy significantly increased the numbers and/or activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lung, compared to the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs and anti-PD-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6<italic>F</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6<italic>G</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Of note, consistent with the undetectable toxicity of PDLIM2 nanotherapy, its co-treatment did not further increase the toxicity of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. There was no obvious histological difference of major organs, including the liver, lung, kidney, and spleen (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, no significant differences in animal body weights were observed by additional nanoPDLIM2, in comparison to the mice received the combinational treatment of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs in the presence or absence of empty vector plasmid nanoparticles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6<italic>H</italic></xref>). These data suggested a novel combination therapy with very high therapeutic efficacy and no increased toxicity for lung cancer, particularly refractory lung cancer.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PD-1/PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy has recently joined chemotherapy as a standard treatment for lung and several other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. While some patients have shown dramatic responses, most patients do not benefit from this novel treatment. Currently, various combinations of ICIs with other therapies, in particular its combination with chemotherapeutic drugs are being extensively tested in both preclinical and clinical trial studies to expand the benefit of this innovative therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Although a promising synergy and better efficacy has been observed in both preclinical animal models and human clinical trial studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], significant further improvement is direly needed. Using an authentic mouse model of lung cancer, we show, for the first time, that PDLIM2 nanotherapy shows efficacy and high safety, and more importantly, induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals when it is combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs.</p>
<p>Most human lung tumors as well as lung tumors in our animal model have low numbers of TILs and decreased expression of PD-L1 and MHC-I on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], all of which are important mechanisms contributing to the resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy. Through inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], chemotherapy can increase TILs and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, and thereby synergize with anti-PD-1. However, chemotherapy cannot induce MHC-I expression, which limits further improvement of its synergy with immune therapy for complete cancer remission. Also, tumor cells usually express high levels of survival genes against the tumoricidal effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and of CTLs, including those activated by chemotherapy and unleashed by ICIs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, PDLIM2 nanotherapy induces MHC-I expression and lymphocyte tumor infiltration but does not up-regulate PD-L1. Moreover, PDLIM2 nanotherapy prevents the induction of MDR1 and the expression of tumor-related genes and in particular cell survival genes, further sensitizing tumor cells to the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs and immune cells including those recruited by chemotherapy and unleashed by PD-1 blockade. Because of these important functions of PDLIM2 nanotherapy, PDLIM2 nanotherapy improved the efficacy of chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade therapy, and in combination with chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade therapy, resulted in complete cancer remission in most of the animals and dramatic tumor reduction in the remaining mice.</p>
<p>Another important clinical characteristic of PDLIM2 nanotherapy is its tumor-specificity and high safety profile. It delivered PDLIM2-expression plasmids to lung tumor tissues and showed undetectable toxicity in the animal model. Its combination does not further increase the toxicity of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. This is in sharp contrast to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved epigenetic drugs, which can restore PDLIM2 expression in cancer cells with PDLIM2 epigenetic repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Epigenetic drug treatment leads to body weight loss of animals (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S3<italic>A</italic></xref>). The toxicity is much worse when epigenetic drugs are combined with chemotherapy (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Besides its side effects, epigenetic therapy should have much more limited application, even though it shows better efficacy as a monotherapy or combined with chemotherapeutic drugs or anti-PD-1 in comparison to PDLIM2 nanotherapy (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). While nanoPDLIM2-based combination therapies could be applicable to all lung tumors with PDLIM2 repression regardless of the mechanisms involved, epigenetic therapy may be used to treat about 26% of lung tumors with PDLIM2 epigenetic repression only. About 58% of lung tumors harboring PDLIM2 LOH are not suitable to epigenetic therapies, although most of them are also with epigenetic alterations of the <italic>pdlim2</italic> gene. Of note, the therapeutic efficacy of epigenetic therapy depends on PDLIM2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], and PDLIM2 heterozygous loss causes spontaneous lung and other cancers. Further, the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of epigenetic agents with both anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs has not been examined yet.</p>

<sec id="s5">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, the presented data identify genetic deletions as a major mechanism other than epigenetic alterations for PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer, and PDLIM2 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor particularly important for suppressing lung cancer and therapy resistance. More importantly, these preclinical data establish a novel combination treatment of nanoPDLIM2, anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs that induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals and is also with high safety profile. We believe that these knowledges are applicable to other cancers, because PDLIM2 repression has also been linked to numerous human cancers other than lung cancer.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Sun and colleagues followed on their previous findings on the tumor suppressive role of PDLIM2 in lung cancer. They further investigated various mechanisms, including epigenetic modification, copy number variation and LOH, that led to the decrease expression of PDLIM2 in human lung cancer. Next, they used nanoparticle-based approach to specifically restore the expression in mouse lung tumors. They showed that over-expression PDLIM2 in lung cancer repressed its progression in vivo. Also, this treatment could synergize with chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1. Overall, the results were quite promising and convincing, using a treatment combination that would appear to have potential for clinical implementation.</p>

<p>Summary: The authors have previously demonstrated that the E3 ligase PDLIM2 inhibits NF-kB and STAT3 and is epigenetically repressed in human lung cancers (Sun et al. Nat. Comm. 2019 10: 5324); therefore, PDLIM2 is a tumor suppressor in lung cancer. In this manuscript, they follow up on their previous findings and show that expression of PDLIM2 is downregulated in human lung cancers by both genetic deletion and promoter methylation. They further describe a novel approach to restore the expression of PDLIM2 in mouse lung tumors by systemically administering PDLIM2 plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (termed &quot;nanoPDLIM2&quot;). The nanoPDLIM2 approach was shown to exhibit efficacy with low toxicity in a urethane-induced mouse lung cancer model. The authors further demonstrated synergy of nanoPDLIM2 with chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade immunotherapy. The combination therapy of nanoPDLIM2, chemotherapy and immunotherapy proved most effective with complete tumor remission in 60% of mice. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 upregulated MHC-I expression, enhanced CD4/CD8 T cell activation and tumor infiltration, and suppressed MDR1 induction and nuclear expression of STAT3, RelA and prosurvival genes in tumors. Overall, this study is important because it reinforces the critical roles of PDLIM2 in suppressing lung cancer, and also identifies a potential approach to restoring PDLIM2 expression in lung tumors. The experiments were well executed; the data are convincing and support the conclusions made by the authors.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>NanoPDLIM2, nanotechnologies that efficiently deliver lentivirus overcomes resistance to chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. This is a new strategy for enhancing the efficiency of immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p>
<p>This finding is important from a clinical translation perspective, but I have several minor concerns.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Please describe the mechanism of increased MHC class I and PD-L1 by PDLIM2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our previous studies showed that PDLIM2 induces MHC-I induction through decreasing STAT3 whereas it is dispensable for PD-L1 expression (Sun et al, 2019, PMID: 31757943).  In line with the studies, PD-L1 is induced by chemotherapeutic drugs, but not by NanoPDLIM2 (Figure 6A).  Together with the roles of PDLIM2 in repressing RelA-dependent MDR1 induction by chemotherapy and in preventing expression of cell survival and proliferation genes by targeting both RelA and STAT3 (Sun et al, 2019, PMID: 31757943), further providing the mechanistic basis for the combination and synergistic effect of nanoPDLIM2, anti-PD-1 and chemo drugs.  The improvement has now been further incorporated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Please describe the mechanism of decreased MDR1, nuclear RelA and STAT3 by PDLIM2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our previous studies demonstrated that PDLIM2 reduces MDR1 expression by degrading nuclear RelA (Sun et al, 2019, PMID: 31757943).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Please determine whether PDLIM2 expression directly impacts immune cells (function and number)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As shown in Figure 5, NanoPDLIM2 increased the number and activation of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); and in prior study, PDLIM2 knockout repressed the numbers of TILs and inhibited the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, while its re-expression in lung tumors led to T cell activation (Sun et al. 2019, PMID: 31757943). On the other hand, selective deletion of PDLIM2 in immune cells and in particular myeloid cells repressed the numbers and activation of TILs (Li et al, 2021, PMID: 33539325; PMCID: PMC8021114).  Thus, PDLIM2 may impact immune cells both directly and indirectly, particularly when nanoparticles can deliver PDLIM2 into both tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells (despite PDLIM2 is delivered into much fewer immune cells compared to tumor cells).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. What is the efficiency of PDLIM2 delivery? Does delivery efficiency determine anti-tumor effect?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As shown in the manuscript, the dose of PDLIM2 used already shows high delivery (20-30 copies per tumor cell in Figure 3B) and therapeutic efficacy in the mouse model of refractory lung cancer and particularly when being combined with anti-PD-1 and chemo drugs.  It is of interest to test different doses in the model for the best delivery and efficacy, which is actively being pursued in the lab.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Authors used a non-immunogenic tumor model. Can you demonstrate the combination effect with PDLIM2 in immunogenic lung cancer models to determine whether the combination of PDLIM2 with anti-PD-1 Ab confers a synergistic effect without chemotherapy?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, it is of interest to demonstrate the combination of PDLIM2 and anti-PD-1 in immunogenic lung cancer models with chemotherapy although a synergy is highly expected.  The greatest challenge in the lung cancer field is the low response of non-immunogenic tumor, which is the focus of the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. On page 11, % change can make one over-interpret data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The % change has been removed from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 5, what is the difference between 5A and 5D?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 5A shows the increase of TILs by nanoPDLIM2 in animals that did not receive PD-1 blockade immunotherapy, Figure 5D shows the increase of TILs by nanoPDLIM2  in animals received PD-1 blockade immunotherapy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It is unclear whether PDLIM2 confers an additive or a synergistic effect with anti-PD-1/chemo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>PDLIM2 nanotherapy confers a synergistic effect with chemotherapy on increasing apoptosis in tumors (Figure 4B) and tumor reduction (Figure 4A and 6E, left panel, tumor number), confers a synergistic effect with antiPD-1 on increasing CD4+ and CD8+ TILs (Figure 5A and 5D), and apoptosis in tumors (Figure 5F),  and an additive effect on tumor reduction (Figure 5C and 6E), and  confers a synergistic effect with chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1 on increasing CD4+ and CD8+ TILs (Figure 5A and 6F) and tumor reduction (Figure 6E, left panel, tumor number).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Have the authors tested any toxicity in normal lungs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Same to tumor lungs, no obvious toxicity has been observed in normal lungs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The paper is clear and well-written, although some minor edits are needed. For example, the title could be changed to reflect both human and mouse studies in the manuscript for more general readers. Moreover, 'lung cancer' should be used instead of 'lung cancers'. The manuscript could be further improved by validating their findings in a different model and particularly the syngeneic model of metastatic lung cancer for a better overall survival time by the new combination therapy, given the fact that clinical trial studies usually start in patients with metastatic tumors. But this is optional because the therapeutic effect on primary lung cancer is already significant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the correction and wonderful suggestions.  The “lung cancers” were replaced with “lung cancer”, and the title was changed to “Improving PD-1 blockade plus chemotherapy for complete remission of lung cancer by nanoPDLIM2”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>1. What is the rationale for i.v. injection of nanoparticles containing PDLIM2 plasmid? Intranasal administration of nanoparticles may potentially target nanoPDLIM2 specifically to the lungs. Another potential option is intranasal infection of mice with adenovirus expressing PDLIM2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The rationale for i.v. injection of nanoPDLIM2 is that iv injected nanoPDLIM2 first reach into the lung and more importantly tumor tissues as well as the convenience and high efficacy of mouse i.v. injection, particularly when multiple injections are needed.  Mice are much less stressful compared to other intranasal or even intratracheal injection.   Adenovirus can be used only once, because it will initiate ant-viral immune response in mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors examine PDLIM2 expression in lung tumors 1 week after i.v. administration of nanoparticles (Fig. 3A). Do all tumor cells express PDLIM2 after nanoPDLIM2 treatment? How long does PDLIM2 persist in the tumors? The kinetics of PDLIM2 expression may be informative to help interpret the results from the various combination treatments given to the mice. Multiple rounds of nanoPDLIM2 treatment could potentially improve the efficacy of the treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For all the sections examined (n=6), PDLIM2 was re-expressed in most but not all lung cancer cells at 1-week of the i.v administration.  Accordingly, nanoPDLIM2 was injected weekly.  We are examining if PDLIM2 reexpression can last longer.  We are also testing the best dose with the best efficacy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Does the plasmid DNA from nanoparticles trigger an innate immune response in the lung that contributes to anti-tumor responses?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In line with previous studies showing no effect on immune responses (Bonnet et al. 2008. PMID: 18709489), the dose used in current study does not significantly affect immune cells in the lung, suggesting no obvious effect of nanoparticles with empty plasmid on innate immune response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Fig. 4, does the combination of nanoPDLIM2 and chemotherapy diminish STAT3 nuclear staining?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>NanoPDLIM2 alone decreased nuclear STAT 3 in tumor cells (Figure 2C), it also diminished nuclear STAT3 in tumor cells with the combination of chemotherapy.</p>
