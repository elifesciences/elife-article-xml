<title>Abstract</title><p>Cilia defects lead to scoliosis in zebrafish, but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood and may diverge depending on the mutated gene. Here, we dissected the mechanisms of scoliosis onset in a zebrafish mutant for the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> gene encoding a ciliary transition zone protein. <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant fish developed scoliosis with near-total penetrance but asynchronous onset in juveniles. Taking advantage of this asynchrony, we found that curvature onset was preceded by ventricle dilations and was concomitant to the perturbation of Reissner fiber polymerization and to the loss of multiciliated tufts around the subcommissural organ. Rescue experiments showed that Rpgrip1l was exclusively required in <italic>foxj1a</italic>-expressing cells to prevent axis curvature. Genetic interactions investigations ruled out Urp1/2 levels as a main driver of scoliosis in <italic>rpgrip1</italic> mutants. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies identified neuroinflammation associated with increased Annexin levels as a potential mechanism of scoliosis development in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> juveniles. Investigating the cell types associated with <italic>annexin2</italic> over-expression, we uncovered astrogliosis, arising in glial cells surrounding the diencephalic and rhombencephalic ventricles just before scoliosis onset and increasing with time in severity. Anti-inflammatory drug treatment reduced scoliosis penetrance and severity and this correlated with reduced astrogliosis and macrophage/microglia enrichment around the diencephalic ventricle. Mutation of the <italic>cep290</italic> gene encoding another transition zone protein also associated astrogliosis with scoliosis. Thus, we propose astrogliosis induced by perturbed ventricular homeostasis and associated with immune cell activation as a novel pathogenic mechanism of zebrafish scoliosis caused by cilia dysfunction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is a 3D rotation of the spine without vertebral anomalies that affects about 3% of adolescents worldwide. Its etiology remained mysterious, mainly because of the lack of appropriate animal models and the complexity of its inheritance profile in large families presenting a severe scoliosis trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Patten et al., 2015</xref>). Since the description of the first IS model in the zebrafish <italic>ptk7</italic> gene mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hayes et al., 2014</xref>), a number of mutants for genes encoding ciliary proteins were shown to develop scoliosis at late larval and juvenile stage (4 to 12 weeks post-fertilization, wpf) without any vertebral fusion or fracture, highlighting the link between cilia function and straight axis maintenance in that species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grimes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Cilia are microtubular organelles with sensory and/or motile functions. Zebrafish mutants in genes involved in cilia motility or in intraflagellar transport display severe embryonic axis curvature and are usually not viable beyond larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grimes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, mutants in genes implicated in ciliary gating or ciliary trafficking encoding respectively components of the transition zone (TZ) or of the BBsome complex survive to adult stage and develop scoliosis with variable penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bentley-Ford et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Masek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). The molecular basis for these differences is still poorly understood, even if progress has been made in our understanding of zebrafish scoliosis. Cilia-driven movements of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are involved in zebrafish axis straightness, both in embryos and juveniles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boswell and Ciruna, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grimes et al., 2016</xref>) and are tightly linked to the assembly and maintenance of the Reissner fiber (RF), a SCO-spondin polymer secreted by the subcommissural organ (SCO) and running down the brain and spinal cord CSF-filled cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cantaut-Belarif et al., 2018</xref>). RF loss at embryonic stage in null <italic>sspo</italic> mutants generates ventral curvatures of the posterior axis of the body and is lethal while its loss at juvenile stage in hypomorphic <italic>sspo</italic> mutants triggers scoliosis with full penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cantaut-Belarif et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Troutwine et al., 2020</xref>). Signaling downstream of the RF in embryos implicates Urp1 and Urp2, two neuropeptides of the Urotensin 2 family expressed in ventral CSF-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs), which act on dorsal muscles in embryos and larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cantaut-Belarif et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gaillard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Their combined mutations or the mutation of their receptor gene <italic>uts2r3</italic> lead to scoliosis at adult stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bearce et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gaillard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether RF maintenance and Urp1/2 signaling are perturbed in juvenile scoliotic mutants of genes encoding TZ proteins (“TZ mutants”) and how these perturbations are linked to scoliosis is unknown, especially because TZ mutants do not display any sign of embryonic or larval cilia motility defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, two scoliotic models develop axial curvature while maintaining a RF showing that their curvature onset occurs independently of RF loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Meyer-Miner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Xie et al., 2023</xref>). Finally, neuro-inflammation has been described in a small subset of zebrafish IS models for which anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant treatments (with NAC or NACET) partially rescue scoliosis penetrance and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Van Gennip et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper we dissect the mechanisms of scoliosis appearance in a novel deletion allele of the zebrafish TZ <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> gene. <italic>RPGRIP1L</italic> mutations have been found in neurodevelopmental ciliopathies, Meckel syndrome (MKS) and Joubert syndrome (JS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Delous et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arts et al., 2007</xref>) characterized by severe brain malformations. Other organs such as the kidney and liver are variably affected. Some JS patients also present with severe scoliosis, but this phenotypic trait is of variable penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Delous et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brancati et al., 2008</xref>). Functional studies performed in mouse and zebrafish have shown that <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic> is required for proper central nervous system patterning due to complex perturbations of Sonic Hedgehog signaling (in mice) and cilia planar positioning (in mice and zebrafish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andreu-Cervera et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mahuzier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Vierkotten et al., 2007</xref>). Zebrafish <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants are viable and develop an axis curvature phenotype at juvenile stages with nearly full penetrance. Using a variety of approaches, we show that i) Rpgrip1l is required in ciliated cells surrounding ventricular cavities for maintaining a straight axis; ii) at juvenile stages, <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants develop cilia defects associated with ventricular dilations and loss of the RF; iii) increased <italic>urp1/2</italic> expression in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants does not account for spine curvature defects; and iv) a pervasive astrogliosis process associated with neuroinflammation participates in scoliosis onset and progression. Finally, we show that astrogliosis is conserved in another zebrafish ciliary TZ mutant, <italic>cep290</italic>, identifying a novel mechanism involved in scoliosis upon ciliary dysfunction.</p>

<title>Rpgrip1l <sup>-/-</sup> fish develop scoliosis asynchronously at juvenile stage</title>
<p>To study the mechanisms of scoliosis appearance upon ciliary dysfunction in zebrafish, we produced a viable zebrafish deletion mutant in the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> gene encoding a ciliary transition zone protein (<italic>rpgrip1l</italic><sup>Δ</sup>, identified in ZFIN as <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>bps1</sup>)</italic> <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). We made a 26 kb deletion by CRISPR-Cas9 double-cut, which removes 22 out of the 26 exons of the protein (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>) and triggers protein truncation at amino-acid (aa) position 88 out of 1256. 90-100% of <italic>rpgrip1l</italic><sup>Δ<italic>/</italic>Δ</sup> embryos and larvae were straight (0-10%, depending on the clutch, displayed a sigmoid curvature). They did not display any additional defects found in many ciliary mutant embryos or larvae such as randomized left-right asymmetry, kidney cysts or retinal anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bachmann-Gagescu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tsujikawa and Malicki, 2004</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1B, D, E</xref>). Another allele with a frameshift mutation in exon 4 (<italic>rpgrip1l<sup>ex4</sup>,</italic> identified in ZFIN as <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>bps2</sup></italic>) showed a similar phenotype (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1A, B</xref>). Considering the large size of the deletion, we considered the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic><sup>Δ</sup> allele as a null and called it <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> thereafter. <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>animals developed scoliosis during juvenile stages. Scoliosis appearance was asynchronous between clutches, from 4 weeks post fertilization (wpf) (around 1 cm length) to 11 wpf (1.8-2.3 cm), and also within a clutch. It started with slight upward bending of the tail (the <italic>tail-up</italic> phenotype) and progressed toward severe curvature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>) with 90% penetrance in adults (100% in females and 80% in males) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Micro-computed tomography (μCT) at two different stages (5 wpf and 23 wpf) confirmed that spine curvature was three-dimensional and showed no evidence of vertebral fusion, malformation or fracture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-G</xref> and Supplementary Movie 1).</p>

<p>Thus, the ciliary <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant shows almost totally penetrant, late-onset juvenile scoliosis without vertebral anomalies, making it a valuable model for studying the etiology of human idiopathic scoliosis. Furthermore, the asynchronous onset of curvature is an asset for studying the chronology of early defects leading to scoliosis.</p>

<p>Since <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mahuzier et al., 2012</xref>), scoliosis could have different tissue origins, including a neurological origin as shown for the <italic>ptk7</italic> and <italic>ktnb1</italic> scoliotic fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Meyer-Miner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Van Gennip et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, no tissue-specific rescue has been performed in mutants for zebrafish ciliary TZ or BBS genes. We tested if introducing by transgenesis a tagged human RPGRIP1L protein under the control of the <italic>col2a1a (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dale and Topczewski, 2011</xref><italic>)</italic> or <italic>foxj1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Van Gennip et al., 2018</xref>) enhancers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>) would reduce scoliosis penetrance and severity. The <italic>foxj1a</italic> enhancer drives expression in motile ciliated cells, among which ependymal cells lining CNS cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Van Gennip et al., 2018</xref>), while the <italic>col2a1a</italic> regulatory region drives expression in cartilage cells including intervertebral discs and semi-circular canals, tissues that have been proposed to be defective in mammalian scoliosis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hitier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Karner et al., 2015</xref>). After selecting F1 transgenic fish that expressed the Myc-tagged RPGRIP1L protein in the targeted tissue at 2.5 dpf, we introduced one copy of each transgene into the <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background. The Foxj1a:5XMycRPGRIP1L transgene was sufficient to fully suppress scoliosis in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish: none of the transgenic <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish became scoliotic while virtually all the non-transgenic <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> siblings did (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I, J</xref>). In contrast, RPGRIP1L expression triggered by the <italic>col2a1a</italic> promoter did not have any beneficial effect on scoliosis penetrance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I, J</xref>). In conclusion, <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> expression in <italic>foxj1a</italic>-expressing cells is sufficient to maintain a straight axis.</p>

<title>Rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup> adult fish display cilia defects along CNS cavities</title>
<p>We observed normal cilia in the neural tube of <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>embryos (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>).

<title>MCC defects at SCO level correlate with scoliosis appearance at juvenile stages</title>
<p>We then took advantage of the asynchrony in scoliosis onset to correlate, at a given stage, cilia defects at different levels of the CNS cavities with the spine curvature status (straight or curved) of <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> juveniles. We analyzed cilia defects in three CNS regions implicated in scoliosis appearance: the spinal cord central canal (since scoliosis develops in the spine), the forebrain choroid plexus (fChP) whose cilia defects have been associated with scoliosis in <italic>katnb1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Meyer-Miner et al., 2022</xref>) and the subcommissural organ (SCO), which secretes SCO-spondin whose absence leads to scoliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Troutwine et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In the spinal cord central canal of 8 wpf juvenile fish, cilia density was reduced to the same extent in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish irrespective of the fish curvature status (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A-C, E</xref>). In addition, cilia length increased in straight mutants and was more heterogenous than controls in scoliotic mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A’-C’, D</xref>). Arl13b content appeared severely reduced in mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A”-C”</xref>). In the fChP, mono- and multi-ciliated cell populations were observed with a specific distribution along the anterior-posterior axis, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">D’Gama et al., 2021</xref>). At the level of the habenula nuclei, cells of dorsal and ventral midline territories were monociliated, while lateral cells presented multicilia tufts (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2 K-K’’</xref>). <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> juveniles presented an incomplete penetrance of ciliary defects in the fChP, with no correlation between cilia defects and the curvature status (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2, L-O’’</xref>).</p>

<p>The SCO lies at the dorsal midline of the diencephalic ventricle (DiV), under the posterior commissure (PC) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 G, H</xref>, Supplementary Figure 2A, C). CiIia in and around the SCO have not been described previously in zebrafish. We showed that, in control animals, Sco-spondin (Sspo) secreting cells varied in number along SCO length, from 24 cells anteriorly to 6-8 cells posteriorly (Supplementary Figure 2 A, A’, C) and were monociliated at all anteroposterior levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-H</xref>, Supplementary Figure 2 A’). The Sspo protein produced from one copy of the transgene Scospondin- GFP<sup>ut24</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Troutwine et al., 2020</xref>) formed cytoplasmic granules around SCO cell nuclei, under emerging primary cilia (Supplementary Figure 2A’). Conversely, MCCs lateral to the SCO did not secrete Sspo and were prominent towards posterior (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, Supplementary Figure 2C), as observed in the rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Collins and Woollam, 1979</xref>). Monocilia of Sspo secreting cells were still present but appeared longer in straight <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> juveniles and could not be individualized anymore at anterior SCO level in scoliotic fish: we observed a weaker and denser acetylated and glutamylated tubulin staining that likely corresponded to longer intertwined cilia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 I, I’, K, K’</xref>). Lateral multicilia tufts were preserved in straight <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> juveniles (n=5) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 J</xref>) but were missing at posterior SCO level in tail-up or scoliotic <italic>rpgrip1l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish (n=7) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants develop both monocilia and multicilia defects at juvenile stages, but cilia defects in the spinal cord and in the fChP do not correlate with axis curvature status of the fish. By contrast, the loss of MCC cilia at the SCO strictly correlates with scoliosis onset, suggesting a causal relationship.</p>

<title>Rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup> juveniles show ventricular dilations and loss of the Reissner fiber at scoliosis onset</title>
<p>Ciliary beating is an essential actor of CSF flow and of ventricular development in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Olstad et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, ciliary defects in the brain and spinal cord of <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fish could lead to abnormal ventricular and central canal volume and content. In the spinal cord, the lumen of the central canal was enlarged at thoracic and lumbar levels in all <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutant juveniles, with no correlation to the axis curvature status (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A-C; F</xref>). To determine the timing of brain ventricular dilations relative to scoliosis, we analyzed ventricular volume at the onset of spine curvature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-G</xref>). Ventricular reconstruction was performed on cleared brains of 4 control and 4 <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-</sup></italic><sup>/-</sup> (3 tail-up and 1 straight) fish at 5 wpf, stained with ZO1 to highlight the ventricular border and with DiI to outline brain shape, focusing on the RhV at the level of the posterior midbrain and hindbrain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>).

<p>Defective ependymal ciliogenesis has been associated with abnormal CSF flow and defective Reissner Fiber (RF) maintenance in several scoliotic zebrafish models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grimes et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). The RF runs along the length of the body, within brain ventricles and central canal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). It is mainly composed of Sspo secreted by the SCO and floor plate (FP) and its loss at juvenile stages triggers scoliosis in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rose et al., 2020</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Troutwine et al., 2020</xref>). To visualize the RF, we used an antiserum that labels the RF in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Didier et al., 1995</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cantaut-Belarif et al., 2018</xref>) and we confirmed the results by introducing one copy of the <italic>sspo-GFP</italic> knock-in allele, sco-spondin-GFP<sup>ut24,</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Troutwine et al., 2020</xref>) by genetic cross into <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals. The RF formed normally in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>embryos, as expected given the absence of embryonic curvature (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1 C</xref>). To study its maintenance in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> juveniles, we immunostained spinal cord longitudinal sections of 7-8 wpf curved or straight fish of the same clutch. The RF was visualized as a 1 μm diameter rod in the central canal of the neural tube and few dots were present in the apical cytoplasm of FP cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) as well as in the SCO of all controls (n=8, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L, O</xref>) and in ventricles caudal to the SCO, but not rostral to it as expected (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2E, H</xref>). The RF was also present in all <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> straight fish (n=9, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2I</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tail-up and scoliotic fish, the RF was absent at all axis levels and a few SCO-spondin-positive debris were present in the central canal (n=8, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Transverse sections at the level of the SCO and fChP as well as caudal to the SCO in severely scoliotic fish revealed abnormally packed material in the ventricles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N, Q</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2G, J</xref>). In juveniles with a slight tail-up phenotype, SCO-secreting cells produced Sspo-GFP cytoplasmic granules as in controls (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2B, B’</xref>, n=7/7), and polymers of Sspo-GFP accumulate in the adjacent DiV, which suggests that Sspo-GFP aggregates are produced by the SCO.</p>
<p>Thus, our study uncovers a strict temporal correlation between the loss of MCC at posterior SCO level, impaired RF polymerization and scoliosis onset in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>juvenile fish.</p>

<p>Given the early and long-lasting upregulation of <italic>urp1/2</italic> in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish, we attempted to rescue axis curvature by decreasing global Urp1/2 production via genetic means. To that end, we generated double (<italic>rpgrip1l<sup>+/-</sup>; urp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) heterozygous fish using the recently generated <italic>urp2</italic> deletion allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gaillard et al., 2023</xref>) and crossed them to produce double mutants. Using a curvature quantification method on whole fish (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S3I</xref> and methods), we observed that the removal of one or two <italic>urp2</italic> functional allele(s) in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish did not lower their curvature index (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B, C</xref>), neither at two mpf (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S3 F</xref>) nor at four mpf (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S3 G-H</xref>). We observed that <italic>urp2</italic> mRNA amounts were reduced by removing one or two functional copies of <italic>urp2</italic>, probably as a consequence of mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gaillard et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

Filtering the gene list to select for P-adj &lt; 0.05 and Log2 FC &gt; 0.75 or &lt; −0.75 recovered a vast majority of upregulated genes in the dorsal trunk (75 downregulated vs 614 upregulated genes) and, to a lesser extent, in the brain (1 downregulated, <italic>rpgrip1l,</italic> vs 60 upregulated genes) as illustrated on the volcano plots from DGE analysis of the brain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and trunk (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). 54 out of 60 genes upregulated in the brain were also upregulated in the trunk, suggesting that, in the trunk, these genes were specific to the CNS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). In both the brain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and the trunk (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>), the most upregulated biological processes in GO term analysis included cilium movement and cilium assembly. Among the 20 most significant GO terms found for upregulated genes in the trunk, 8 were related to ciliary movement/assembly (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). The upregulation in both tissues of <italic>foxj1a,</italic> encoding a master transcriptional activator of genes involved in cilia motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yu et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) likely contributed to this enrichment. To confirm this hypothesis, we compared our dataset with those of targets of Foxj1 from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Quigley and Kintner, 2017</xref>). We found that 106 out of 614 upregulated genes were targets of Foxj1, among which 77 were direct targets (Supplementary Table 3).

<p>In order to confirm these results and to identify processes affected at the post- transcriptional level in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry of brains from 5 <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> adult fish and 5 control siblings. This analysis detected 5706 proteins present in at least 4 over the 5 replicates, of which 172 are associated with a P value &lt; 0.05 and a Log2FC &gt; +0.75 and &lt; −0.75. 127 proteins were present in higher and 45 in lower quantity, as illustrated on the volcano plot (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> and Supplementary Table 4). Pathways enriched in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brains included regulation of vesicular trafficking and membrane repair processes, as well as proteolysis and catabolic processes, suggesting profound perturbation of cellular homeostasis (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). Among the proteins that were present in highest quantity in mutants, several members of the Annexin family were identified: Anxa2a, Anxa1a, Anxa5b (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>. Annexins are associated with membranes from endo and exovesicles as well as plasma membranes and involved in a wide array of intracellular trafficking processes such as cholesterol endocytosis, plasma membrane repair as well as modulation of immune system functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Boye and Nylandsted, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Grewal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rentero et al., 2018</xref>). Of note, only four proteins of that list, Anxa2a, C4, C7a and Stat3, were the products of genes up-regulated in the transcriptomic study (indicated in red in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). In agreement with the common enriched GO terms in both studies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>), these four proteins are associated with immune response. Overall, <italic>rpgrip1l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants at scoliosis onset present deregulated pathways in common with other scoliotic models such as activation of immune response genes, but also specific deregulated pathways such a marked activation of the Foxj1a ciliary motility program and an increase of Annexin levels.</p>

<title>Astrogliosis precedes scoliosis onset of rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup> juvenile fish</title>
<p>Both transcriptomic and proteomic analysis highlighted the occurrence of innate and adaptive immune responses in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fish. Several upregulated genes, such as <italic>irg1l, mmp9 and anxa2,</italic> are reported to be expressed in macrophages and/or microglia but also in epithelia or neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hall et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kuhlmann et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Shan et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore investigated in which cell type(s) Anxa2, the most upregulated protein in the <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brain proteome, was expressed. Immunostaining of brain sections revealed a strong Anxa2 staining on cells lining brain ventricles, such as SCO cells and ventral ependymal cells of the rhombencephalic ventricle (RhV) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B’, D’</xref>) in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> adult fish, which was barely detectable in controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A’, C’</xref>), and to a lesser extent on other brain regions (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S5 A’-F’</xref>), suggesting a deregulation of ependymal cell homeostasis. In mutants, Anxa2 staining spread over long cellular extensions reaching the pial surface of the rhombencephalon (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D’</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S5F’</xref>). This cell shape is characteristic of radial glial cells, a cell type that behaves as neural and glial progenitors and also plays astrocytic functions in zebrafish, as anamniote brains are devoid of stellate astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lyons and Talbot, 2015</xref>). To confirm the glial nature of Anxa2-positive cells around brain ventricles in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish, we double-labeled brain sections with GFAP, a glial cell marker, and Anxa2. In adult <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fish, SCO cells were strongly double-positive for Anxa2 and GFAP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B, B’</xref>), while controls displayed much weaker labeling for GFAP in the SCO and no labeling for Anxa2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 A, A’</xref>). We made similar observations at rhombencephalic ventricle (RhV) and other brain levels: ependymal cells were positive for Anxa2 and strongly positive for GFAP, and GFAP labeling was much higher in mutants than in controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 C-D’</xref>; <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S5A-F’</xref>). GFAP overexpression is a hallmark of astrogliosis, a process in which astroglial cells react to the perturbed environment, as shown during brain infection, injury, ischemia or neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Escartin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Matusova et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zamanian et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the strong increase of GFAP staining combined with Anxa2 overexpression in brain ependymal cells of <italic>rpgrip1<sup>l-/-</sup></italic> adult fish strongly suggests that these cells undergo astrogliosis as observed in other animal models following CNS injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zamanian et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>To assay whether an astrogliosis-like phenotype was already present at scoliotic onset, we immunostained GFAP on juvenile brain sections of straight and tail-up mutants and controls. Tail-up juveniles (n=3/3) presented a strong GFAP staining in almost all cells of the SCO and along the ventral rhombencephalic ventricle, higher than control levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 E, I, H, L, M</xref>) while the phenotype of straight fish was heterogeneous: two out of four juveniles presented GFAP-positive cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G, K</xref> and red dots on <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref> graph), while the two other did not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F, J</xref> and green dots on <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref> graph) as confirmed by cell quantification (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref>).

<title>Immune cell enrichment around the SCO and within tectum parenchyma is detected prior to scoliosis onset</title>
<p>Astrogliosis may be reinforced or induced by an inflammatory environment containing cytokines released by microglia or macrophages or the presence of high levels of ROS and NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sofroniew, 2015</xref>). We thus performed immunostaining for the LCP1/L- Plastin marker, which labels both macrophages and microglia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N-Q’</xref>), in adjacent sections to those used for GFAP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-L</xref>). We found that the scoliotic fish presented a higher number of LCP1-positive cells of ameboid shape within SCO cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Q, Q’, R</xref>). Strikingly, the straight mutants (2/4) that presented a high GFAP staining within SCO cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G, K</xref>) also showed a higher number of LCP1-positive cells around the SCO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6P, P’</xref>; red dots in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6R</xref>) than in controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N, N’</xref>), while the other straight mutants did not ((<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F, J, O, O’</xref>, green dots in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref>) suggesting positive regulation between astrogliosis and macrophages/microglia recruitment. LCP1+ cells were also detected in other regions of the brain (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S5 G-K</xref>). In the optic tectum, where resident LCP1-positive macrophages/microglia were present in controls, a two-fold increase in the number of ramified LCP1<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in straight <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>juveniles compared to controls (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S5H-J</xref>).

<p>Our data thus uncovers an early astrogliosis process initiated asynchronously at the SCO and RhV levels of straight <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish, favored by a transient inflammatory state, and preceding the loss of multiciliated tufts around the SCO and that of the RF, that we only detected in curved <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fish.

In addition, we found among the upregulated genes in dorsal trunk at scoliosis onset, a number of activated astrocyte markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Matusova et al., 2023</xref>) such as <italic>s100b</italic>, <italic>c4b</italic>, <italic>gfap</italic>, <italic>glast/slc1a3b</italic>, <italic>viml</italic>, <italic>ctsb</italic> (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4D</xref>), showing that astrogliosis spread over the whole central nervous system.</p>

<p>To test for the presence of astrogliosis, we quantified the number of SCO cells presenting high GFAP labeling on several sections along the A/P extent of the SCO in 3 control and 3 <italic>cep290<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brains (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G-K</xref>). 50% of SCO cells presented strong GFAP staining in fully scoliotic juveniles, which was not detectable in controls (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H, K</xref>, N=2/3), while a lower proportion (22%) of SCO cells was GFAP positive in the juvenile with a milder curvature (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8M</xref>, N=1/3). Strong GFAP staining was also detected in some diencephalic radial glial cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8K</xref>). On the same sections, immune cells were quantified by LCP1 staining. A mean of 4 LCP1 positive cells per SCO field was found in <italic>cep290<sup>-/-</sup>,</italic> versus 1 in controls (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8I, L</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">N</xref>). As in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants, abnormal monocilia, astrogliosis and immune cell enrichment were evidenced at SCO levels in <italic>Cep290 <sup>-/-</sup></italic>(3/3). Furthermore, astrogliosis was observed within radial glial cells lining the RhV at cerebellar level (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8O-R</xref>) and at anterior hindbrain level (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8S-V</xref>), as shown in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> scoliotic brain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D, K, L</xref>). This indicates that astrogliosis is shared by these two zebrafish scoliotic models, even though they develop axis curvature at different stages (3-4 wpf for <italic>cep290<sup>-/-</sup></italic> versus 5-12 wpf for <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we dissected the mechanisms of scoliosis appearance in a zebrafish mutant for the TZ gene <italic>rpgrip1l</italic>, taking advantage of its asynchronous onset to decipher the chronology of events leading to spine torsion. Transcriptome analysis of the brain and trunk at scoliosis onset in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish compared to control siblings revealed increased expression of <italic>urp1/2</italic>, <italic>foxj1a</italic> and its target genes, as well as genes linked to immune response. Genetic experiments ruled out an involvement of increased Urp1/2 signaling in scoliosis development. Cilia defects appeared asynchronously in different CNS regions, while RF loss strictly coincided with scoliosis onset. Strikingly, we observed a strong increase of GFAP staining along the diencephalic and rhombencephalic ventricles, indicative of astrogliosis. This astrogliosis preceded scoliosis onset and then spread posteriorly and increased in severity. In the region of the SCO, the appearance of astrogliosis and neuroinflammation coincided temporally, preceding the onset of RF depolymerization and spine torsion. NACET treatment showed that increased astrogliosis and inflammation participated in the penetrance and severity of scoliosis in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish. Finally, we showed that another TZ gene mutant, <italic>cep290</italic>, also displayed astrogliosis at the time of scoliosis onset. Thus, the cascade of events uncovered in the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant sheds a new light on the origin of zebrafish scoliosis caused by ciliary TZ defects.</p>
<p>Cilia motility defects lead to RF loss and to scoliosis in several zebrafish mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grimes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rose et al., 2020</xref>)). <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic> encodes a TZ protein important for cilia integrity and function in many eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andreu-Cervera et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gogendeau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wiegering et al., 2018</xref>). Our data show that <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> deficiency in zebrafish affects cilia maintenance differentially depending on the CNS territory and the developmental stage, raising the question of which ciliated cells are responsible for RF loss and scoliosis initiation in this mutant. The full rescue observed after re-introducing RPGRIP1L in <italic>foxj1a</italic>-expressing cells points towards a crucial function of the protein in cells lining CNS cavities. Foxj1a- positive cell populations encompass both monociliated and multiciliated ependymal cells, radial glial progenitors, glial cells of the SCO and the ChP, as well as CSF- contacting sensory neurons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">D’Gama et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Prendergast et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Ribeiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Van Gennip et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work suggested that impairment of ciliogenesis in the fChP of the <italic>katnb1</italic> mutant could play a role in inducing axis curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Meyer-Miner et al., 2022</xref>). In the case of the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant, we temporally uncorrelated fChP cilia defects from scoliosis onset. This, combined with the fact that the total loss of multicilia in the fChP of [<italic>foxj1b<sup>-/-</sup>, gmnc</italic><sup>-/-</sup>] double mutants does not trigger axis curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">D’Gama et al., 2021</xref>) suggests that another <italic>foxj1a</italic>-expressing population is crucial for axis straightness. Our results strongly suggest that cilia defects in the SCO trigger axis curvature in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants. Two cilia populations were affected in the SCO of <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant juveniles at the onset of scoliosis: cilia of monociliated glial cells that secrete SCO-spondin, which appeared longer in mutants than in controls, and multiciliated tufts at SCO exit, which were lost in scoliotic mutants. Both defects could be responsible for the phenotype, by perturbing CSF flow and content (presence of SCO-spondin aggregates in ventricles) (left side on the Graphical Abstract) and leading to ventricular dilations or by perturbing primary cilia signaling within SCO cells (right side of the Graphical Abstract). The observation that multiciliated cells were not yet fully differentiated in <italic>cep290</italic> mutants at scoliosis onset is in favor of a prominent role of monocilia. This is consistent with the literature showing that most ciliary mutant models develop axis curvature at 3-4 weeks, a stage when brain multiciliated cells are not yet differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">D’Gama et al., 2021</xref>). Still, as scoliosis onset in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant is asynchronous from 5 to 12 weeks, MCC loss at SCO exit could contribute to defective RF polymerization.</p>
<p>Our model for scoliosis appearance in the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant is presented in the graphical abstract. Since we have observed several straight <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish with astrogliosis and increased immune cells presence around the SCO, we propose that <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> SCO and astroglial cells experience altered signaling that activates immune cell recruitment, producing an inflammatory environment. This would promote multicilia loss as a secondary event (Graphical Abstract, orange arrow) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lattke et al., 2012</xref>) leading to RF depolymerization and spine curvature. However, as <italic>sspo <sup>-/-</sup></italic> hypomorphic mutants which present aggregates within ventricles have been shown to present an inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rose et al., 2020</xref>), it is equally possible that SCO astrogliosis is a downstream consequence of the presence of these proteoglycans aggregates in contact with primary cilia or ventricular cell surfaces (Graphical Abstract, green arrow). These two scenarios may also act in parallel to reinforce scoliosis onset and ependymal cilia loss. Future experiments will help to discriminate between these two scenarios.</p>
<p>Our transcriptome analysis and qRT-PCR data challenges a model proposed for axis straightness of zebrafish embryos in which the loss of RF leads to a down-regulation of <italic>urp2</italic> and <italic>urp1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) since we observed an upregulation of both genes before and after RF loss. As forced expression of <italic>urp1/2</italic> induces a tail- up phenotype in embryos and juveniles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gaillard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lu et al., 2020</xref>), we attempted to rescue <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> axis curvature by down-regulating <italic>urp1/2</italic> expression. No beneficial effect on scoliosis penetrance or severity was observed, indicating that increased <italic>urp1/2</italic> expression level does not significantly contribute to axis curvature in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fish.</p>
<p>In this study, we found an unexpected and strong defect characterized by enhanced GFAP and Anxa2 expression, which we identified as astrogliosis (also called reactive astrogliosis). Astrogliosis is a reaction of astroglial cells to perturbed homeostasis of the CNS, characterized by molecular and phenotypic changes in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Escartin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Matusova et al., 2023</xref>). In zebrafish, radial glial cells are endowed with both neurogenic and astrocytic functions, and are thus also called astroglial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2020</xref>). Astrogliosis in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants arose in a subdomain of Foxj1a-positive cells, within the DiV and ventral ependymal cells lining the RhV. The observation of astrogliosis in some straight juvenile mutants suggests an early role of this defect in scoliosis onset.</p>
<p>Astrogliosis along the ventricular cavities could arise in response to local mechanical or chemical perturbations caused by cilia motility defects, abnormal CSF flow and content and ventricular dilations. In two murine models of primary ciliary dyskinesia, decreased CSF flow was associated with gliosis at juvenile stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Finn et al., 2014</xref>). A response to CSF pertubation in <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutants is also suggested by the strong upregulation of Foxj1a and its target genes. <italic>foxj1a</italic> expression is also reported to be upregulated in the CNS of three other scoliotic models in addition to <italic>rpgrip1l</italic>, namely in <italic>ptk7, sspo</italic> and <italic>katnb1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Escartin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Meyer-Miner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Van Gennip et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that it constitutes a common response to similar ventricular and CSF defects. Interestingly, <italic>foxj1a</italic> expression is also upregulated upon zebrafish embryonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cavone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hellman et al., 2010</xref>) or adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Ribeiro et al., 2017</xref>) spinal cord injury. The up-regulation in the <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> mutant proteome of the membrane repair module Anxa2-S100a10-Ahnak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bharadwaj et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) together with the Foxj1-induced motility module detected in the transcriptomic analysis may indicate ongoing reparation attempts of CNS ventricles and associated neural tissues.</p>
<p>Moreover, the presence of few Lcp1+ cells around the mutant SCO suggests that microglia/macrophages could participate in astrogliosis establishment and reinforcement. This dialogue between immune Lcp1+ cells and astroglial cells is evidenced during early stages of regeneration after acute injury or cellular damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cavone et al., 2021</xref>). In our bulk RNAseq analysis performed at scoliosis onset, we have indications of the upregulation of microglia and macrophage markers (<italic>p2ry12</italic> and <italic>mpeg1</italic>) at trunk levels and of numerous markers of activated astrocytes characterized in several mammalian astrogliosis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Matusova et al., 2023</xref>). A similar dialogue is detected in polycystic kidney disease models where compromised primary cilia signalling leads to uncontrolled cytokines secretion by epithelial cells, a situation that favors local immune cells recruitment and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Viau et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>What are the intracellular mechanisms involved in astrogliosis induction in ciliated ventricular cells? Candidate pathways emerge from our multi-omics studies. Proteomic data showed a 2.4-fold increase in GSK3bb amount in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant brains (P value &lt; 0.001, Supplementary Table 3). In several neurodegenerative murine animal models, GSK3b enzymatic activity was shown to promote inflammation and gliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorge-Torres et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Medina and Avila, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mines et al., 2011</xref>). Another potential trigger of astrogliosis may be a defective mitochondrial activity as the amounts of four proteins involved in electron transport chain activity (<italic>gpd1b, mt-nd6, pdia5 and dmgdh</italic>) were reduced by 40% to 86% in the analysis of mutant brain proteome (Supplementary Table 4). We think this is of particular interest in light of a recent report demonstrating that impaired mitochondrial activity within ciliated astrocytes leads to the induction of the Foxj1 ciliary motility program, the elongation and distortion of astrocyte primary cilia as well as reactive astrogliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ignatenko et al., 2023</xref>), three phenotypes also observed in <italic>rpgrip1l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brains.</p>
<p>Finally, our observation of widespread astrogliosis in two TZ gene mutants, <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> and <italic>cep290</italic>, suggests that it could represent a general mechanism involved in scoliosis downstream of cilia dysfunction. Of note, astrogliosis markers such as <italic>glast/slc1a3b</italic>, <italic>vim</italic>, <italic>s100b</italic>, <italic>c4</italic>, <italic>timp2b</italic>, <italic>gfap</italic> and <italic>ctssb.2</italic>, are also upregulated in the transcriptome of <italic>ptk7 mutants</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Van Gennip et al., 2018</xref>). We propose that sustained astrogliosis might impair neuronal survival and activity, crucial for proper interoception and locomotor control, thus leading to axis curvature in the context of a rapidly growing axial skeleton. A similar context of astrocytosis associated with spinal cord dilation has been observed in human patients with syringomyelia. This population with a high incidence of scoliosis can present hyper-signals on T2 MRI scans, which were proposed to reflect local astrocytosis and could be validated by biopsies in rare cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sherman et al., 1987</xref>). Further imaging studies will need to be performed to validate a potential link between developing astrogliosis and the onset and progression of idiopathic scoliosis in humans.</p>

<p>CRISPR target sites were selected for their high predicted specificity and efficiency using the CRISPOR online tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Haeussler et al., 2016</xref>). Real efficiency was assessed on zebrafish embryos by T7E1 test. The two most efficient guides (Rpgrip1l_x4_G1: GCTTACGGTCCTTCACCAGACGG and Rpgrip1l_x25_G3: CCTCAGTTGACAGGTTTCAGCGG) respectively situated 24 nt from the beginning of exon 4 and 82 nt downstream of exon 25 were kept for further experiments. sgRNA transcription templates were obtained by PCR using T7_Rpgrip1l-x4_G1_Fw primer (5′-GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCTTACGGTCCTTCACCAGAGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGC- 3′) or T7_Rpgrip1l-x25_G3_Fw (5′- GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCCTCAGTTGACAGGTTTCAGGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAG C-3′) as forward primer and sgRNA_R universal primer (5′- AAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCCACTTTTTCAAGTTGATAACGGACTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTA TTTCTAGCTCTAAAAC-3′) as reverse primer. sgRNAs were transcribed using Megascript T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and purified using NucleoSpin® RNA Clean up XS kit (Macherey Nagel, DuLJren, Germany). sgRNA:Cas9 RNP complex was obtain by incubating Cas9 protein (gift of TACGENE, Paris, France) (7.5 μM) with sgRNA (10 μM) in 20 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl for 10 min at 28 °C. 1–2 nl was injected per embryo. For deletion, Rpgrip1l_x4_G1 and Rpgrip1l_x25_G3 RNP complexes were mixed half and half.</p>

<title>Screening and genotyping</title>
<p>Injected (F0) fish were screened for germline transmission by crossing with wild type fish and extracting genomic DNA from resulting embryos. For genomic DNA extraction, caudal fin (juveniles/adults) or whole embryo DNA were used. Genomic DNA was isolated with Proteinase K (PK) digestion in 40 of lysis buffer (100 mM Tris- HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 0.1 μg/μl Proteinase K (PK)) for embryos (300 μl for adult fin) overnight at 37°C with agitation. PK was inactivated for 10 min at 90°C and a five-fold dilution was used as template for PCR amplification. Combined genotyping of wild type and mutant alleles (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1A’</xref>) was performed by PCR using 3 primers, a common reverse primer for both alleles : Rpgrip1l_ex25_R3 (GTTGTGTCTCTGCCATATATTG), a specific forward primer for the deleted allele: Rpgrip1l-ex4-del (CCCACACTGCATACGCACTC) and a specific forward primer for the wild type allele : Rpgrip1l_ex25F (AGTGTGCGGTACATCTCCAA) at an annealing temperature of 60°C for 35 cycles. Expected size of the amplified fragment is 364 nt for the wild type allele and 544nt for the mutant allele. The deleted allele presents a frameshift at position N77 leading to the generation of a STOP codon after 11 aas, thus leading to a N-terminally truncated protein at position 88/1256 aas.</p>
<p>For genotyping the <italic>urp2</italic> mutant line, caudal fins from adult fish were extracted in 300µl of lysis solution and PCR was performed as above to detect exon 5 deletion using the following primers: urp2-F1 (TGATTACTAGCCCTGTCCCAAC) and urp2-R1 (AGGTACAGTACACACGTCACAG).</p>

<title>μCT scans</title>
<p>The samples were scanned on a Bruker micro scanner (Skyscan 1272) with a resolution of 8.5 μm, a rotation step of 0.55° and a total rotation of 180°. For the acquisition of adult fish (2.5 cm), a 0.25 mm aluminium filter was used, for a voltage of 50 kV and an intensity of 180 mA, for juvenile fish (0.9 to 1.2 cm) the filter was omitted, and a voltage of 60 kV was used with an intensity of 166 mA. Each image contained 1008 x 672 pixels and was based on the average of 3 images. The 3D reconstruction by backprojection was carried out by the NRecon software and the 2D image overlays were then cleaned by the CT Analyser software. The Dataviewer software allowed all fish skeletons to be oriented in the same way taking the otoliths as landmarks. The CTvox software then allowed 3D visualizing of the samples. Morphometric analysis was performed with the CT Analyser software.</p>

<title>Scanning electron microscopy</title>
<p>3 month fish (3 controls, 5 mutants) were euthanized using lethal concentration of MS222 (0.028 mg/mL). The brains were quickly dissected in 1.22 X PBS (pH 7.4), 0.1 M sodium cacodylate and fixed overnight with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.61 X PBS (pH 7.4), 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at 4°C. They were sectioned along the dorsal midline with a razor blade to expose their ventricular surfaces. Both halves were washed four times in 1.22 X PBS and post-fixed for 15 minutes in 1.22 X PBS containing 1% OsO4. Fixed samples were washed four times in ultrapure water, dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol and critical point dried (CPD 300, Leica) at 79 bar and 38 °C with liquid CO2 as the transition fluid and then depressurized slowly (0,025 bar/s). They were then mounted on aluminum mounts with conductive silver cement. Sample surfaces were coated with a 5 nm platinum layer using a sputtering device (ACE 600, Leica). Samples were observed under high vacuum conditions using a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (Gemini 500, Zeiss) operating at 5 kV, with a 20 μm objective aperture diameter and a working distance around 3 mm. Secondary electrons were collected with an in-lens detector. Scan speed and line compensation integrations were adjusted during observation.</p>

<title>Histological sections of juvenile and immunofluorescence on sections</title>
<p>Juvenile and adult zebrafish were euthanized using lethal concentration of MS222 (0.028 mg/mL). Pictures and size measurements were systematically taken before fixation. Fish were fixed in Zamboni fixative [35 ml PFA 4 %, 7.5 ml saturated picric acid (1.2 %), 7.5 ml 0.2M Phosphate Buffer (PB)] [55] overnight at 4°C under agitation. Fish were washed with Ethanol 70% and processed for dehydration by successive 1 h incubation in Ethanol (3 x 70% and 2 x 100%) at room temperature under agitation, then for paraffin inclusion. 14 μm sagittal paraffin sections were obtained using a Leica RM2125RT microtome. Sections were deparaffinized and antigen retrieval was performed by incubation for 7 min in boiling citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6). Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andreu-Cervera et al., 2019</xref>). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-RF, anti-Acetylated Tubulin, anti-Glutamylated Tubulin, anti-Arl13b, anti-LCP1, anti- AnnexinA2. Corresponding primary and secondary antibodies are described and referenced in the Resources Table.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence on whole embryos</title>
<p>Embryos from 24 to 40 hpf were fixed 4 hr to overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C. For Reissner fiber staining, larvae at 48 and 72 hpf were fixed 2 hr in 4% PFA and 3% sucrose at 4°C, skin from the rostral trunk and yolk were removed. Samples from 24 to 40 hpf embryos were blocked overnight in a solution containing 0.5% Triton, 1% DMSO, 10% normal goat serum and 2 mg/mL BSA. For older samples (48 to 72 hpf) triton concentration was increased to 0.7%. Primary antibodies were incubated one to two nights at 4°C in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton, 1% DMSO, 1% NGS and 1 mg/mL BSA. All secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes, used at 1:400 in blocking buffer, and incubated a minimum of 2.5 hr at room temperature. The primary antibodies chosen for in toto immuno-labeling against Reissner fiber, Acetylated-tubulin, Myc, Arl13b and Gamma-tubulin as well as the corresponding secondary antibodies are referenced in the Key Resources Table. Whole mount zebrafish embryos (dorsal or lateral mounting in Vectashield Mounting Medium) were imaged on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope and Zeiss LSM910 confocal microscope, both equipped with a 63X immersion objective. Images were then processed using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Whole-mount brain clearing</title>
<p>Brains were dissected from 4-5 wpf size-matched (0.9-1.2 mm length) zebrafish after in toto fixation with formaldehyde. Whole–mount tissue clearing was performed following the zPACT protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Affaticati et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, brains were infused for 2 days in hydrogel monomer solution (4% acrylamide, 0.25% VA- 044, 1% formaldehyde and 5% DMSO in 1X PBS) at 4°C. Polymerization was carried out for 2h30 at 37°C in a desiccation chamber filled with pure nitrogen. Brains were transferred into histology cassettes and incubated in clearing solution (8% SDS and 200 mM boric acid in dH2O) at 37°C with gentle agitation for 8 days. Cleared brains were washed in 1X PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBT) for 3 days at room temperature and kept in 0.5% formaldehyde, 0.05% sodium azide in PBT at 4°C until further processing.

<title>Volumetric analysis of the posterior ventricles</title>
<p>The volumes of the posterior ventricles were segmented, reconstructed and analyzed using Amira for Life &amp; Biomedical Sciences software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In essence the ventricles volumes were manually segmented in Amira’s segmentation editor and subsequently refined by local thresholding and simplification of the corresponding surfaces. Volumes, which were open to the environment were artificially closed with minimal surfaces by connecting the distal-most points of their surface to the contralaterally corresponding points using straight edges. Due to the biologic variability of the sample population the overall size of the specimens needed to be normalized to keep the measured volumes comparable. For this spatial normalization one of the specimens was randomly selected from the wildtype population as template (1664, grey) and the ‘Registration’ module in Amira was used to compute region-specific rigid registrations for the other specimens, allowing for isotropic scaling only [details in supp. mat.]. For excluding the influence of the ventricular volumes, the registration was computed on the basis of the independent reference stain (DiIC18) (details in supp. mat.). Region specific volume differences between the mutant and wildtype population were evaluated on seven subvolumes of the posterior ventricles (details in supp. mat.).</p>

Zebrafish brain samples were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma) with 1/100 antiprotease and sonicated for 5 minutes. After a 660 nm protein assay (Thermo), samples were digested using a Single Pot Solid Phase enhanced Sample Preparation (SP3) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, 40 µg of each protein extract was reduced with 12mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and alkylated using 40 mM iodoacetamic acid (IAM). A mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic magnetic beads was used to clean-up the proteins at a ratio of 20:1 beads:proteins (Sera-Mag Speed beads, Fisher Scientific). After addition of ACN to a final concentration of 50%, the beads were allowed to bind to the proteins for 18 minutes. Protein-bead mixtures were washed twice with 80% EtOH and once with 100% ACN.

Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine residues and acetylation of proteins’ n-termini were set as variable modifications. Identification results were imported into the Proline software (version 2.1.2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proline.profiproteomics.fr">http://proline.profiproteomics.fr</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bouyssié et al., 2020</xref>) for validation. Peptide Spectrum Matches (PSM) with pretty ranks equal to one were retained. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was then optimized to be below 1% at PSM level using Mascot Adjusted E-value and below 1% at protein level using Mascot Mudpit score.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Djebar et al. perform a comprehensive analysis of mutant phenotypes associated with the onset and progression of scoliosis in zebrafish ciliary transition zone mutants rpgrip1l and cep290. They determine that rpgrip1l is required in foxj1a-expressing cells for normal spine development, and that scoliosis is associated with brain ventricle dilations, loss of Reissner fiber polymerization, and the loss of 'tufts' of multi-cilia surrounding the subcommissural organ (the source of Reissner substance). Informed by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, they identify a neuroinflammatory response in rpgrip1l and cep290 mutants that is associated with astrogliosis and CNS macrophage/microglia recruitment. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory drug treatment reduced scoliosis penetrance and severity in rpgrip1l mutants. Based on their data, the authors propose a feed-forward loop between astrogliosis, induced by perturbed ventricular homeostasis, and immune cells recruitment as a novel pathogenic mechanism of scoliosis in zebrafish ciliary transition zone mutants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Comprehensive characterization of the causes of scoliosis in ciliary transition zone mutants rpgrip1l and cep290</p>
<p>
- Comparison of rpgrip1l mutants pre- and post-scoliosis onset allowed authors to identify specific phenotypes as being correlated with spine curvature, including brain ventricle dilations, loss of Reissner fiber, and loss of cilia in proximity to the subcommissural organ</p>
<p>
- Elegant genetic demonstration that increased urotensin peptide levels do not account for spinal curvature in rpgrip1l mutants</p>
<p>
- The identification of astrogliosis and Annexin over-expression in glial cells surrounding diencephalic and rhombencephalic ventricles as being correlated with scoliosis onset and severe curve progression is a very interesting finding, which may ultimately inform pathogenic mechanisms driving spine curvature</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The fact that cilia loss/dysfunction and Reissner fiber defects cause scoliosis in zebrafish is already well established in the literature, as is the requirement for cilia in foxj1a-expressing cells</p>
<p>
- Neuroinflammation has already been identified as the underlying pathogenic mechanism in at least 2 previously published scoliosis models (zebrafish ptk7a and sspo mutants)</p>
<p>
- Anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin, NAC and NACET have also previously been demonstrated to suppress scoliosis onset and severe curve progression in these models</p>
<p>
Therefore, although similar observations in rpgrip1l and cep290 mutants (as reported here) add to a growing body of literature that supports a common biological mechanism underlying spine curvature in zebrafish, novelty of reported findings is diminished.</p>
<p>
- Although authors demonstrate that astrogliosis and/or macrophage or microglia cell recruitment are correlated with scoliosis, they do not formally demonstrate that these events are sufficient to drive spine curvature. Thus, the functional consequences of astrogliosis and microglia infiltration remain uncertain.</p>
<p>
- Authors do not investigate the effect of anti-inflammatory treatments on other phenotypes they have correlated with spinal curve onset (like ventricle dilation, Reissner fiber loss, and multi-cilia loss around the subcommissural organ). This would help to identify causal events in scoliosis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Djebar et al investigated the role and the underlying mechanism of the ciliary transition zone protein Rpgrip1l in zebrafish spinal alignment. They showed that rpgrip1l mutant zebrafish develop a nearly full penetrance of body curvature at juvenile stages. The mutant fish have cilia defects associated with ventricular dilations and loss of the Reissner fibers. Scoliosis onset and progression are also strongly associated with astrogliosis and neuroinflammation, and anti-inflammatory drug treatment prevents scoliosis in mutant zebrafish, suggesting a novel pathogenic mechanism for human idiopathic scoliosis. This study is quite comprehensive with high quality data, and the manuscript is well written, providing important information on how the ciliary transition zone protein functions in maintaining the zebrafish body axis straightness.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Very clear and comprehensive analysis of the mutant zebrafish.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Please provide more background about Rpgrip1l in the introduction, particularly the past studies of mammalian homolog of Rpgrip11, if any? Is there any human disease associated with Rpgrip1l? Do these patients have scoliosis phenotype?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• We have added more background on the human ciliopathies caused by <italic>RPGRIP1L</italic> mutations and on their occasional association with early onset scoliosis (lines 45-54 page 2 in the introduction, see cited references).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The allele is a large deficiency of most of the coding region of rpgrip1l, can you give details in the Supplementary data of how you show this by genotyping? It would be good to explain that this mutation is most likely behaving as a null, if you have RNAseq data that supports this please note that. Otherwise, it may be incorrect to assume it is a null allele as your shorthand nomenclature states. If you do not have stronger evidence that the deficiency allele is behaving as a null allele, then please think about using an allele nomenclature as outlined at ZFIN:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• We now describe in the results section (Lines 72-76, page 3) the extent of the deletion of <italic>rpgrip1l ∆/∆</italic> (22 exons out of 26) that creates an early stop at position 88 of 1256 aas. We have submitted to ZFIN our two novel mutant lines: <italic>rpgrip1l∆</italic>  is recorded as <italic>rpgrip1l bps1</italic> and <italic>rpgrip1l ex4</italic> as <italic>rpgrip1l bps2</italic> , and we provide this information in the text. Transcriptomics data confirmed this allele is behaving as a null as the most down-regulated transcript found in the brain of <italic>rpgrip1l ∆/∆</italic> is <italic>rpgrip1l</italic> transcript itself, (volcano plot in Fig 5A, described in the results, Line 270-71, page 9).</p>
<p>• We also have provided in Supplementary Figure 1 A’ a picture of a typical genotyping gel for the <italic>rpgrip1l∆</italic> allele. Sequences of both CRISPR guide RNAs and genotyping primers are provided in the Math &amp; Meth section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to zebrafish mutant phenotypes as &quot;juvenile scoliosis&quot;. However, scoliosis may not appear until 11 weeks post-fertilization in some animals. After 6-8 weeks of age, it would be more appropriate to describe the phenotype as &quot;late-onset or adult scoliosis&quot; to differentiate between other reported scoliosis mutants (such as hypomorphic or dominant negative alleles of scospondin) that start body curvatures at 3-5 dpf .</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• We think we can really qualify <italic>rpgrip1l-</italic>/- scoliosis as being a “juvenile scoliosis” as shown by the time course displayed in Fig 1B: <italic>rpgrip1l-</italic>/- scoliosis develops asynchronously between 4 weeks and 9 weeks (from 0.8 cm/1 cm to 1.6 cm, corresponding to juvenile stages according to Parichy et al, 2009 PMID: 19891001), after which it reaches a plateau. Half of the mutants are already scoliotic by 5 weeks and no scoliosis develops at adult stage, ie from 10 weeks on. We have acknowledged the late onset scoliosis in page 3 line 93.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) A more careful demonstration of the individual vertebrae, using magnified high-resolution pictures in Figures 1D-G, should be made to more clearly show no obvious vertebral malformations are present.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• We now provide a movie in Sup Data that presents 3D views of controls and mutant spines, which show the intervertebral spaces as well as vertebral shape and size. With these images we could exclude vertebral fusion and the presence of dysmorphic vertebrae.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) On page 5: the authors comment on transgenic expression of RPGRIP1L in foxj1a-lineages as &quot;rescuing&quot; scoliosis. This terminology is confusing, as rescuing a condition could be interpreted as inducing it where it was once absent. &quot;Suppressing&quot; scoliosis may be a more appropriate term.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• We agree with the reviewers, the “rescue” term is confusing, we changed it for “suppress” in the title of the paragraph (line 95 page 3) and within the text (line 115 page 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) On page 5, lines 155-156: the authors state that &quot;Indeed, no tissue-specific rescue has been performed yet in zebrafish ciliary gene mutants&quot;. This is misleading, as ptk7a and katnb1 mutations both disrupt cilia, and transgenic reintroduction of both <italic>ptk7a</italic> and <italic>katnb1</italic> in <italic>foxj1a</italic>- expressing lineages has previously been shown to suppress cilia defects as well as scoliosis in these models. The statement should be removed for accuracy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• We agree that we were not precise enough in our sentence: when we mentioned “ciliary gene” mutants, we were referring to genes whose products are enriched within cilia and directly affecting ciliogenesis, cilia content and maintenance such as TZ or BBS genes, without encompassing genes like <italic>ptk7</italic> and <italic>katnb1</italic> whose products perform multiple functions on top of cilia maintenance such as Wnt signalling and remodelling of the whole microtubule network respectively. We have therefore modified our sentence by adding zebrafish ciliary “TZ and BBS” genes (line 104, page 4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figure 2: panels A-B: In the text (line 196) you state that cilia length was increased and that Arl13b content was severely reduced. However, Panel B shows no significant length difference between scoliotic mutants and controls. This statement and graph should be corrected for accuracy. Also, the Arl13b staining is difficult to see in panel A - can channels be split, and/or quantified?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• We have now split the Arl13b and glutamylated tubulin channels (Fig 2 A-C”). We think that the reduction of Arl13b staining intensity is now obvious in both straight and scoliotic mutants (Compare 2A” with 2B” and 2C”). We were not able to quantify Arl13b staining using ciliary masks from glutamylated tubulin staining since both staining only partially overlap along the length of the cilium, Arl13b being more distal than glutamylated tubulin (Fig 2A’).</p>
<p>• Ciliary length was significantly increased (from 3.4 to 5.3 µ) in straight <italic>rpgrip1l-</italic>/-, while the average mean values for scoliotic <italic>rpgrip1l-</italic>/- were heterogenous (mean 4.1µ) and therefore not significantly different when compared to controls. This heterogeneity stems from the combined presence of both shorter and longer cilia in scoliotic fish, a finding we interpreted by the potential breakage over time of extra-long and thin cilia observed in scoliotic fish (as in Sup figure 1 H’’’, Sup Fig 2M’ and 2O’).</p>
<p>• We changed the text to be more accurate: we now state that cilia length increased in straight mutants, and became more heterogenous than controls in scoliotic mutants (line 143-144, page 5).</p>

<p>(8) Figure 3: Page 7, line 206: authors state that SCO-spondin secreting cells varied in number along SCO length. What is the evidence that these cells secrete SCO-spondin? The staining shown in Figure 3L-O appears to demonstrate extracellular accumulation of sspo:GFP. What is the evidence that this staining originated from cells in proximity to it?</p>
<p>The claim of SCO-secreting cells in Figure 2E-J is confusing. I assume you are using anatomy to infer the SCO is captured in these sections. This should be done in sspo-GFP animals (as in Figure 3) and/or dual anti-body labeling can be done to show SCO-secreting cells and cilia.</p>

<p>• We now show in Supplementary Figure 2 A-D a double staining for Sco-spondin-GFP and cilia (Ac-tub, Glu-Tub). Analyzing GFP staining along SCO length on successive sections, we identified the SCO producing cells on the diencephalic dorsal midline by their position under the posterior commissure (PC), which forms an Acetylated Tubulin positive arch), and counted the nuclei surrounded by cytoplasmic GFP from the most anterior region ( 24 cells wide, Sup Fig 2A-A’) to the most posterior region (4-8 cells wide, Sup Fig 2 C).`</p>
<p>• Furthermore, the close-ups presented on Fig 2A’ and 2B’ allow to detect the cytoplasmic Sspo-GFP staining around SCO nuclei, above the region presenting primary cilia pointing towards the diencephalic ventricle, both in controls and mutants at scoliosis onset (tail-up mutants), showing that the extracellular staining in B’ very likely originates from these cells. In these tail-up mutants, extracellular Sspo aggregates have not yet filled the whole diencephalic ventricle as in Fig 3 N and Q.</p>

<p>(9) Figure 5: Is the transcriptome data and proteomic data consistent for any transcripts and encoded protein products? Please highlight those consistent targets in both analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• We would like to emphasize that the transcriptomic study was performed at scoliosis onset, at 5 weeks, while the proteomics analysis was performed at adult stage (3 months) so they cannot be directly compared.</p>
<p>Moreover, low abundance proteins (such as centrosomal proteins and transcription factors like Foxj1a ) are not detected by label-free proteomics, without prior subcellular fractionation procedure (Lindemann et al, 2017 PMID: 28282288). The extraction protocol also does not allow to purify short neuropeptides such as Urp1-2.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we found four targets in common, now highlighted in red in Fig 5, Panel E: Anxa2, complement proteins</p>
<p>C4 and C7a, and Stat3, all related to immune response, a GO term enriched in both studies as explained in the text (Lines 308-311, page 10).</p>
<p>The absence of many inflammation markers or immune response proteins at adult stage in scoliotic mutants most probably indicates a transient inflammatory episode at scoliosis onset, while astrogliosis, as detected by GFAP staining, increases with scoliosis severity. Along the same lines, the two-fold increase of Lcp1 cells within the tectum is present before axis curvature (in straight mutants) and disappears in scoliotic fish (Graph G in Sup Figure S5) as explained in the text, Lines 378-381, page 12,</p>

<p>(10) Supplementary Figure 1 F-H: What stage/age samples were used for SEM? It is only stated that they were 'adults'. It is also stated that cilia tufts in straight rpgrip1l-/- fish were morphologically normal but 'less dense'- this was not obvious from the figure. Can density be quantified? (otherwise, data does not support the statement). Similarly, can the statement that &quot;cilia of mono-ciliated ependymal cells showed abnormal irregular structures compared to controls, with either bulged or thinner parts&quot; be supported with measurements/quantification?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• The SEM study was performed on 3 months old fish, 3 controls and 5 mutants. We added this information in the figure legend. We could not quantify the number of ciliary tufts in the brain ventricle of the sole straight mutant that was analyzed. We therefore removed the statement that cilia were less dense in the straight mutant. Along the same lines, we mentioned that we could find mutant cilia of irregular shape as shown in Supplementary Figure S1, F”,G’’, H’’ and H’’’) (page 4, lines 124-129).</p>

<p>(11) Supplementary Figure 1D-E is never mentioned in the text. The Supplemental Figure legend also refers to a graph of cilia length that is not in the figure itself. As a result, many of the subsequent panel references are out of register.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• We now provide the correct version of the legend and refer to Sup Fig 1D-E in the text (page 3, lines 79-81) and its legend, page 53, lines 1616-1620.</p>

<p>(12) Supplementary Figure 2A-F: Of interest, in panels C and F, it looks as though sspo:GFP is accumulating on cilia within the ventricles of rpgrip1l mutants. Can this be explored? Is it possible that abnormal aggregation of SSPO on cilia is ultimately leading to cilia loss, as you report for multi-ciliated cells surrounding the subcommissural organ? This could be a very interesting finding and possible mechanism for cilia loss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• Our observation of all brain sections led us to conclude that the majority of Sspo-GFP aggregates were floating within the brain ventricles of <italic>rpgrip1l-</italic>/- fish while a portion of aggregates were stuck on ventricle walls, in close contact with cilia as now shown on Supplementary figure S2 B’, outlined in legend page 54, lines 1634-1637. We agree that the contact between Sspo aggregates and cilia might have damaging consequences, either on cilia maintenance or on immune reaction induction and we now mention these possibilities in the discussion page16, lines 524-526. These research lines will be explored in the near future.</p>

<p>(13) Supplementary Figure 5A-F is not mentioned in the manuscript. Please clarify the role of Anxa2 in neuroinflammation. Is increased Anxa2 expression in rpgrip1l mutant zebrafish reduced after anti-inflammatory drug treatment? What is the expression level of anxa2 in cep290 mutant zebrafish?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>• We have now added mention to Supplementary Figure 5A-F in the text page 10 lines 328-331.</p>
<p>• We unfortunately did not have enough histological material to test Anxa2 staining on NACET treated fish after performing GFAP and Lcp1 staining, neither for dilatation measurement or multiciliated cells quantification. We agree this would have helped to better define which defect might be an indirect consequence of an inflammatory environment.</p>
<p>• We tested the expression level of Anxa2 in <italic>cep290-/-</italic> fish. No labelling above control level was detected on <italic>cep290-/-</italic> brain sections that were positive for GFAP (N = 5). As GFAP staining in 3-4 weeks <italic>cep290-/-</italic> was not as intense and widespread as in adult <italic>rpgrip1l-/-</italic> (50% of GFAP + cells compared to 100% in the SCO for example), we concluded that Anxa2 expression may be upregulated after widespread or long-term astrogliosis/inflammation. Alternatively, Anxa2 overexpression could be specific to <italic>rpgrip1l-/-</italic> fish.</p>
