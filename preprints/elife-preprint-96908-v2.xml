<title>Abstract</title><p>Periodontitis, a prevalent inflammatory disease worldwide, poses a significant economic burden on society and the country. Previous research has established a connection between cellular senescence and periodontitis. However, the role and mechanism of cell senescence in the progression of periodontitis have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to explore the involvement of cellular senescence in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and determine the underlying mechanisms. Our findings demonstrated that senescent cells accumulated during the progress of periodontitis. Moreover, several scRNA-seq analysis suggested that gingival fibroblasts were the main cell population undergoing cellular senescence during periodontitis, which helps mitigate tissue damage and bone loss. Furthermore, we identified a high expression of CD81 in the senescent gingival fibroblast population. These cells were found to actively contribute to inflammation through their potent pro-inflammatory metabolic activity and secretion of SASP-related factors. Additionally, they recruited neutrophils via the C3/C3aR1 pathway, indirectly sustaining the inflammatory response. Senolytics via Navitoclax successfully alleviated inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis and administration of metformin could alleviate alleviated inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis through inhibiting cellular senescence. These results provide valuable insights into the cellular and molecular basis of periodontitis-induced tissue damage, highlighting the significance of fibroblast senescence. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the relationship between CD81 and cellular senescence, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for periodontitis.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of irreversible progressive tissue damage, alveolar bone loss and destruction of tooth supporting tissues, and is caused by microbial infections that eventually lead to tooth loosening and eventual tooth loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wolff, Dahlén, &amp; Aeppli, 1994</xref>). Periodontitis affects 11.2% of the global population and more than 40% of people over the age of 30, posing a major burden on public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eke, Borgnakke, &amp; Genco, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sanz et al., 2020</xref>). Clinical studies have shown that the prevalence and severity of periodontitis increase with age, and moderate loss of alveolar bone and periodontal attachment is common in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huttner, Machado, de Oliveira, Antunes, &amp; Hebling, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Cell senescence is a stress response characterized by irreversible proliferation arrest, resistance to apoptosis, and secretion of a range of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteases, known as senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coppé, Desprez, Krtolica, &amp; Campisi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rodier et al., 2009</xref>). Cellular senescence is considered necessary for tissue homeostasis as it aims to eliminate unnecessary damage and promote tissue repair through immune-mediated mechanisms, and even prevent the occurrence of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ohtani &amp; Hara, 2013</xref>). However, the specific environment of the gingival sulcus leads to persistent plaque in periodontal tissue, resulting in oxidative DNA damage as collateral damage of chronic bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aquino-Martinez et al., 2020</xref>). Repeated exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> (Pg), a key pathogen of periodontitis, can accelerate cellular senescence driven by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aquino-Martinez et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that bacteria can also induce senescence of healthy cells in an active oxygen-dependent manner by causing inflammation and excessive neutrophil activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lagnado et al., 2021</xref>). The aggravation or persistence of these stimulating factors can lead to abnormal accumulation of senescent cells and directly affect periodontal tissue function. Therefore, chronic bacterial infections can cause cell senescence through both direct and indirect mechanisms.</p>
<p>Senescent cells have been found to contribute to bacteria-induced inflammation, with the activation of SASPs playing a crucial role in the release of various pro-inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-6, and IL-8. Elevated levels of these inflammatory factors have been associated with periodontal damage and loss of alveolar bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aquino-Martinez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yu et al., 2024</xref>). However, the specific mechanism by which senescent cells contribute to the development of periodontitis remains unclear. In the immune response to periodontitis, dendritic cells (DCs) infected by Pg activate related SASPs, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, which ultimately accelerate the progression of periodontitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">El-Awady, Elashiry, Morandini, Meghil, &amp; Cutler, 2022</xref>). Additionally, the aging of T lymphocytes, which are crucial for adaptive immunity, leads to a significant alteration in their immunosuppressive ability in Th17/Treg subsets. This alteration ultimately results in the loss of tooth support and alveolar bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">González-Osuna et al., 2022</xref>). However, the role and mechanism of cellular senescence in the progression of periodontitis have not been thoroughly investigated.</p>
<p>The breakthrough technology of single-cell RNA sequencing has made it easier to analyze gene expression at the cellular level and identify key cell subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we utilized bulk-RNA seq, clinical periodontal samples, and a mice ligature-induced periodontitis model to demonstrate that cellular senescence levels increase with periodontitis progression. Through sc-RNA seq, in vitro, and in vivo experiments, we observed significant cellular senescence in gingival fibroblasts. Additionally, we identified a unique subgroup of gingival fibroblasts with high expression of CD81, which exhibited senescence characteristics such as ROS accumulation and enrichment of senescence genes. We propose that this subgroup of fibroblasts can directly promote the progression of periodontitis by secreting SASP-related factors, such as IL-6, and indirectly amplify inflammation by recruiting neutrophils through the complement pathway, specifically C3. We also found that targeting cellular senescence with senolytic drug or metformin can reduce inflammation and delay alveolar bone resorption in periodontitis.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Cellular senescence characteristics in periodontitis</title>
<p>Cellular senescence is a manifestation of aging at the cellular level. Although accumulation of senescent cells is normal in aged tissues, persistent bacterial infection and chronic inflammation promote the early onset of senescence by ROS activation and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aquino-Martinez, 2023</xref>). In clinical gingival specimens from periodontally healthy individuals of similar age and those diagnosed with periodontitis, we found that the senescence biomarker senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) was scarcely expressed in the gingiva of young healthy individuals. However, in gingival samples from patients with periodontitis, a notable increase in SA-β-gal-positive cells was observed, primarily localized in the lamina propria of gingival connective tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, IHC staining analysis revealed that other senescent biomarkers, such as cell cycle inhibitory proteins p16 and p21, and senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs) like H3K9me3, were significantly upregulated in human periodontitis gingival tissues as well (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>The clinical samples from periodontitis patients were often derived from older individuals, because periodontitis incidence obviously increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eke et al., 2020</xref>). To avoid confounding factors like age potentially affecting the experimental results, we also examined the levels of cellular senescence in the Ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) mouse model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). IHC staining results indicated that the protein expression level of p16 among gingiva was significantly upregulated following ligation, peaking at day 7 post-ligation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). And then, gingiva at day 7 post-ligation and healthy gingiva as control were collected for protein and gene analysis. Western blotting analysis showed that the protein levels of p16 in LIP 7D group was about 2 times of that in control group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). And the transcription of p16, p21, and Tp53 in gingival tissues were higher at day 7 post-ligation than those in control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, bulk RNA-sequencing was performed on gingival tissues from LIP 7D and healthy mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>), identifying 458 upregulated and 358 downregulated genes. Notably, among the upregulated genes, 19 senescence-associated genes were detected, including C3, Il6 and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also observed a significant upregulation of several SASPs genes such as Icam1, Mmp3, Nos3, Igfbp7, Igfbp4, Mmp14, Timp1, Ngf, Il6, Areg, and Vegfa in the LIP group (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref>). The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) enrichment analysis based on our sequencing data revealed the upregulation of the cellular senescence pathway in LIP mice <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, a significant reduction in oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was observed in the LIP group (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">C</xref>).</p>
<p>Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO BP) analysis of differentially expressed genes further demonstrated mitochondrial respiratory and electron transport dysfunction, as well as impaired oxidative phosphorylation in the gingiva of LIP mice, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction might contribute to cell senescence in periodontitis (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Meanwhile, upregulation of the cellular senescence pathway and a series of inflammatory-related pathways, including complement activation and response to lipopolysaccharide, were also enriched in the LIP group (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Besides that, the PI3K-AKT, MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways were also activated in LIP group (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">F</xref>), which were closely associated with the onset of cellular senescence and the secretion of SASP factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Raynard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sayegh et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggested that senescent cells gradually accumulated and senescence-related signaling pathways were activated during the progression of periodontitis.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Gingival fibroblasts were the main cell type responsible for cellular senescence in periodontitis</title>
<p>To identify which cell types in periodontitis tissue are enriched for senescence, we re-analyzed public sc-RNA seq data of healthy and periodontitis human gingiva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Williams et al., 2021</xref>). This data from 8 healthy and 13 periodontitis-affected gingival samples were analyzed, clustering the cells into 15 distinct groups (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>). These clusters were classified into fibroblasts, immune cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and other cell types based on specific markers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>In periodontitis samples, there was a notable shift in cellular composition: immune cells increased while structural cells, such as fibroblasts, decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C). Cellular senescence gene score analysis across different cell types revealed that fibroblasts in particular showed significant upregulation of senescence scores in periodontitis, indicating that they had the highest overall levels of senescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). GSEA of differentially expressed genes between healthy and periodontitis fibroblasts further confirmed the activation of senescence pathways in periodontitis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). To further verify fibroblast senescence in periodontitis, we analyzed another data from GSE152042, which included samples from 2 healthy, 1 mild, and 1 severe periodontitis gingiva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Caetano et al., 2021</xref>). The results showed a decline in fibroblast proportion along with increasing disease severity (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">D</xref>) and a corresponding increase in cellular senescence score (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining on clinical sample confirmed that the proportion of P16<sup>+</sup> senescent fibroblasts in periodontitis rose to approximately 25%, compared to very few in healthy gingiva (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). <italic>In vitro,</italic> healthy primary gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) stimulated with different concentrations of <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) showed a dose-dependent increase in SA-β-gal positive fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">B</xref>).

<label>2.3</label><title>CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts were identified as the major fibroblast subpopulation undergoing senescence</title>
<p>To examine the changes in gingival fibroblast subpopulations during periodontitis, we analyzed gingival fibroblasts from dataset GSE164241 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Williams et al., 2021</xref>), and identified 7 distinct fibroblasts subpopulations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The cell proportion bar chart revealed a significant increase in subpopulations 1 and 3 in periodontitis compared to healthy controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We then applied a cellular senescence gene set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Saul et al., 2022</xref>), to score these subpopulations and found that subpopulation 1 exhibited the highest average expression levels, with a marked increase in periodontitis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). GO enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes further confirmed that subpopulation 1 displayed upregulated aging characteristics <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that this subpopulation is primarily responsible for fibroblast senescence. Among the top 20 marker genes for subpopulation 1, CD81, a transmembrane protein, emerged as a potential biomarker for this senescent subpopulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). A density heatmap demonstrated that CD81 was predominantly enriched in subpopulation 1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). The remaining subgroups were classified as EmFB (extracellular matrix-associated fibroblasts), P-EmB (pre-extracellular matrix-associated fibroblasts), MyFB (myofibroblasts), P-MyFB (pre-myofibroblasts), VFB (vascular-associated fibroblasts), and ImFB (immune-associated fibroblasts), based on GO analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining further showed that the proportion of CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts in periodontitis increased to approximately 50%, compared to very few in healthy samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Thus, CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts might represent a core senescent fibroblast population in human periodontitis.</p>

<label>2.4</label><title>CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts were terminally differentiational cell with high SASP expression</title>
<p>To investigate the role of fibroblasts in periodontitis-related inflammation, we analyzed the expression of SASP-related genes in each fibroblast group. CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts exhibited elevated levels of SASP-related genes, including IL-6, CXCL-5, CXCL-6, MMP1, and MMP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Additionally, we examined the metabolic activity of each subgroup, focusing on lipid metabolism. Pathways related to fatty acid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, and steroid biosynthesis were significantly upregulated in CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that lipid metabolism might play a role in cellular senescence of the gingival fibroblasts. Arachidonic acid, in particular, could be converted into prostaglandins and leukotrienes via cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases, contributing to the inflammatory response (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). We further observed a higher gene expression of PTGS1 (encoding COX1 protein) and PTGS2 (encoding COX2 protein) in CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts compared to other fibroblasts subpopulations (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Pseudotime analysis of fibroblast differentiation trajectories revealed that CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts predominantly clustered at the end of the trajectory, indicating limited differentiation potential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">C</xref>).

Overall, our bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts exhibited differentiation arrest and heightened expression of SASP factors, further implicating them in the inflammatory and senescent processes of periodontitis.</p>

<label>2.5</label><title>CD81<sup>+</sup>fibroblasts indirectly sustained inflammation by recruiting neutrophils via C3/C3aR1 axis</title>
<p>To explore the communication between CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts and immune cells in periodontitis, we analyzed their interactions under diseased conditions. Our results revealed that CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts had the highest level of communication with immune cells, particularly neutrophils, compared to other fibroblast subgroups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This suggests that CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts play a key role in mediating the immune response during periodontitis. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in the expression of MIF and C3 signaling pairs between CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts and immune cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of sustained neutrophil infiltration in the progression of periodontitis, with C3 known to recruit neutrophils and contribute to the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ando et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Song et al., 2023</xref>). Further analysis of the C3 pathway showed that the C3 receptor-ligand pair was active in the communication between CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts and neutrophils in both healthy and periodontitis conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), underscoring its unique role in neutrophil recruitment. Notably, CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts exhibited the highest expression of the C3 ligand compared to other fibroblasts subgroups, while the C3 receptor (C3aR1) was exclusively expressed by neutrophils in periodontitis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We also detected higher C3 expression in human periodontitis gingiva (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating its involvement in the disease. In vitro experiments further confirmed that periodontitis gingival fibroblasts secreted higher levels of C3 protein at 30 ng/mL compared to healthy fibroblasts at about 20 ng/mL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), and Pg-LPS stimulation could enhance C3 secretion by gingival fibroblasts from baseline at 10 ng/mL to about 20 ng/mL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Interestingly, spatial transcriptomic analysis of gingival tissue revealed that the regions expressing CD81 and SOD2, a neutrophil marker, in periodontitis overlapped in the gingival lamina propria, showing a high spatial correlation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). These findings suggest that CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts might facilitate neutrophil infiltration through the C3/C3aR1 axis, contributing to the inflammatory response in periodontitis.</p>

<label>2.6</label><title>Targeting cellular senescence in periodontitis could alleviated inflammation and bone resorption</title>
<p>In human periodontitis gingiva, we found that CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts might activate neutrophils via the C3/C3aR1 axis to exaggerate inflammation. To verify whether this mechanism exists in the LIP mouse model, we examined the expression of related markers. In the gingiva of the LIP model, P16<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts, identified by p16 and Vimentin protein, comprised approximately 70% of total fibroblasts, significantly higher than the 10% observed in healthy mice (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts accounted for about 30% of total fibroblasts, compared to less than 10% in the control group (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining revealed co-localization of Vimentin, p16, and CD81 in LIP gingiva, indicating the presence of senescent CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts in the experimental periodontitis model (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also observed a higher expression of C3 protein expression in the LIP group compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">B</xref>). Neutrophil infiltration, marked by MPO increased from approximately 10% at baseline to 40% in the inflamed gingiva of LIP mice, notably in the epithelial and lamina layers (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">D</xref>). Further staining demonstrated that CD81<sup>+</sup> C3<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts constituted the majority of fibroblasts in the LIP group (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">F</xref>). Notably, MPO<sup>+</sup> neutrophils clustered around CD81<sup>+</sup> cells in the lamina of the LIP model (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2G</xref>). These findings in the LIP mouse model suggest that CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts with senescence characteristics might activate neutrophils through C3, similar to the mechanism observed in human periodontitis.</p>
<p>To further explore the role of senescent cells in periodontitis progression, we established a LIP mouse model treated with the senolytic drug ABT263, a Bcl2 inhibitor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). H&amp;E staining revealed that the ABT263-treated group exhibited reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in the gingiva compared to the vehicle control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). IHC staining of senescence markers p16 and H3K9me3 showed a significant reduction in senescent cells: P16<sup>+</sup> cells decreased from 20% to 8%, and H3K9me3<sup>+</sup> cells from 35% to 20%, after ABT263 administration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">D</xref>, a and b). To assess the effect of ABT263 on eliminating CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts in periodontitis, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a drop in the proportion of CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts from 40% to less than 20% after treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and c). Since our results suggested that CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts might activate neutrophil infiltration via the C3/C3aR1 axis, we next evaluated the impact of senolytic treatment on C3 secretion and neutrophil infiltration. IHC analysis revealed a slight reduction in C3 intensity in gingival tissue and a significant decrease in the number of infiltrated neutrophils after ABT263 treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, G, d and e). Finally, we observed a marked reduction in the number of osteoclasts marked by CTSK in the ABT263-treated group, decreasing from 6 cells/mm² in the vehicle group to 1 cell/mm², which suggested less bone resorbing after ABT263 treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref> and f). Taken together, these results suggest that senolytic treatment with ABT263 could be a potential strategy to mitigate inflammation and bone resorption in periodontitis progression.</p>

<label>2.7</label><title>Metformin alleviated the inflammation and bone resorption of periodontitis via inhibiting the interaction between CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts and neutrophil cell</title>
<p>Metformin, an oral antihyperglycemic drug, has been preliminarily validated its therapeutic efficacy in periodontitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Neves et al., 2023</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that metformin regulates cellular senescence, but its involvement in periodontitis-related senescence has yet to be reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kodali et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Soukas, Hao, &amp; Wu, 2019</xref>). To uncover the role of metformin in periodontitis regarding cellular senescence, we first re-analyzed sc-RNA seq data from GSE242714, which included the gingival tissue of periodontitis mice treated with metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Neves et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, we found that metformin treatment reduced the cellular senescence score of the periodontitis gingiva compared to untreated periodontitis gingiva (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on this, we further established a LIP mouse model and administered metformin daily for 14 days before and after the modeling time point to evaluate its effects on cellular senescence in periodontitis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Micro-CT imaging revealed that delayed bone loss around the periodontal area was found following metformin administration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), with the higher bone volume to tissue volume ratio (BV/TV, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>) and less distance of cement-to-enamel junction to alveolar bone crest (CEJ-ABC distance, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>) compared to LIP treated with ddH<sub>2</sub>O group. Histological analyses further demonstrated that metformin significantly mitigated periodontitis-induced inflammatory cell infiltration (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1B</xref>), and collagen degradation (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1C</xref> and a), as shown by H&amp;E and Masson staining. Additionally, metformin reversed the upregulation of p16 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref> and c), p21 (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1D</xref> and b), and H3K9me3 (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1E</xref> and c) in the periodontitis model. Importantly, the number of CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts was reduced in the LIP model after metformin administration compared to the untreated LIP group as well (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">d</xref>). Furthermore, metformin reversed the elevated expression of C3 and MPO in periodontitis, compared to the periodontitis and ddH<sub>2</sub>O groups (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">F</xref>, e, and f). In vitro, senescent fibroblasts induced by PG-LPS were treated with metformin (<xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 2A</xref>). Results showed that metformin decreased the proportion of SA-β-gal positive fibroblasts from 50% in the LPS group to 35% (<xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">C</xref>). Metformin also reversed the protein expression of CD81, C3, and p16 in fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 2D</xref>). Additionally, metformin reduced the proportion of CD81/p16 and CD81/C3 double-positive gingival fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig7s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 3A-D</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that metformin alleviates inflammation and bone resorption in periodontitis by inhibiting the interaction between CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts and neutrophils, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for periodontitis.</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study suggests that cellular senescence plays a role in the progression of periodontitis, and targeting cellular senescence may help alleviate the condition. We discovered that senescent gingival fibroblasts are associated with periodontitis pathology. Under continuous stimulation of LPS-PG, oxidative stress caused by ROS accelerates cell senescence in gingival fibroblasts. These senescent cells highly express CD81, which contribute to the expansion of inflammation through proinflammatory metabolic activities and factors related to SASP. Additionally, they continuously recruit neutrophils through the C3 pathway, indirectly maintaining the inflammatory response. The use of Navitoclax and Metformin can slow down the progression of periodontitis by reducing gingival cell senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch1">Scheme 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The underlying mechanism of immune homeostasis instability and the transformation of chronic gingivitis into periodontitis has not been fully elucidated. Our findings will provide valuable insights for future studies on the pathological mechanism of periodontitis development. Gingival fibroblasts, which are essential cells in gingival connective tissue, have recently gained attention as key participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wielento, Lagosz-Cwik, Potempa, &amp; Grabiec, 2023</xref>). Previous studies have reported heterogeneity in gingival fibroblasts in periodontal tissues, with four subsets significantly altered in periodontitis: Fib1.1 (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL13); Fib 1.2 (APCDD1, IGFBP2, MRPS6); Fib 1.3 (APOD, GSN, CFD); and Fib 1.4 (TIMP3, ASPN, COL11A1). Some of these clusters are directly associated with neutrophils and proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that periodontal tissue immunity relies on strong matrix-neutrophil interactions within these tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Williams et al., 2021</xref>). Another study revealed the presence of genetic markers in a unique subgroup of gingival fibroblasts called AG fibroblasts (fibroblasts activated to guide chronic inflammation). These fibroblasts may have functional capabilities as oral immune surveillance agents and play a role in coordinating the initiation of gingival inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kondo, Gleason, Okawa, Hokugo, &amp; Nishimura, 2023</xref>). Caetano et al. conducted a study where they mapped stromal cells from healthy and periodontitis individuals. They identified a subset of fibroblasts that expressed ARGE pro-inflammatory genes at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Caetano et al., 2023</xref>). In a more recent study, the team used multiomics techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization to demonstrate the presence of a spatially restricted population of pathogenic fibroblasts in the gingival lamina propria. These fibroblasts expressed CXCL8 and CXCL10 and were responsible for recruiting neutrophils and lymphocytes in the periodontal pocket area. Additionally, they exhibited angiogenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Caetano et al., 2023</xref>). The increasing amount of data supports the role of gingival fibroblast heterogeneity in the pathological mechanism of periodontitis, particularly in immune regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yin et al., 2025</xref>). However, previous studies have mainly focused on immune disorders resulting from communication between fibroblasts and immune cells, neglecting the dynamic changes of fibroblasts themselves in periodontitis pathology. In this study, we present a unique subset of fibroblasts with significantly altered gene signatures due to cell senescence, suggesting that cell senescence plays a crucial role in the heterogeneity of gingival fibroblasts. It has been recognized that low concentrations of ROS produced during chronic inflammation can indirectly cause periodontal tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chapple &amp; Matthews, 2007</xref>). Recent studies have also found that repeated exposure to LPS, a component of gram-negative bacterial membranes, leads to DNA damage in various cell types, including gingival and alveolar bone cells (Aquino-Martinez et al., 2020). Cells that survive from persistent DNA damage acquire a senescent phenotype, which in turn triggers the recruitment of immune cells through dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Senescent cells often overexpress IL-6, IL-1 α, IL-1 β, and IL-8, collectively referred to as SASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings indicate that gingival fibroblast senescence directly promotes the development of chronic periodontitis by secreting SASP-related factors, which may explain the formation of pro-inflammatory fibroblasts and their significant impact on immune regulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that drugs can regulate the activity of SASP, as demonstrated by An et al. who showed that short-term treatment with rapamycin can reduce gingival and alveolar bone inflammation and promote the regeneration of alveolar bone in elderly mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">An et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, Kuang et al. reported that metformin inhibits the destructive effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on human PDLSC, leading to a reduction in oxidative stress-induced aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kuang et al., 2020</xref>). Through oral administration of metformin, we have demonstrated its potential in alleviating the progression of periodontitis by delaying the senescence of gingival fibroblasts. However, further experiments are required to determine the decisive role of fibroblast senescence in the periodontitis.</p>
<p>CD81, a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins, could serve as a cell surface marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Karam, Méresse, Kremer, &amp; Daher, 2020</xref>) and a signaling pathway receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Oguri et al., 2020</xref>). CD81 is a major regulator of virus entry into cells and plays an important role in other pathogenic human viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">New et al., 2021</xref>). Research on the role of CD81 has shown that it could form a complex with αV/β1 and αV/β5 integrins to activate the FAK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Oguri et al., 2020</xref>), which induce the interferon signaling pathway for immune response regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hanagata &amp; Li, 2011</xref>), and mediate NF-kB signaling pathway to induce IL-6 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ding et al., 2019</xref>). Clinical studies have indicated a correlation between the level of CD81 in saliva and the severity of periodontitis disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tobon-Arroyave, Celis-Mejia, Cordoba-Hidalgo, &amp; Isaza-Guzman, 2019</xref>), as well as its association with the regulation of aging and inflammation (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jin et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, we observed that gingival fibroblasts with high CD81 expression exhibited a high enrichment of the NF-kB signaling pathway, leading to significant upregulation of IL-6 expression. The NF-kB pathway is recognized as a switch for cellular senescence, and NF-kB activation can drive cell senescence-related secretory phenotypes. Therefore, CD81 is likely to play a crucial role in regulating gingival fibroblast cell senescence. However, further investigation is needed to elucidate the specific molecular mechanism.</p>
<p>Finally, a link has been established between C3 from senescent fibroblasts and neutrophil infiltration in periodontitis. C3 has a strong recruitment ability for neutrophils and is crucial for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yipp et al., 2012</xref>). Persistent neutrophil infiltration and hyperresponsiveness, including the formation of NETs, play significant roles in the development of periodontitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Uriarte &amp; Hajishengallis, 2023</xref>). Genetic analysis and preclinical studies have confirmed C3 as a potential pharmacological target for periodontitis treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alayash et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hajishengallis &amp; Chavakis, 2021</xref>). Gingival fibroblasts stimulated with IFN-γ up-regulated the expression of chemokines (CXCL9, -10, -11, CCL8), molecules involved in antigen presentation, complement component 3 (C3), and other immune response-related molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ha, Jung, Choi, &amp; Ji, 2022</xref>). Our experimental results have demonstrated that CD81<sup>+</sup> gingival fibroblasts are an important source of C3. Understanding the source and mechanism of C3 complement in periodontitis is of great significance for comprehending the pathological development of the disease and can provide a new perspective for designing drug schemes.</p>
<p>Our study focused on identifying a specific group of gingival fibroblasts that express high levels of CD81 during the development of periodontitis. Our findings suggest that these CD81<sup>+</sup> gingival fibroblasts exhibit characteristics of cellular senescence and possess strong pro-inflammatory abilities. Furthermore, we have established a connection between CD81<sup>+</sup> gingival fibroblasts and the recruitment and hyperactivation of neutrophils through C3. However, further investigations are required to explore the association between CD81 and cellular senescence, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target. In conclusion, our research provides valuable insights and treatment strategies for understanding the progression of periodontitis.</p>

The animal experiments were conducted according to the ARRIVE guidelines 2.0. Animals and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee at the School &amp; Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, China (No. S07922040A). The animals were housed in a SPF environment with controlled temperature/humidity with 12h light/dark cycle. To investigate the role of senescent cells in periodontitis progression, the ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) mouse model was treated by Senolytics drug ABT263 (HY-10087, MedChemExpress, China). In brief, after anesthetics, the mice were ligated with a 5-0 silk (SA82G, ETHICON, China) between the maxillary first and second molars and knots were tied on palatal side to secure the ligature. The ligatures were examined daily to ensure that they remained in place during the experimental period. LIP mice were divided into 2 group: Vehicle and ABT263 group.</p>
<p>Each group included 6 mice. LIP mice were intraperitoneally injected with vehicle alone (10% DMSO + 40%PEG300 + 5% Tween-80 + 45% Saline) or with ABT263 (50mg/kg/d; HY-10087; MedChemExpress, China) as previously (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Three days after ligation, vehicle and ABT263 was given to mice for two cycles of 4 consecutive days, with 3 days of rest between cycles. After 14 days post ligation, mice were euthanized, and their maxilla and gingiva were collected for histological staining.</p>
<p>To investigate the effect of metformin on the periodontitis progression, the LIP mouse model was treated by metformin (HY-B0627, MedChemExpress, China). Mice were allocated into four group: CON+ddH<sub>2</sub>O group, LIP+ ddH<sub>2</sub>O group, LIP+MET group and CON+MET group, each group included 6 mice. LIP+MET group and CON+MET group were treated with 200 mg/kg metformin while CON+ddH<sub>2</sub>O group and LIP+ddH<sub>2</sub>O were treated with the distilled water as the control. Metformin or ddH<sub>2</sub>O were given by intragastric administration once a day for 14 days before LIP model establishment. On the fifteenth day after intragastric administration, LIP+ ddH<sub>2</sub>O group and LIP+MET group were ligated with a 5-0 silk between the maxillary left first and second molars and knots were tied on palatal side to secure the ligature. A second set of controls included mice that were not treated with ligatures on either side. Metformin or ddH<sub>2</sub>O were given once a day for another 14 days.

<caption><title>Schematic overview of the CD81<sup>+</sup> senescent gingival fibroblast-neutrophil axis in periodontitis progression.</title><p>We propose that the initial periodontal inflammation is triggered by the CD81<sup>+</sup> senescent gingival fibroblast induced by bacterial virulence like Pg-LPS. CD81<sup>+</sup> senescent gingival fibroblast could exaggerate inflammation in the periodontal tissue via secreting SASPs and recruiting neutrophils by C3. In addition, Navitoclax and Metformin could alleviate the cellular senescence of the fibroblast and rescue the uncontrolled inflammation and bone resorption.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study identifies a population of CD81-positive fibroblasts showing senescence signatures that can activate neutrophils through the C3/C3aR1 axis, hence contributing to the inflammatory response in periodontitis. <bold>Solid</bold> evidence, combining in vitro and in vivo analyses and mouse and human data, supports these findings. The revised manuscript has addressed many concerns significantly. The work would be of interest to researchers working in the senescence and oral medicine fields.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report the discovery of a population of gingival fibroblasts displaying the expression of cellular senescence markers P21 and P16 in human periodontitis samples and a murine ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) model. They support this finding in the murine model through bulk RNA-sequencing and show that differentially expressed genes are significantly enriched in the SenMayo cellular senescence in aging dataset. They then show that Ligature-Induced Periodontitis (LIP) mice treated with the senomorphic drug metformin display overall diminished bone damage, reduced histomorphic alterations, and a reduction in P21 and P16 immunostaining signal. To explore the cell types expressing cellular senescence markers in periodontitis, the authors make use of a combination of bioinformatic analyses on publicly available scRNA-seq data, immunostainings on patient samples and their LIP model; as well as in vitro culture of healthy human gingival fibroblasts treated with LPS. They found that fibroblasts are a cell population expressing P16 in periodontitis which are also enriched for SenMayo genes, suggesting they have a senescent phenotype. They then point to a subgroup of fibroblasts expressing CD81+ with the highest enrichment for a SASP geneset in periodontitis. They also show that treatment of LIP mice and human LPS-treated gingival fibroblasts with metformin leads to a reduction of P21 and P16-positive cells, as well as the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) marker. Finally, they show evidence suggesting that CD81+ senescent fibroblasts are the source of C3 complement protein, which they stipulate signals through the C3AR1 receptor present in neutrophils in periodontitis. The authors observed that both CD81+ fibroblast and C3AR1+ neutrophil populations are expanded in periodontitis, that both populations appear to be in close contact, and that treatment with metformin reduced both C3 and the neutrophil marker MPO in their mouse LIP model.</p>
<p>After a round of revision, the authors have made significant improvements to their manuscript, such as improving the quality of the data/evidence and also included new data from experiments using a well-known senolytic and the senomorphic metformin, which all together provide a solid support to their main claims.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study implements several different techniques and tools on human samples, mouse models, fibroblast cultures, and publicly available data to support their conclusions. In summary, they provide solid evidence showing that in the context of periodontitis, there is an expansion of cells expressing senescence markers P21, and P16, as well as members of the SASP, and that this includes CD81+ fibroblasts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The fact that in this study the periodontitis samples belonged to patients with a significantly higher median age (all older than 50 years of age) and the healthy samples belonged to young adults (all younger than 35 years of age), raises the need for caution in interpretation due to a possible effect of aging in the accumulation of CD81+ senescent fibroblasts. However, the recruitment of similar age groups in this case is of course difficult due to the higher prevalence of periodontitis in older adults. In this regard it is important to note that the authors still support their findings using a mouse ligature model. Similar studies comparing healthy and periodontitic patients from similar age groups will be of great importance in the future.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>There are four main areas that need further clarification:</p>
<p>(1) Further and more complete assessment of senescence and the fibroblasts must be done to support the claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the Reviewing Editor's valuable suggestion regarding the addition of cellular senescence detection markers. In the revised manuscript, we have incorporated additional detection markers for cellular senescence, such as H3K9me3 and SA-β-gal staining, in healthy and periodontitis gingival samples to further validate our findings (Figure 1A, B in revised manuscripts).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Confusion between ageing and senescence throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully understand the concerns raised by the Reviewing Editor and reviewers regarding the confusion between the concepts of ageing and senescence in the manuscript. Cellular senescence is a manifestation of ageing at the cellular level. In the revised manuscript, we have given priority to the term ‘senescence’ to describe the cell condition instead of ‘aging’.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The lipid metabolism mechanistic claims are very speculative and largely unsupported by experimental data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the Reviewing Editor and reviewers for pointing out the incorrect statements regarding the role of lipid metabolism in regulating cellular senescence. Since the mechanism by which cellular metabolism regulates cellular senescence is not the core focus of this manuscript, we have moved the results of the metabolic analysis from the sc-RNA sequencing data to the figure supplement (Figure 4-figure supplement 1) and revised the related statements in the revised manuscript (Page 7-8, Line 186-194).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Concerns about the use of Metformin as a senotherapy vs other pleiotropic effects in periodontitis and the suggestion of using an alternative Senolytic drug (Bcl2 inhibitors, etc.).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully understand the concerns of the Reviewing Editor and reviewers regarding metformin as an anti-aging therapy. In the revised manuscript, we have included additional experiments using other senolytic drugs ABT-263, a Bcl2 inhibitor, in the ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model. The corresponding results could be found in the Figure 6. and Page 9-10, Line 248-264 in the revised manuscripts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>While most of the experiments are elegantly designed and the procedures well conducted there are several critical weaknesses that temper my enthusiasm for this solid and timely work. Considering my main points, I would recommend the following:</p>
<p>(1) Potentiate the senescent assessment in vitro and, most importantly, in vivo. E.g. SABgal with fresh tissue, other senescent biomarkers like SAHFs (HP1g or H3K9me3), etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewers' suggestion to potentiate the assessment of cellular senescence. In the revised manuscript, we performed SA-β-gal staining on fresh frozen samples, revealing a significantly higher number of SA-β-gal positive cells in the gingival tissue of periodontitis, particularly in the lamina propria, while few SA-β-gal positive cells were observed in healthy gingival tissue (Figure. 1A). Additionally, we assessed the protein level changes of H3K9me3, a marker of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), in gingival tissues from healthy individuals and periodontitis patients. The results showed a notable increase in the number of H3K9me3 positive cells in periodontitis tissues, approximately double that found in healthy gingiva (Figure. 1B). This trend aligns with our previous findings of elevated p16 and p21 levels. Collectively, these results further confirm that periodontitis gingival tissues contain a greater number of senescent cells compared to healthy gingiva.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Claims on disturbances in lipid metabolism as a driver of CD81+ fibroblast senescence require appropriate functional/mechanistic validations and experiments of metabolism rewiring.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewers' suggestion for more experimental evidence regarding the role of lipid metabolism in driving CD81+ fibroblast senescence. The influence and mechanisms of lipid metabolism on cellular senescence is a complex and important scientific issue, and it is not the central focus of this manuscript. Therefore, to avoid causing confusion for the reviewers and readers, we have removed the metabolism analysis in the Figure 4-figure supplement 1 and revised the presentation of the relevant results in the revised manuscript to ensure a more rigorous interpretation of our findings (Page 7-8, Line 186-194).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Do LPS-stimulated HGFS implementing the senescent programme secrete C3? Detection of complement C3 at the protein level (e.g. by ELISA) would reinforce the proposed mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is indeed a very interesting question. In response to the reviewers' suggestion, we measured the levels of C3 protein secreted by human gingival fibroblasts induced by Pg-LPS, which is one of the markers of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The results indicated that, compared to untreated fibroblasts, those induced by Pg-LPS exhibited significantly higher levels of C3 secretion, approximately 1.5 times that of the control group (Figure. 5G). Additionally, we also found that primary gingival fibroblasts derived from periodontitis tissues secreted more complement C3 compared to those derived from healthy tissues (Figure. 5F). These findings suggest that the increased secretion of complement C3 by gingival fibroblasts in periodontitis tissues may be related to Pg-LPS-induced cellular senescence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The mechanism of Metformin to impair senescence and/or the SASP is not fully validated and Metformin can produce other pleiotropic effects. A key experiment (including therapeutic implications) is using a senolytic drug (e.g. Navitoclax) to causally connect the eradication of senescent CD81+ fibroblasts with the recruitment of neutrophils. If the hypothesis of the authors is correct this approach should result in reduced levels of gingival CD81 and C3 positivity, prevention of neutrophils infiltration (reduced MPO positivity), and ameliorate bone damage in ligationinduced periodontitis murine models.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully understand the reviewers' concerns regarding the role of metformin in alleviating cellular senescence and the possibility of it acting through non-senescent pathways. To clarify the role of cellular senescence in the recruitment of neutrophils by CD81+ fibroblasts through C3 in periodontitis, we treated a ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model with ABT-263, also known as Navitoclax. The results showed that after ABT-263 treatment, the number of p16-positive or H3K9me3-positive senescent cells in the periodontitis mice significantly decreased. Additionally, we observed reductions in the quantities of CD81+ fibroblasts, C3 protein levels, neutrophil infiltration, and osteoclasts to varying degrees in the LIP model after ABT263 treatment (Figure. 6). These results further support our hypothesis that the eradication of senescent CD81+ fibroblasts could reduce neutrophil infiltration and alveolar bone resorption.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Have the authors considered using any of the available C3/C3aR inhibitors to validate the involvement of neutrophils and the inflammatory response in periodontitis? A C3/C3aR inhibitor would be an elegant treatment group in parallel with the senolytic approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for the reviewers' suggestion to investigate neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory responses after treating periodontitis with C3/C3aR inhibitors. In a clinical study by Hasturk et al. in 2021 (Reference 1), it was found that using the C3 inhibitor AMY-101 effectively alleviated gingival inflammation levels in periodontitis patients. This was reflected in significant decreases in clinical indicators such as the modified gingival index and bleeding on probing, as well as a marked reduction in inflammatory tissue destruction markers, including MMP-8 and MMP-9. In addition, Tomoki Maekawa et al. (Reference 2) demonstrated that a peptide inhibitor of complement C3 effectively reduced inflammation levels and the extent of bone resorption in periodontitis. Moreover, research by Guglietta et al. (Reference 3) clarified that the C3 complement promotes neutrophil recruitment and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) via C3aR. And neutrophil extracellular traps are considered key pathological factors in causing sustained chronic inflammation in periodontitis (References 4 and 5). In summary, existing studies have clearly indicated that C3/C3aR inhibitors likely reduce neutrophil recruitment and inflammation in periodontitis.</p>

<p>Other comments</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1. The authors report upregulation of the aging pathway in bulk RNAseq analyses. What about the upregulation of senescence-related pathways and differential expression of SASP-related genes in this experiment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this interesting question. Through further analysis of the bulk RNA sequencing results of gingival tissues from LIP mice model, we found significant alterations in multiple senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes and several cellular senescencerelated pathways. SASP genes, such as Icam1, Mmp3, Nos3, Igfbp7, Igfbp4, Mmp14, Timp1, Ngf, Il6, Areg, and Vegfa, were markedly upregulated in the periodontitis samples of ligature-induced mice (Figure 1-figure supplement 2A). Moreover, we observed a significant reduction in oxidative phosphorylation levels and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the periodontitis group, suggesting that the occurrence of cellular senescence may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction (Figure 1figure supplement 2B and C.).</p>
<p>Additionally, we noted the activation of the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways in LIP model (Figure 1-figure supplement 2D and E), both of which can induce cellular senescence by activating the tumor suppressor pathway TP53/CDKN1A, leading to cell cycle arrest (References 1, 2). Furthermore, the NF-κB signaling pathway was also significantly enriched in LIP model (Figure 1-figure supplement 2F), which is closely associated with the secretion of SASP factors (Reference 3).</p>
<p>In summary, our bulk RNA sequencing results suggest enrichment of cellular senescencerelated pathways in the periodontitis group, including mitochondrial metabolic dysregulation, senescence-related pathways, and alterations in the SASP. Related results were added into Page 56 of the revised manuscripts.</p>

<p>(2) I wonder whether the authors could clarify how the semi quantifications for p21, p16, Masson's trichrome, C3, or MPO were done in Figures 1, 2, and 6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for the reviewer's suggestion. We have added the semi-quantitative methods for p21, p16, Masson's trichrome, C3, and MPO in the Methods section. Specifically, for semi-quantification of protein expressions, the mean optical density (MOD) of positive stains for p21, p16, and C3 was measured using the ImageJ2 software (version 2.14.0, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The number of MPO-positive cells and collagen volume fractions (stained blue) for individual sections were also measured using the ImageJ2 software.

<p>Thank you very much for the reviewer's question. To avoid any misunderstandings for the reviewer and readers, we have added a definition of the sample size in the description of the micro-CT analysis method. Specifically, in the micro-CT quantitative analysis, the sample size n for each group consists of 6 mice, with the average value of the BV/TV of the bilateral maxillary alveolar bone taken as one sample for statistical analysis (Page 17-18, Line 488-490 in the revised manuscripts).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) When the authors refer to accelerated aging and/or senescence, they are doing so in comparison to what?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer's question, which allows me to further clarify the concepts of accelerated aging and/or senescence. In sections 2.1 and Figure 1 of this manuscript, we referred to accelerated aging and/or senescence. This indicates that the gingival tissues of periodontitis patients exhibit a higher number of senescent cells and elevated levels of senescence-related markers compared to healthy gingival tissues. In the title of this manuscript, we describe CD81+ fibroblasts as a unique subpopulation with accelerated cellular senescence. This means that CD81+ fibroblasts display higher expression levels of senescence-related genes, cell cycle inhibitor p16, and SASP factors compared to other fibroblast subpopulations. To avoid any misunderstanding, we have deleted the text ‘accelerated senescence’ in the revised manuscripts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In general, the main text does not describe the results using exact and reproducible terminology. Phrases like &quot;X was most active&quot;, &quot;a significant increase was observed&quot;, &quot;the highest proportion was&quot;, and &quot;the level of aging increased&quot; should be supported by adding quantification details and by detailing what these comparisons are made to, to improve the reproducibility of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer's suggestion. To improve the reproducibility of the results, we have added quantification details in the results section and clarified what comparisons are being made through the whole manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In some sections of the main text and figure legends, it is not entirely clear which sequencing experiments were conducted by the authors, which analyses were conducted by the authors on publicly available sequencing data, and which analyses were conducted on their mouse sequencing data.</p>

<p>(4) In Figure 3H, the images showing SA-beta-gal staining on LPS-treated fibroblasts do not show convincingly the difference between treatments that are represented in the graph.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reviewer's suggestion. To further clearly show the differences between treatments, we have enlarged the partial image of SA-β-gal staining shown in Figure 2-figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscripts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The choice of colors for Figure 4K is far from ideal as it is very difficult to tell apart red from purple channels and thus to visualize triple positive cells. A different LUT should be chosen, and separate individual channels should be shown to clearly identify triple-positive cells from others. Arrows also do not currently point at triple-positive cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer's suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have included separated staining for p16, VIM, and CD81, and the triple-positive cells are marked with white arrows shown in Figure 5-figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscripts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors state that treatment with metformin &quot;alleviated.... inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 2C), and collagen degradation (Figure 2D) as observed through H&amp;E and Masson staining.&quot; However, I cannot find a description of how the &quot;relative fraction of collagen&quot; in Figure 2Gc was calculated and how the H&amp;E image they provide shows evidence of a reduction in inflammatory cells at that magnification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer's suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have added details in the methods section regarding the calculation of the &quot;relative fraction of collagen&quot; (Page 19, Line 539-541). Specifically, the collagen volume fractions (stained blue) for individual sections were measured using ImageJ2 software. Additionally, we have marked the infiltrating inflammatory cells in the gingiva in the H&amp;E images with black arrows shown in Figure 7-figure supplement 1B of the revised manuscripts.</p>

<p>(8) The methodology described for the bulk RNA-sequencing experiment in mice should describe the sequencing library characteristics and some reference to quality control thresholds that were implemented (mapped and aligned reads, sequencing depth and coverage, etc.).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the bulk RNA-sequencing experiment, the sequencing library characteristics and quality control thresholds were listed as follows:</p>
<p>Sequencing Library Characteristics: We utilized the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Construction Kit, generating libraries with an insert fragment length of approximately 400-500 bp.</p>
<p>Quality Control Standards include the following:</p>
<p>Alignment and Mapping Rates: The read data for all samples underwent preliminary quality control using FastQC (v0.11.9) and were aligned using HISAT2 (v2.2.1). The average mapping rate for each sample was over 90%.</p>
<p>Sequencing Depth and Coverage: Each sample had a sequencing depth of 30M-40M paired reads to ensure sufficient transcript coverage. Detailed alignment statistics have been provided in the supplementary materials.</p>
<p>Other Quality Control Measures: During the analysis, we also utilized RSeQC (v3.0.1) to evaluate the transcript coverage and GC bias of the sequencing data.</p>
<p>The corresponding method description and reference were added in the Page 19-20, Line 546-558 of the revised manuscripts.</p>

<p>(9) Patients with periodontitis are labeled as diagnosed with &quot;chronic periodontitis&quot;. I would like to know how the authors defined this chronic state of the disease in their inclusion criteria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for the reviewer’s question, which gives us the opportunity to further clarify the definition and diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. The diagnostic criteria for patients with chronic periodontitis in this study are based on the 1999 International Workshop for a Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions (Reference 1). Chronic periodontitis is a type of periodontal disease distinct from aggressive periodontitis, and it is not diagnosed based on the rate of disease progression. Clinically, the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis is primarily based on clinical attachment loss (CAL) ≥ 4 mm or probing depth (PD) ≥ 5 mm as one of the criteria for diagnosis.</p>

<p>(10) There is no detail about the age and sex of the donors for the healthy gingival fibroblast experiments. Are they some of the patients mentioned in Supplementary Table 1? Please clarify the source and number of independent primary cultures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much to the reviewer for allowing us to further clarify the source and number of independent primary cultures. In the cell experiments, we used gingival fibroblasts derived from gingival tissue of two healthy volunteers and two patients with periodontitis as experimental subjects. This information has been listed in the Supplementary Table 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Can the authors explain why their age inclusion criteria were different for the healthy and periodontitis groups according to their methods (healthy 18-50 years old: periodontitis 18-35 years old?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much to the reviewer for pointing this out. We noticed that there was an error in the age range indicated for the healthy and periodontitis groups in the inclusion criteria. Based on the original inclusion criteria information, we have corrected the age range of the included population. 18-65 years old individuals were included into the both healthy and periodontitis groups. (Page 14-15, Line 396-404 in the revised manuscripts)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) The methodology for inclusion is confusing and does not reflect the actual information of the recruited patients and samples thus analyzed. In the text, the healthy group appears to have included 8 young adult individuals and 8 middle-aged individuals. However, the list of recruited patients shows all healthy patients were in the young adult range (below 35 years of age) while all chronic periodontitis patients were middle-aged (above 50 years of age). Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much to the reviewer for pointing out the issues in the article. This study included 8 healthy periodontal patients and 8 patients with periodontitis (Page 14, Line 396-398 and Supplementary Table 1 in the revised manuscripts). Since periodontitis has a higher prevalence in middle-aged and elderly populations, the periodontitis samples included in this study were mostly from this demographic. In contrast, the healthy gingival samples were sourced from patients undergoing wisdom tooth extraction, which primarily involves younger individuals. Therefore, due to the limited sample size, we could not enforce strict age matching. To address this, we repeated the relevant experiments in more consistent mouse models, which confirmed the increase in senescent cells in periodontal tissues (Figure 1D in the revised manuscripts). In summary, although the clinical samples were limited, the experimental results from the mouse models still support our conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) The number of biological replicates for each group used in the bulk RNA-sequencing experiment is unclear. The methods state:&quot; For those with biological duplication, we used DESeq2 [8] (version: 1.34.0) to screen differentially expressed gene sets between two biological conditions; for those without biological duplication, we used edgeR&quot;. Please clarify the number of mouse samples sequenced and the description of the groups.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much to the reviewer for pointing out the errors in the article. In the transcriptome sequencing, we collected gingival tissues from 3 healthy mice and gingival tissues from 3 ligature-induced periodontitis mice. Therefore, we used the DESeq2 (version: 1.34.0) method to filter for differentially expressed genes. The corresponding descriptions were revised in Page 20, Line 554-555 in the revised manuscripts.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major Comments for the Authors:</p>
<p>(1) I do not find the immunohistochemical staining of p16 and p21 shown in Figures 2E and F to be particularly compelling. Especially as other stains of these markers used later in the manuscript are of higher quality (i.e. Figures 3F and G). Can this staining be improved to better reflect the quantifications in Figure 2G?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for the reviewer's suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have provided more representative images in Figure 7C in the revised manuscripts to reflect the effect of metformin treatment on the number of p16-positive cells in periodontitis. In Figure 7-figure supplement 1D of the revised manuscripts, we have marked p21-positive cells with black arrows to help readers better identify the p21-positive cells. Additionally, we have also assessed the H3K9me3 marker, which is more specific, and the results similarly indicate that metformin treatment can alleviate the formation of senescent cells in periodontitis (Figure 7-figure supplement 1E of the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) On line 140, Supplementary Figure 2C, D is quoted to show &quot;...an increase in senescence characteristics of fibroblasts with the severity of periodontitis.&quot; This figure panel does not appear to support this statement. Please revise.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for pointing out the errors in the manuscript. In the revised version, we have corrected this part of the description and added that “The results showed a decline in fibroblast proportion along with increasing disease severity (Figure 2-figure supplement 1C and D)” (Page 6, Line 153-154 of the revised manuscript)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I do not find the Western Blot experiment in Figure 4L to be particularly convincing. The text states that p21, p16, and CD81 increase in a context-dependent manner upon LPS stimulation, which doesn't appear to be very evident. I recommend repeating this experiment and showing both a representative blot alongside a blot density quantification where the bars have the error shown between experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for the reviewer’s suggestion regarding this result. During subsequent repeated experiments, we found that the result was not reproducible, and we have removed the related results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The results state that metabolic profiling of senescent fibroblasts shows an increase in the biosynthesis of Linoleic acid, linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, and steroid. However, in Figure 5B only arachidonic acid and steroid biosynthesis appear to be elevated in CD81+ Fibroblasts, while Linoleic and linolenic acid appear to be decreased. Can the authors comment on this discrepancy? Moreover, in Figure 5C steroid biosynthesis is unchanged between healthy and periodontitis samples, contrary to the claimed increased trend in the results text. Please revise this section. Also, in Figures 5 B and C some of the terms are highlighted in a red or blue box. This is not discussed in the figure legend. Could the significance of this be explained or could these highlights be removed from the figure?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for the reviewer’s correction regarding the errors in the manuscript. In the Page 7-8, Line 186-194 of the revised manuscripts, “Pathways related to fatty acid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, and steroid biosynthesis were significantly upregulated in CD81+ fibroblasts (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A)” was re-wrote. Moreover, we have removed the results from Figure 5C, and the highlights in Figures 5B and C of the previous manuscripts. Since the mechanism by which cellular metabolism regulates cellular senescence is not the core focus of this manuscript, we have moved the results of the metabolic analysis from the sc-RNA sequencing data to the figure supplement (Figure 4-figure supplement 1) and revised the related statements in the revised manuscript (Page 7-8, Line 186-194).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors state that arachidonic acid can be converted to prostaglandins and leukotrienes through COXs (which are expressed in their CD81+ Fibroblasts), accentuating inflammatory responses. Have the authors profiled for the expression of prostaglandins and leukotrienes in their CD81+ Fibroblasts or between healthy and periodontitis samples? Such data would be a great inclusion in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for the reviewer’s suggestion. Our results indicated that CD81+ gingival fibroblasts expressed higher levels of PTGS1 and PTGS2 compared to other fibroblast subpopulations. These genes encode proteins that are COX-1 and COX-2, which are key enzymes in prostaglandin biosynthesis (Figure 4-figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript). Additionally, previous studies have reported high levels of prostaglandins and leukotrienes in periodontal tissues, and these pro-inflammatory mediators contribute to tissue destruction in periodontitis (Reference 1 and 2).</p>

<p>(6) Lines 199 and 200 state &quot;...the cellular senescence of CD81+ fibroblasts could be attributed to disturbances in lipid metabolism&quot;. While altered lipid metabolic profiles are shown in Figure 5 to correlate with senescent fibroblasts/periodontitis tissue, no evidence is shown to suggest that they are the driver or cause of fibroblast senescence. Could this sentence be amended to better reflect the conclusions that can be drawn from the data presented?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the reviewer’s suggestion. We have revised the related statements and believed that “lipid metabolism might play a role in cellular senescence of the gingival fibroblasts” in the Page 7, Line 189 of the revised manuscripts.</p>
