<title>Abstract</title><p>Recent findings indicate that the translation elongation rate influences mRNA stability. One of the factors that has been implicated in this link between mRNA decay and translation speed is the yeast DEAD-box helicase Dhh1p. Here, we demonstrate that the human ortholog of Dhh1p, DDX6, triggers deadenylation-dependent decay of inefficiently translated mRNAs in human cells. DDX6 interacts with the ribosome through the Phe-Asp-Phe (FDF) motif in its RecA2 domain. Furthermore, RecA2-mediated interactions and ATPase activity are both required for DDX6 to destabilize inefficiently translated mRNAs. Using ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing, we identified two classes of endogenous mRNAs that are regulated in a DDX6-dependent manner. The identified targets are either translationally regulated or regulated at the steady-state-level and either exhibit signatures of poor overall translation or of locally reduced ribosome translocation rates. Transferring the identified sequence stretches into a reporter mRNA caused translation-and DDX6-dependent degradation of the reporter mRNA. In summary, these results identify DDX6 as a crucial regulator of mRNA translation and decay triggered by slow ribosome movement and provide insights into the mechanism by which DDX6 destabilizes inefficiently translated mRNAs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>mRNA translation is a highly controlled process that critically determines the mRNA turnover rate. In particular, the elongation rate at which the ribosome translates an mRNA into the nascent peptide chain is thought to affect mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">D’Orazio and Green, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Morris et al., 2021</xref>). Many mRNA attributes can affect the speed of the translating ribosome, including secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>), nucleotide and codon composition (Chaney and Clark, 2015, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gardin et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Letzring et al., 2010</xref>), tRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ishimura et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Novoa and Ribas de Pouplana, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nakahigashi et al., 2014</xref>), the sequence of the nascent peptide and its interaction with the ribosome exit tunnel or other ribosome-associated factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>, Charneski and Hurst, 2013, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kuroha et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tanner et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lin et al., 2020</xref>), and damage or improper processing of the mRNA itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brandman and Hegde, 2016</xref>, Joazeiro, 2019, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Simms et al., 2017</xref>). It is now understood that recognition of slow ribosome dynamics by the mRNA decay machinery can trigger mRNA degradation, not only during ribosome-based quality control (RQC), but also in general translation regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Buskirk and Green, 2017</xref>, Buschauer et al., 2020, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In eukaryotes, general mRNA decay is initiated by a shortening of the poly(A) tail mediated by the CCR4-NOT complex with its catalytic subunits CNOT7 and CNOT8, followed by 5′-to-3′ mRNA decay, where the mRNA is decapped by the DCP1/DCP2 decapping complex and then exonucleolytically degraded by the exonuclease XRN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mugridge et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, the exosome can degrade deadenylated mRNA in the 3′-to-5′ direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Labno et al., 2016</xref>). There are also more specialized RQC mechanisms such as nonsense mediated decay, no-go decay, and non-stop decay which remove aberrant mRNAs often by endonucleolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Simms et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Inada, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, mRNAs with slow translation rates due to the presence of non-optimal codons are regulated by translation-dependent decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Radhakrishnan and Green, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Richter and Coller, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boel et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herrick et al., 1990</xref>). One factor implicated in translation-dependent decay in yeast is Dhh1p, the ortholog of human DDX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). DDX6 belongs to the conserved DEAD-box ATPase/helicase family, which plays a central role in cytoplasmic mRNA regulation, including processing body (P-body) assembly, mRNA decapping, and translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ostareck et al., 2014</xref>). DDX6 is composed of two globular RecA-like domains connected by a flexible linker. The helicase motifs that are crucial to the ATPase and RNA binding activities are located in the DDX6-RecA1 domain. The DDX6-RecA2 domain mediates binding to the translational regulators 4E-T and GIGYF1/2, the decapping activators PATL1, EDC3, LSM14A, and to the NOT1 subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, thereby providing a link between mRNA translational repression and 5′-to-3′ mRNA decay by deadenylation and decapping (Mathys et al., 2014, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Peter et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its well-known involvement in translation-coupled RNA turnover in yeast, the target mRNAs and the molecular mechanism of mRNA recognition in mammalian DDX6 remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of human DDX6 in translation-dependent mRNA decay. Comparing the stability of a reporter mRNA containing a non-optimal codon stretch in both HEK293T WT and DDX6 KO cells revealed that DDX6 destabilizes inefficiently translated reporter mRNA in human cells, in a similar manner as has been observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). The reporter is destabilized by initiation of 5′-to-3′ mRNA decay. Furthermore, we found that the DDX6 RecA2 domain interacts with ribosomal proteins and provide evidence that RecA2-mediated interactions and DDX6-ATPase activity are both necessary for translation-dependent mRNA decay. To identify the set of inefficiently translated transcripts that are naturally targeted by DDX6 we took an unbiased approach and compared HEK293T-WT and -DDX6 KO cells by ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing analysis. This approach identified a set of mRNAs that are translationally regulated by DDX6, enriched in zinc finger transcription factors, and have low overall codon optimality and thus slow translation elongation dynamics across the entire open reading frame. We also identified a second group of mRNAs with locally decreased elongation dynamics targeted by DDX6 for decay. Interestingly, the second group of mRNAs included transcripts with CAG repeats, which have recently been linked to slow ribosome dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aviner et al., 2022</xref>). These findings suggest that loss of DDX6 could disrupt co-translational proteostasis of factors associated with neurodegenerative diseases, leading to the characteristic formation of intracellular aggregates. Through an mRNA reporter approach, we also found that the newly identified mRNA regions promote destabilization in a translation-and DDX6-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Codon composition affects mRNA stability in human cells</title>
<p>Codon optimality was recently identified as a strong determinant of mRNA stability in yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and different vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mishima and Tomari, 2017</xref>). Since codon composition affects the ribosome translocation rate, it has been proposed that the translation elongation rate is monitored by the ribosome and ribosome-associated factors, triggering mRNA decay when the ribosome slows down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hu et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Radhakrishnan and Green, 2016</xref>). To investigate this phenomenon in more detail, we created a reporter construct containing a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase gene whose last thirty codons were replaced by synonymous but rarely used codons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This change was designed to reduce the translation speed without altering the resulting protein sequence (Hussmann et al., 2015, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Weinberg et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nakahigashi et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gardin et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yu et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Letzring et al., 2010</xref>). To find out whether the expected decrease in ribosome translocation rates indeed alters mRNA stability, we measured the half-life of the reporter mRNA in human HEK293T cells. As expected, introducing the rare codon stretch into the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase open reading frame significantly reduced the half-life of its translated mRNA from &gt; 10 h to 8.0 ± 4.4 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This result confirms that codon composition directly affects mRNA stability in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen and Coller, 2016</xref>), and is in line with previous reports describing a correlation between codon optimality and RNA stability in various mammalian cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Radhakrishnan and Green, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Goodarzi et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.c.)</italic> the DEAD-box RNA helicase Dhh1p (ortholog of human DDX6) has been shown to act as a sensor of codon optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). To test whether its human ortholog DDX6 is needed to trigger the decay of not optimally translated mRNAs, we created HEK293T DDX6 KO cells using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Loss of DDX6 protein expression was verified by western blotting and sequencing of the genomic target site (<bold>Figure S1A,D</bold>; <bold>Experimental procedures</bold>). Remarkably, loss of DDX6 significantly stabilized the non-optimal codon-containing reporter, resulting in a measured half-life comparable to that of the respective control reporter (&gt; 10 h vs 8.0 ± 4.4 h) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1B,C</bold></xref> <bold>right panel</bold>). These results indicate that DDX6 acts as a sensor of codon optimality and that this function is evolutionary conserved from yeast to mammals.</p>
<p>In budding and fission yeast, co-translational degradation of mRNA is mediated by the 5′-to-3′ decay pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hu et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). It has also recently been reported that maternal codon-mediated mRNA clearance in zebrafish is triggered by co-translational CCR4-NOT-dependent deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mishima and Tomari, 2017</xref>). To test whether the observed degradation of the rare-codon reporter is dependent on CCR4-NOT, we measured its half-life in cells overexpressing a catalytically inactive POP2 deadenylase mutant (POP2 DExAA). Blocking CCR4-NOT dependent deadenylation indeed resulted in marked stabilization of the reporter mRNA, with half-lives increasing from 5.5 ± 2.8 h to &gt; 10 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1D,E</bold></xref>). This result shows that in human cells, mRNA decay triggered by rare codon-related slow ribosome movement is initiated by CCR4-NOT-dependent deadenylation of the target mRNA.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>DDX6 interacts directly with the ribosome</title>
<p>To sense translation speed, it has been proposed that DDX6 must maintain physical interactions with the ribosome, and yeast Dhh1p has indeed been found to co-purify with ribosomal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Drummond et al., 2011</xref>). To test whether human DDX6 interacts with the ribosome, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> pulldown assays with recombinant DDX6 purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E.coli</italic>) lysates, and endogenous ribosomal complex components purified from HEK293T cells. Streptavidin-tagged DDX6 pulled down several ribosomal protein components (labelled with a red dot), whereas no such interaction was observed in the corresponding streptavidin-MBP pulldown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref><bold>, lane 4 vs 6</bold>). Interactions with ribosomal components therefore seem to be a conserved feature in DDX6 orthologs.</p>

<p>To determine precisely which part of DDX6 contacts the ribosome, we performed co-immunoprecipitations with DDX6 protein fragments in HEK293T cells. Since we did not know which ribosomal component was mediating the interaction with DDX6, immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of RNaseI. RNaseI cleaves unprotected internal RNA fragments but leaves the ribosome structure and ribosome-protected RNA regions intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ingolia et al., 2012</xref>). We found that under these conditions, overexpressed full length GFP-tagged DDX6 and the C-terminal RecA2 domain co-immunoprecipitated with both the HA-tagged large ribosomal subunit protein RPL22 and the small ribosomal subunit component RPS3A in human cells. In contrast, the N-terminal RecA1 domain did not interact with either subunits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>). The RecA2 domain of DDX6 mediates multiple protein interactions. It binds the Mid domain of eIF4G (MIF4G) of NOT1 which stimulates its ATPase activity by stabilizing it in an activated conformation (Mathys et al., 2014, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to providing a link to the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, the RecA2 domain of DDX6 also mediates interactions with other regulatory proteins e.g. EDC3, LSM14A, PatL1, 4E-T and GIGYF1/2. These proteins interact with DDX6 RecA2 through their Phe-Asp-Phe (FDF) motifs in a mutually exclusive manner, thereby either facilitating mRNA decay by linking the deadenylation machinery to the core decapping complex or inducing translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fromm et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tritschler et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>, Tritschler et al., 2009, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brandmann et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ozgur et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Peter et al., 2019</xref>). To obtain further insights into how DDX6 interacts with the ribosome, we compared the interactions of different DDX6 mutants with the large ribosomal subunit protein RPL22 in HEK293T cells. In particular, we used a DDX6 mutant (Mut1; R94E + F101D + Q322A + N324A + R375A) that does not interact with NOT1 but still interacts with the FDF-binding pocket. We also tested a mutant with substitutions on the FDF-binding surface (Mut2; Q209A + H312A + T316A + R320A + R335A + K341A + K342A). These mutations prevent binding to regulatory factors such as EDC3, LSM14A, PatL1, 4E-T and GIGYF1/2, thereby breaking the link with the decapping and translation repression machinery (Tritschler et al., 2009, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kuzuoglu-Ozturk et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ozgur et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Peter et al., 2019</xref>). As a control, we also tested a DDX6 DEAD-box mutant (E236Q). Interestingly, mutation of the FDF-binding surface abolished DDX6’s interaction with the ribosomal protein RPL22, whereas mutations interrupting the interaction with NOT1 and mutation of the DEAD-box motif did not interfere with ribosome binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). The DDX6 mutant with a modified FDF motif (Mut2) still interacted with NOT1, indicating that the fold was not compromised (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). In summary, these results demonstrate that DDX6 interacts with the ribosome via the same region that provides a link to the decapping and translation repression machinery.</p>
<p>DDX6 belongs to the DEAD-box family of RNA dependent ATPases/helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ozgur et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Presnyak and Coller, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Russell et al., 2013</xref>). To test whether ATPase activity is required to promote the decay of rare-codon reporter mRNA, we complemented HEK293T DDX6 KO cells with either wild-type (WT) or DEAD-box mutant (E236Q) DDX6. Interestingly, loss of ATPase activity completely abolished DDX6’s ability to induce decay of rare-codon reporter mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref> <bold>lane 2 vs lane 3 and 2E</bold>). Sweet <italic>et al</italic>. found similarly that in yeast, Dhh1 interaction with polysomes following translation inhibition was dependent on its ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether the interactions mediated by the DDX6 RecA2 domain are also necessary for stalling mediated decay, we complemented DDX6 KO HEK293T cells with either the NOT1 binding mutant (Mut1) or FDF-pocket mutant (Mut2) of DDX6 and examined their effect on the stability of the non-optimal codon reporter. Stalling mediated mRNA decay was only observed in the presence of WT DDX6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref> <bold>lane 2 and 2E</bold>). Loss of contact with NOT1 (Mut1) or of FDF-mediated interactions (Mut2) rendered DDX6 inactive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref> <bold>lanes 4 and 5 and 2E</bold>). All proteins were expressed at equivalent levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2F</bold></xref>). These data show that DDX6 interacts with the ribosome via its C-terminal RecA2 domain and that all domains and its catalytic activity are required for it to mediate mRNA decay of a poorly translated reporter.</p>

<title>Identification of endogenous mRNAs targeted by DDX6 for decay because of inefficient translation elongation</title>
<p>To determine which cellular mRNAs are naturally sensed by DDX6 and targeted for decay, we performed ribosome profiling combined with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in HEK293T WT and DDX6 KO cells. Ribosome profiling involves high-throughput sequencing of the RNA footprints of polyribosomes subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>, McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017). This technique can thus reveal genome-wide ribosomal occupancy with nucleotide resolution, providing insights into the number and position of ribosomes bound throughout the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ingolia et al., 2012</xref>). While the overall ribosomal occupancy on a given transcript gives a rough estimate of the amount of protein synthesized from that transcript, the distribution of ribosome occupancy within a transcript is a measure of local ribosome speed. In particular, ribosomal footprint counts tend to accumulate in sites where the ribosome passes more slowly than in the rest of the transcript, since the likelihood of catching that footprint in the steady-state snapshot of the ribosome profiling experiment increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>). Ribosome profiling can therefore be used to study ribosomal pausing or stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Li et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Guydosh and Green, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gamble et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate a possible link between locally increased ribosomal occupancy, indicative of slow ribosome elongation, and DDX6-dependent mRNA decay, we compared the RNA-seq and ribosome profiling data of HEK293T WT and HEK293T DDX6 KO cells (overview <bold>Figure S2A</bold>). Comparison of the two RNA-seq libraries revealed 1707 mRNAs specifically upregulated in the absence of DDX6 (<italic>FDR &lt; 0.005;</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A,C</bold></xref>). Of those, 298 transcripts were upregulated more than two-fold (logFC &gt; 1). Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for transcripts coding for proteins that localize in the extracellular space, to membranes or are involved in signaling or in cell adhesion. On the other hand, 1484 transcripts were significantly downregulated (<italic>FDR &lt; 0.005;</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A,C</bold></xref>), 156 more than two-fold (logFC &lt; -1). In addition, comparing ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data allowed us to identify changes in translation efficiency (TE). Remarkably, 260 transcripts were translationally upregulated in DDX6 KO cells (<italic>FDR &lt; 0.005;</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3B,D</bold></xref>), 152 more than two-fold (logFC &gt; 1). Functional characterization of these target genes revealed a predominance of genes encoding for zinc finger transcription factors (89 of the 260 translationally upregulated genes; 34%; FDR=2.5E-46) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3B,D</bold></xref>). Accordingly, GO-analysis showed an enrichment for DNA binding proteins and factors involved in transcription (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>). In contrast, only 38 transcripts showed significant downregulation in TE (<italic>FDR &lt; 0.005;</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3B,D</bold></xref>), 17 more than two-fold (logFC &lt; -1), with no functional association as measured by GO analysis. These results suggest that loss of DDX6 has a profound effect on the translation efficiency of a specific class of mRNAs and led us to investigate what molecular features the 260 mRNA targets translationally repressed by DDX6 have in common. Comparing the features of the 260 upregulated mRNAs in DDX6 KO cells revealed that these mRNAs have significantly lower coding sequence (CDS) GC content than the rest of the mRNAs expressed in the same cells (<bold>Figure S3B</bold>). Furthermore, DDX6 regulated CDSes appear to be longer than unaffected mRNA CDSs (<bold>Figure S3C</bold>). Interestingly, in mammals, low codon GC content is correlated with low codon optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>). Thus, DDX6 may be involved in the regulation of the translation efficiency of mRNAs with low codon optimality across the whole transcriptome. DDX6 regulated mRNAs were not found to have a significantly lower TE than the other mRNAs expressed in the cells; however, loss of DDX6 significantly increased the TE of this subset of mRNAs above the overall TE (<bold>Figure S3D</bold>).</p>

<p>In addition to the unexpected finding that DDX6 translationally represses a specific group of endogenous transcripts, we reasoned that we should also find potential targets of DDX6-mediated mRNA decay in the group of mRNAs that are more abundant in the absence of DDX6. Based on our previous observations that DDX6 mediates decay of inefficiently translated mRNAs, we further reasoned that we could use the ribosome profiling data to identify upregulated mRNAs with locally increased ribosome occupancy, indicative of slow elongation rates. We manually screened the list of transcripts with logFC &gt; 1 and a statistically significant change (FDR &lt; 0.005) in the RNA-seq experiment (298 transcripts) for the presence of locally increased ribosome footprint as measured by the coupled ribosome profiling experiment and found 35 genes that matched these criteria (<bold>Table 1</bold>). Note that one of the most highly upregulated mRNAs in DDX6 KO cells was the androgen receptor (AR) transcript containing GAC repeats, coding for a stretch of glutamine repeats (poly Q). The repetitive nature of this sequence makes it impossible to determine whether inefficient translation elongation occurs during synthesis. However, it is interesting to note that a recent preprint suggests CAG expansions can cause altered elongation kinetics that can lead to CAG expansion diseases like Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aviner et al., 2022</xref>). Given the repetitive nature of the transcript, we hypothesize that AR could be a direct DDX6 target. We then used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the levels of selected transcripts in WT, DDX6 KO cells and DDX6 KO cells expressing either WT or mutant DDX6 exogenously. DDX6 dependency was detected in 6 of the 9 tested mRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3G</bold></xref> <bold>and S3A</bold> AR, BMP2, LGALS1, DLX5, ENO2, PSMB9; see also changes in mRNA abundance as determined by RNA-seq; the remaining three potential DDX6 targets were not confirmed: C1QTNF4, CALCB, PCK1). We observed that DDX6 KO cells had higher levels of targeted mRNAs compared to WT HEK293T cells, as revealed by RNA sequencing experiments, and were partially restored back to WT levels by overexpressing DDX6. The partial rescue might be explained by uneven transfection efficiency and/or additional time required to reach base line mRNA levels. It should be noted that none of the mutant forms of DDX6 were able to restore the endogenous levels of the targeted mRNA, consistent with the previous reporter experiments. All proteins were expressed at equivalent levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3H</bold></xref>). These results strongly suggest that DDX6 plays a direct role in the regulation of targeted mRNA levels in HEK293T cells.</p>

<title>mRNA sequences with increased ribosomal occupancy reduce reporter mRNA stability</title>
<p>To test whether the identified translational pause sites in some of the endogenous DDX6-targeted mRNAs contribute to mRNA destabilization, we created different reporter constructs in which the putative ribosomal stalling region (RSR) was inserted at the 3′ end of the Renilla luciferase open reading frame, either preceding or following a stop-codon; RL-RSR and RL-stop-RSR respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). These constructs were designed to differentiate translation dependent regulation from translation independent effects, triggered for example by binding of trans-regulatory factors (e.g. RNA-binding proteins or miRNAs) to the introduced sequence. We tested two of the sequences identified in our screen for DDX6-destabilized mRNAs: first, a stretch containing 23 ‘CAG’ codon repeats (encoding 23 x Q) of the X-chromosome encoded AR gene. Repetitive codon sequences can lead to stalling because of limited tRNA availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dana and Tuller, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ishimura et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Novoa and Ribas de Pouplana, 2012</xref>). For the second sequence, we chose a 30 nt-long fragment of the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene encoded on chromosome 20, which codes for a sequence of basic amino acids (QRKRLKSSCK). Polybasic amino acid stretches and prolines have been reported to cause ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>, Charneski and Hurst, 2013, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>). Since the sequence immediately adjacent to the actual stall site also contained several lysine, arginine and proline codons, we cloned the stalling sequence with ∼100 nt upstream and downstream flanking to include all potential contributing regulatory element in the respective reporter constructs. We then measured the half-lives of the reporter constructs when transfected into HEK293T cells. For this, reporter mRNA was quantified by northern blot at different times after transcription was blocked using actinomycin D. As expected, presence of the <italic>AR</italic> stalling sequence before the stop-codon strongly reduced the mRNA half-life compared to the control vector where the stop-codon precedes the stalling sequence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4B,C</bold></xref>). The same was true for the <italic>BMP2</italic> stalling sequence: presence of the stalling sequence was associated with a strong translation-dependent reduction in mRNA half-life (4.0 ± 1.9 h compared to &gt; 10 h in the control vector) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4D,E</bold></xref>). To prove that the observed reduction in reporter mRNA stability containing endogenous ribosomal stalling sites was dependent on DDX6, the half-life measurements were repeated in HEK293T DDX6 KO cells, and indeed, when expressed in DDX6 KO cells, the RL-stop and RL-vectors for both <italic>AR</italic> and <italic>BMP2</italic> stalling sequences had approximately similar half-lives (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4B-E</bold></xref>). These results therefore confirm that DDX6 is required to trigger the co-translational mRNA decay induced by these sequences.</p>

<p>To further confirm that the identified sequences of the <italic>AR</italic> and <italic>BMP2</italic> mRNAs lead to ribosome stalling, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) assays by pulling down the reporter RNA under DDX6 KO conditions and then detected the ribosome stalling level.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>mRNA decay factors regulate gene expression by processes other than just general mRNA degradation. For example, it has recently been shown that the translational elongation rate influences mRNA stability. One factor implicated in coupling mRNA decay with translation rates is the yeast decay factor, Dhh1p. In this study, we show that mRNA stability in human cells is also affected by codon optimality, just as it is in yeast. Moreover, DDX6 (the human ortholog of Dhh1p) plays an important role in triggering the decay of slowly translated mRNAs. Using a wide range of approaches, we systematically characterized the contribution of DDX6 to ribosome stalling-mediated mRNA decay.</p>
<p>To investigate whether DDX6 is necessary to trigger the decay of sub-optimally translated mRNA, we created a reporter construct containing a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase open reading frame where the last thirty codons were replaced by synonymous but rarely used codons, chosen to reduce the translation rate without altering the protein sequence produced. The reporter with the non-optimal codons was much more stable in the absence of DDX6, with a half-life comparable to that of the corresponding WT reporter. This result demonstrates that DDX6 acts as sensor of codon optimality and that this function is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. We also demonstrated that DDX6 interacts directly with the ribosome through the RecA2 domain, which also binds to the CCR4-NOT complex. By overexpressing DDX6 mutants in DDX6 KO cells, we showed that DDX6-CCR4-NOT interactions are essential for ribosome stalling-dependent mRNA decay.</p>
<p>To identify a possible link between increased ribosomal occupancy and DDX6-dependent mRNA decay, we performed RNA-seq and ribosome profiling experiments in HEK293T WT and DDX6 KO cells. Comparison of the two RNA-seq libraries allowed us to identify mRNAs that are upregulated in the absence of DDX6. These DDX6-regulated mRNA targets were further examined using ribosome profiling and found to have increased ribosome occupancy in specific regions, indicative of slow ribosome movement, which may therefore destabilize the corresponding mRNAs. Importantly, we also found that reporter mRNAs containing the ribosomal stalling region were only destabilized in the presence of both translation and DDX6.</p>
<p>These findings have important implications for understanding the regulation of gene expression and the underlying mechanisms of mRNA decay. By elucidating the role of DDX6 and the CCR4-NOT complex in this process, we may be able to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for diseases caused by dysregulated gene expression. Furthermore, the approach used here of combining RNA-seq and ribosome profiling technologies could be applied to other biological systems to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying translation-coupled mRNA decay. Overall, our work opens up exciting avenues for future research and could potentially contribute to the development of novel treatments for a variety of diseases.</p>

In brief, HEK293T cells are submitted to an osmotic shock by incubation in an appropriate hypotonic buffer containing NP-40. After removing the nuclear fraction by centrifugation at 750 g, the cytoplasmic fraction is further submitted to centrifugation at 12,500 g to remove the mitochondrial fraction. The concentration of the post-mitochondrial fraction is then adjusted to 0.5 M KCl to disrupt most interactions between ribosomes and other proteins of the other cell compartments. Finally, ribosomes are purified through a sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation. Purified ribosomes are ready for the subsequent analyses.</p>

Remaining reads were mapped onto the human genome using Tophat2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) which resulted in 21-27 million mapped reads with an overall read mapping rate &gt;91% for RNA-Seq and 3-4 million mapped reads with an overall read mapping rate &gt;87% for Ribo-Seq. Read count analysis was performed using QuasR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gaidatzis et al., 2015</xref>), differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">McCarthy et al., 2012</xref>). Translational efficiencies (TE) were calculated using RiboDiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>DDX6 stalling-induced decay targets were selected I. based on the logFC of total RNA of DDX6 KO versus WT HEK293T cells. Targets with a logFC&gt;1 and statistical significant change FDR&lt;0.005 (n=298) were manually screened for potential stalling sites using the Integrative Genomics Viewer tool from Broad Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013</xref>) II. Stalling targets were selected based on a local accumulation of footprints determined by ribosome profiling. We found 35 genes that matched these criteria (AMDHD2, AR, ART5, BMP2, C1QTNF4, CA11, CALCB, CD19, CILP2, COL2A1, CTSA, CXCL12, DLX5, DUSP1, ENO2, HOXA13, IFI35, IFITM2, IGFBP5, LGALS1, MLC1, PBXIP1, PCK1, PSMB9, PTRH1, QPCT, SAT1, SEMA6C, SFXN3, SLC13A4, SLIT2, SMPDL3B, TMSB15B, TNC, ZNF91). A representation of the most convincing targets (AR, BMP2, LGALS1, DLX5, ENO2, PSMB9) can be found in Figure S2B-G.</p>
<p>GO analysis was performed using the R-based package goseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Young et al., 2010</xref>). Analyses of GC content, CDS length and transcript TE were performed with R-based scripts.</p>

<title>Reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative PCR (qPCR)</title>
<p>We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine transcript levels of selected targets. 22nt primers were designed using Primer-BLAST from NCBI to amplify a 250-350bp region of the target mRNA. To use the Livak method (ΔΔCT method) for relative quantification each primer pair was tested if the amplification rate of the specific PCR product is 2 +/-5%.</p>
<p>For validation and rescue experiments HEK293T wild-type or DDX6 KO cells were either transfected with a GFP-MBP control or GFP-DDX6 (either WT, Mut1, Mut2, DEAD*). 48h after transfection total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers. Target mRNA amount was subsequently determined by qPCR using the respective primer pair and normalized to beta-Actin abundance in the same sample. A sample treated with water instead of reverse transcriptase (-RT) was used as a negative control. Relative abundances of target mRNAs of three independent experiment were determined using the Livak method (the wild-type sample was arbitrarily set to 1) (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study demonstrates the requirement of a DEAD-box helicase DDX6 for the cotranslational mRNA decay pathway in human cells. The authors performed a set of <bold>solid</bold> experiments, combining DDX6 KO cells with reporter assay and global analysis of mRNA stability/translation efficiency. Although some conclusions drawn by the authors need a more careful examination of alternative possibilities, this study will be of broad interest to RNA biologists working on translational control and mRNA stability.</p>

<p>Weber et al. investigated the role of human DDX6 in messenger RNA decay using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout (KO) HEK293T cells. The authors showed that stretches of rare codons or codons known to cause ribosome stalling in reporter mRNAs leads to a DDX6 specific loss of mRNA decay. The authors moved on to show that there is a physical interaction between DDX6 and the ribosome. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, the authors determined that the FDF-binding surface of DDX6 is necessary for binding to the ribosome, the same domain which is necessary for binding several decapping factors such as EDC3, LSM14A, and PatL. However, they determine the interaction between DDX6, and the ribosome is independent of the DDX6 interaction with the NOT1 subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex. Interestingly, the authors were able to determine that all known functional domains, including the ATPase activity of DDX6, are required for its effect on mRNA decay. Using ribosome profiling and RNA-sequencing, the authors were able to identify a group of 260 mRNAs that exhibit increased translational efficiency (TE) in DDX6 Knockout cells, suggesting that DDX6 translationally represses certain mRNAs. The authors determined this group of mRNAs has decreased GC content, which has been previously noted to coincide with low codon optimality, the authors thus conclude DDX6 may translationally repress transcripts of low codon optimality. Furthermore, the authors identify 35 transcripts that are both upregulated in DDX6 KO cells and exhibit locally increased ribosome footprints (RBFs), suggestive of a ribosome stalling sequence. Lastly, the authors showed that both endogenous and tethering of DDX6 to reporter mRNAs with and without these translational stalling sequences leads to a relative increase in ribosome association to a transcript. Overall, this work confirms that the role of DDX6 in mRNA decay shares several conserved features with the yeast homolog Dhh1. Dhh1 is known to bind slow-moving ribosomes and lead to the differential decay of non-optimal mRNA transcripts (Radhakrishnan et al. 2016). The novelty of this work lies primarily in the identification of the physical interaction between DDX6 and the ribosome and the breakdown of which domains of DDX6 are necessary for this interaction. This work provides major insight into the role of the human DDX6 in the process of mRNA decay and emphasizes the evolutionary conservation of this process across Eukaryotes.</p>
<p>
Strengths: Weber et al. take our knowledge of dhh1, the yeast homolog of the human DDX6, and determine several features that are conserved across eukaryotes. The authors take our understanding of DDX6 a step further by identifying the specific domains involved in the interaction between DDX6 and the ribosome. As well as, differentiating those interactions from other factors known to interact with DDX6, such as NOT1. All of this is necessary and important to understand how mRNA decay plays a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation in humans.</p>
<p>
Weaknesses: The authors fail to truly define codon optimality, rare codons, and stalling sequences in their work, all of which are distinct terminologies. They use reporters with rare codon usage but do not mention what metrics they use to determine this, such as cAI, codon usage bias, or tAI. The distinction between the type of codon sequences that DDX6 affects is very important to differentiate and should be done here as certain stretches of codons are known to lead to different quality control RNA decay pathways that are not reliant on canonical mRNA decay factors. Likewise, the authors sort their Ribo-seq data to determine genes that might exhibit a DDX6 specific mRNA decay effect but fail to go into great depth about common features shared among these genes other than GO term analysis, GC content, and coding sequence (CDS) length. The authors then sort out 35 genes that are both upregulated at the mRNA level and have increased local ribosome footprint along the ORF. They are then able to show that 6 out of 9 of those genes had a DDX6-dependent mRNA decay effect. There was no comment or effort as to why 2 out of those 6 genes tested did not show as strong of a DDX6-dependent decay effect relative to the other targets tested. Thus, the efforts to identify mRNA features at a global level that exhibited DDX6-dependent mRNA decay effects are lacking in this analysis.</p>
<p>
Overall, the work done by Weber et al. is sound, with the proper controls. The authors expand significantly on the knowledge of what we know about DDX6 in the process of mRNA decay in humans, confirming the evolutionary conservation of the role of this factor across eukaryotes. The analysis of the RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data could be more in-depth, however, the authors were able to show with certainty that some transcripts containing known repetitive sequences or polybasic sequences exhibited a DDX6-mRNA decay effect.</p>

<p>In the manuscript by Weber and colleagues, the authors investigated the role of a DEAD-box helicase DDX6 in regulating mRNA stability upon ribosome slowdown in human cells. The authors knocked out DDX6 KO in HEK293T cells and showed that the half-life of a reporter containing a rare codon repeat is elongated in the absence of DDX6. By analogy to the proposed function of fission yeast Dhh1p (DDX6 homolog) as a sensor for slow ribosomes, the authors demonstrated that recombinant DDX6 interacted with human ribosomes. The interaction with the ribosome was mediated by the FDF motif of DDX6 located in its RecA2 domain, and rescue experiments showed that DDX6 requires the FDF motif as well as its interaction with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and ATPase activity for degrading a reporter mRNA with rare codons. To identify endogenous mRNAs regulated by DDX6, they performed RNA-Seq and ribosome footprint profiling. The authors focused on mRNAs whose stability is increased in DDX6 KO cells with high local ribosome density and validated that such mRNA sequences induced mRNA degradation in a DDX6-dependent manner.</p>
<p>The experiments were well-performed, and the results clearly demonstrated the requirement of DDX6 in mRNA degradation induced by slowed ribosomes. However, in some cases, the authors interpreted their data in a biased way, possibly influenced by the yeast study, and drew too strong conclusions. In addition, the authors should have cited important studies about codon optimality in mammalian cells. This lack of information hinders placing their important discoveries in a correct context.</p>
<p>1. Although the authors concluded that DDX6 acts as a sensor of the slowed ribosome, it is not clear if DDX6 indeed senses the ribosome speed. What the authors showed is a requirement of DDX6 for mRNA decay induced by rare codons, and DDX6 binds to the ribosome to exert this role. For example, DDX6 may bridge the sensor and decay machinery on the ribosome. Without structural or biochemical data on the recognition of the slowed ribosome by DDX6, the role of DDX6 as a sensor remains one of the possible models. It should be described in the discussion section.</p>
<p>2. It is not clear if DDX6 directly binds the ribosome. The authors used ribosomes purified by sucrose cushion, but ribosome-associating and FDF motif-interacting factors might remain on ribosomes, even after RNaseI treatment. Without structural or biochemical data of the direct interaction between the ribosome and DDX6, the authors should avoid description as if DDX6 directly binds to the ribosome.</p>
<p>3. Although the authors performed rigorous reporter assays recapitulating the effect of ribosome-retardation sequences on mRNA stability, this is not the first report showing that codon optimality determines mRNA stability in human cells. The authors did not cite important previous studies, such as Wu et al., 2019 (PMID: 31012849), Hia et al., 2019 (PMID: 31482640), Narula et al., 2019 (PMID: 31527111), and Forrest et al., 2020 (PMID: 32053646). These milestone papers should be cited in the Introduction, Results, and Discussion.</p>
<p>4. While both DDX6 and deadenylation by the CCR4-NOT were required for mRNA decay by the slowed ribosome, whether DDX6 is required for deadenylation was not investigated. Given that the CCR4-NOT deadenylate complex directly interacts with the empty ribosome E-site in yeast and humans (Buschauer et al., 2020 PMID: 32299921 and Absmeier et al., 2023 PMID: 37653243), whether the loss of DDX6 also affected the action of the CCR4-NOT complex is an important point to investigate, or at least should be discussed in this paper.</p>
