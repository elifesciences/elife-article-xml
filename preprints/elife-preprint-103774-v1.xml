<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The evolution of new gene regulation is an important source of evolutionary adaptations and innovations, especially when organisms encounter new environments. At its heart is the process by which new and strong DNA binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) originate in evolution. Here we study the potential of Darwinian evolution to create strong binding sites for the three <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> global transcription factors CRP, Fis, and IHF. Using a massively parallel reporter assay, we measure for each TF the ability of more than 30,000 binding sites to regulate gene expression. We use the resulting data to map the adaptive landscape of each TF. We find that all three landscapes are rugged, epistatic, and harbor multiple peaks. The highest peaks are widely scattered throughout the landscape, indicating that strong regulation can be achieved by very different binding sites. Landscape ruggedness does not prevent the evolution of strong regulation, because more than 10% of evolving populations can attain one of the highest peaks. Adaptive evolution starting from the same DNA sequence can attain more than one high peak, and some high peaks are more likely to be reached than others. Our experiments show that de novo adaptive evolution of new gene regulation is feasible. It is also subject to a blend of chance, historical contingency, and evolutionary biases that favor some peaks and evolutionary paths over others.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transcriptional regulation controls the ability of RNA polymerase to initiate the transcription of a gene into mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. It is crucial in the life of all organisms, orchestrating the expression of genes in response to environmental cues and cellular states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Transcriptional regulation is mediated by transcription factors (TFs), proteins that bind DNA near a gene at short DNA words known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). The binding of a TF to its binding site on DNA can either hinder or facilitate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The stronger the binding of a TF to its TFBS is, the more strongly the TF can regulate a nearby gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In bacteria, TFs operate within a hierarchically organized gene regulatory network. At the bottom of this hierarchy are <italic>local</italic> TFs that regulate the expression of one or few genes and modulate specific biological processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. At the top are <italic>global</italic> TFs that may regulate hundreds of genes and control many cellular functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Consistent with their broader role, global regulators are typically more highly expressed and bind to a broader range of TFBSs than local regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Both TFs and their TFBSs evolve, but TFBSs evolve more rapidly. The reason is that a mutation in a TF can affect the expression of many genes, whereas a mutation in a TFBS may affect only one gene and is less likely to be deleterious <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. A special case of TFBS evolution is the evolution of a strong TFBS from a DNA word with weak or no regulatory activity. Such <italic>de novo</italic> evolution of TFBSs can create new regulatory interactions and change the structure of gene regulatory networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, we know little about the ability of Darwinian evolution to create TFBSs de novo. A strong TFBS may have to arise from a non-binding site through an evolutionary path of multiple mutational steps. Darwinian evolution can favor this process only if strong binding is adaptive and if each mutational step in a path increases binding strength, i.e., if the path is <italic>accessible</italic> to Darwinian evolution. To find whether such paths exist may require the analysis of multiple paths. This is challenging because sequence space contains an astronomical number of potential TFBSs for any one TF. The number of evolutionary paths to strong transcriptional regulation is thus also astronomical. For each such path, the strength of each TFBS along the path has to be measured experimentally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Building on our previous work on a local TF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, we take a step to address this challenge for three global regulators in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Specifically, we perform three independent and massively parallel experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> using a plasmid-based expression system for each TF. Our synthetic biology approach allows us to explore the regulatory effects of tens of thousands of TFBS variants in a high-throughput manner. We quantify how strongly each of more than 30,000 binding sites for each TF can regulate the expression of a nearby reporter gene.</p>
<p>The first TF we study is the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). In the absence of glucose, CRP modulates the expression of genes mostly involved in carbon metabolism. It allows <italic>E. coli</italic> to efficiently switch between sources of carbon and energy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The second TF is the factor for inversion stimulation (Fis), which helps to regulate the expression of genes involved in growth phase transitions. It also modulates the supercoiling of DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and influences DNA replication, recombination, and repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The third factor is the integration host factor (IHF). IHF regulates genes involved in stress responses and stationary phase survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Similar to Fis, it is involved in DNA compaction, replication, and recombination, but also in the assembly of complex nucleoprotein structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. We chose these factors because they are the most global regulators in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and they are diverse, belonging to different protein families.</p>
<p>We use the regulatory data for each TF’s binding sites to map a genotype-phenotype landscape for these binding sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Such a landscape is a conceptual analog of a physical landscape, where each location corresponds to one genotype in sequence space, and the elevation at this location corresponds to a phenotype – the ability to regulate gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. One of our two main aims is to provide the first characterization of such landscapes for global bacterial regulators, and to find out whether these landscapes are different or similar.</p>
<p>When strong regulation of a gene is adaptive, a regulatory landscape becomes an adaptive landscape or fitness landscapes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Our second aim is to understand how populations would evolve on each of our three landscapes when they are viewed as fitness landscapes. Specifically, we study how evolving populations would traverse each landscape through individual mutational steps that change a TFBS its ability to regulate a gene via its cognate TF. A peak in such a landscape is a TFBS conveying stronger regulation than all neighboring TFBSs in sequence space. If such a landscape is rugged (has multiple peaks), natural selection alone may not enable a population to discover the highest peaks, i.e., the strongest TFBSs. The reason is that the peaks may be separated by valleys of low regulation strength that cannot be traversed by natural selection alone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In other words, high peaks may not be easily accessible through Darwinian evolution – they may be reachable by few or no evolutionary paths of single DNA mutations where each mutational step increases TFBS strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. One factor that can reduce peak accessibility is epistasis – non-additive effects of two or more mutations on a phenotype. In addition, epistasis can reduce the predictability of evolutionary trajectories towards a peak <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To accomplish both aims, we first studied the topography of the three landscapes, and then simulated the dynamics of evolving populations on them. All three landscapes are highly rugged. They contain more than 2,000 peaks that are scattered through genotype space and are also rife with epistatic interactions. Despite these features, evolving populations can reach the strongest TFBSs in all three landscapes. Which of several high peak is reached is contingent on chance events during adaptive evolution.</p>

<title>Landscape mapping</title>
<p>We constructed a plasmid system (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S1</xref>-<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref> and Supplementary Methods 2-3) to inducibly express each of the three global TFs CRP, Fis, and IHF in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We expressed each factor in a host strain in which its encoding chromosomal gene had been knocked out (<italic>Δcrp</italic>, <italic>Δfis</italic> and <italic>Δihf,</italic> see <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). This ensures that each TF is expressed only upon induction. Expression of each TF can be induced with anhydrotetracycline (atc), which allowed us to control TF expression levels and measure how the binding of the TF to DNA can influence transcriptional regulation by measuring the expression of a green fluorescent reporter gene (<italic>gfp</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). In our plasmid system, stronger binding of a TF to DNA leads to lower GFP expression. The reason is that the TF’s binding site is located directly upstream of the <italic>gfp</italic> gene, and TF-DNA binding thus downregulates GFP expression by interfering with <italic>gfp</italic> transcription. Our three plasmid-strain pairs attained similar cell densities during late exponential or early stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) where we performed all our measurements.</p>

</fig>
<p>For each plasmid expressing one of our three TFs, we cloned an entire library of TFBSs upstream of the <italic>gfp</italic> reporter. Specifically, in this library, we randomized each of the eight most important (information-rich) base pair positions within the TFBS (see Supplementary Methods 4 and <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). We obtained these most information-rich positions for each TF from the alignment of known TFBSs in the RegulonDB database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Each library comprised 4<sup>8</sup>=65,536 unique sequences. We constructed three replicates of each library (Supplementary Methods 4 and 5).</p>
<p>We then mapped these TFBS genotypes to their respective regulatory phenotypes using a well-established technique known as sort-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>), which combines fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with high-throughput sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). In sort-seq, one first sorts cells into multiple fluorescence “bins” depending on the level of GFP expression. A cell’s GFP fluorescence serves as a proxy for GFP expression levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and quantifies how strongly the TFBS library member in this cell can regulate GFP expression (Methods, Supplementary Methods 5).</p>
<p>The results of our sort-seq experiments are three maps – one for each transcription factor – from each of more than 30,000 genotypes (TFBS variants) to regulatory phenotypes (regulation strength). One can view each map as a genotype-phenotype landscape that we also call a regulatory landscape<sup>8,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). Whenever strong regulation entails high fitness, such a landscape is also an adaptive landscape or fitness landscape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. For the purpose of analyzing the landscape quantitatively, we represent it as a network of genotypes (TFBS variants). Each node in this network corresponds to a genotype. Edges link neighboring genotypes, which differ in a single nucleotide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Landscapes exhibit diverse regulation strengths and distribution breadths</title>
<p>To evaluate the ability of our library to regulate gene expression, we first measured the distribution of GFP fluorescence intensities across the bins in two conditions, i.e., in the presence or absence of the TF (with or without the atc inducer, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S4</xref>-<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>). In the presence of the TF, GFP expression was lower on average and showed a broader distribution than in the absence of the TF (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S4</xref>-<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>). This indicates that the TFBSs in each library can indeed downregulate GFP expression, but some library variants convey stronger regulation than others, hence the broader fluorescence distribution.</p>
<p>We then pooled barcoded DNA sequences extracted from cells in each bin and biological replicate. We sequenced at least 250 unique TFBS genotypes from each bin, with an average of 3992.3±4293.9 unique sequences per bin for the three TFs (as detailed in Methods, Supplementary Methods 7, and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S4</xref>-<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>). The resulting sequences covered 95%, 90%, and 93% of the total library sizes (N = 65,536 genotypes) for CRP, Fis and IHF, respectively. To ensure the reliability of our data, we excluded sequences with low read coverage and sequences that were not present in all triplicates (Methods, Supplementary Methods 7.3). This quality filtering step resulted in library sizes of 31,975 genotypes for CRP (49% of all 4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> genotypes), 43,222 genotypes for Fis (66%), and 41,325 genotypes for IHF (63%). The correlation in read counts for each variant across replicates was very high for this quality-filtered data (Pearson’s R= 0.98-0.99) (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S7</xref>-<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">S9</xref>). We used this data for all further analyses.</p>
<p>The fluorescence and sequence data from each bin allowed us to quantify the variant’s ability to regulate gene expression for each TFBS library variant. We refer to the resulting metric as the <italic>regulation strength S</italic> conveyed by the variant (Methods, Supplementary Methods 7.2, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). It ranges between S=0 (no regulation) to S=1 (strongest regulation among all variants in the library). Although our experiments directly quantify expression regulation, and not the affinity or binding strength of a TF to a TFBS variant, we also use <italic>binding strength</italic> as a proxy for regulation strength, because TF-DNA binding is necessary for regulation<sup>1,4,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. To each of our three TFs, we also assigned a reference TFBS that is naturally occurring and conveys strong regulation by the TF, as proven by previous experimental work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. We refer to this TFBS as the wild-type (WT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> WT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> and WT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). We refer to TFBSs with regulation strengths below and above the wild-type (WT<sub>CRP</sub>: S<sub>WT</sub>=0.71, WT<sub>Fis</sub>: S<sub>WT</sub>=0.97, WT<sub>IHF</sub>: S<sub>WT</sub>=0.95) as weak and strong, respectively.</p>
<p>We observed a broad range of regulation strengths S for each TF landscape, with varying spreads. The CRP landscape exhibited the lowest average regulation strength and a narrower distribution of S compared to Fis and IHF, which had similar distributions (mean±s.d., 0.37±0.1 for CRP, 0.57±0.13 for Fis, and 0.52±0.14 for IHF; see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). Next, we analyzed the strongly regulating TFBSs to identify nucleotides that may be particularly frequent and thus, potentially important for strong regulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>).

<title>All three regulatory landscapes are highly rugged</title>
<p>The study of our landscapes in a network framework (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>) can help to quantify different aspects of landscape topography (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). One of them is the ruggedness of each landscape. It can be quantified by the number of peaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. In the network framework, a peak is a TFBS whose neighbors are all weaker regulators (with lower S) than the TFBS itself. We find that all three landscapes are highly rugged, with 2,154, 2,312, and 2,453 peaks for the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>, <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Not surprisingly, peak genotypes generally are stronger regulators than non-peak genotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Only a small fraction of peak genotypes regulate expression more strongly than the wild-type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>; 61 for CRP, 172 for Fis, and 199 for IHF). We refer to such peaks as high peaks and distinguish them from low peaks (S&lt;S<sub>WT</sub>).</p>
<p>We compared the ruggedness of our landscapes with that of a well-established theoretical model of uncorrelated random landscapes, in which each sequence is assigned a fitness at random from the same fitness distribution, and neighbors have uncorrelated fitness values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> Such landscapes are maximally rugged <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. We created 100 uncorrelated random landscapes for each of our three TF landscapes by randomly shuffling the measured regulation strengths among all genotypes (Supplementary Methods 7.6). The number of peaks in our TF landscapes lies within 93%, 96%, and 98% percent of that of a maximally rugged random landscape, which, on average [mean±s.d.], has 2,308±133, 2,405±89 and 2,373±97 peaks for CRP, Fis and IHF, respectively. This analysis underlines that our landscapes are indeed highly rugged.</p>
<p>Because we use only quality-filtered genotype data, our landscapes lack regulatory information for about 40% of the 4<sup>8</sup> genotypes. While we cannot exclude that this undersampling of genotypes has led to systematic biases in our determination of landscape ruggedness, we note that the sampling of landscape genotypes by our experiments was not strongly biased with respect to regulation strength. Specifically, when we analyzed the relative connectivity of genotypes in our landscapes – the fraction of each genotype’s 24 possible neighbors for which our experiments yielded regulatory data – we found that it is only weakly correlated with regulation strength (R=-0.1, −0.1, 0.01 for the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Figures S13-S15</xref>). Similarly, the relative connectivity of peak genotypes is only weakly correlated with their regulation strength (R=-0.05, −0.04, 0.06 for the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes). Furthermore, the prevalence of sign epistasis (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S5</xref>) supports the notion that our landscapes are indeed rugged (see Supplementary Methods 7.5 for further details on epistasis and its evolutionary consequences).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Landscape peaks are widely scattered in genotype space</title>
<p>In a rugged adaptive landscape, reaching high fitness peaks can be challenging, because such peaks are separated from other genotypes by valleys of low fitness that cannot be traversed by natural selection alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. If natural selection favors strong gene regulation, the ruggedness of our regulatory landscapes may thus present a challenge for adaptive evolution. To better understand the potential magnitude of this challenge, we next analyzed our landscapes’ topography in greater detail. We began by studying the distribution of peaks in genotype space. If a landscape’s highest peaks are widely scattered through genotype space, then they may be accessible via fitness-increasing evolutionary paths from diverse non-peak genotypes. This may facilitate adaptive evolution compared to a landscape where peaks are clustered in a small region of genotype space.</p>
<p>For each of our three landscapes, we determined the genetic distance between peaks, i.e., the minimum number of mutations needed to transition from one peak to another, regardless of their effect on regulation strength. We compared the distribution of these distances to the distribution of genetic distances for an equal number of randomly selected non-peak variants. In all three landscapes, the distances between peaks are almost indistinguishable from those of random genotypes, differing on average by fewer than 0.1 mutational steps. In other words, peaks are about as widely dispersed in each landscape as random genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs16">Supplementary Figure S16</xref>). This is the case for both low and high peaks (<xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S17</xref>-<xref rid="figs18" ref-type="fig">S18</xref>). A principal component analysis further underscores this dispersion (Supplementary Methods 7.7, <xref rid="figs19" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S19</xref>-<xref rid="figs21" ref-type="fig">S21</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Accessible paths to a peak are often not the shortest possible paths</title>
<p>Next, we focused on mutational paths to peaks that are evolutionarily accessible, i.e., a series of mutational steps where each step increases regulation strength. Specifically, we enumerated all accessible paths that exist from each non-peak genotype to each peak genotype for all three landscapes. We found that these paths are generally longer than the shortest genetic distance between a non-peak and the peak genotypes. Specifically, the mean length of accessible paths exceeded the shortest distance by 1.5, 1.8 and 1.8 steps for the CRP, Fis and IHF landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs22">Supplementary Figure S22</xref>). In other words, accessible mutational paths are often not the most direct paths.</p>
<p>The existence of indirect paths implies that some mutational steps are evolutionarily prohibited because they decrease regulation strength. The reason is closely linked to epistasis – non-additive effects of two or more mutations on regulation strength. (see Supplementary Methods 7.5 for further details on epistasis). More specifically, such inaccessible steps are a result of sign epistasis. In this kind of epistasis, a double mutant of a TFBS regulates expression more strongly than the TFBS itself, even though one or both constituent single mutants regulate expression more weakly than the TFBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Indeed, epistasis is prevalent in all three landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="tbls5">Table S5</xref>). Specifically, we observe sign epistasis in 62%, 66%, and 65% percent of interactions between single mutant pairs in the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes.</p>
<p>The existence of accessible paths alone does not tell us how easily a high peak can be found through Darwinian evolution. The reason is that only a very small fraction of all paths to that peak may be accessible, and an evolving population may not find any one of those paths. To quantify the fraction of accessible paths, we determined the total number of paths from each non-peak genotype to each high fitness peak, and computed the fraction of those paths that are accessible. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref> shows how this fraction depends on the number of mutational steps in a path. It behaves similarly for all three landscapes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). The majority of two-step paths (a fraction greater than 80%) are accessible in all three landscapes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), but the fraction of accessible paths dwindles rapidly with an increasing number of mutational steps. It reaches a minimum below 1% for all three landscapes at eight mutational steps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>).</p>

<title>High peaks have large basins of attraction that share many TFBS genotypes</title>
<p>In the following analysis, we computed the basin of attraction of each peak, defined as the set of non-peak genotypes from which accessible paths to the peak exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. In other words, a peak’s basin of attraction comprises all genotypes from which adaptive evolution can access the peak. The peaks in our landscapes have widely different basin sizes. They include peaks accessible from a mere fraction of genotypes to those accessible by a majority of genotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Notably, high peaks generally had larger basins of attraction than low peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs23">Supplementary Figure S23</xref>). In addition, we found that many genotypes are part of multiple basins of attraction. Adaptive evolution may reach different high peaks starting from any such genotype. For all pairs of high peaks, we computed the pairwise overlap (intersection) of the basins of attraction, i.e., the fraction of genotypes that are part of both basins of attraction. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref rid="figs24" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S24-S25</xref>). The number of genotypes in this intersection varies widely, but the basins of attraction of high peaks generally share a substantial fraction of genotypes (mean shared genotypes: 48%, 42%, and 36% among all pairs of high peaks for the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>)</p>
<p>The violin plots with embedded boxplots illustrate the fraction of genotypes shared between basins of attractions (vertical axis) for all pairs of high peaks in the CRP (green), Fis (orange), and IHF (purple) TF landscapes (horizontal axis). Specifically, we computed basin overlap as one minus the Jaccard coefficient (Supplementary Methods 7.5). A value of one (zero) indicates that the basin of attraction of two peaks share all (no) genotypes (CRP: 61 high peaks, N=1,830 comparisons, Fis: 172 high peaks, N=14,706 comparisons, IHF: 199 high peaks, N=19,701 comparisons). Their width represents the frequency of a given basin overlap. The vertical length of the box in each box covers the range between the first and third quartiles (IQR).

<title>Genetic drift facilitates and clonal interference reduces the attainment of high peaks</title>
<p>Taken together, our analyses thus far indicate that high peaks in the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes are more accessible than low peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), and their basins of attraction also share more genotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). However, the accessible evolutionary paths to high peaks are often indirect. In addition, the fraction of accessible paths to any one high peak dwindles rapidly with the distance from that peak (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand how these topographical features jointly affect adaptive evolution, we simulated the evolutionary dynamics on our three landscapes under the assumption that natural selection would favor strong regulation and that fitness is proportional to regulation strength.</p>
<p>Because high peaks constitute only a small fraction of all peaks (2.8%, 0.4%, and 0.5% in the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes), we hypothesized that most evolving populations would reach only low peaks. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the fact that <italic>E.coli</italic> has a low genomic mutation rate of 2.2 × 10<sup>−10</sup> per base pair per generation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, and that we study evolution only within an 8-nucleotide segment of a TFBS. In addition, <italic>E. coli</italic> has a large effective population size (&gt;10<sup>8</sup> individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>), which means that genetic drift is weak and even minor differences in fitness are visible to natural selection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. These conditions imply that a population on our landscape would evolve in the well-studied strong-selection weak-mutation regime (SSWM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. In this regime, a population is monomorphic most of the time, until a beneficial mutation arises, which usually sweeps rapidly to fixation. In other words, adaptive evolution can be modeled as an adaptive walk, in which each mutational step is taken with a fixation probability that has been derived by Kimura <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. We thus call the resulting adaptive walks Kimura walks (Supplementary Methods 8). We simulated 10<sup>3</sup> such adaptive walks starting from each of 15,000 randomly and uniformly selected starting (non-peak) TFBS genotypes from each landscape. Each random walk comprised up to 25 mutational fixation steps, unless it reached a fitness peak earlier. Each adaptive walk also accounted for known <italic>E. coli</italic> mutational biases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup> (Supplementary Methods 8).</p>
<p>As we hypothesized, most adaptive walks indeed reach only low peaks (90%, 85%, and 87% percent for the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes.). However, the percentage of walks that terminate at high peaks is several-fold greater than the proportion of high peaks. Specifically, 10 percent of walks terminate at high peaks in the CRP landscape, which is 3.6-fold higher than the percentage (2.8%) of high peaks in this landscape. In the Fis and IHF landscape, adaptive walks are 2 and 1.6-fold more likely to terminate at high peaks than expected from the proportion of these peaks among all peaks (7.4% and 8.1% percent) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). In other words, adaptive walks reach high fitness peaks more often than one might expect.</p>

</fig>
<p>The adaptive walks that reached a high peak were short (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). On average, they were also no more than half a mutational step longer than the shortest genetic distance between each starting genotype and peak (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>, CRP landscape: path length 3.2 ± 1.6 [mean±s.d.] vs. genetic distance 2.8 ± 1.2; Fis landscape: path length 3.1 ± 1.5 vs. genetic distance 2.7 ± 1.2; IHF landscape: path length 3.1 ± 1.5 vs. genetic distance 2.7 ± 1.2).</p>
<p>These short paths can be explained by our previous observation that peaks are widely distributed across the genotype spaces of the three landscapes. This distribution makes it easier for populations starting from any (non-peak) genotype to find a local peak through few mutations. Additionally, path lengths realized during adaptive walks tend to be shorter than the average lengths of accessible paths. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>) The reason is that the average length of accessible paths takes all accessible paths into consideration, whereas adaptive walks tend to stop at the first peak they encounter, which results in shorter realized path lengths.</p>
<p>Because genetic drift can cause evolving populations to escape a low fitness peak and attain a higher fitness peak, we also asked how small population sizes affect the likelihood that a population attains a high fitness peak (Supplementary Material 8, <xref rid="figs26" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S26</xref>-<xref rid="figs28" ref-type="fig">28</xref>). When simulating adaptive evolution in populations of N=15,000 individuals, we found that the likelihood that a population reaches a high peak increased by at least 10% percent (to 18%, 20%, and 21% for the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes, <xref rid="figs26" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S26</xref>-<xref rid="figs28" ref-type="fig">S28</xref>).</p>
<p>We also studied how deviations from the strong selection weak mutation regime would affect evolutionary dynamics. In large populations or at high mutation rates, populations tend to be polymorphic and are subject to clonal interference, where the most advantageous of several co-occurring mutations typically dominates and becomes fixed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. To approximate this dynamic, we conducted simulations using “greedy” adaptive walks (Supplementary Methods 8) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. In such an adaptive walk, it is always a genotype’s mutational neighbor with the highest increase in regulation strength that becomes fixed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. In other words, a greedy walk starting from a given genotype is deterministic. We, therefore, simulated only one walk for each of the 15,000 randomly chosen (non-peak) starting genotypes. We found that the fraction of greedy walks reaching high regulation peaks is slightly lower than in the SSWM regime, with 1%, 2%, and 5% fewer walks achieving such peaks in the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs29">Supplementary Figure S29</xref>). This outcome is expected, because greedy walks prioritize immediate fitness gains at the expense of the ability to discover higher fitness peaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>The attainment of peaks is highly contingent on chance events</title>
<p>Because different basins of attraction share many TFBS genotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref rid="figs24" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S24</xref>-<xref rid="figs25" ref-type="fig">S25</xref>), it is possible that adaptive evolution starting from any one genotype can reach different peaks, depending on which mutational paths it takes.

Indeed, non-peak genotypes can access on average around 30% of the total number of high peaks in each landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs25">Supplementary Figure S25</xref>). To assess the prevalence of evolutionary contingency, we determined how many different peaks are attained by 10<sup>3</sup> adaptive walks starting from the same randomly chosen genotype. We performed this analysis on 15,000 starting genotypes, focusing on the subset of those starting genotypes from which at least one high peak is reached during the 10<sup>3</sup> walks. Specifically, 28.6%, 23%, and 24.5% of starting genotypes for the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes, reached at least one high peak. Notably, these percentages represent the fraction of starting genotypes that can access at least one high peak, not the total fraction of adaptive walks that lead to a high peak, which is lower (as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). For instance, while adaptive walks starting from 28.6% of genotypes reached at least one high peak in the CRP landscape only 10% of all adaptive walks in this landscape end at a high peak (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Importantly, for any one starting genotype where random walks reached at least one high peak, they typically reached more than one high peak (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>, median±IQR, 4±4, 4±8, 6±6 for the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes, respectively). The number of high peaks attained from any one starting genotype was as large as 21, 30, and 33 for the three respective landscapes. Thus, evolutionary contingency is pervasive in all three landscapes. In addition, not only the end point of evolution but also the evolutionary trajectories leading to this end point show contingency. That is, adaptive walks starting from a specific genotype and ending at a specific high peak often take multiple paths to this peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs30">Supplementary Figure S30</xref>).</p>
<p>Biases towards specific evolutionary outcomes have been documented in both empirical and computational studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. They also exist in our landscapes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs31">Supplementary Figure S31</xref>). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref> illustrates both contingency and bias for 10<sup>3</sup> adaptive walks starting from each of 10 different genotypes in the CRP landscape (thus a total of 10<sup>4</sup> adaptive walks). Depending on the starting variant, the adaptive walks reached between 1 and 16 high peaks. Whenever different peaks are reached, they are reached by markedly different proportions of adaptive walks. The same holds in the Fis and IHF landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs32">Supplementary Figure S32</xref>). Additionally, while multiple routes to each peak can be traversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs30">Supplementary Figure S30</xref>), we observed in all three landscapes biases towards specific paths that are taken more frequently than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs33">Supplementary Figure S33</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We evaluated the ability of three <italic>E. coli</italic> global regulators to control gene expression through each of more than 30,000 TFBSs for each regulator. To achieve this, we utilized a synthetic plasmid-based system that facilitates high-throughput fluorescence measurements. This system allowed us to quantify the regulatory strength of individual TFBSs by measuring gene expression through GFP fluorescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Additionally, the system insulates the control of transcription from any direct effects library sequences might have on transcription, such as the transcriptional and translational impacts of 5’ untranslated regions on gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. Recent studies have investigated large empirical datasets of cis-regulatory genotypes, examining the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>. However, few studies have focused on these interactions from an evolutionary perspective, as we do here <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We showed that the regulatory landscapes of all three TFs are highly rugged and have multiple peaks. The ruggedness of all three landscapes is also supported by the prevalence of epistasis in them (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). A particularly important form of epistasis is sign epistasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, because it can lead to multiple adaptive peaks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> (see Supplementary Methods 7.5) Our landscapes contain up to 65% of mutation pairs with sign epistasis, a value that is especially high compared to the almost exclusively additive interactions of mutations in eukaryotic TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>. However, the TFs we study are not exceptions among other prokaryotic TFs. Recent studies have shown that epistatic interactions are common in binding sites of local prokaryotic regulators, such as AraC (sign epistasis in more than 50% of 20 mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup>) and Cl (sign epistasis in 85% of 113 mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup>). We attribute this greater incidence of epistasis to the nature of prokaryotic TFBSs. Specifically, prokaryotic TFBSs are at approximately 20bps, twice as long as eukaryotic ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup> and exhibit symmetries reflecting the dimeric state of their cognate TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup>. These factors may increase the likelihood of intramolecular epistasis.</p>
<p>Despite high ruggedness and epistasis, we found that a modest proportion of evolving populations can access the highest peaks of each landscape. Specifically, in the large populations that are typical of <italic>E. coli,</italic> at least 10% percent of evolving populations reach one of the highest peaks. The clonal interference that may occur in even larger populations or in populations with high mutation rates only modestly reduces this percentage to 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs29">Supplementary Figure S29</xref>) Conversely, in small populations where genetic drift can help a population escape from a low peak, this percentage increases to 18%. Numbers like these render the de novo evolution of strong transcription factor binding sites plausible for our three global regulators. Once such binding site have originated in one population, they can also spread to others through horizontal gene transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It is well known that epistasis can influence the trajectories of evolving populations on adaptive landscapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>. The regulation strength of a TFBS is partially determined by the combined interactions of the nucleotides within the TFBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref></sup>, which in turn affects TF-TFBS binding affinities. Different combinations of mutations can result in similar regulation strengths and create multiple evolutionary pathways to achieve optimal or near-optimal regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref></sup>. This can lead to overlapping basins of attraction among different peak TFBSs conveying strong regulation, such that even evolution starting from the same genotypes can take different paths and reach different peaks with similar regulation strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs30">Supplementary Figure S30</xref>). Indeed, we observed such overlapping basins in our landscapes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs29">Supplementary Figure S24</xref>). Moreover, epistasis can create plateaus of regulation strength where various combinations of nucleotides yield TFBSs with intermediate regulation strengths. These plateaus serve as common evolutionary intermediates that multiple starting sequences can traverse on their way to different peaks, and thus contribute further to the shared basins of attraction we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs24">Supplementary Figure S24</xref>).</p>
<p>In a landscape with substantial epistasis, the sequence of mutations that occurs in an evolving population can render adaptive evolution highly contingent on this sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. For example, some beneficial mutations within a TFBS might only be accessible after other specific mutations have occurred. Different starting sequences or early mutations can also change the spectrum of accessible mutations, leading to different peaks with similarly strong regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. Indeed, we observed in all three landscapes that different evolving populations starting from the same genotypes in the landscape attain different peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3d</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs32">Supplementary Figure S32</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">121</xref></sup>. Such contingency renders evolution less predictable <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite the prevalence of contingency in all three landscapes, evolving populations starting from the same genotype more often attain some peaks than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs32">Supplementary Figure S32</xref>). Moreover, for each attained peak with multiple possible evolutionary routes, we also observed that some paths are more frequently transversed than their alternatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs33">Supplementary Figure S33</xref>). That is, evolution is biased towards traversing some paths and attaining some peaks more often than others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref></sup>. These observations emphasize the complex interplay between chance, contingency, and evolutionary biases in shaping the outcomes of adaptive evolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The three TFs we studied here belong to different protein families, yet they have regulatory landscapes with similar topography. All three landscapes highly rugged, highly epistatic, and harbor multiple peaks that are widely scattered, and this holds for peaks of low, intermediate, and high regulation strength. This might help to explain how TFBSs with intermediate and high regulation strength can be easily attained during evolution. In addition, peak accessibility in all three landscapes increases with peak height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs31">Supplementary Figure S31</xref>). On the one hand, these commonalities may be caused by common biological or biochemical properties of the three TFs. For example, CRP has been suggested to possess nucleoid-associated protein properties similar to Fis and IHF, due to its ability to bend and loop DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the commonalities may reflect general characteristics of global gene regulation. One of them is that global TFs often bind unspecifically to multiple TFBSs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Also, they may bind DNA with a broad range of different affinities centered around intermediate affinity, rather than bind few sites but very strongly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This possibility is supported by comprehensive analyses of in vitro eukaryotic TF binding affinities for thousands of TFBS variants, showing essentially continuous binding affinity distributions for hundreds of sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite broad similarities among the three landscapes we study, we also found some differences. Most notable is the narrower distribution of regulation strengths for the binding sites of CRP compared to those of Fis and IHF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). This is not unexpected, given that CRP binding sites are known for being quasi-symmetric and less degenerate than those of Fis and IHF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Previous studies have also shown that Fis and IHF binding sites are less conserved in their nucleotide structure and more biased toward AT-rich content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref></sup>. One possible explanation for this observation is the nature of the binding dynamics of these regulators. CRP, mostly restricted to gene regulatory interactions, may have evolved to finely tune its regulatory output, resulting in a narrower distribution of regulation strengths. In contrast, Fis and IHF, which are involved in functions beyond gene regulation, such as DNA replication and genomic structural maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">129</xref></sup>, might encompass a more diverse range of regulation strengths.</p>
<p>The landscapes of our global regulators also differ in two respects from that of the previously characterized local regulator TetR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. First, the peaks of the TetR landscape are more clustered in genotype space due to its lower diversity of strongly binding TFBSs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Second, the distribution of regulation strengths for its TFBSs is narrower and shows more strongly binding TFBSs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. A possible explanation may lie in the fact that TetR regulates only two transcription units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">130</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Some of the properties of our landscapes are similar to what would be expected from theoretical models, such as uncorrelated random landscapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">132</xref></sup>. First, both kinds of landscapes have many peaks. Specifically, the number of peaks of the CRP, Fis, and IHF landscapes is 93%, 96%, and 98% of that expected in a random landscape of the same size (Supplementary methods 7.6). Second, the peaks of our landscapes are widely scattered in genotype space. This scattering may reflect a biological property, namely that global regulators can strongly bind multiple and highly diverse sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, high peaks in our empirical landscapes also have large basins of attractions, an observation that is consistent with predictions from simple theoretical models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">132</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One limitation of our work stems from our rigorous quality filtering of sort-seq data. As a result, we lack regulatory data for some 40% of the TFBSs in each landscape. This limited diversity of reliable data is a common feature in mutational library studies. It has several technical causes, such as biases in library synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">133</xref></sup>, PCR amplification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">134</xref></sup>, cloning, and loss of sequence diversity after cell sorting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>. In future work, this limitation could be overcome by a combination of strategies, such as subsampling complete genotype spaces or combining different molecular methods to overcome biases and diversity loss during PCR amplification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">135</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">136</xref></sup>, sorting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">137</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">138</xref></sup>, and high-throughput sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A second limitation comes from our use of the sort-seq method, which is best-suited for our work, because it allows the high-throughput measurement and sorting of millions of individual cells in a standardized and straightforward manner. However, the method’s accuracy depends on the binning procedure. Other studies have used between two and several dozen bins, with or without unbiased sampling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">137</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">139</xref></sup>. Recommendations emerging from this work include sorting of cells into at least four logarithmically (log<sub>2</sub>) equally-spaced bins, each covering approximately 12.5-15% of the fluorescence distribution, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">140</xref></sup>. We followed these recommendations, using 13 bins. In addition, we computed a weighted average to calculate expression values from sequences appearing in multiple bins, a straightforward method validated by robust studies in transcriptional regulation analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In addition, we validated individual regulation strengths with an independent method to demonstrate its reliability.</p>
<p>A third limitation of our study is that we only examined variation at eight positions for each TF. We selected these positions based on their importance for DNA binding and regulation by our TFs, as evidenced by their high information content. We cannot exclude the possibility that selecting a different set of positions could yield different landscape topographies. However, we speculate that less information-rich position would not reduce but rather increase the potential for the de novo evolution of strong TFBSs. For example, they may facilitate landscape navigability through extradimensional bypasses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">141</xref></sup> or provide small-incremental changes in regulation strengths. These small changes help populations reach peaks via diminishing returns effects, meaning that as a population gets closer to a peak, each subsequent mutation contributes progressively smaller improvements to regulation strength <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">142</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">143</xref></sup>. Investigating a wider array of positions and larger regulatory landscapes remains an important task for future work.</p>
<p>Fourth, we use a simplified empirical system for the study of gene regulation—a promoter followed by a single TFBS. Although this regulatory architecture exists for some genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">144</xref></sup>, global regulators often form part of more complex, combinatorial architectures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">144</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c145">145</xref></sup> that are influenced by environmental factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c146">146</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c147">147</xref></sup>, concentrations of active TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c148">148</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">150</xref></sup>, chromosome structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">151</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c155">155</xref></sup>, methylation states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c156">156</xref></sup>, and more. Studies on more complex promoter architectures may reveal regulatory landscapes with different topographies.</p>
<p>Lastly, we also analyzed the adaptive evolution of TFBSs in a simplified manner, performing data-driven evolutionary simulations rather than experimental evolution. Although many studies assume that regulation strength and fitness are correlated, this is not always the case. Low binding affinities can be adaptive during development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c157">157</xref></sup>, and many genes exhibit a nonlinear fitness-expression function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c158">158</xref></sup> with a plateau of maximal fitness across a wide range of expression levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c159">159</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c161">161</xref></sup>. For instance, most mutations and polymorphisms in the promoter of the yeast gene TDH3 do not significantly affect fitness in a glucose-rich medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c160">160</xref></sup>. For these reasons we focused our observations and interpretations on regulatory phenotypes (regulation strength). Our simplified approach allowed us to model population evolution in a large genotype space and avoid monitoring thousands of evolving regulatory sequences simultaneously in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c162">162</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c163">163</xref></sup>. However, it cannot replace experimental evolution of TFBSs, which also remains an important challenge for future work.</p>
<p>Transcription factor binding sites are among the simplest units of biological organization. Our work provides the first large-scale analysis of the regulatory landscapes formed by such sites for global transcriptional regulators. It shows that strong binding sites can readily evolve de novo, even though prokaryotic transcription factor binding sites are much larger than their eukaryotic counterparts and have more rugged regulatory landscapes. In addition, the evolution of these simple sequences also displays phenomena that have been characterized in much more complex systems, such as evolutionary contingency and evolutionary biases.</p>

<title>Sort-Seq procedure</title>
<p>To explore the regulatory effects of each transcription factor on binding sites in the corresponding library, we constructed three plasmids, each of which enables the inducible expression of one of our three TFs. These are plasmids pCAW-Sort-Seq-V2-CRP, pCAW-Sort-Seq-V2-Fis, and pCAW-Sort-Seq-V2-IHF (Supplementary Methods 3 and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We cloned the TFBS libraries (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) into their respective plasmids and then transformed them into mutant strains lacking the corresponding TFs (<italic>Δcrp</italic>, <italic>Δfis</italic>, and <italic>Δihf</italic>, as listed in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). We induced TF expression using anhydrotetracycline (Atc) and, after overnight growth, performed cell sorting for cell populations. During sorting, we distributed cells into 13 equally-spaced logarithmic bins based on their fluorescence levels. We replicated each sort-seq experiment three times from three separate library transformations for each TF. To mitigate the impact of extrinsic noise (gene expression variation among cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c165">165</xref></sup>), we adhered to standard protocols by normalizing our GFP fluorescence measurements against mScarlet-I fluorescence values obtained from flow-cytometry assays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c166">166</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c167">167</xref></sup>. We subsequently recovered the sorted cells from each bin in 50mL Falcon tubes containing 10 mL of LB medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubated them overnight at 37°C with shaking at 220 rpm. After this growth period, we re-sorted cell cultures from each bin to eliminate potential contaminants and ensure that the cell populations had preserved their fluorescence distributions. Following re-sorting, we extracted plasmids from the cell population of each bin. We amplified and barcoded the TFBS region from each population through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Lastly, we sequenced barcoded amplicons containing TFBS sequences, and used the sequencing results to calculate the regulation strengths of each TF to its TFBSs in the corresponding library. More details are provided in the Supplementary Material.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Regulation strengths</title>
<p>Due to gene expression and measurement noise, individual TFBS variants in a sort-seq experiment usually appear in more than a single bin, and their read count (frequency) varies among bins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">138</xref></sup>. Following established practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>, we used a weighted average of these frequencies for each variant to represent the mean expression level driven by the variant. To facilitate the interpretation of this quantity, we converted this expression level into a regulation strength relative to the highest observed regulation strength for a given TF, to which we assigned a value of one. From each library, we selected a single naturally occurring binding site for each TF that was previously characterized in the literature as a strong binder. We called this TFBS the WT sequence and used it as a baseline to separate weakly (higher GFP expression) from strongly (lower GFP expression) binding TFBSs.</p>

<title>Validating regulation strengths with plate reader measurements</title>
<p>To further validate our regulation strength data, we chose 10 DNA binding sites from each bin (10 variants ×13 bins = 130 variants in total per TF library, Supplementary File 2), covering a wide range of measured regulation strengths. We cloned these sequences into the appropriate vector pCAW-Sort-Seq-V2-TF (TF: CRP, Fis or IHF), and transformed them into the appropriate mutant strain. We picked individual colonies and grew them overnight (16 hours, 37°C, 220 rpm) in liquid LB supplemented with 50 μg/mL of chloramphenicol and anhydrotetracycline. We diluted the cultures to 1:10 (v/v) in cold Dulbecco’s PBS (Sigma-Aldrich #D8537) to a final volume of 1 mL. We transferred 200 μl of the diluted cultures into individual wells in 96-well plates and measured GFP fluorescence (emission: 485nm/excitation: 510nm, bandpass: 20nm, gain: 50), as well as the optical density at 600nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) as an indicator of cell density. We then normalized fluorescence by the measured OD<sub>600</sub> value to account for differences in cell density among cultures and compared the obtained ratios to the previously inferred regulation strengths for the 130 selected variants. We performed all such measurements in biological and technical triplicates (three colonies per sample, and three wells per colony, respectively).</p>

<caption><title>Construction of pCAW-Sort-Seq-V2.</title>
<p>The plasmid pCAW-Sort-Seq-V2 is a derivative of plasmid pCAW-Sort-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The figure illustrates the sequential cloning steps involved in the plasmid’s construction, from the bottom upwards. For an in-depth explanation, see <bold>Supplementary Methods</bold>. Briefly, we began with the synthesis and cloning of a codon-optimized <italic>mscarlet</italic> gene expression cassette into the pCAW-Sort-Seq plasmid, oriented antiparallel to the tetracycline resistance gene (<italic>tetr</italic>). This generated the intermediate plasmid pCAW-Sort-Seq-mscarlet plasmid. Subsequently, we inserted each TF gene, exemplified by the <italic>crp</italic> gene for the purpose of this representation, upstream of the <italic>mscarlet</italic> gene in a bicistronic operon configuration. This step created the TF-specific expression plasmid variants (one each for CRP, Fis and IHF). The final stage, not depicted here, involved the incorporation of the appropriate wild-type TFBSs and libraries into each plasmid variant upstream of the <italic>gfp</italic> gene, which yielded the library plasmids we utilized in our sort-seq experiments.</p></caption>

<p>Each violin plot is based on data from 15,000 randomly (and uniformly) sampled starting (non-peak) genotypes from each TF landscape – CRP, Fis and IHF (see color legend) – and on 1’000 Kimura adaptive walks per starting genotypes. For each pair of a starting genotype and a high peak that is attainable from this starting genotype, we calculated the number of distinct shortest paths reaching the peak (vertical axis, note logarithmic scale). The width of the violin plot at any given y-axis value represents the density of data points at that value. Wider sections indicate a higher density of data points. The text at the top of each violin indicates the median number of shortest paths and the interquartile range (IQR) for each TF. For example, in the CRP landscape peaks are reached via a median number (± IQR) of 4 (± 4) shortest paths, with a sample size (number of starting genotypes × attainable peak pairs) of N = 345,224. The violin regions appear discretized because the number of shortest paths is a discrete variable, not a continuous one. This means that the data can only take on specific integer values, resulting in discrete regions within the violin plots with a non-zero density of data points.</p></caption>

<sec id="s10">
<label>1.</label><title>General procedures</title>
<p>Although all general procedures have been previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, we describe them again below for completeness.</p>
<sec id="s10a">
<label>1.1</label><title>​Media and reagents</title>
<p>To prepare SOB medium, we mixed 25.5g of solid medium stock (VWR J906) with 960 ml of purified water and subjected the resulting suspension to autoclaving. To prepare the SOC medium, we dissolved 20 ml of 1 M D-glucose (Sigma G8270) and 20 ml of 1 M magnesium sulfate (Sigma 230391) in 960 ml of pre-prepared SOB solution. For the LB medium, we combined 25g of solid medium stock (Sigma-Aldrich L3522) with 1 liter of purified water and then autoclaved it. To prepare the M9 minimal medium, we diluted M9 minimal salt sourced from Sigma (M6030) in distilled water as per the manufacturer’s guidelines, autoclaved the solution, and added 0.4% glucose (Sigma G8270), 0.2% casamino acid (Merk Millipore, 2240), 2 mM magnesium sulfate (Sigma 230391), and 0.1 mM calcium chloride (Sigma C7902). Where required, we supplemented growth media with chloramphenicol (50 µg/mL), anhydrotetracycline (100 ng/mL, Cayman-chemicals #10009542), and/or glucose (0.4% w/v final concentration). We prepared anhydrotetracycline by diluting the dried chemical in absolute ethanol, from a stock concentration (1000X) of 100 µg/mL to a working concentration of 100 ng/mL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s10b">
<label>1.2</label><title>​Overnight incubation of cultures in liquid and solid medium</title>
<p>We cultivated bacteria in liquid LB medium (using either 15mL or 50mL Falcon tubes), enriched with chloramphenicol at a concentration of 50 µg/mL. We incubated these cultures for a period of 16 hours at a temperature of 37°C, with a shaking speed of 200rpm and 50 mm orbital motion, using an Infors HT Multitron Incubator Shaker. Similarly, for cultures in solid medium, we grew bacterial colonies on LB-agar plates (using sterile plastic Petri dishes of 90mm × 15mm dimensions), also supplemented with chloramphenicol at a concentration of 50 µg/mL, and incubated them for the same time and at the same temperature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s10c">
<label>1.3</label><title>​PCR Reactions</title>
<p>Except where specifically mentioned, we amplified DNA fragments through a polymerase chain reactions (PCR), employing Q5<sup>®</sup> high-fidelity polymerase (NEB #M0491L) to minimize mutation introduction into the amplicons. We followed the protocol recommended by NEB, aiming for a final reaction mixture of 50uL. We conducted each PCR reaction twice, and combined the products from these duplicates after the completion of the reaction. We determined the primer melting temperatures (Tm) using the NEB Tm calculator (accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tmcalculator.neb.com/#!/main">https://tmcalculator.neb.com/#!/main</ext-link>), with primers at a concentration of 500nM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s10d">
<label>1.4</label><title>​Verifying PCR products through gel electrophoresis</title>
<p>Unless indicated otherwise, we verified successful PCR amplification via gel electrophoresis to ensure the presence of singular-band amplicons and the absence of non-specific bands. This process involved separating PCR products in a 0.8% agarose Tris-EDTA (TAE) gel. We conducted electrophoresis for 45 minutes at 120V, or until the bands had progressed beyond the halfway point of the gel’s total length.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s10e">
<label>1.5</label><title>​DNA purification with commercial kits</title>
<p>Once we had confirmed a successful PCR through gel electrophoresis, we purified the PCR products utilizing the Monarch<sup>®</sup> DNA PCR/Gel Extraction Kit (NEB #T1020L), adhering to the manufacturer’s protocol. In situations requiring further purification (such as the occurrence of non-specific bands post-PCR), we performed gel purification. This involved mixing 10 μL of 6x NEB DNA dye with each 50 μL PCR product, then loading all 60 μL onto a 1% agarose gel. We carried out electrophoresis for 45 minutes at 120V, or until the bands had moved more than halfway through the gel. We then excised the DNA band corresponding to the amplified sequence using a scalpel. For extracting DNA from the gel, we used the Monarch<sup>®</sup> DNA Gel Extraction Kit (NEB #T1020L).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s10f">
<label>1.6</label><title>​Gibson assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c168">168</xref></sup></title>
<p>We assembled PCR-amplified fragments using the NEBuilder-HiFi<sup>®</sup> DNA Assembly Master Mix kit (NEB #E2621L). We determined the molarity required for assembly based on the guidelines outlined by the Barrick Lab (details available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://barricklab.org/twiki/bin/view/Lab/ProtocolsGibsonCloning">https://barricklab.org/twiki/bin/view/Lab/ProtocolsGibsonCloning</ext-link>). We incubated the assembly mix for one hour at 50°C in a dry bath incubator, followed by cooling on ice for subsequent steps.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s10g">
<label>1.7</label><title>​Preparation of electrocompetent cells</title>
<p>We utilized glycerol/mannitol step centrifugation to prepare electrocompetent cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c169">169</xref></sup>. To this end, we first cultured the appropriate <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (<xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) in 5 mL SOB medium at 37°C with a shaking speed of 250 rpm overnight. The next day, we transferred 3 mL of the culture to 300 mL SOB medium, and incubated under the same conditions until the OD600 reached a value between 0.4 and 0.6 (measured at an optical path length of 1 cm), which took approximately 2-4 hours. After cooling the culture on ice for 15 minutes, we centrifuged the cells at 4°C and 1,500 g for 15 minutes. We then resuspended the cells in 60 mL of ice-cold distilled water (dH<sub>2</sub>O) and divided them into three 50 mL tubes. Gradually, we added 10 mL of an ice-cold glycerol/mannitol solution (consisting of 20% glycerol (w/v) and 1.5% mannitol (w/v)) to each tube using a 10 mL pipette. We centrifuged the tubes at 1,500 g and 4°C for 15 minutes in an Eppendorf 5810/5810 R centrifuge with acceleration/deceleration set to zero. After discarding the supernatant, we resuspended cells in 3.0 mL of the same glycerol/mannitol solution. We transferred these suspensions to pre-cooled 1.5 mL tubes, and incubated them in a dry ice-ethanol bath for about 1 minute. Finally, we stored the suspensions at −80°C for future transformation experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s10h">
<label>1.8</label><title>​Electroporation</title>
<p>In all transformation experiments described in this study, we used 100 µL of electrocompetent cells for electroporation, employing 0.2 cm cuvettes (EP202, Cell Projects, UK) and a Micropulser electroporator (Bio-Rad) set to the EC3 setting (15k V/cm). Post-electroporation, we recovered cells in 1 mL of SOC media, warmed in advance in 15 mL Falcon tubes. This recovery step lasted for 1.5 hours at 37°C with a shaking speed of 220 rpm. Unless specified otherwise, we spread 300 µL of each recovered culture on an LB agar plate that contained 50 μg/mL chloramphenicol. We then incubated this plate overnight for 16 hours at 37 °C. Subsequently, we confirmed the identity of the clones on the plate via Sanger sequencing.</p>

<p>The plasmid pCAW-Sort-Seq-V2 is a derivative of the plasmid pCAW-Sort-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Briefly, plasmid pCAW-Sort-Seq harbours a pBBR1 replication origin, which ensures a broad host range and a low copy number—typically between 5 to 10 copies per cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c170">170</xref></sup>.It also harbours a chloramphenicol resistance gene, a TetR repression system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c171">171</xref></sup> and a TFBS measuring module. The latter consists of an interchangeable TFBS that lies between a constitutive promoter and a superfolder GFP (<italic>sfgfp</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c172">172</xref></sup>) reporter gene. In this system, TF-TFBS interactions can decrease GFP production by physically obstructing the bacterial RNA polymerase, a phenomenon known as steric hindrance. The reporter gene <italic>sfgfp</italic> is insulated by a transcriptional insulator named RiboJ, a synthetic ribozyme that removes 5’UTR interferences from variable TFBS sequences in the mRNA by self-cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c173">173</xref></sup>. More details and features have been previously described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Here, we have integrated a bicistronic expression cassette into pCAW-Sort-Seq to enable the regulated expression of a TF of choice. This cassette harbors the gene encoding one of our focal TFs situated upstream of a <italic>mscarlet-I</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c174">174</xref></sup> reporter gene to monitor the expression of this bicistronic operon via fluorescence. Regulation is achieved through the <italic>pLtetO-1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c171">171</xref></sup> promoter, a synthetic promoter tightly repressed by TetR. Expression is initiated by the addition of anhydrotetracycline (Cayman Chemicals, catalog #10009542), which relieves TetR-mediated repression and activates the expression of the entire cassette.</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Construction of the plasmid pCAW-Sort-Seq-V2 and its variants</title>
<p>We initiated the construction of pCAW-Sort-Seq-V2 by synthesizing (Twist Biosciences, Calfornia, USA) and cloning a codon-optimized <italic>mscarlet-I</italic> gene expression cassette into the pCAW-Sort-Seq plasmid. This gene is oriented antiparallel to the tetracycline resistance gene (<italic>tetr</italic>). This cloning step resulted in the formation of the intermediate pCAW-Sort-Seq-mScarlet plasmid. Subsequently, we amplified for each of our three TFs the encoding gene (<italic>crp</italic>, <italic>fis</italic> and <italic>ihf</italic>) from the genome of the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BW25113 and inserted it upstream of the <italic>mscarlet-I</italic> gene in a bicistronic operon configuration using Gibson assembly. This process produced TF-specific expression plasmid variants. The final phase involved removing the core promoter to create negative controls for each TF and cloning libraries into each plasmid variant upstream of the sf<italic>gfp</italic> gene. This yielded the plasmids used in our experiments (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The specific sets of primers used for each PCR reaction are listed in <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S6</xref>.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Library design, synthesis, and cloning</title>
<p>We based the design of the TFBS library for each TF on consensus sequences available in the RegulonDB database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, the most comprehensive database for <italic>E. coli</italic> transcriptional studies. We designed each library by randomizing the eight most important TFBS positions, such that each of the four nucleotides had an equal probability (0.25) to occur at each position. The expected library size for this approach is (4<sup>8</sup>) <sup>=</sup> 65,536 sequences. Library compositions can be found in <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. We designed libraries in the Snapgene<sup>®</sup> software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snapgene.com">snapgene.com</ext-link>), and had them synthesized by IDT (Coralville, USA) as single-stranded DNA Ultramers<sup>®</sup> of 140bp (4nmol). We resuspended each library in nuclease-free distilled water and serially diluted it to a concentration of 50ng/uL. We used Ultramers<sup>®</sup> as templates in a PCR reaction for the formation of dsDNA fragments and library amplification. We amplified the Ultramer<sup>®</sup> DNA molecules with the following PCR program: 98°C/30 s; 25 cycles of 98°C/10 s, 60°C/15 s and 72°C/80 s; and 1 cycle of 72°C/5 min. We opted for a maximum of 20 cycles to reduce amplification biases. We analyzed amplification products through gel electrophoresis to confirm that only a single product band with the expected size of around 140bp was present for each PCR reaction. After confirming the presence of single bands, we purified the products using the Monarch<sup>®</sup> DNA gel extraction kit (NEB #T1020L). Whenever unspecific bands appeared during electrophoresis, we gel-purified the PCR products using the same kit.</p>
<p>For the construction of each plasmid-based library, we digested 1μg of the purified library with HindIII-HF (NEB #R3104) and BamHI (NEB #R3136) restriction enzymes in a 100μL reaction, followed by overnight incubation at 37°C. We isolated the appropriate cloning plasmid from its host strain using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Germany), and digested it with the same enzymes. Post-digestion, we added 3μL of Quick CIP (calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase) to prevent self-ligation by dephosphorylating DNA ends. We purified the ligated DNA using the Monarch<sup>®</sup> DNA gel extraction kit (NEB #T1020L).</p>
<p>We performed the ligation with a 10:1 molar ratio of insert-to-vector, using 100ng of vector, 10 units of T4 DNA ligase (NEB #M0202L), and 2 µL of 10X ligation buffer in a 20 µL reaction. We incubated the mixture at 20-22°C for approximately 16 hours, followed by 15-minute inactivation of the ligase at 65°C. We purified the ligation product, resulting in 10 µL of DNA resuspended in dH<sub>2</sub>O. We transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> SIG10-MAX® cells by electroporation with this purified product.</p>
<p>Post-transformation, we plated 50 µL of each recovered culture on LB agar for colony-forming unit counting (cfu) and transformation efficiency estimation. From the agar plates, we selected 30 colonies for colony PCR and Sanger sequencing to assess library diversity (NightSeq<sup>®</sup> service, Microsynth, Switzerland). Our mean transformation efficiency was 10<sup>6</sup> cells per transformation. We diluted the remaining 950 µL of transformants in 9 mL of LB medium with chloramphenicol and cultured it overnight. We then aliquoted the overnight culture into 1 mL cryotubes with 20% glycerol and stored at −80°C.</p>
<p>After transforming plasmid libraries into the SIG10-MAX® strains for reasons of transformation efficiency and plasmid maintenance, we extracted the plasmids using a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Germany), and transformed them into the appropriate host mutant host strains <bold><italic>Δ</italic></bold><italic>crp, <bold>Δ</bold>fis and <bold>Δ</bold>ihf</italic> (see the strain genotypes in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).

<label>5.</label><title>Analysing and sorting cells</title>
<p>In preparation for cell sorting, we cultivated cells harboring each library in liquid LB medium enriched with chloramphenicol. Specifically, we cultured 1mL of transformed cell aliquots and a streak of cells with a control plasmid (a promoterless pCAW-Sort-Seq-V2 plasmid lacking sfGFP expression) in 50ml Falcon tubes with 9mL LB medium (containing 50 µg/mL chloramphenicol) overnight. Subsequently, we diluted these overnight cultures at a 1:100 ratio (v/v) in LB medium with chloramphenicol and divided them into two aliquots. We supplemented one aliquot with the anhydrotetracycline (Atc) inducer to express the plasmid-encoded TF. The other aliquot remained unchanged. We incubated both cultures for 5 hours until late-exponential/early-stationary phase (200RPM, 37°C). Subsequently, we diluted 20µL of the cultures in 1mL of cold filtered Dulbecco’s PBS (Sigma-Aldrich #D8537) in 15 mL FACS tubes.</p>
<p>We performed FACS-sorting on a FACS Aria III flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) using a 70 µm nozzle. We utilized a 488 nm laser for detecting forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) with a 488nm/10nm band-pass filter. We set the flow rate to 1.0, adjusting sample dilution as necessary to achieve no more than ≈10,000 events/second. Considering the small size of bacterial cells, we reduced the particle detection threshold to the lowest feasible setting (200 arbitrary units on FSC and SSC channels), increasing it to a maximum of 500 units if background noise was excessive. We then adjusted FSC-H and SSC-H for cells with the negative control plasmid to center the bacterial population in the cytometer’s software (BD FACSDiva™ Software v9.0). We based the sorting and binning of cells on both mScarlet-I (PE-Texas-Red channel, excitation laser: YellowGreen 561nm, LP filter: 600 nm, BP filter: 610/20nm) and sfGFP fluorescence (FITC channel, excitation laser: 488nm, LP filter: 502nm, BP filter: 530nm/30nm), setting both the PE-Texas-Red and FITC channels voltages so that the median fluorescence of the negative control was between 0 and 100 (arbitrary units) on the FITC-H and PE-Texas-Red-H axes.</p>
<p>Initially, the sorting process involved establishing a gate for identifying cells that are red-fluorescence-positive, i.e., reporter and thus TF-expressing. To establish this gate, we began by measuring the autofluorescence of our negative control culture on the PE-Texas-Red-H axis. Thereafter, we examined the fluorescence of a positive control that had been induced with Atc and was expressing the mScarlet-I protein. We then configured a gate around the positive mScarlet-I-expressing population, ensuring that all cells sorted through this gate exhibited a level of reporter expression higher than the negative control.</p>
<p>Next, we established the green-fluorescent sorting gates. For setting sorting gates on the FITC-H axis, we first recorded the autofluorescence of the negative control culture. This median autofluorescence defined the upper boundary of the lowest bin (B1) for the experimental population. We then analyzed the fluorescence of 10<sup>6</sup> cells expressing sfGFP and containing the library, without sorting, in order to establish the boundaries of the next binning gates. We took the lower bound of the highest bin (B13) for the experimental population to correspond to the 95th percentile of the fluorescence distribution of this population. We chose boundaries between the remaining 11 intermediate bins with equidistant spacing on a binary logarithmic (log<sub>2</sub>) scale. After we had determined the gates in this way, we calculated the fractions of the previously 10<sup>6</sup> recorded cells that fell inside each bin.</p>
<p>To maintain statistical robustness and minimize sampling error in our downstream analyses, we wanted to ensure that each of the 65,536 unique sequences in our library was represented by at least 30 cells after sorting. In addition, it was crucial to account for an anticipated diversity loss of up to 70% of the cell population during sorting, due to factors such as cell death and the dilution of low-frequency and lower-fitness genotypes during the post-sorting recovery phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>. To establish the number of cells required to be sorted initially, we thus determined a multiplicative factor <italic>f</italic> based on the minimally needed number of 30 cells per sequence and the expected cell retention rate post-sorting of 30%, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="623025v1_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> cells/sequence. We thus multiplied our initial library size by 100 for sorting purposes, i.e., we sorted total of 6,553,600 cells. This calculation aims to ensure that despite a substantial reduction in cell numbers post-sorting, each unique sequence remains adequately represented in the surviving cell population. We sorted cells into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, each containing 500 µL of LB medium, and kept at 4 °C to prevent growth during sorting and sample processing. We replicated the entire sorting procedure three times, each based on independent library transformations.</p>
<p>After sorting, we added 1mL of LB without antibiotics to each tube and removed 20 uL of the resulting volume for serial dilutions. We transferred the remaining liquid culture (980 uL) to 50 mL falcon tubes and allowed each culture to recover for 2 hours (37°C, 220 rpm). After recovery, we added 9mL of LB supplemented with chloramphenicol, and grew the cultures overnight for freezing part of them in glycerol stock aliquots, for validating our binning procedure (see below), and for extracting plasmid DNA for subsequent PCR and sequencing steps. We used the 20 uL initially removed from each 1mL culture for preparing two serial dilutions (10<sup>-4</sup> and 10<sup>-6</sup>) that we plated on LB-Cm agar plates (200uL per plate) to estimate the post-sorting viability through colony forming unit (cfu) counting. By knowing how many cells were sorted into each bin, we can estimate how many cells would be expected in our dilutions and compare this number with the cfu counts we observed. In this way, we estimated that on average (across bins) 77% of cells remained viable (standard deviation: 18.15%). We also estimated the genetic diversity of the library through Sanger sequencing of DNA from individual colonies (NightSeq<sup>®</sup> service, Microsynth, Switzerland).</p>
<p>To validate our binning procedure, we re-grew binned cultures from either overnight recovered cultures or frozen aliquot stocks. We then measured their expression distributions by flow cytometry, which reproduced the original expression measurements. This approach allowed us to compare the fluorescence distributions of the re-grown cultures with the pre-sorting distributions. Specifically, we assessed whether the geometric mean of the fluorescence distribution for each sorting bin matched those recorded during the initial sorting procedure. Next, we re-sorted cells derived from each bin in order to eliminate cell cross-contaminations and other factors that could alter the bin distributions. The geometric mean is often preferred over the arithmetic mean in this type of analysis, because it is less affected by the presence of outliers in the data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c175">175</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c176">176</xref></sup>. It is also a more accurate representation of the central tendency of data that is log-normally distributed, which is often the case with flow cytometry fluorescence measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c175">175</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c176">176</xref></sup>.</p>

<label>6.</label><title>DNA extraction and sequencing</title>
<p>We diluted 500 uL of individual glycerol stocks of each replicate subpopulation of sorted cells (i.e., cells from each bin of fluorescence intensity) in 5mL of LB supplemented with chloramphenicol in 15mL Falcon tubes, and grew the resulting cell culture overnight (16 hours, 37°C, 220 rpm). On the next day, we isolated plasmids from each culture using a QIAprep<sup>®</sup> spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Germany). In order to allow the sequencing of multiple pooled samples (multiplexing), we barcoded our regulatory region through PCR with specific HPLC-purified primers (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S6</xref>) provided by Eurofins (Konstanz, Germany). We added barcodes to the 5’region of the amplicon through a PCR reaction. We performed this PCR reaction with the Q5 high-fidelity polymerase, and did so in triplicate for each miniprep-isolated plasmid library. To calculate primer melting temperatures (Tm), we used the NEB Tm calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tmcalculator.neb.com/#!/main">https://tmcalculator.neb.com/#!/main</ext-link>) for a primer concentration of 500nM. We performed the PCR with the following program: 98°C/30 s; 25 cycles of 98°C/10 s, 64°C/30 s and 72°C/30 s; and 1 cycle of 72°C/2 min.</p>
<p>After PCR amplification, we digested the reaction products with the restriction enzymes DpnI (NEB #R0176L) and Exonuclease I (NEB #M0293L) in order to remove traces of genomic DNA, plasmids, and single-stranded DNA that could interfere with sequencing. The Master Mix we used for a single digestion harbored 1µL of 10x CutSmart<sup>®</sup> Buffer (NEB #B6004S), 1µL of Exonuclease I (NEB #M0293L), 1µL of DpnI restriction enzyme (NEB #R0176L), and 7µL of distilled nuclease-free water. For each PCR product, we added 10µL of the Master Mix. We incubated the reaction for 1 hour at 37°C, following 15 minutes at 80°C for deactivation of the enzymes.</p>
<p>We purified the digestion products using the Monarch<sup>®</sup> DNA PCR/Gel Extraction Kit (NEB #T1020L) and fractionated them through gel electrophoresis to confirm that only a single band with a size ≈150bp was present. After this confirmation, we pooled the purified PCR products from the different bins of each replicate sorting equimolarly to a total mass of 2,600 ng and a volume of 100 µL (26ng/µL of DNA) in 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes. We then sent the pooled purified amplicons for adapter ligation and sequencing at Eurofins (NGSelect Amplicons<sup>®</sup> on Illumina HiSeq), obtaining 15 million paired-end reads (2 × 150 bp) for all samples.</p>
<p>We quantified the total number of reads (<italic>t</italic>) required for sequencing based on several factors, including the number of bins (<italic>b)</italic>, biological replicates (<italic>r)</italic>, strains (<italic>s)</italic>, genotypes (<italic>g)</italic>, and the reads per genotype (<italic>p)</italic>.

<p>For each of our three TFs, the values of these parameters are <italic>b</italic>=13 bins, <italic>r</italic>=3 biological replicates, and <italic>s</italic>=1 strains, yielding <italic>n<sub>bc</sub></italic>=39. The total number of required sequence reads can be estimated through the equation:

where we aimed for <italic>p</italic>=30 paired-reads per genotype. The number <italic>g</italic> of expected genotypes per library is the same (65,536) for each TF. These values lead to a total of <italic>t</italic> = 3 × 65,536 × 30 = 7,667,712 required paired-end reads for each library.</p>

<label>7.1</label><title>​Filtering and preparing sequencing reads</title>
<p>We processed the sequencing data with a blend of custom python and awk scripts, complemented by established bioinformatics utilities. Firstly, we trimmed sequences by computationally excising Illumina adapters, followed by merging paired-end reads. We then organized the paired-end reads into distinct files, each tagged with a sequence barcode identifying the sequence bin from which the corresponding reads originated.</p>
<p>For the removal of Illumina adapter sequences from the paired-end reads, we employed Cutadapt <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c177">177</xref></sup> with the following parameters:

<p>Here, “ADAPTER_FWD” and “ADAPTER_REV_RC” are placeholders for the actual adapter sequences used, which are 5’-AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA-3’ for read 1, and 5’-AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT-3’ for read 2.</p>
<p>Because our amplicons were short (153 bp) and each sequencing sample was divided into two files with overlapping single-end reads, merging the two files (single-end reads) was necessary, for which we used the FLASH software <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c178">178</xref></sup>. After the filtering and merging of reads, we demultiplexed paired-end reads with the following FLASH parameters:
<disp-formula>

<p>Next, we utilized the FastX toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c179">179</xref></sup> to discern and preserve only those sequences that exceeded a high-quality threshold of Q = 33. Subsequently, we refined our dataset by removing sequences that contained undesirable mutations or insertions/deletions (indels) within the region extending from the start of the core promoter to the end of the variable TFBS library. We performed this filtering step using a custom R <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c180">180</xref></sup> script. Thereafter, we used custom awk and R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c180">180</xref></sup> scripts to convert the data into a table. Each row of this table contains data from one TFBS in the library, and each column contains the number of reads for this TFBS from one of the thirteen bins into which we had sorted cells. We estimated the average regulation strength of each TFBS from this data.</p>

<sec id="s16b">
<label>7.2</label><title>​Calculating regulation strengths</title>
<p>We calculated regulation strengths as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Briefly, in sort-seq experiments, sequences often appear in multiple fluorescence bins due to random mis-sorting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">137</xref></sup> and the stochastic nature of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c165">165</xref></sup>. Following methods established in previous research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>, we determined the reporter expression level driven from each TFBS variant by calculating a weighted average of bins in which the variant occurred. This involved multiplying the frequency of each sequence (<italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>) in a given bin <italic>i</italic> by a numerical value representing that bin (<italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic>=1,2,3,…,13), and then averaging these products over the total sequence count. Mathematically, this weighted average calculates as
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="623025v1_ueqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>e</italic> is the expression level driven by the sequence.</p>
<p>This approach yields a continuous spectrum of expression levels <italic>e</italic> within the range of 1 to 13. High expression values indicate robust GFP expression and, thus, weak binding of a TF to a TFBS variant. To facilitate interpretation, we inverted this scale so that higher values indicate stronger repression and lower GFP expression, i.e., we define the regulation strength <italic>b</italic> (strength of regulation) as follows:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="623025v1_ueqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>e<sub>max</sub></italic>=13 is the maximal expression level (maximal bin value). We then normalized <italic>b</italic> by the maximal regulation strength among all TFBSs we studied for a given TF. The resulting normalized regulation strength scores <italic>b</italic> vary from 0 to 1, where low scores denote TFBS variants with weak TF binding (weak reporter repression), and high scores indicate variants with strong TF binding (strong reporter repression). A score of <italic>b</italic> =1 signifies the highest regulation strength (repression) calculated among all TFBSs for a given TF.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s16c">
<label>7.3</label><title>​Combining data from triplicates</title>
<p>As a quality-filtering step, we eliminated TFBS variants that did not appear in all three replicates or that were represented by less than 30 reads in total (summing their read counts over the thirteen bins). Given that we have 13 bins and most sequences are typically found within an average of 3.4 bins, we wanted a minimum of 10 reads per bin to prevent misinterpretation of repression levels and also guide our threshold’s choice. This procedure reduced the fraction of TFBS variants for which we had sort-seq-based sequence data from 95%, 90%, and 93% of the total library size (65,536 sequences) for CRP, Fis and IHF, respectively, to 49%, 66% and 63%.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we calculated the regulation strengths <italic>b</italic> of the remaining TFBS variants (Supplementary Materials and Methods 7.2). Then, we determined the coefficient of variation of regulation strengths across replicates for each TFBS variant, which estimate the consistency of measured regulation strengths among replicates. Notably, most TFBS variants exhibited a coefficient of variation (CV) below 0.5, which was the threshold we set for filtering sequences. Sequences with a CV above 0.5 were excluded from the analysis. This threshold is commonly used in transcriptional studies employing fluorescent reporters to account for transcriptional noise and measurement variability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c165">165</xref></sup>. Finally, we averaged regulation strengths for each TFBS variant across all replicates and normalized the resulting averages by the maximal observed regulation strength among all TFBSs of a given TF.</p>

<label>7.4</label><title>​Frequency matrices and sequence logos</title>
<p>We generated frequency matrices of nucleotides that occur in TFBSs from each fluorescence bin by counting the frequency of each nucleotide at each variable position of the TFBS library. From this data, we generated heatmaps and DNA sequence logos representing the frequency matrices graphically. A sequence logo consists of a stack of the letters A, C, G, and T, at each position of a DNA sequence, where the relative size of each letter indicates its frequency in the sequence. The total height of the stack corresponds to the information content of that position, in bits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c181">181</xref></sup>. A sequence logo is a graphical representation of the informational properties of a TFBS.

<label>7.5</label><title>Creation of genotype networks and determining network metrics</title>
<p>We used in-house Python script and the Python package <italic>igraph</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c182">182</xref></sup> to generate directed genotype networks. These are graphs in which TFBS variants are nodes (vertices, genotypes), and variants that differ in a single nucleotide are connected by an edge. Each node of this network is associated with the corresponding DNA sequence and the associated regulation strength. Each edge is directed, i.e., it corresponds to a binding-score-increasing mutation, and points from a TFBS variant with lower regulation strength to a neighbor with higher regulation strength. We extracted the largest weakly connected subgraph (the“giant component” <sup>6</sup>) of the network, and used it for all further analyses. This giant component comprises the vast majority (99%) of sequenced genotypes for all of our TF landscapes. We used in-house Python and R scripts for all network analyses described below.</p>

<title>Epistasis</title>
<p>Epistasis refers to non-additive interactions between two or more mutations. It can impose severe constraints on molecular evolution, because the mutations that are beneficial in one genetic background may be deleterious in another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Epistasis between two mutations can be classified as magnitude, simple sign, or reciprocal sign epistasis, depending on the sign (i.e., positive or negative) of the fitness effect of individual mutations and their combinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In magnitude epistasis, the effect of a mutation on regulation strength varies depending on the genetic background but the sign of this effect (increasing or decreasing regulation strength) does not. Simple sign epistasis occurs if one single mutant has a lower regulation strength than both the wild type and the double mutant, while the other single mutant has a regulation strength that is intermediate to the wild type and double mutant. Reciprocal sign epistasis occurs when both mutations independently decrease regulation strength, but their combination increases regulation strength. The presence of reciprocal sign epistasis is a necessary condition for the existence of multiple peaks in an adaptive landscape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To determine the incidence of epistasis in our landscapes, we employed a method that involves identifying all “squares” in a genotype network with the <italic>motifs</italic> function from the <italic>igraph</italic> library in R. Each square consists of a “wild-type” sequence, a double-nucleotide mutant, and the corresponding two single mutants. We assessed epistasis for each square along a single axis by selecting the highest-regulation strength sequence as the double mutant. Our analysis placed each square into one of three categories: no sign epistasis, simple sign epistasis, and reciprocal sign epistasis. The no sign epistasis category included both magnitude epistasis and additivity (no epistasis) without differentiating between them, because neither affects the accessibility of landscape peaks through only binding-increasing mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>. We determined the proportion of all squares that fell into each category (see <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S5</xref>).</p>

<title>Peaks</title>
<p>A peak is a genotype (TF binding site variant) whose neighbors all convey lower regulation strength than itself. Two peaks are connected if they are neighbors and convey the same regulation strength. We refer to the genotype with the highest regulation strength as the summit or global peak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c183">183</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s16e3">
<title>Genotype connectivity</title>
<p>To evaluate the sparsity of our networks and the likelihood of peak misclassification due to the incompleteness of our landscapes, we used a metric called “genotype connectivity.” This represents the number of immediate (1-mutant) neighbors of a given genotype for which our experiment produced repression strength data. A perfect experiment creating a complete landscape data set would provide repression data for each of our 4<sup>8</sup> genotype and all of its 24 immediate neighbors. In practice, however, data for some genotypes and some of their neighbors is unavailable. We quantified the “relative connectivity” of any one genotype as the ratio of the actual number of adjacent genotypes for which we have repression data to the theoretical maximum of 24 neighbors. This measure helps us to address questions about the sparsity of our landscape and its implications. Specifically, it allows us to determine if our sample is biased, with some regions or genotypes being more connected than others. This is particularly important for assessing whether peaks and high peaks are less connected than non-peaks, which could potentially lead to peak misassignments.</p>

<sec id="s16e4">
<title>Accessible Paths</title>
<p>In the context of our genotype networks, we call a mutational path accessible if the regulation strength increases with each mutational step <sup>6,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c183">183</xref></sup>. We systematically enumerated all shortest accessible paths, distinguishing them by their path length, i.e., by the number of mutational steps in a path. Notably, there can be multiple alternative accessible paths with the same number of mutational steps from a single starting genotype to a peak.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s16e5">
<title>Basins of attraction</title>
<p>The basin of attraction of a peak comprises all TFBS variants from which accessible paths to the peak exist. We refer to the basin’s size as the number of variants in the basin. We determined basin sizes by exhaustive enumeration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s16e6">
<title>Overlap between basins</title>
<p>The basins of attraction of different peaks may comprise overlapping sets of variants. To determine the overlap between two basins B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>, we used the Jaccard index <italic>J</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">184</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c185">185</xref></sup>, which is equal to the size of the intersection between two sets of variants divided by the size of their union:

<label>7.6</label><title>​Generating randomly shuffled landscapes</title>
<p>To generate uncorrelated random landscapes for our three TF landscapes, we performed a random shuffling of regulation strength values from our genotypes, followed by landscape analysis to identify peaks. To this end, we employed an ad-hoc python script to randomly permute experimentally measured regulation strength values among all genotypes in each of our landscape. This procedure preserves the distribution of regulation strengths in each landscape, but also creates an uncorrelated random landscape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Following random shuffling, we analyzed each shuffled landscape’s topography with the same methods we had applied to the original (unshuffled) landscape to identify its peaks. To ensure statistical robustness, we repeated the random shuffling and peak identification 100 times. We then compared the number of peaks between the 100 shuffled landscapes and the original (unshuffled) landscape.</p>

<label>7.7</label><title>​Principal component analysis</title>
<p>In order to investigate which nucleotides in a TFBS are most important for changes in regulation strengths, we performed a principal component analysis for each landscape (<xref rid="figs19" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures S19</xref>-<xref rid="figs21" ref-type="fig">S21</xref>). To this end, we first one-hot-encoded our data. This encoding represents each categorical value (nucleotide at each position of a DNA string) as a binary vector of length 4. It thus converts an entire DNA string of length L into a 4xL binary matrix. We used this binary matrix to perform PCA with the R base function <italic>prcomp</italic>.</p>

<label>8.</label><title>Simulated adaptive walks</title>
<p>We simulated the adaptive evolution of a population on our landscapes by performing two different types of random walks, “greedy” adaptive random walks, and random walks based on Kimura’s model of fixation probabilities.</p>
<p>For all simulations, we assumed that only point mutations occur and that the time it takes for a point mutation to become fixed in a population is much shorter than the time it takes for a new mutation to appear that will eventually go to fixation. This scenario is also called the strong selection weak mutation (SSWM) scenario <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. Under this scenario, evolving populations are monomorphic most of the time, i.e., all individuals have the same genotype. This scenario is realistic when the product of effective population size <italic>N</italic> and mutation rate <italic>μ</italic> is small (<italic>Nμ</italic> &lt; 1), which is the case for <italic>E. coli</italic> (N=1.8<italic>×10<sup>8</sup>, μ=2×</italic>10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. It allows us to model adaptive evolution as an adaptive random walk in our landscapes. Our simulations also account for mutation bias, which means that different types of mutation have a different probability of occurring in a population. We use mutation biases that were experimentally determined for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In a greedy adaptive random walk, starting from any one genotype, only the mutational neighbor that conveys the largest fitness advantage is fixed in a population. We initiated one greedy random walk from each non-peak genotype and terminated the walk once a fitness peak was reached, i.e., once every neighbor of the current genotype had lower fitness than the genotype itself. Because every greedy random walk is deterministic in the absence of neutral mutations, it is sufficient to initiate one greedy random walk per starting genotype.</p>
<p>Another well-established model for random walks allows for genetic drift. It uses fixation probabilities computed by Kimura<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c186">186</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c187">187</xref></sup> i.e., <italic>f<sub>ij</sub></italic> = (1 – <italic>e</italic><sup>-2<italic>s</italic></sup>) / (1 – <italic>e</italic><sup>-2<italic>Ns</italic></sup>), where <italic>f<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the probability of fixing mutation <italic>j</italic> in the background of genotype <italic>i</italic>, <italic>N</italic> is the effective population size, and <italic>s</italic> is the selection coefficient, i.e. the difference in fitness between genotypes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c186">186</xref></sup>. For a given pair of genotypes, the only parameter of this model is the effective population size <italic>N</italic>, for which we explored values of <italic>N</italic>=10<sup>8</sup>, <italic>N</italic>=10<sup>5</sup> and <italic>N</italic>=10<sup>2</sup>. Generally, the smaller the population size is, the larger is the probability that neutral or deleterious mutations become fixed in a population.</p>
<p>For these “Kimura” adaptive walks, we chose 15,000 random starting genotypes for each of the three values of <italic>N</italic>, and simulated 1,000 random walks for each of them. At each step, we randomly picked a mutation <italic>j</italic>, generated a random number in the interval [0, 1], and considered the mutation to become fixed if the random number fell within the interval [0, <italic>f<sub>ij</sub></italic>]. Computationally, we accelerated this process by precomputing all fixation probabilities for all genetic backgrounds, and then used the <italic>python</italic> function <italic>numpy.choice</italic> to generate a random sample from the multinomial distribution of fixation probabilities at each step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c188">188</xref></sup>. Because of genetic drift, Kimura’s random walks do not necessarily terminate when they reach a fitness peak. For this reason, we simulated each such random walk for a maximum of 25 mutational steps.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>For each of the three key transcription factor (TF) proteins in E. coli, the authors generate a large library of TF binding site (TFBS) sequences on plasmids, such that each TFBS is coupled to the expression of a fluorescence reporter. By sorting the fluorescence of individual cells and sequencing their plasmids to identify each cell's TFBS sequence (sort-seq), they are able to map the landscape of these TFBSs to the gene expression level they regulate. The authors then study the topographical features of these landscapes, especially the number and distribution of local maxima, as well as the statistical properties of evolutionary paths on these landscapes. They find the landscapes to be highly rugged, with about as many local peaks as a random landscape would have, and with those peaks distributed approximately randomly in sequence space. The authors find that there are a number of peaks that produce regulation stronger than that of the wild-type sequence for each TF and that it is not too unlikely to reach one of those &quot;high peaks&quot; from a random starting sequence. Nevertheless, the basins of attractions for different peaks have significant overlap, which means that chance plays a major role in determining which peak a population will evolve to.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The experiments and analysis of this paper are very well-executed and, by and large, very thorough (with an important exception identified below). I appreciated the systematic nature of the project, both the large-scale experiments done on three TFs with replicates and the systematic analysis of the resulting landscapes. This not only makes the paper easy to follow but also inspires confidence in their results since there is so much data and so many different ways of analyzing it. It's a great recipe for other studies of genotype-phenotype landscapes to follow.</p>
<p>(2) Considering how technical the project was, I am really impressed at how easy to read I found the paper, and the authors deserve a lot of credit for making it so. They do a great job of building up the experiments and analyses step-by-step and explaining enough of the basics of the experimental design and the essence of each analysis in the main text without getting too complicated with details that can be left to the Methods or SI. Compared to other big data papers, this one was refreshingly not overwhelming.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The main weakness of this paper, in my view, is that it felt disconnected from the larger body of work on fitness and genotype-phenotype landscapes, including previous data on TFBSs in E. coli, genotype-phenotype maps of TFBSs in other systems, protein sequence landscapes (e.g., from mutational scans or combinatorially-complete libraries), and fitness landscapes of genomic mutations (e.g., combinatorially-complete landscapes of antibiotic resistance alleles). I have no doubt the authors are experts in this literature, and they probably cite most of it already given the enormous number of references. But they don't systematically introduce and summarize what was already known from all that work, and how their present study builds on it, in the Abstract and Introduction, which left me wondering for most of the paper why this project was necessary. Eventually, the authors do address most of these points, but not until the end, in the Discussion. Readers who have no familiarity with this literature might read this paper thinking that it's the first paper ever to study topography and evolutionary paths on genotype-phenotype landscapes, which is not true.</p>
<p>There were two points that made this especially confusing for me. First, in order to choose which nucleotides in the binding sites to vary, the authors invoke existing data on the diversity of these sequences (position-weight matrices from RegulonDB). But since those PWMs can imply a genotype-phenotype map themselves, an obvious question I think the authors needed to have answered right away in the Introduction is why it is insufficient for their question. They only make a brief remark much later in the Results that the PWM data is just observed sequence diversity and doesn't directly reflect the regulation strength of every possible TFBS sequence. But that is too subtle in my opinion, and such a critical motivation for their study that it should be a major point in the Introduction.</p>
<p>The second point where the lack of motivation in the Introduction created confusion for me was that they report enormous levels of sign epistasis in their data, to the point where these landscapes look like random uncorrelated landscapes. That was really surprising to me since it contrasts with other empirical landscape data I'm familiar with. It was only in the Discussion that I found some significant explanation of this - namely that this could be a difference between prokaryotic TFBSs, as this paper studies, and the eukaryotic TFBSs that have been the focus of many (almost all?) previous work. If that is in fact the case - that almost all previous studies have focused on eukaryotic TFBSs or other kinds of landscapes, and this is the first to do a systematic test of prokaryotic TFBS, then that should be a clear point made in the Abstract and Introduction. (I find a comparable statement only in the very last paragraph of the Discussion.) If that's the case, then I would also find that point to be a much stronger, more specific conclusion of this paper to emphasize than the more general result of observing epistasis and contingency (as is currently emphasized in the Abstract), which has been discussed in tons of other papers. This raises all sorts of exciting questions for future studies - why do the landscapes of prokaryotic TFBSs differ so dramatically from almost all the other landscapes we've observed in biology? What does that mean for the evolutionary dynamics of these different systems?</p>
<p>(2) I am a bit concerned about the lack of uncertainties incorporated into the results. The authors acknowledge several key limitations of their approach, including the discreteness of the sort-seq bins in determining possible values of regulation strength, the existence of a large number of unsampled sequences in their genotype space, as well as measurement noise in the fluorescence readouts and sequencing. While the authors acknowledge the existence of these factors, I do not see much attempt to actually incorporate the effect of these uncertainties into their conclusions, which I suspect may be important. For example, given the bin size for the fluorescence in sort-seq, how confident are they that every sequence that appears to be a peak is actually a peak? Is it possible that many of the peak sequences have regulation strengths above all their neighbors but within the uncertainty of the fluorescence, making it possible that it's not really a peak? Perhaps such issues would average out and not change the statistical nature of their results, which are not about claiming that specific sequences are peaks, just how many peaks there are. Nevertheless, I think the lack of this robustness analysis makes the results less convincing than they otherwise would be.</p>

<p>The authors aim to investigate the ability of evolution to create strong transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) de novo in E. coli. They focus on three global transcriptional regulators: CRP, Fis, and IHF, using a massively parallel reporter assay to evaluate the regulatory effects of over 30,000 TFBS variants. By analyzing the resulting genotype-phenotype landscapes, they explore the ruggedness, accessibility, and evolutionary dynamics of regulatory landscapes, providing insights into the evolutionary feasibility of strong gene regulation. Their experiments show that de novo adaptive evolution of new gene regulation is feasible. It is also subject to a blend of chance, historical contingency, and evolutionary biases that favor some peaks and evolutionary paths.</p>
<p>(1) Strengths of the methods and results:</p>
<p>The authors successfully employed a well-designed sort-seq assay combined with high-throughput sequencing to map regulatory landscapes. The experimental design ensures reliable measurement of regulation strengths. Their system accounts for gene expression noise and normalizes measurements using appropriate controls.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Landscape Mapping:</p>
<p>
The study examines ~30,000 TFBS variants per transcription factor, providing statistically robust and thorough maps of the regulatory landscapes for CRP, Fis, and IHF. The landscapes are rigorously analyzed for ruggedness (e.g., number of peaks) and epistasis, revealing parallels with theoretical uncorrelated random landscapes.</p>
<p>Evolutionary Dynamics Simulations:</p>
<p>
Through simulations of adaptive walks under varying population dynamics, the authors demonstrate that high peaks in regulatory landscapes are accessible despite ruggedness. They identify key evolutionary phenomena, such as contingency (multiple paths to peaks) and biases toward specific evolutionary outcomes.</p>
<p>Biological Relevance and Novelty:</p>
<p>
The author's work is novel in focusing on global regulators, which differ from previously studied local regulators (e.g., TetR). They provide compelling evidence that rugged landscapes are navigable, facilitating de novo evolution of regulatory interactions. The comparison of landscapes for CRP, Fis, and IHF underscores shared topographical features, suggesting general principles of global transcriptional regulation in bacteria.</p>
<p>(2) Weaknesses of the methods and results:</p>
<p>Undersampling of Genotype Space:</p>
<p>
While the quality filtering of the data ensures robustness, ~40% of the TFBS space remains uncharacterized. The authors acknowledge this limitation but could improve the analysis by employing subsampling or predictive modeling.</p>
<p>Simplified Regulatory Architecture:</p>
<p>
The study considers a minimal system of a single TFBS upstream of a reporter gene. While this may have been necessary for clarity, this simplification may not reflect the combinatorial complexity of transcriptional regulation in vivo.</p>
<p>Lack of Experimental Validation of Simulations:</p>
<p>
The adaptive walks are based on simulated dynamics rather than experimental evolution. Incorporating in vivo experimental evolution studies would strengthen the conclusions. Although this is a large request for the paper, that would not prevent publication.</p>
<p>Impact on the Field:</p>
<p>
This study advances our understanding of adaptive landscapes in gene regulation and offers a critical step toward deciphering how global regulators evolve de novo binding sites. The findings provide foundational insights for synthetic biology, evolutionary genetics, and systems biology by highlighting the evolutionary accessibility of strong regulation in bacteria.</p>
<p>Utility of Methods and Data:</p>
<p>
The sort-seq approach, combined with landscape analysis, provides a robust framework that can be extended to other transcription factors and systems. If made publicly available, the study's data and code would be valuable for researchers modeling transcriptional regulation or studying evolutionary dynamics.</p>
<p>Additional Context:</p>
<p>
The study builds on a growing body of work exploring regulatory evolution. For instance, recent studies on local regulators like TetR and AraC have revealed high ruggedness and epistasis in TFBS landscapes. This study distinguishes itself by focusing on global regulators, which are more biologically complex and influential in bacterial gene networks. The observed evolutionary contingency aligns with findings in other biological systems, such as protein evolution and RNA folding landscapes, underscoring the generality of these evolutionary principles.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>
The authors successfully mapped the genotype-phenotype landscapes for three global regulators and simulated evolutionary dynamics to assess the feasibility of strong TFBS evolution. They convincingly demonstrate that ruggedness and epistasis, while prominent, do not preclude the evolution of strong regulation. Their results support the notion that gene regulation evolves through a blend of chance, contingency, and evolutionary biases.</p>
<p>This paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of regulatory evolution in bacteria. While minor limitations exist, the authors' methods are robust, and their findings are well-supported. The work will likely be of broad interest to researchers in molecular evolution, synthetic biology, and gene regulation.</p>
