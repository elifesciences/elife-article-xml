<title>Abstract</title><p>Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) is a common and inevitable factor leading to poor prognosis in various liver diseases, making the outcomes of current treatments in clinic unsatisfactory. Metformin has been demonstrated to be beneficial to alleviate HIRI in recent studies, however, the underpinning mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we found metformin mitigates HIRI-induced ferroptosis through reshaped gut microbiota in mice, which was confirmed by the results of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) treatment but showed the elimination of the beneficial effects when gut bacteria were depleted using antibiotics. Detailedly, through 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing, we identified that the metformin-reshaped microbiota was characterized by the increase of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) producing bacteria. This increase was further confirmed by the elevation of GABA synthesis key enzymes, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and putrescine aminotransferase (PAT), in gut microbes of metformin-treated mice and healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the benefit of GABA against HIRI-induced ferroptosis was demonstrated in GABA-treated mice. Collectively, our data indicate that metformin can mitigate HIRI-induced ferroptosis by reshaped gut microbiota, with GABA identified as a key metabolite.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) remains a major cause of liver damage mainly following liver transplantation, complicated hepatectomy, haemorrhagic shock and severe liver trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Traditional therapeutics have been developed and repurposed to treat HIRI, including ischemic preconditioning, machine perfusion technologies, gene interventions, and stem cell therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Unfortunately, current treatments are not satisfactory due to the complicated pathogenesis of HIRI. Recently, a novel theory relating to the gut-liver axis has been well accepted, demonstrating that gut microbiota is vital for liver diseases, however, there is no strategy targeted this theory to alleviate HIRI in clinical practice.</p>
<p>The liver links with the intestine by portal circulation which allows the transfer of gut-derived products, not only nutrients, but also microbial metabolites and components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> As an important part of the gut-liver communication, the intestinal mucosal and vascular barriers limit the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and reaching the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Additionally, it is generally believed that liver injury can provoke intestinal mucosal damage and inflammation, further resulting in gut dysbiosis, which reversely induces a secondary attack on the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Microbial agents, such as synbiotics and probiotics, have demonstrated to attenuate different liver diseases in animal studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> indicating that modulating gut microbes potentially prevents HIRI in clinical practice.</p>
<p>Recently, the hypoglycaemic drug, metformin, has attracted intensive attention in its pleiotropic biological actions in various diseases, such as obesity, cancer, nuroinflammation, especially liver diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> As evidences shown, the gut with high concentration of metformin become an important action site to reshape microbiota.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> According to <italic>Sun et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> metformin was proven to decrease the abundance of the <italic>B. fragilis</italic> species and to increase the levels of bile acid and glycoursodeoxycholic acid in the gut, which inhibited intestinal farnesoid X receptor against obesity-related metabolic dysfunction in mice. Moreover, it is also demonstrated that metformin could attenuate sepsis-related liver injury by increasing the proportion of <italic>Bifidobacterium, Muribaculaceae, Parabacteroides distasonis,</italic> and <italic>Alloprevitella</italic> in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> As for the HIRI, metformin has also shown the protective effect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> but the detailed role of gut microbiota remains unclear.</p>
<p>Although metformin showed protective effects on HIRI, the role and distinctions of reshaping microbes have yet to be determined. In the present study, we sought to elucidate that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing bacteria played a critical role for the protective effects of metformin against HIRI by using 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing to find the different features of gut microbiota. The finding was reconfirmed by the results of mice that were treated with metformin-reshaped fecal microbiota or oral antibiotics administration. Furthermore, GABA was found to show a protective effect on HIRI by intraperitoneally injection into mice in advance, while an increase of microbial GABA was observed in both mice and human experiments after metformin treatment. Evidenced by the improvement of HIRI, we hypothesize that metformin-reshaped gut microbiota elicits greater therapeutic responses for liver diseases and serve as a promising targeted therapeutic.</p>

<title>Metformin significantly mitigates HIRI and reshapes gut microbiota in mice</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the protective effect of metformin on HIRI, survival experiment was employed in mice. The survival rate of HIRI mice increased from 41.67% to 90.00% after metformin intervention (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), accompanied by hepatic morphological and histopathological improvement including the recovery of liver pathological structure, the decrease in red blood cell aggregation and consumption of liver glycogen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), as well as the decrease in serum activity of ALT and AST (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Qualification of MDA and GSH concentrations in the mice liver demonstrated that the presence of metformin significantly attenuated HIRI-induced oxidation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to clarify the critical role of gut microbiota in the pleiotropic actions of metformin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> fecal samples were collected from the mice to perform 16S rRNA sequencing. It was found that the gut microbiota was substantially modulated in IR + metformin (Met) group, showing decreased abundance (alpha diversity) and reshaped distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Next, as the microbiota-gut-liver axis theory indicates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> HIRI-induced dysfunction of the gut barrier may aggravate liver damage by disrupting the gut microbiota. H&amp;E staining of the colon and ileum, mainly involved in gut barrier dysfunction, showed that the density and integrity of intestinal mucosa were strikingly reduced by HIRI, which was restored by metformin treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). The immunofluorescence analysis of colon tissues showed that the decreased tight junction protein ZO-1 and Occludin in HIRI-treated mice were reversed by metformin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). Similarly, western blot analysis of Occludin in colon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>) and the mRNA levels of <italic>Occludin</italic>, <italic>ZO-1, Claudin-1, JAM1</italic> and <italic>JAM4</italic> in ileum of HIRI mice were increased with metformin administration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). The inflammatory cytokine <italic>IL</italic>-6, <italic>IL-1</italic>β and <italic>IL-18</italic> were significantly upregulated in the ileum and colon received HIRI and were reduced by metformin treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>). In addition, the serum FD-4 level in IR group was cut down by metformin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref>). These results suggested that metformin plays a critical role in restoring gut barrier function and alleviating HIRI.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Metformin-reshaped fecal microbiota attenuates HIRI</title>
<p>In order to further confirm the role of metformin in reshaping the gut microbiota, microbes were transplanted into mice before inducing reperfusion (IR). As expected, the survival analysis of mice in the IR + fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) group showed a similarly protective efficacy as the IR + Met group, as indicated by the significantly improved survival rate of IR mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). This finding was validated by ALT and AST levels as well as H&amp;E, PAS and DHE staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). FMT treatment could restore the GSH level but reduce the accumulation of MDA in hepatic tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Furthermore, a decreased alpha diversity was observed in the FMT group, similar to IR + Met group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Meanwhile, the attenuation of gut damage was showed by H&amp;E staining, and the improvement in tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin, and decreased HIRI-induced <italic>IL-1</italic>β, <italic>IL-6</italic>, and <italic>IL-18</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). Serum FD-4 level showed a sharply decrease in IR + FMT group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). To further identify the function of gut microbes, experiments were designed, and combination treatment of antibiotics (1 mg/mL penicillin sulfate, 1 mg/mL neomycin sulfate, 1 mg/mL metronidazole and 0.16 mg/mL gentamicin) and metformin were employed for 1 week before IR treated. As results showed, the survival rate of IR + Met + antibiotics (Abx) group was greatly reduced, while the levels of ALT, AST, MAD and GSH were completely opposite to IR + Met group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref>). The results confirmed that gut microbiota is critical for the effect of metformin against HIRI.</p>

<title>FMT alleviates HIRI-induced ferroptosis through reshaped fecal microbiota</title>
<p>Since the reperfusion-induced excessive oxidative stress takes place in iron-rich hepatocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> experiments were designed to observe ferroptosis in HIRI. The ferroptosis inhibitor, DFO, significantly ameliorated the liver injury, suggesting that ferroptosis contributes to HIRI (sFig. 1). Hence, to find out the relation, ferroptosis-related indicators were also monitored in both IR + Met and IR + FMT groups. The increased accumulation of Fe after HIRI was significantly cut down by metformin and FMT treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that the HIRI-induced upregulation of ferroptotic parameters, <italic>ACSL4, SLC7A11, SLC39A14</italic> and <italic>COX-2,</italic> were significantly decreased by metformin and its reshaped gut microbiota, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). The results of western blotting further confirmed the anti-ferroptosis of metformin and FMT by the remarkable reduction of ACSL4, TFR1, VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3 levels and the apparent increase of antiferroptotic FTH1 and Xct levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>), The results was further consolidated by lipid ROS staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>).

<title>Metformin induces GABA-producing gut microbiota</title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which pathway participates metformin-treated IR injury, we analysed gene expression profiles of each group mice. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that 9697 genes were in common among four groups (sFig. 6). Therefore, we used these common genes for KEGG analysis, showing that similar mRNA changes are mainly concentrated in the three top pathways: lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). Given the close relevance between lipid metabolism and ferroptosis (sFig. 2), and the fact of carbohydrate metabolism is a primary way to metabolize amino acids, 22 species of amino acid were detected in liver tissues using HPLC-MS/MS for further identification of key metabolites involved in the role of metformin against HIRI-induced ferroptosis. It was found that only GABA level is significantly increased by metformin treatment and FMT treatment (sFig. 3), further verifying by the data of ELISA detection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Moreover, it was observed that the genus of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> had a significant increase based on the 16s rRNA gene sequencing of metformin-treated mice microbes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis of eukaryotic GABA synthesis key enzymes including <italic>SSADH, GABA-T, Gad1</italic> and <italic>Gad2</italic> in liver tissues, were not upregulated by metformin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), which was also confirmed by western blotting detection of GAD1 and GAD2 in liver (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Interestingly, the fecal GABA concentration was shown a significant increase in metformin-treated mice, which was copied by the IR + FMT group, but eliminated by antibiotics treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). In order to further identify the increased GABA originates from gut microbiota, two key enzymes of prokaryotes GABA synthesis, GAD and PAT, were detected on DNA level, finding that both of them are significantly increased in the feces from IR+Met and IR+FMT groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g and h</xref>). In order to clarify the specific effects of metformin on microbiota, given the big safety margin, healthy volunteers were recruited for a 1 week of daily oral 500mg dose of metformin trial. Fecal samples were collected before and after oral administration of metformin for metagenomic analysis. Detailedly, the species of Bacteroides containing Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides unifomis, and Bacteroides salyersiae, were enriched in human gut after metformin administration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). Excitingly, the increase of GABA production, and the expression of GAD and PAT were shown in the results of fecal experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, accompanied by the decreased glutamic acid (Glu), a key substrate for gut microbiota to synthesize GABA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j and k</xref>). Besides, putrescine, another substrate of GABA synthesis, was not found in primary culture medium but appeared after 24h fermentation and then was consumption later in the anaerobic culture of human feces experiment. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4l</xref>). Taken collectively, GABA- producing gut microbiota was upregulated by metformin.</p>

<title>GABA is the critical metabolite of metformin-reshaped gut microbiota against HIRI-induced ferroptosis</title>
<p>The animal experiment was designed to further observe the effects of GABA on HIRI-induced ferroptosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). As expected, the data showed that GABA treatment reduced histological damage and liver glycogen consumption (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Serum liver function detection showed that ALT and AST activities were dramatically depressed after GABA treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>).

The results of western blotting showed the anti-ferroptosis effect of GABA treatment by the significant reduction in ACSL4, TFR1, VDAC1,2,3 and increase of anti-ferroptotic FTH1 levels, which had the same attenuating effect as metformin and FMT treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). In addition, the clustergram showed GABA upregulated the genes of antiferroptosis and depressed the proferroptic ones, which was similar to the effect after metformin treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). In summary, GABA treatment reduced HIRI- induced ferroptosis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Metformin has been well researched for treating various liver diseases due to its multifarious effects. Notably, it has been well documented that oral administration of metformin lead to therapeutic effects on HIRI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> leaving a thought-provoking question in its underlying mechanism. In the current study, the changes in the gut microbiota altered by metformin are demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for conferring liver injury protection. Moreover, it has been confirmed that metformin attenuated HIRI by the increased GABA from reshaped gut microbiota, through anti-ferroptosis.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence shows that the gut microbiota is critical for the pleiotropic actions of metformin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Interestingly, metformin was previously found to have a much higher concentration in the gut lumen than other organs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> as also confirmed by the current study. In fact, that concentration favoured the action of metformin on reshaping gut microbes. Despite the distinct heterogeneity of metformin-reshaped gut microbiota in recent research, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> with a high abundance of gut microbes was reported to be reduced after metformin treatment in studies of hyperlipidemia and diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> which other studies vary from for the different action of this bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> In our study, we used a disease model of HIRI, which may have unique characteristics compared to other disease models. It is possible that the specific disease model influenced the response of the gut microbiota. Additionally, the starting microbiota of the recipients and the characteristics of the donor microbiota used for FMT could also play a role in the disparity. Our findings showed an increase abundance of the genus of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> after metformin treatment supported by the data of mice and healthy volunteers. Detailedly, the increased <italic>Bacteroides</italic> especially <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides unifomis,</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides salyersiae</italic> were observed in the human gut after metformin administration. The enriched <italic>Bacteroides theaiotaomicron,</italic> a glutamate-fermenting commensal, was reported to be decreased in obese individuals and was inversely correlated with serum glutamate concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Therefore, <italic>Bacteroides theaiotaomicron</italic> might be the potential bacterium regulating of GABA production. Little research has been done on <italic>Bacteroides unifomis</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides salyersiae</italic>, needing a further exploration of their characteristics in the future. Notably, <italic>Phascolarctobacterium</italic>, coexistly with <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> was reported as an emerging probiotic which showed a significant increase in our study. Taken collectively, those reshaped bacteria after metformin treatment may be responsible for attenuating HIRI.</p>
<p>Increased GABA was shown from the metformin reshaped gut microbiota for the first time, verified by our results of feces from mice and humans. As the critical metabolite of bacteria against acid stress, GABA was extensively produced by gut microbes, especially the species with strong capacity of acid resistance. Interestingly, our analysis of the sequences in PUBMED Genebank found that those three species of <italic>Bacteroides, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides unifomis, and Bacteroides salyersiae,</italic> which belong to metformin reshaped microbiota, contain the key enzyme genes of GABA synthesis GAD and PAT (sFig 4), further confirmed by the qRT-PCR result of human fecal DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment. Specifically, the species with the strong ability of producing GABA such as <italic>Bacteroides theaiotaomicron, Bacteroides unifomis and Bacteroides salyersiae</italic> were increased in metformin-treated volunteers. Some studies were published to elucidate the mechanism of metformin regulating bile acids and folate metabolite by reshaped gut microbiota, however, there is no report about how metformin to affect GABA synthesis of gut microbes. The data from anaerobic cultured human feces showed that metformin promoted the increase of GAD and PAT, and GABA level along with the substrate consumption of glutamate and putrescine in a time-dependent manner.</p>
<p>GABA production was reported to be critical against acid stress for microbiota to survive and preserve metabolic activity, especially in the human gut with a lower pH than other animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> Humans benefit from bacteria-derived GABA. Peripheral GABA was first demonstrated in intestinal flora in 1981 and further confirmed by recent studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> In addition to the important role in the central neural system and immune system, GABA showed a protective effect in different acute liver injury models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> Published papers have shown that GABA performs beneficial effect through binding to the GABA receptors or promoting histone acetylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Our data from GABA-treated mice showed protective effects against HIRI-induced ferroptosis. However, further studies are required to examine the exact molecular mechanisms of GABA regulating ferroptosis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated metformin-reshaped gut microbiota performs therapeutic responses for HIRI. Gut microbiota has been obviously modified while receiving oral metformin treatment, suggesting that metformin-reshaped gut microbiota has enhanced intestinal mucosal function so that reduce harmful substances to the liver, which most efficiently evade damage. Specifically, GABA producing bacteria were significantly regulated after metformin administration. Demonstrated for the first time, we showed that the increased GABA is a key metabolite of gut microbiota for metformin to mitigate HIRI. These results offer a unique therapeutic strategy, with optimized gut microbiota, that can serve as a target for metformin treating liver diseases.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding on the impact of metformin-induced shifts in gut microbial community structure and metabolite levels for drug efficacy in a mouse model of liver injury. The current evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>incomplete</bold>, although inclusion of additional controls and a revision to clarify the reviewer's methodological concerns could strengthen the study. With revision, this paper could be of broad interest to researchers across multiple disciplines, including the microbiome, liver disease, and pharmacology.</p>

<p>The major strength of this work is its scope, including detailed mouse phenotyping, inter-disciplinary methods, and numerous complementary experiments. The antibiotic depletion and FMT experiments provide support for a role of the gut microbiota in this mouse model.</p>
<p>A major limitation is the lack of studies narrowing down which microbes are responsible. Sequencing data is shown, but no follow-up studies are done with bacterial isolates or defined communities.</p>
<p>The link to GABA is also somewhat tenuous. While it does match the phenotypic data, there are no targeted experiments in which GABA producing microbial communities/strains are compared to a control community/strain. As such, it seems difficult to know how much of the effects in this model are due to GABA vs. other metabolites.</p>
<p>My major recommendation would be to revise the title, abstract, and discussion to provide more qualification and to consider alternative interpretations.</p>
<p>Some key controls are also missing, which could be addressed by repeat experiments in the mouse model. The antibiotic depletion experiment would be improved by testing the effect of antibiotics in the absence of metformin, to see if the effect is just driven by the model itself as opposed to an interaction between metformin and antibiotics. The FMT experiment lacks a control group and suffers from pseudoreplication: multiple donors from metformin treated and untreated mice could be used to colonize separate groups of recipient mice.</p>

<p>The authors examine the use of metformin in the treatment of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) and suggest the mechanism of action is mediated in part by the gut microbiota and changes in hepatic ferroptosis. While the concept is intriguing, the experimental approaches are inadequate to support these conclusions.</p>
<p>The histological and imaging studies were considered a strength and reveal a significant impact of metformin post-HIRI.</p>
<p>Weaknesses largely stem from the experimental design. The impact of metformin on the microbiota is profound resulting in changes in bile acid, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. Throughout the manuscript no comparisons are made with metformin alone which would better capture the metformin-specific effects. With the pathology and metabolic disturbances resulting from HIRI, it is important to understand if metformin is providing beneficial effects from reported mechanisms such as changes in bile acid, glucose, and/or lipid metabolism, or are these changes the result of a new unappreciated mechanism. A comparison of the reported and the new pathways is not included.</p>
<p>Overall, while the concept is interesting and has potential to better understand the pleiotropic functions of metformin, the limitations with the experimental design and lack of key controls make it challenging to support the conclusions.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Many drugs have off-target effects on the gut microbiota but the downstream consequences for drug efficacy and side effect profiles remain unclear. Herein, Wang et al. use a mouse model of liver injury coupled to antibiotic and microbiota transplantation experiments. Their results suggest that metformin-induced shifts in gut microbial community structure and metabolite levels may contribute to drug efficacy. This study provides valuable mechanistic insights that could be dissected further in future studies, including efforts to identify which specific bacterial species, genes, and metabolites play a causal role in drug response. Importantly, although some pilot data from human subjects is shown, the clinical relevance of these findings for liver disease remain to be determined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for reviewing our manuscript. We appreciate your valuable feedback. We agree that the downstream consequences of off-target effects on the gut microbiota by various drugs remain unclear. Our study aimed to shed light on this aspect by utilizing a mouse model of liver injury and conducting antibiotic and microbiota transplantation experiments. Our findings suggest that shifts in the structure and metabolite levels of the gut microbial community induced by metformin play a role in the drug’s efficacy. We believe that these mechanistic insights provide a strong foundation for further investigations. Specifically, future studies could focus on identifying the specific bacterial species, genes, and metabolites that have a causal role in drug response. While we have included some pilot data from human subjects, we acknowledge that the clinical relevance of our findings in the context of liver disease still requires further determination. In fact, we focused on the alteration of microbiota and metabolism caused by metformin in human bodies, which could capture the characteristics of changes in a more composite clinical direction, elucidating the potential role of metformin. We appreciate your attention to this aspect and thank you again for your thoughtful review and valuable suggestions.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the limitation of our study in not narrowing down the specific microbes responsible for the observed effects. We hold the opinion that metformin exerts its effects through modulation of specific metabolic pathways unique to the microbial community. Previous study has shown that metformin can inhibit microbial folate metabolism, leading to longevity-promoting effects that are not attributed to a single colony or strain[1]. Similarly, the impact of metformin on amino acid metabolism in the microbial community appears to be widespread. While further investigations with bacterial isolates or defined communities are needed, our findings suggest that metformin's effects on microbial metabolism are complex and involve multiple members of the microbial community.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with your point regarding the tenuous link to GABA in our study. While we did observe an increase in GABA as the only amino acid following metformin treatment, and this finding has not been reported previously, we acknowledge the need for targeted experiments comparing GABA-producing microbial communities/strains to control communities/strains. Previous literatures suggest that metformin's modulation of the microbiota can vary significantly depending on the disease context, with different microbial populations exhibiting differential responses[2-4]. Given this complexity, we opted to study the overall microbial community response to metformin rather than focusing on specific strains. Additionally, our detection of key enzymes involved in GABA synthesis at the community level further supports our findings.</p>

<p>My major recommendation would be to revise the title, abstract, and discussion to provide more qualification and to consider alternative interpretations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your feedback and understand your concern regarding the need for more qualification and consideration of alternative interpretations. We hope to have more specific and detailed suggestions you may have to enhance the clarity and qualification of our title and abstract. Furthermore, we have tried to revise discussion in order to enhance the scientific rigor and logical coherence of our study. If you have any specific recommendations or insights, we would be more than willing to make further revisions to address those concerns.</p>

<p>Some key controls are also missing, which could be addressed by repeat experiments in the mouse model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion to include additional key controls in the mouse model experiments. We have conducted repeat experiments to test the effect of antibiotics in the absence of metformin to differentiate between the effects of the model itself and the interaction of metformin with antibiotics. As results of liver injury indicators shown, there were no significance among Control, Control+Met, Control+FMT and Control+Abx groups, revealing that metformin and its treated feces, and antibiotics had no effect on liver function in normal mice (Figure 1).</p>

<p>For the antibiotic depletion experiment, we had used antibiotics (Abx) for the mice of modeling, and the survival rate and liver function detection suggested that Abx had no extra effect on liver, which demonstrated that the effect is just driven by the model itself as opposed to an interaction between metformin and antibiotics (Figure 2).</p>

<p>Thank you for reviewing our paper titled “Gut microbiota-derived gamma-aminobutyric acid from metformin treatment reduces hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury through inhibiting ferroptosis”. We appreciate your insightful comments and suggestions, which have provided valuable insights into improving the quality and credibility of my research.
We agree with your assessment that the experimental approaches used in this study may have limitations in supporting the conclusions drawn, and we appreciate your recognition of the strength of our histological and imaging studies, which clearly demonstrate the impact of metformin post-HIRI.</p>

<p>Weaknesses largely stem from the experimental design. First, use of the iron chelator DFO would be strengthened using the ferroptosis inhibitor, liproxstatin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Your suggestion to employ the ferroptosis inhibitor, liproxstatin, in addition to the iron chelator DFO is well-taken. Incorporating liproxstatin into our experimental setup would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the involvement of hepatic ferroptosis in the mechanism of action of metformin. Therefore, we employed liproxstatin to inhibit HIRI and detected some core indicators of liver injury. As figure 3 shown, liproxstatin can reduce liver injury, restore liver GSH level and inhibit Fe accumulation, suggesting that ferroptosis plays an important role in HIRI. We hope this modification will enhance the credibility of our conclusions.</p>

<p>Second, the impact of metformin on the microbiota is profound resulting in changes in bile acid, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. Throughout the manuscript no comparisons are made with metformin alone which would better capture the metformin-specific effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising an important point regarding the impact of metformin on the microbiota and its potential effects on bile acid, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. It has well known that that the effects of metformin on normal blood glucose and lipid metabolism are minimal. Metformin primarily exerts its effects in cases of impaired glucose tolerance, which is why it is widely used for non-diabetic conditions. Regarding the changes in bile acid metabolism and chronic cholesterol and lipid elevation, these associations are typically observed in chronic liver disease models. Since our study focuses on an acute model of HIRI, we did not specifically investigate these changes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lastly, the absence of proper controls including germ free mice, metformin treated mice, FMT treated mice, etc make it difficult to understand the outcomes and to properly reproduce the findings in other labs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Lastly, we acknowledge your concern regarding the absence of proper controls, including germ-free mice, metformin-treated mice, and FMT -treated mice. We understand that these controls are essential for robustly interpreting and reproducing our findings. Therefore, we have added a batch of experiments for verification. As results shown, there were no significance among Control, Control+Met, Control+FMT and Control+Abx groups, revealing that metformin and its treated feces, and antibiotics had no effect on liver function in normal mice (Figure 1). We hope the result of these controls could address your valid point and provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding the outcomes.</p>

<p>The study presented in this paper explores the role of gut microbiota in the therapeutic effect of metformin on HIRI, as supported by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments. Through high throughput sequencing and HPLC-MS/MS, the authors have successfully demonstrated that metformin administration leads to an increase in GABA-producing bacteria. Moreover, the study provides compelling evidence for the beneficial impact of GABA on HIRI.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback on our paper exploring the role of gut microbiota in the therapeutic effect of metformin on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI). We appreciate your positive remarks and suggestions for improvement.
In response to your comments, we have revised the manuscript accordingly. We have included additional details on the high throughput sequencing and HPLC-MS/MS methods used to analyze the gut microbiota and GABA levels. This should provide readers with a clearer understanding of our experimental approach and the evidence supporting our findings.</p>
<p>Regarding your suggestion to further investigate the mechanisms underlying the beneficial impact of GABA on HIRI, we agree that this is an important direction for future research. We plan to conduct additional studies to explore the specific mechanisms by which GABA exerts its protective effects on HIRI in the future. We also supplemented discussion of potential therapeutic strategies targeting GABAergic pathways in the discussion section.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for your insightful comments. We believe that these revisions have strengthened the manuscript and improved its scientific rigor. We hope that you find the revised version to be satisfactory and look forward to your further feedback.</p>

<p>The writing could be improved. Multiple typos are found throughout and there is an overuse of adverbs like &quot;expectedly&quot;. You should let the reader decide what is or is not expected. Try to avoid terms like &quot;confirmed&quot; or &quot;validated&quot;, which only applies if you knew the result a priori. Remove underscores in species names. The Results section is also very difficult to interpret given the lack of explanation of experimental design. For example, the human study is only briefly mentioned within a larger paragraph on mouse data, without any explanation as to the study design. Similar issues are true for the transcriptomics and amplicon sequencing - it would help the reader to explain what samples were processed, the timepoints, etc.</p>

<p>We understand your surprise regarding the observed decrease in alpha diversity after FMT. Our findings indeed deviate from the commonly observed pattern of increased alpha diversity post-FMT. We have carefully re-examined our data and conducted additional analyses to ensure the accuracy of our results. After thorough investigation, we have identified a potential reason for this unexpected outcome, which we believe could shed light on this phenomenon. We hypothesize that the lower alpha diversity observed in our study might be attributed to the specific characteristics of the donor microbiota used for FMT. While the donor microbiota exhibited certain beneficial properties associated with the therapeutic effect on HIRI, it could have presented a limited diversity compared to the recipient’s original gut microbiota. This discrepancy in diversity could have contributed to the observed decrease in alpha diversity following FMT.</p>
<p>To further support our hypothesis, we have included a discussion on this unexpected finding in the revised manuscript. We believe that this addition will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the results and help contextualize the observed decrease in alpha diversity following FMT.</p>

It is possible that the specific disease model influenced the response of the gut microbiota. Additionally, the starting microbiota of the recipients and the characteristics of the donor microbiota used for FMT could also play a role in the disparity. We have expanded the discussion section of our revised manuscript to further address these potential factors and their implications.

<p>In the mouse experiments, we observed a significant increase in Bacteroides after metformin treatment.

<p>1. More thorough characterization of metabolite pools. Metformin is known to influence many pathways including bile acids and lipids. These important molecules should be measures as they likely play a key role in the observed protective effect. In fact, many of the key changes displayed in Figure 3H are involved in lipid metabolism.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding the characterization of metabolite pools in our study. We appreciate your suggestion to measure the influence of metformin on bile acids and lipid metabolism, as they are crucial pathways that may play a significant role in the observed protective effect.</p>
<p>Regarding bile acids, we agree that they are important in the context of metformin’s influence on metabolic pathways. However, it is important to note that the impact of metformin on bile acids appears to be more prominent in chronic liver disease models. In our acute model, the changes in bile acids were not as significant. Instead, our results primarily indicate a close association between lipid changes and hepatic ferroptosis. Metformin significantly modulates lipid metabolism, thereby alleviating liver ferroptosis.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have conducted metagenomic sequencing on the gut microbiota of healthy volunteers before and after oral administration of metformin. While analyzing the data, we did not observe significant changes in key genes involved in regulating bile acid variations. This might be attributed to the healthy volunteers used in our study, where significant changes in bile acids were not induced.</p>
<p>We appreciate your insightful comments and suggestions, which have shed light on the importance of characterizing bile acids and lipid metabolism in our study. While the impact of bile acids may be more evident in chronic liver disease models, our findings highlight the significant influence of metformin on lipid metabolism, closely related to hepatic ferroptosis. We will take your suggestions into account for future studies to further explore the role of bile acids and their regulation by metformin.</p>

<p>We appreciate your suggestion to conduct more standard assays using BODIPY 581/591 C11 with cell lysates.</p>
<p>We would like to clarify that we did indeed utilize assays with BODIPY 581/591 C11 to detect and measure lipid ROS in our study. The detailed description of these assays can be found in the Methods section of our paper. We followed established protocols and guidelines to ensure accurate and reliable measurements of lipid ROS levels.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that imaging techniques may have limitations in providing quantitative data. However, we employed BODIPY 581/591 C11 assays as a widely accepted and commonly used method to assess lipid ROS levels.

<p>1. The rationale for how GABA was selected is not clear. I am surprised that there were not more significant metabolite changes. It might be better to show a volcano plot of heatmap of the significantly changed features.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising an important question regarding the rationale for selecting GABA as the focus metabolite in our study. Initially, we also had concerns about the limited number of significant metabolite changes observed. However, through our comprehensive metabolomic profiling, we identified GABA as the most significantly altered metabolite following HIRI.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that we specifically focused on the measurement of 22 essential amino acids in our analysis. While it is possible that changes in non-essential amino acids may have occurred, we did not examine them in this study. Nevertheless, we have since used additional methods to validate the upregulation of GABA levels, and the biological effects observed support the specific role of GABA in protecting against HIRI. Based on the fact that GABA was the only significant amino acid, the volcano plot was of little significance, so we did not supplement this plot.</p>
