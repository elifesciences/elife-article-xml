<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The assembly and maintenance of neural circuits is crucial for proper brain function. Although the assembly of brain circuits has been extensively studied, much less is understood about the mechanisms controlling their maintenance as animals mature. In the olfactory system, the axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the same odor receptor converge into discrete synaptic structures of the olfactory bulb (OB) called glomeruli, forming a stereotypic odor map. The OB projection neurons, called mitral and tufted cells (M/Ts), have a single dendrite that branches into a single glomerulus, where they make synapses with OSNs. We used a genetic method to progressively eliminate the vast majority of M/T cells in early postnatal mice, and observed that the assembly of the OB bulb circuits proceeded normally. However, as the animals became adults the apical dendrite of remaining M/Ts grew multiple branches that innervated several glomeruli, and OSNs expressing single odor receptors projected their axons into multiple glomeruli, disrupting the olfactory sensory map. Moreover, ablating the M/Ts in adult animals also resulted in similar structural changes in the projections of remaining M/Ts and axons from OSNs. Interestingly, the ability of these mice to detect odors was relatively preserved despite only having 1-5% of projection neurons transmitting odorant information to the brain, and having highly disrupted circuits in the OB. These results indicate that a reduced number of projection neurons does not affect the normal assembly of the olfactory circuit, but induces structural instability of the olfactory circuitry of adult animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In order to produce behavior, the brain needs to respond to two contradictory demands. First, to acquire new information, the brain needs to be plastic. Second, to retain information, the brain needs to be stable. The brain of young animals is highly plastic, enabling early experiences to influence the development of many neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963</xref>). In contrast, the adult brain is considered to be relatively hard-wired, with limited capacity for morphological changes in response to natural experiences or different types of experimental manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Darian-Smith and Gilbert, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Florence et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Two fundamental parameters for the function of brain circuits are the number of neurons that comprise the circuit and how they are connected to each other. Interestingly, within a given circuit and animal species, the number of neurons of a specific cell type in that circuit appears to be relatively conserved. Similarly, there is also significant regularity in the general connectivity trends between neurons in the circuit. These observations have raised the question of whether there is any relationship between the number of a specific type of neuron in the brain, and their patterns of connectivity. In adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> , reducing the number of neurons of specific cell types in the olfactory system does not alter the overall structure of the circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berdnik et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, ablation of a particular cell type during embryonic development induces structural changes in the neurites of the remaining neurons of the same type (“peer” cells) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). However, less is known about how the reduction in the number of neurons affects the connectivity of their remaining “peer” cells and how these changes evolve as animals mature, impacting the organization and function of the entire circuit. To further investigate these questions, we focused on the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB).</p>
<p>The structural organization of the olfactory system makes it an ideal model to investigate the mechanisms underlying the connectivity, assembly, maintenance, and plasticity in brain circuits. The olfactory epithelium harbors olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that send their axons to the OB. Axons from OSNs expressing the same odor receptor converge into two stereotypic glomeruli within the OB, generating an odor map on its surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mombaerts et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ressler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vassar et al., 1994</xref>). The odor information received by the OSNs is transmitted from each glomerulus to cortical areas by the axons of the OB projection neurons, mitral and tufted cells (M/T cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schwob and Price, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Walz et al., 2006</xref>). During development, M/T cells initially extend several apical dendrites that innervate multiple neighboring glomeruli. At postnatal stages (P7-P10), M/T cells acquire their mature morphology with the vast majority (&gt;95%) displaying a single apical dendrite innervating a single glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blanchart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hinds, 1968a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">1968b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shepherd et al., 2004</xref>). Each glomerulus is innervated by the apical dendrites of ∼40 peer M/T cells, and it has been demonstrated that peer M/T cells that their apical dendrites project into the same glomerulus differ in their intrinsic excitability and downstream connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Burton and Urban, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Inokuchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The OB is one of the areas of the adult mammalian brain with the highest levels of structural plasticity. OSNs, glomerular and periglomerular cells are some of the key synaptic partners for M/T cells and they turn over throughout the animal’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Graziadei and Graziadei, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Merkle et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, despite this continuous turnover, the M/T dendrites are highly stable in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mizrahi and Katz, 2003</xref>). Thus, the synaptic organization of the OB, where each M/T cell, and each set of OSNs expressing the same receptor innervate a single glomerulus, makes the OB circuit an ideal model for understanding how neurons achieve long-term stability.</p>
<p>To investigate the relationship between neuron number and connectivity, we genetically ablated &gt;95% of M/T cells in early postnatal transgenic mice. Despite this drastic reduction in M/T numbers, the initial assembly of the OB circuits proceeded in an apparently normal manner, and the remaining M/T cells refined their arbors to a single dendrite projecting to a single glomerulus, and OSNs expressing the same receptor targeted a single glomerulus. However, as animals matured, the OB wiring became progressively perturbed, and the apical dendrite of remaining M/T cells grew additional branches that innervated multiple glomeruli, indicating that long term stability of M/T cells morphology depends on the presence of peer M/T cells. In addition, after reducing the number of M/T cells the axons of OSNs expressing the same odorant receptor innervated multiple glomeruli, perturbing the olfactory sensory map in the OB surface, indicating that odor map maintenance also depends on a full set of M/T cells. Despite the significant disruptions in the connectivity of the OB circuits, several olfactory-dependent behaviors were preserved, demonstrating the high functional resilience of the olfactory system.</p>

<title>Reducing the number of M/T cells soon after birth does not affect the refinement of the apical dendrite of remaining peer cells</title>
<p>M/T cells experience a drastic change in their morphology after birth. During the embryonic and early neonatal period (less than P7), M/T cells have multiple apical dendrites innervating multiple glomeruli. After the first postnatal week, the vast majority (&gt;95%) of M/T cells prune all but one dendrite that innervates a single glomerulus. This refinement can also occur in the absence of sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). However, genetic deletion of NMDA receptors in the M/T cells prevents the refinement of their apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aihara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fujimoto et al., 2023</xref>), indicating that synaptic inputs to M/T cells originating from spontaneous brain activity may regulate the process of dendrite refinement. In the mammalian retina, reducing the number of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) during development triggers dendritic sprouting on remaining RBCs, suggesting that interaction between peer cells sculpts the maturation of their dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huckfeldt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). To investigate whether dendritic refinement of M/T cells depends on their density, we ablated M/T cells soon after birth by crossing the driver <italic>Tbx21- Cre</italic> (<italic>Tbx</italic> for short) mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mitsui et al., 2011</xref>) with the reporter loxP-<italic>DTA</italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Voehringer et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>Tbx</italic> mouse expresses cre selectively in M/T cells, and the loxP-<italic>DTA</italic> mouse expresses diphtheria toxin (DTA) upon cre-mediated recombination, which triggers the death of M/T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). To count the number of M/T cells we crossed the Tbx mice with the loxP-<italic>tdt</italic> reporter <italic>Ai9</italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). The number of tdt+ M/T cells that we observed in the OB of adult <italic>Tbx::Ai9</italic> mice was similar to that previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benson et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Richard et al., 2010</xref>), and by P3 the vast majority, if not all, M/T cells expressed tdT in <italic>Tbx::Ai9</italic> mice at P3 (Figure 1—figure supplement.</p>

<p><italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice survive and reach adulthood without any gross differences from their wild-type siblings (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and B). Although the OB volume of <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice was reduced to half, the typical OB layer organization was mostly preserved (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> and D). Interestly, using antibodies against the Tbr2 protein (a marker for M/T cells), we identified a small number of Tbr2+ cells remaining in the mitral cell layer (MCL) and external plexiform layer (EPL) after cell ablation (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In <italic>Tbx::DTA::Ai9</italic> mice we observed that there was a small percentage of M/T cells that survived and expressed <italic>tdt.</italic> Previous works have demonstrated that DTA is extremely potent, and that a single molecule of DTA is sufficient to kill a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yamaizumi et al., 1978</xref>). These observations are consistent with the recombination of the loxP-<italic>tdt</italic> transgene being more sensitive to cre than the loxP-<italic>DTA</italic> transgene, a phenomenon that has been routinely reported in the literature (Becher et al., 2018; Kurachi et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>; Song and Palmiter, 2018). We observed a progressive reduction of M/T cells in <italic>Tbx::DTA::Ai9</italic> mice approximately 25% (P10), 3% (P21), and 1% (P120) of M/T cells remained after cell ablation (and expressed tdt), compared with wild type mice (<italic>Tbx::Ai9</italic> at P120) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we crossed the <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mouse with the loxP-<italic>Confetti</italic> reporter mouse to label individual M/T cells with one out four possible fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sánchez-Guardado and Lois, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Snippert et al., 2010</xref>). This sparse labeling of cells facilitates investigating whether the refinement of the dendrites of M/T cells depends on interactions between peer cells. At P10, ∼95% of the remaining M/T cells had a single apical dendrite innervating a single glomerulus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that the refinement of the apical dendrite of M/T cells proceeds normally despite a progressive drastic reduction in the density of M/T cells.</p>

<p>The decrease in structural plasticity of M/T cells that normally occurs in postnatal mice after the refinement of their apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mizrahi and Katz, 2003</xref>) is probably due to a combination of cell-autonomous, and non-cell autonomous processes. Cell-autonomous processes depend on genetic program of maturation intrinsic to the individual cells. An alternative model is that the reduction in plasticity with age may be due to non-cell autonomous processes, where each neuron loses plasticity because of the interactions with its neighbors. In normal conditions, despite the turnover of their synaptic partners (OSNs and periglomerular interneurons), the apical dendrite of M/T cells remains very stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mizrahi and Katz, 2003</xref>). To investigate whether the interactions between neighboring peer M/T cells regulate the stability of their dendrites in adult animals, we reduced the number of M/T cells in full adult animals (two month old) by crossing the <italic>Tbx21-Cre</italic> mouse with the <italic>iDTR</italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buch et al., 2005</xref>). Mice from this cross express the gene for diphtheria toxin receptor (dtR) on the M/T cells. Upon systemic injection of diphtheria toxin (DT), M/T cells are selectively eliminated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and B</xref>). DT injections into P60 <italic>Tbx::iDTR::Ai9</italic> mice were analyzed two months later (P120), and only 3% of the M/T cells remained compared with the wild type (<italic>Tbx::Ai9</italic> ) mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we analyzed the dendrites of individual M/T cells using a two-component viral vector system to sparse and stochastically label cells that express Cre recombinase in the <italic>Tbx</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). Viral injections were performed in three types of animals: (i) <italic>Tbx,</italic> that had the normal set of M/T cells, (ii) <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> , in which &gt;90% of M/T cells were killed by DT injection at P60, and (iii) <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> , in which &gt;90% of M/T (cells were killed around P3). In all three conditions, the morphology of M/T cells was examined in adult animals, at P120. As expected, most of M/T cells projected into a single glomerulus in <italic>Tbx</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and I</xref>). Surprisingly, in <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice, 48% of the remaining M/T cells branched to several glomeruli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F and I</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, whereas in <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice the apical dendrite of remaining M/T cells innervated a single glomerulus at P10, we also observed that by P120, 36% of remaining M/T cells projected their apical dendrite into multiple glomeruli, as in the <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and I</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also investigated whether the plasticity of the apical dendrite is reduced with age. Cell ablation performed in six month old <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice (P180) showed that 45% of remaining M/T cells branched to several glomeruli, a percentage comparable to that of animals in which ablation was performed at P60, indicating that the ability of M/T cells to experience drastic morphological changes in their dendrites does not decrease with age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G and I</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The tuft length of M/T cells in <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> (early postnatal cell ablation), and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> (cell ablation at P60 and P120) was increased compared to apical dendrite tuft in control <italic>Tbx</italic> (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that a sufficient density of M/T cells are required for the maintenance of a normal mature morphology (one apical dendrite-one glomerulus), suggesting that structural plasticity is not locked even six months after M/T cells acquired their mature morphology.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested the hypothesis that if glomeruli are innervated by a drastically reduced number of M/T cells this may induce nearby M/T cells to expand their apical dendrites so that they innervate the neighboring empty or depleted glomeruli. In wild type animals, there are ∼2,000 glomeruli, and each glomerulus is innervated by around 40-50 M/T cells. In animals injected with a high dose of DT (20 μg/kg mouse body weight), as shown above, around 3% (∼500) of M/T cells remained, suggesting that in these animals most glomeruli were innervated by very few M/T cells (2,000 glomeruli innervated by ∼ 500 M/T cells – roughly 1 M/T for every 4 glomeruli), or none, in many cases. In these animals, around 40% of the remaining M/T cells projected to several glomeruli. When we injected half (10 μg/kg) of the DT dose used in our previous experiments, the fraction of remaining M/T cells was 25% (∼10,000 cells) compared to wild type mice (∼40,000 cells) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, in animals injected with this lower dose of DT it is expected that each glomerulus would be innervated by around several M/T cells (∼10,000 M/T cells for 2,000 glomeruli – roughly around 5 M/T per glomerulus). However, in these animals, ∼40% of the M/T cells still projected to multiple glomeruli, a similar percentage as in the animals with higher doses of DT in which the vast majority of M/T cells were ablated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H and I</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results suggest that the branching of M/T dendrites into multiple glomeruli does not simply occur because nearby glomeruli are empty. In addition, it is important to emphasize that even in wild type animals with a full set of M/T cells, a small percentage of M/T cells still innervate more than one glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lin et al., 2000</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the innervation of multiple glomeruli by M/T cells is not simply due to the presence of empty glomeruli.</p>
<p>These results indicate that the ability of M/T cells to grow new dendrites, and to project them to multiple glomeruli is not restricted to neonatal stages and that it can be induced in adults (6 months old) mice, simply by reducing the density of their peer M/T cells. Interestingly, only around half of the surviving M/T cells their apical dendrites extended toward several glomeruli, while the other half maintained a single dendrite that targeted a single glomerulus. This observation suggests that the ability of M/T cells to change their structure and grow dendrites into adjacent glomeruli may be restricted to specific subtypes of M/T types.</p>

<title>Mechanisms controlling M/T cells structural plasticity in adult animals</title>
<p>Activity plays an important role in sculpting cortical sensory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dräger, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sawtell et al., 2003</xref>).

To investigate whether the structural plasticity induced in remaining M/T cells after ablation is regulated by sensory input, we performed unilateral naris occlusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Sensory deprivation was carried out in P50 <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice, starting ten days before M/T cell ablation. We used a two-component viral vector system to sparse and stochastically label cells, which allowed us to visualize the dendrites of individual M/T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). OBs were analyzed two months after naris occlusión (P120). Sensory deprivation causes a decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in PG cells, and we confirmed that in these animals sensory deprivation was effective by TH immunostaining (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). M/T cells tuft length in sensory deprived OBs was reduced compared to apical dendrite tuft in control <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice (ablation at P60 and unmanipulated sensory input) (<xref rid="fig3s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

<p>To examine the role that the spontaneous activity of M/T cells may play in their apical dendrite plasticity in the absence of peer M/T cells, we overexpressed the inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir2.1) which reduces the firing of action potentials (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Burrone et al., 2002</xref>). Kir2.1 channel was delivered into <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice 2-3 weeks before DT injection at P60 using a viral vector in which Kir expression depended on cre recombination. Thus, in this strategy, Kir was selectively expressed in M/T cells, and as expected, the firing of M/T cells was strongly reduced in the expressing cells Kir2.1 (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). As observed with sensory deprivation, Kir2.1 expression caused a significant reduction of the tuft length in the apical dendrite of remaining M/T cells (<xref rid="fig3s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, the overexpression of the Kir2.1 channel in remaining M/T cells did not cause statistically significant differences in the percentage of M/T innervating multiple glomeruli compared to remaining M/T cells in <italic>Tbx::iDTR:DTA</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D and E</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref> and D). These experiments demonstrate that the structural plasticity observed after reducing the total number of M/T cells in an animal is not regulated by the firing action potentials in the remaining cells. Instead, this experiment indicates that the observed structural plasticity may be regulated by other types of mechanisms (such as increased synaptic excitation) that do not require the M/T cells to fire action potentials in a physiological manner.</p>

<p>OSNs send their axons from the olfactory epithelium to the OB. During development, axons from OSNs expressing the same odor receptor initially project to several neighboring glomeruli. In the first postnatal week, OSNs axons undergo a refinement process such that all OSNs expressing one receptor project into a single glomerulus and form a stereotypic odor map on the OB surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mombaerts et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ressler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vassar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). Once the odor map is established, it is maintained throughout the animal’s lifespan, despite the constant turnover of OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zou et al., 2004</xref>). Above, we described that reducing the density of M/T cells in <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice breaks the “one apical dendrite-one glomerulus” rule, such that remaining M/T cells branched into several glomeruli. Thus, we investigated whether M/T cells could also play a role in the refinement and maintenance of the odor map from the OSNs into the bulb.</p>
<p>To study whether M/T cells could regulate OSN refinement, we crossed the <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mouse (to produce early postnatal cell ablation) with the <italic>M72-IRES-ChR2-YFP</italic> mouse (M72 for short) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Smear et al., 2013</xref>); which expresses yellow fluorescent protein under the promoter of the M72 odor receptor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and B</xref>). At P10 and P21 there were no differences in the targeting of M72 axons between <italic>Tbx::M72</italic> and <italic>Tbx::DTA::M72</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C and E</xref>). These results suggest that a normal density of M/T cells is not necessary to refine OSN axons and odor map formation, and it is consistent with previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bulfone et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we investigated whether M/T cells are necessary for odor map maintenance by ablating M/T cells in adult <italic>Tbx::iDTR::M72</italic> mice (ablation induced by DT injection at P60). Surprisingly, M72 axons projected to several glomeruli when OBs were analyzed two months later (P120) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Interestingly, whereas in <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice M72 axons projected into a single glomerulus at P10 and P21, we also observed that by P120 the M72 axons projected into multiple glomeruli, as in the <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D and E</xref>). These results suggest that the maintenance of the odor map on the OB surface depends on the presence of a sufficient density of M/T cells.</p>

<title>Learned olfactory behaviors: odor detection and discrimination</title>
<p>In rodents, many behaviors critically depend on olfaction. Previous experiments with mutant mice affecting the olfactory system have reported severe perturbations of behavior, including the inability to find food or choose mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Belluscio et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice not only have very few M/T cells remaining (fewer than 5%), but also the architecture of their OBs is disrupted: OSNs expressing the same odor receptor project into several glomeruli, and the apical dendrite of individual M/T cells innervate multiple glomeruli. Thus, we investigated the ability of <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> (early postnatal cell ablation) and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> (adult cell ablation) mice to identify odors using a go/no-go paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bodyak and Slotnick, 1999</xref>). Despite the massive loss of M/T cells and the disorganization of OB connectivity, all <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice reached 80% accuracy when exposed to 5% cineole (a chemical typically used for olfactory tests) concentrations on their first trial and even showed comparable accuracy to control <italic>Tbx</italic> mice at 0.5% cineole concentrations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Whereas all the <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice (with early postnatal M/T ablation) succeeded in the go/no-go test, only 50% of <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> (in which M/T ablation occurred as adults) successfully performed this paradigm on the first day of testing. Of the remaining 50% of <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> animals, 21% of the mice were completely unable to perform this detection test at any time, even after training on this test for 3 weeks. The remaining 29% of <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice were eventually able to complete the test after one week of training (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations indicate that the assembly of an olfactory circuit with a reduced density of projection neurons in young animals (<italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice) is compatible with preserved olfactory performance. In contrast, reducing the density of M/T cells in an adult animal after the circuitry of its olfactory bulb was assembled normally (in <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice) causes important deficits in olfactory performance; however, in some cases these deficits can be overcome after training.</p>

<p>After the animals were exposed to the detection test, we investigated the ability of these mice to perform a more challenging olfactory test: to discriminate between two odors with very different chemical properties (cineole (S+) and eugenol (S-)). Both <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice reached more than 80% accuracy criterion when exposed to pure molecules and binary mixtures (80/20::20/80) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). However, they had difficulties discriminating between more similar binary mixtures (55/45::45/55). Next, <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice were exposed to highly similar smells, such as the monomolecular enantiomers (carvone (+) (S+) and carvone (-) (S-)). <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice failed to discriminate between carvone (+) and carvone (-), even when the odorants were presented as pure molecules (not as mixtures). In contrast, <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice reached 80% accuracy in this version of the discrimination test with pure molecules (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). We should note that both in <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> animals, the discrimination test (using cineole (S+) and eugenol (S-)) was performed after they were exposed to the detection test (using (cineole (S+) and mineral oil (S-)). Thus, it is possible that the good performance of some the <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> animals in the discrimination test could be due to the prior training in the detection test with the cineole as the reworded odor (S+), in agreement with the improved performance of the <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> animals on the detection test after several days of practice, as indicated above.</p>
<p>These results suggest that despite the reduced number of M/T cells and disorganization of their OBs in <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice, their olfactory system has a remarkable resilience that partially preserves their ability to smell. However, it is important to note that these standard tests commonly used to measure olfactory function require substantial training, and thus, are quite artificial.</p>

<title>Innate olfactory-driven behaviors: mating and aggression</title>
<p>In rodents, many key social behaviors depend on olfaction. In mice, litters are primarily taken care of by females. No apparent differences were observed in offspring nursing between both experimental <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice, indicating that this behavior was mostly preserved in females. However, the reduction of M/T cells affected the mating rate of <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> male mice. Individual <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> male mice were housed with a single wild type female for three nights. We scored that a male mated with a female when a vaginal plug was observed. Only 16.67% of <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> males mated, compared to 63.63% of <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> and 90.91% control <italic>Tbx</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Next, we used a resident/intruder paradigm to analyze the aggressive behavior of the male mice. <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice did not initiate a fight when a wild type male or a male mouse from the same strain (<italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> or <italic>Tbx::iDTR)</italic> was introduced into its cage. Moreover, when <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> or <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> male mice were the intruders, the resident wild type mice attacked them in 33% (<italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> ) and 28% (<italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> ) of the cases, compared to 83% when the intruder was another wild type male mouse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>The accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) plays a key role in innate social olfactory behaviors. We quantified the number of M/T cells remaining in the male AOB. Wild type mice have around ∼2,000 M/T cells in their AOBs, while only ∼1.5% and 16% of M/T cells remained in the AOB of <italic>Tbx::DTA::Ai9</italic> mice and <italic>Tbx::iDTR::Ai9</italic> mice, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, the drastically reduced number of AOB M/T cells in the <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> and <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice could explain their inability to engage in social behaviors such as a mating or aggression, suggesting that behaviors depending on the AOB are hard-wired, less plastic, and less resilient than the learned behaviors that depend on the main OB.</p>

<title>A full set of M/T cells is necessary for the maintenance of a stable dendrite</title>
<p>Dendrite morphology is one of the main morphological features of a neuron. The shape and size of the dendritic arbor are important determinants of the number and types of inputs that a neuron receives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>). During development, each M/T cell extends several apical dendrites toward several glomeruli at the same time that OSN axons penetrate into the OB surface to form a glomerular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blanchart et al., 2006</xref>). In the first week after birth, M/T cells undergo a refinement process where they end up with a single apical dendrite innervating a single glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blanchart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hinds, 1968a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">1968b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shepherd et al., 2004</xref>). It is known that OSN axons are required both for glomerular formation and for the refinement of the apical dendrite of M/T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nishizumi et al., 2019</xref>). In the absence of OSN axons, M/T cells maintain an immature morphology with multiple apical dendrites even as animals mature and become adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nishizumi et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the requirement of OSN axons to form a glomerular structure, it has been described that the refinement of the apical dendrite of M/T cells is independent of the sensory experience information driven by OSNs inputs. M/T cells apical dendrite refinement is delayed by a few days when OSNs neuronal activity is reduced or neurotransmitter release blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aihara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fujimoto et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lorenzon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Matsutani and Yamamoto, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nishizumi et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently studies have shown that the refinement of the apical dendrites of M/T cells is prevented when the glutamatergic NMDA receptors are deleted (by knocking out the <italic>Grin1</italic> gene) or by silencing the electrical activity of M/T cells (by electroporating Kir2.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aihara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fujimoto et al., 2023</xref>). The glutamatergic input to M/T cells could originate from multiple sources, including external tufted cells, axonal inputs from the olfactory cortex, or from reciprocal connections between M/T cells. In addition, the refinement of the apical dendrite of M/T cells was also reduced when the synaptic vesicle release from M/T cells was blocked by expression of tetanus toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fujimoto et al., 2023</xref>). This observation suggests that release of glutamate between M/T cells at early postnatal stages might regulate the refinement of their apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fujimoto et al., 2023</xref>). Based on tdt expression in <italic>Tbx::Ai9</italic> mice, expression of cre started around P0-3 (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, in <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice one might expect that M/T cells would start to die also around this time. However, our results indicate that the refinement of the apical dendrite of M/T cells proceeds normally, although the number of M/T cells is progressively eliminated soon after birth. Thus, it is possible that we did not observe any obvious effect in the process of dendrite refinement because in <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice the apical dendrites had completed their refinement around P10, a time when 25% of M/T cells are still alive in <italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> mice.</p>
<p>Once the M/T cell apical dendrite refinement process is complete such that each M/T cell projects a single apical dendrite to a single glomerulus, this status stays stable throughout the life of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mizrahi and Katz, 2003</xref>). In the OB each glomerulus is innervated by approximately 40 M/T peer cells where they make synapses with OSN axons expressing the same odor receptor, juxtaglomerular cells (external tufted cells (ETCs) and periglomerular cells (PGCs), and short axon cells (SACs)). Despite the continuous turnover of OSN and PGCs, the apical dendrites of M/T cells remain stable throughout adulthood over long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mizrahi and Katz, 2003</xref>). Similar dendrite stability has been observed in the projection neurons of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system, even when OSNs were ablated in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berdnik et al., 2006</xref>). Our results showed that the refinement of the M/T apical dendrite proceeds normally even when a large fraction of M/T cells are killed soon after birth. In contrast, ablating a large fraction of the M/T cells in early postnatal or adult animals, after the refinement process had occurred and a single dendrite remained projecting to a single glomerulus, induced the surviving M/T cells to expand their dendrites into multiple nearby glomeruli. These observations suggest that reducing the density of M/T cells soon after birth does not interfere with the completion of refinement of apical dendrites, but instead, it is essential for the maintenance of apical dendrite stability as animals mature. Importantly, the main synaptic partners of M/T cells in the glomerulus, the OSNs and juxtaglomerular cells, had not been directly perturbed by our genetic manipulation. This observation suggests that M/T cells apical dendrite stability depends more on the cell density of the peer M/T cells than on their other glomerular synaptic partners (OSN axons, ETCs, PGCs, and SACs). Interestingly, M/T cell ablation in adults after the initial refinement is complete, only induced half of the remaining M/T cells (∼50%) to expand their dendritic tuft toward several glomeruli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This observation could indicate that different subtypes of M/T cells may respond differently to these perturbations, and is consistent with previous works demonstrating that M/T cells are not a homogeneous cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Angelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kollo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Padmanabhan and Urban, 2010</xref>). Alternatively, the fact that only half of M/T cells undergo structural changes could be merely a stochastic event.</p>

<title>Mechanisms controlling structural plasticity of the M/T cells in adult mice</title>
<p>A previous work has shown that reducing the number of bipolar cells in mouse embryonic retina induces dendrite expansion in remaining cells when the retinal circuit is being assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). The results from our early postnatal cell ablation experiment in the OB suggest that the apical dendrite maturation of M/T cells can proceed normally even when a large fraction of M/T cells are being progressively killed. However, our experiments indicate that cell density plays an important role in maintaining the stability of the apical dendrite of M/T cells. There is evidence that neurotransmission plays a role in the growth and maturation of dendrites and synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andreae and Burrone, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bleckert and Wong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rajan et al., 1999</xref>). These previous works would be consistent with a possible scenario where after ablating a large fraction of M/T cells, OSN axons and ETCs cells that do not have a M/T synaptic partner in the glomerulus increased the neurotransmitter levels in the glomerulus, thus triggering the dendritic growth from nearby M/T cells, as we observed in our experiments.</p>
<p>Neuronal activity plays an essential role in sculpting the neuronal circuit as it is being assembled during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andreae and Burrone, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bleckert and Wong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Martini et al., 2021</xref>). However, the refinement of M/T dendrites in early postnatal animals is independent of sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lin et al., 2000</xref>). Our experiments indicated that ablating a high percentage of M/T cells in adult animals (in <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice) caused the expansion of apical dendrites into multiple glomeruli, even when sensory input was blocked by naris occlusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref>). This suggests that sensory input is dispensable for M/T cells apical dendrite pruning and stabilization at perinatal stages and adult stages, respectively. In a recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fujimoto et al., 2023</xref>) Kir2.1 was expressed in a large percentage of M/T cells during embryonic development to block their electrical activity.</p>
<p>This work showed that these embryonic silent M/T cells failed to prune their arbors to a single dendrite. In our experiments, we expressed Kir2.1 in adult animals, and we observed that the ablation of a large fraction of M/T cells still caused the remaining M/T cells to sprout several new tufts towards multiple glomeruli. In aggregate, these observations indicate that action potentials may be necessary for the normal pruning that occurs during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fujimoto et al., 2023</xref>), but are not required for the expansion of dendritic trees caused by ablating a large fraction of M/T cells in adult animals (this current study).</p>

<title>Projection neurons are dispensable to form an olfactory map of sensory axons on the olfactory bulb, but are necessary to maintain it during adulthood</title>

Several previous works have investigated how OSN manipulations affect the formation and maintenance of the odor map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Biju et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we evaluated whether reducing the density of M/T cells affects odor map formation and/or maintenance. Our results showed that odor map formation proceeds normally in animals in which the M/T cells are progressively killed after birth. These results are consistent with previous works that showed that initial convergence of OSN axons expressing the same odorant receptor into single glomeruli does not require M/T cells, as reported in Tbr1 mutant mice that cannot produce M/T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bulfone et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast we observed that odor map maintenance requires a full complement of M/T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). With a reduced density of M/T cells the axons of OSNs initially project to a single glomerulus, but as the animals mature, those axons eventually project into multiple neighboring glomeruli. Moreover, in animals that developed a normal olfactory map with a full set of M/T cells, reducing the density of M/T cells as adults also caused OSN axons to project abnormally into multiple glomeruli. Therefore, the present work shows that while M/T cells are not necessary for the formation of a normal odor map on the OB, they are necessary for the maintenance of this map in adult animals.</p>
<p>The odor map disruption observed after ablation of M/T cells is interesting, because many of the other synaptic partners for OSN axons (ETCs and PGCs) were not directly targeted by our genetic manipulation. One may have anticipated that even without M/T cells dendrites, the neurites from ETCs and PGCs could have provided synaptic targets for the OSN axons, and this could have been sufficient to maintain the odor map on the OB surface. Indeed, there is some evidence that OSN axons make strong synapses contact with ETCs, and some works indicate that M/T cells are not the primary synaptic target of OSN axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">De Saint Jan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">De Saint Jan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gire et al., 2012</xref>). The fact that the drastic reduction in the number of M/T cells caused the OSN axons to miss their normal targets in the OB in adult animals suggests that the OSN-M/T cell (but not the OSN- ETC) connections are necessary for the maintenance of the olfactory map during adulthood. There are three likely scenarios that could account for our observations. (i) The sprouting of the apical dendrite tuft of remaining M/T cells to several glomeruli could directly cause OSN axons to project into multiple glomeruli. (ii) Ablating M/T cells may cause changes in other cells that make synapses in the glomeruli (ETCs, PGCs, sAC, etc…), such that the misrouting of OSN axons that we observed may be a secondary effect caused by the elimination of M/T cells. (iii) Ablating a large fraction of M/T cells causes a reduction in the OB volume, which could cause a failure of OSN axons to converge onto single glomeruli, which in turn may induce the expansion of apical dendrite tuft from remaining M/T cells.</p>

<title>Robustness of learned but frailty of innate olfactory-driven behaviors</title>
<p>The OB is considered to be crucial for olfaction because it is the only connection between the olfactory sensory epithelium and the olfactory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vinograd et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wilson and Mainen, 2006</xref>). However, several works have shown that some olfactory function can persist despite severe perturbations of the OB. For example, mice in which the topographic projection from OSNs to the OB is genetically perturbed can perform simple odor discrimination tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fadool et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fleischmann et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, some rodents with mild or even severe disruption of the OB architecture by NMDA injections or extensive lesions of the OB can still perform odor discrimination tasks, although a certain fraction of these animals become completely anosmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Erskine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lu and Slotnick, 1998</xref>). However, the reproducibility of the surgical or chemical lesions makes it difficult to interpret these results. In addition, in bulbectomized rats, the axons from OSN neurons project into rostral olfactory areas, and that these ectopic projections could explain why some of these animals missing an OB can discriminate between odors to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Slotnick et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, a recent work has reported that some humans in which their OBs cannot be detected by MRI can still smell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Weiss et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results showed that a drastic reduction of M/T cells density (fewer than 5%) cause a severe disruption of the adult OB architecture: OSNs expressing the same odor receptor fail to converge into a single glomerulus, and the apical dendrites from individual M/T cells innervate multiple glomeruli. However, ablation of M/T cells in adult mice (in <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice) showed that 25% of mice became permanently anosmic, unable to perform odorant detection tests, regardless of how many days they were exposed to the test. In contrast, the remaining ∼75% mice retained significant olfactory function, although these animals needed training (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Remarkably, all adult mice in which M/T cells were ablated soon after birth (<italic>Tbx::DTA</italic> ) performed well on olfactory tests, even when only 1% of their M/T neurons remained, the only connection between the OB and the olfactory cortex. Moreover, in these mice, the organization of the projections from the OSNs to the glomeruli (the “odor map”), was severely disrupted, and the dendrites of M/T cells projected abnormally into multiple glomeruli. Overall, these results suggest that the brain of young mice exhibit high resilience in the performance of learned olfactory behaviors, whereas this functional resilience may decrease with age.</p>
<p>Our manipulations cause two major changes in the olfactory system, one primary, and several secondary. The primary change is a large reduction in the number of M/T cells both in the MOB and AOB. This reduction in M/T cell number triggers significant secondary changes in the connectivity of the bulb, including an abnormal projection of OSNs onto the OB, and the growth of ectopic dendrites from the remaining M/T cells into multiple glomeruli. The behavioral abnormalities displayed by these mice is ultimately caused by the reduction in the number of M/T cells, but it is likely that the secondary structural changes could regulate some of the behavioral phenomena that we observed. For example, in principle, it is possible that the ectopic dendrites innervating several glomeruli could help the bulb to perceive smells with a much reduced number of M/T cells. On the other hand, the promiscuous growth of dendrites into multiple glomeruli could make it more difficult for the animals to discriminate between smells. The same argument could be made about the fact that OSN axons project onto multiple glomeruli: we do not know if this change helps or makes it more difficult for the animal to detect smells.</p>
<p>Mice with reduced numbers of M/T cells were able to perform satisfactorily in tests that measured learned behaviors (such as odor detection). However, the performance of these mice with innate olfactory driven behaviors such as mating with females or aggression against intruders was severely impaired. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). It is generally assumed that learned olfactory behaviors and innate olfactory-driven behaviors are primarily controlled by the main and accessory bulbs (MOB and AOB), respectively. However, we observed that our genetic manipulations caused a comparable elimination of M/T cells in the MOB and AOB. Several reasons could explain the different susceptibility of learned or innate olfactory behaviors to ablation of M/T cell. Learned behaviors may be more resilient to experimental perturbations than innate olfactory driven behaviors, perhaps indicating that the performance of innate behaviors depends on hardwired circuits that cannot be easily reconfigured. Indeed, this hypothesis is consistent with our observation that ablating M/T cells in adult animals (in <italic>Tbx::iDTR</italic> mice) caused an initial failure to perform odor detection tests (a learned behavior), which could be overcome after several days of training. Alternatively, the standard tests used to probe learned olfactory behaviors, such as threshold detection with olfactometers, could be much simpler for animals to perform than the olfactory innate-driven behaviors, such as mating or aggression. It is important to note that the procedures commonly used to measure learned olfactory behaviors require substantial training, and thus, are quite artificial. In this scenario, animals with a severe perturbation of the OB may still capable of performing normally on olfactometer tests, but will be unable to perform natural behaviors that require complex olfactory processing.</p>
<p>In summary, our results indicate that the full complement of M/T cells, the projection neurons that transmit odor information from the OB into the rest of the brain, is not required for normal assembly of the olfactory circuit, but it is essential for its maintenance. The initial steps of several processes in the assembly of the OB proceed normally despite a drastically (&gt;95%) reduced number of M/T cells. Early postnatal M/T cell ablation did not affect the appropriate targeting of OSN axons into the OB, or the refinement to a single apical dendrite of remaining M/T cells that projected into a single glomerulus. However, after the OB circuitry was normally assembled despite a reduced density of M/T cells, we observed that the maintenance of the OB wiring was perturbed in multiple ways, including expansion of several dendrites from M/T cells that projected into multiple glomeruli, and misrouting of OSN axons. Importantly, we observed that both of these changes in circuit wiring (apical dendrite expansion and OSN axon misrouting) could also be triggered in animals in which the OB assembly had occurred under normal circumstances, but in which the M/T cell ablation was induced in full adult animals. These experiments highlight that in some brain regions, a full density of cells may be dispensable for the assembly of its neuronal circuits, but it may be required for its maintenance during adulthood. Finally, these observations indicate that olfactory circuits have a remarkable ability to reorganize such that after a severe (&gt;95%) loss of an essential neuronal type during development and adult ages, olfactory function is surprisingly preserved.</p>

<p>The ability of mice to detect odorants was evaluated in a four channel olfactometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Slotnick and Bodyak, 2002</xref>), two months after cell ablation. Several days before starting with the go/no-go paradigm training, mice were partially water-deprived (85 % of their initial body weight). First, mice were trained to introduce their snout into the odor sampling port and lick the water valve to get the water reward. During this initial phase of training, only mineral oil was presented. Next, we began with the go/no-go paradigm using Cineole (843788, Sigma) as a reinforced stimulus (S+) and mineral oil as an unreinforced stimulus (S−). Every day, mice underwent 10 training blocks (20 trials per block, with 10 trials with a positive stimulus, and 10 trials with a negative stimulus) per day, for a total of 200 trials per day. A single random stimulus was presented as S+ or S- in each trial. The accuracy was calculated for each block of 20 trials. Mouse accuracy &gt;80% was considered as successful learning of the positive (S+) and negative (S-) stimuli. During 2 days (40 trials), mice were trained with 5% cineole concentration to ensure that mice can learn the task. After this initial phase, we decreased the concentration of the reward stimulus at 1%, 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.01%, 0.005%, 0.001%, to determine the odor detection threshold.</p>
<p>Odor discrimination was first tested using two different odors: cineole (S+) and eugenol (S-) (818455, Sigma) both diluted at a concentration of 1%. First, pure odors were presented to the mice: only cineole as S+ and only eugenol as S-. On subsequent days, a mixture of cineole and eugenol was presented at either 80/20 (80% cineole/20% eugenol for S+, and 80% eugenol/20% cineole for S−), or 55/45 ratios. Finally, we tested a more challenging odor discrimination task using enantiomer molecules: (+)carvone as S+ (22070, Sigma) and (−)carvone as S− (22060, Sigma) both diluted to 1%.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study shows that eliminating a large portion of the principal neurons in the mammalian olfactory bulb does not affect the initial establishment of the circuit but has an impact on its maintenance. The strength of the paper is that the anatomical changes induced by genetic ablation of neurons are clear-cut. There is <bold>solid</bold> support for the findings, with a description of the structural and behavioral effects of ablating the majority of M/T neurons.</p>

<p>This paper aims to address the establishment and maintenance of neural circuitry in the case of a massive loss of neurons. The authors used genetic manipulations to ablate the principal projection neurons, the mitral/tufted cells, in the mouse olfactory bulb. Using diphtheria toxin (Tbx21-Cre:: loxP-DTA line) the authors ablated progressively large numbers of M/T cells postnatally. By injecting diphtheria toxin (DT) into the Tbx21-Cre:: loxP-iDTR line, the authors were able to control the timing of the ablation in the adult stage. Both methods led to the successful elimination of a majority of M/TCs by 4 months of age. The authors made a few interesting observations. First, they found that the initial pruning of the remaining M/T cell primary dendrite was unaffected. However, in adulthood, a significant portion of these cells extended primary dendrites to innervate multiple glomeruli. Moreover, the incoming olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axons, as examined for those expressing the M72 receptor, showed a divergent innervation pattern as well. The authors conclude that M/T cell density is required to maintain the dendritic structures and the olfactory map. To address the functional consequences of eliminating a large portion of principal neurons, the authors conducted a series of behavioral assays. They found that learned odor discrimination was largely intact. On the other hand, mating and aggression were reduced. The authors concluded that learned behaviors are more resilient than innate ones.</p>
<p>The study is technically sound, and the results are clear-cut. The most striking result is the contrast between the normal dendritic pruning during early development and the expanded dendritic innervation in adulthood. It is a novel discovery that can lead to further investigation of how the single-glomerulus dendritic innervation is maintained. The authors conducted a few experiments to address potential mechanisms, but it is inconclusive, as detailed below. It is also interesting to see that the massive neuronal loss did not severely impact learned odor discrimination. This result, together with previous studies showing nearly normal odor discrimination in the absence of large portions of the olfactory bulb or scrambled innervation patterns, attests to the redundancy and robustness of the sensory system.</p>

<p>The authors make the interesting observation that the developmental refinement of apical M/T cell dendrites into individual glomeruli proceeds normally even when the majority of neighboring M/T cells are ablated. At later stages, the remaining neurons develop additional dendrites that invade multiple glomeruli ectopically and, similarly, OSN inputs to glomeruli lose projection specificity as well. The authors conclude that the normal density of M/T neurons is not required for developmental refinement, but rather for maintaining specific connectivity in adults.</p>
<p>Comments on revised submission:</p>
<p>The authors have adjusted the interpretation of their findings and as a consequence, the conclusions are now better supported by the data. However, the evidence for the absence of a role of firing in regulating ectopic dendrites is still insufficient.</p>

The discussion should take into account these other studies in a historical context.</p>
<p>Main comments:</p>
<p>(1) In previous studies, it has been concluded that dendritic pruning unfolds independently, regardless of the innervation pattern or activity of the OSNs. The new observation bolsters this conclusion by showing that a loss of neighboring M/T cells does not affect the developmental process. A more nuanced discussion comparing the results of these studies would strengthen the paper.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We now include an extended discussion citing relevant previous works in the manuscript (Lines 351-374).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors propose that a certain density of M/T is required to prevent the divergent innervation of primary dendrites, but the evidence is not sufficient to support this proposal. The experiment with low-dose DT injection to ablate a smaller portion of M/T cells did not change the percentage of cells innervating two or more glomeruli. The authors suggest that a threshold must be met, but this threshold is not determined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our experiments using high-dose DT, we hypothesized that there may be many empty glomeruli (glomeruli not innervated by M/T cells), and as a result, that some of the remaining M/T cells could branch their apical dendrite tuft into multiple empty glomeruli. To test this hypothesis, we carried out another experiment using a lower dose of DT. In this experiment, the fraction of remaining M/T cells was 25% (~10,000 M/T cells), which was higher than with the high DT dose (5%, or around 2,000 M/T cells) , but still significantly lower than wild type mice (~40,000 cells M/T cells). With around 2,000 glomeruli and 10,000 M/T per bulb, it could be expected that each glomerulus would be innervated by ~5 M/T cells (on average). However, we found that the percentage of M/T cells projecting to multiple glomeruli (around 40%) was similar when either 10,000 or 2,000 of M/T remained in the bulb. In addition, it is important to emphasize that even in wt animals with a full set of M/T cells, a small percentage of M/T cells still innervate more than one glomerulus (Lin et al., 2000). Together, these observations suggest that the innervation of multiple glomeruli by M/T cells is not simply due to the presence of empty glomeruli, and that our hypothesis was not correct.</p>
<p>We have added a comment explaining this issue in the Results section (Lines 200-203).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors suggest that neural activity is not required for this plasticity. The evidence was derived primarily from naris occlusion and neuronal silencing using Kir2.1. While the results are consistent with the notion, it is a rather narrow interpretation of how neural activity affects circuit configuration. Perturbation of neural activity also entails an increase in firing. Inducing the activity of the neurons may alter this plasticity. Silencing per se may induce a homeostatic response that expands the neurite innervation pattern to increase synaptic input to compensate for the loss of activity. Thus, further silencing the cells may not reduce multiglomerular innervation, but an increased activity may.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The experiments with Kir2.1 demonstrate that the structural plasticity observed after reducing the total number of M/T cells in an animal is not regulated by the firing action potentials in the remaining cells. Instead, this experiment indicates that the observed structural plasticity may be regulated by other types of mechanisms (including increased synaptic excitation as suggested by the reviewer) that do not require the firing of action potentials in M/T cells.</p>
<p>We now have included a comment regarding this point (Lines 243-247).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There is a discrepancy between this study and the one by Fujimoto et al. (Developmental Cell; 2023), which shows that not only glutamatergic inputs to the primary dendrite can facilitate pruning of remaining dendrites but also Kir2.1 overexpression can significantly perturb dendritic pruning. This discrepancy is not discussed by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that it would be useful to contrast these two works.</p>
<p>In our experiments, performed in adult animals, we blocked sensory input by performing naris occlusion before we induced ablation of M/T cells. In a separate experiment, also in adult animals, we expressed the Kir2.1 channel, to reduce the ability of neurons to fire action potentials. With both types of manipulations, we observed that the ablation of a large fraction of M/T cells still caused the remaining M/T cells to maintain a single apical dendrite that sprouts several new tufts towards multiple glomeruli. A recent paper (Fujimoto et al., 2023)) in which Kir2.1 was expressed in a large percentage of M/T starting during embryonic development showed that these “silent” M/T cells failed to prune their arbors to a single dendrite. In aggregate, these observations indicate that action potentials are necessary for the normal pruning that occurs during perinatal development (Fujimoto et al., 2023), but are not required for the expansion of dendritic trees caused by ablating a large fraction of M/T cells in adult animals (our current manuscript).</p>
<p>We have now explained the differences between both studies in the manuscript (Lines 427-439).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) An alternative interpretation of the discrepancy between the apparent normal pruning by p10 and expanded dendritic innervation in adulthood is that there are more cells before P10, when ~25% of M/T cells are present, but at a later date only 1-3% are present.</p>
<p>The relationship between the number of M/T cells and single glomerulus innervation has not been explored during postnatal development. It would be important to test this hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this comment, and in lines 375-381 we discuss the discrepancy between normal refinement during development, and dendritic sprouting in adults.</p>
<p>Cre is expressed in M/T cells and it induces DTA expression starting around P0. The elimination of M/T cells starts at this time, and continues until by P10, when more than 75% of M/T have been eliminated. At P21 more than 90% of M/T have been eliminated, and their number remains stable thereafter.</p>
<p>Pruning of the dendrites of M/T cells starts at P0 and it is mostly complete by P10. Therefore, it is possible that between P0 and P7, when dendrites are being pruned, the number of M/T cells remaining in the bulb is still over a threshold that does not interfere with the process of normal dendrite pruning. We agree that it would be very informative to perform additional experiments in the future where a large set of M/T cells could be ablated before pruning occurs (ideally before P0).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors attribute the change in the olfactory map to the loss of M/T cells. Another obvious possibility is that the diffused projection is a response to the change in the olfactory bulb size. With less space to occupy, the axons may be forced to innervate neighboring glomeruli. It is not known how the total number of glomeruli is affected. This question could be addressed by tracking developmental changes in bulb volume and glomerular numbers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Certainly, this is a possibility, and we have now included a comment on this regard in the manuscript (Lines 473-480).</p>
<p>We believe that there are three likely scenarios that could account for these observations:</p>
<p>(a) After ablating M/T cells, the tufts of the remaining M/T cells sprout into multiple glomeruli, and this causes the axons of OSNs to project into multiple glomeruli.</p>
<p>(b) Ablating M/T cells may cause changes in other OB cells that make synapses in the glomeruli (ETCs, PGCs, sAC, etc…), and the misrouting of OSN axons that we observed in our experiments may be a secondary effect caused by the elimination of M/T cells.</p>
<p>(c) After ablating the majority of M/T cells, the olfactory bulb gets reduced in size, and the axons of OSNs find it difficult to precisely converge on a target that now has become smaller. As a result, the axons of OSNs fail to converge on single glomeruli.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The retained ability to discriminate odors upon reinforced training is not surprising in light of a number of earlier studies. For example, Slotnick and colleagues have shown that rats losing ~90% of the OB can retain odor discrimination. Weiss et al have shown that humans without an olfactory bulb can perform normal olfactory tasks. Gronowitz et al have used theoretical prediction and experimental results to demonstrate that perturbing the olfactory map does not have a major impact on olfactory discrimination. Fleischmann et al have shown that mice with a monoclonal nose can discriminate odors. The authors should discuss their results in these contexts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this important oversight - we now include a more elaborate discussion including the relevant references as suggested in the manuscript (Line 483-496).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) It should be noted that odor discrimination resulting from reinforcement training does not mean normal olfactory function. It is a highly artificial situation as the animals are overtrained. It should not be used as a measure of the robustness of the olfactory sense. Natural odor discrimination (without training), detection threshold, and innate appetitive/aversive response to certain odors may be affected. These experiments were not conducted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the standard tests commonly used to measure olfactory function require substantial training, and thus, are quite artificial. However, these tests are used because they allow a more precise quantification of olfactory function than those relying on natural behaviors.</p>
<p>We have now included a few sentences to address this point in the results (Lines 321322) and discussion sections (Lines 541-543).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) The social behaviors were conducted using relatively coarse measures (vaginal plug and display of aggression). Moreover, these behaviors are most likely affected by the disruption of the AOB mitral cells and have little to do with the dendritic pruning process described in the paper. It is misleading to lump social behaviors with innate responses to odors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This point follows the same logic as the previous one. The olfactory tests that rely on natural behaviors are quite coarse and difficult to quantify. In contrast, the olfactory tests using apparatuses such as olfactometers can be quantified with precision, but they are artificial. We agree that some of the naturalistic behaviors that we studied such as mating or aggression may depend to a large extent on the AOB (although it is possible that the MOB may also be involved in these tasks to a degree). In our initial version of the manuscript, we commented on the anticipated relative involvement of the MOB and AOB in the studied tasks, but we have now added some additional sentences to make this point clearer. In addition, we now add a comment indicating that it is possible that the abnormal behaviors could simply be due to a reduction in the number of AOB M/T cells (~98.5% and ~ 85% elimination of M/T cells in the AOB in Tbx::DTA and Tbx::iDTR mice, respectively), regardless of the abnormal dendritic pruning of main OB M/T cells (Lines 530-534).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors make the interesting observation that the developmental refinement of apical M/T cell dendrites into individual glomeruli proceeds normally even when the majority of neighboring M/T cells are ablated. At later stages, the remaining neurons develop additional dendrites that invade multiple glomeruli ectopically, and similarly, OSN inputs to glomeruli lose projection specificity as well. The authors conclude that the normal density of M/T neurons is not required for developmental refinement, but rather for maintaining specific connectivity in adults.</p>
<p>The observations are indeed quite striking; however, the authors' conclusions are not entirely supported by the data.</p>
<p>(1) It is unclear whether the expression of diphtheria toxin that eventually leads to the ablation of the large majority of M/T neurons compromises the cell biology of the remaining ones.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>DT is an extremely potent toxin that kills cells by inhibiting proteins translation, and it has been demonstrated that the presence of a single DT molecule in a cell is sufficient to kill it, because of its highly efficient catalytic activity. Accordingly, previous experiments have shown that DT kills cells within a few hours after its appearance in the cytoplasm (Yamaizumi et al., 1978). In other words, all the published evidence suggests that if a cell is exposed to the action of DT, that cell will die shortly. There is no evidence that cells exposed to DT can survive and experience long-term effects. Finally, previous works have not observed any long-term changes in neurons directly caused by the actions of DT (Johnson et al., 2017).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors interpret the growth of ectopic dendrites later in life as a lack of maintenance of dendrite structure; however, maybe the observed changes reflect actually adaptations that optimize wiring for extremely low numbers of M/T neurons. The finding that olfactory behavior was less affected than predicted supports this interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not know the cellular or molecular mechanisms that explain why reducing the density of M/T cells is followed by the growth of ectopic dendrites from the remaining M/T cells. We agree that the functional outcome of growing ectopic dendrites may result in an optimization of wiring in the bulb and could explain why olfactory function is relatively preserved. We now include a comment regarding this possibility (Lines 513-525).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The number of remaining M/T neurons is much higher at P10 than later. Can the relatively large number of remaining neurons (or their better health status) be the reason that dendrites refine normally at the early developmental stages rather than a (currently unknown) developmental capacity that preserves refinement?</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>(4) While the effect of reduced M/T neuron density on both M/T dendrites and OSN axons is described well, the relationship between both needs to be characterized better: Is one effect preceding the other or do they occur simultaneously? Can one be the consequence of the other?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Previous works have demonstrated that disrupting the topographic projection of the OSN axons has no effect on the structure of the apical dendrite of M/T cells (Ma et al., 2014; Nishizumi et al., 2019). Our experiments ablating a large fraction of M/T cells suggest that they are necessary for the correct targeting of OSN axons into the bulb. However, our experiments do not allow us to tell apart these 2 scenarios:</p>
<p>(a) the ablation of a large fraction of M/T cells directly causes the sprouting of the apical dendrite of M/T cells, and that this sprouting in turn causes the abnormal projection of OSN axons onto the bulb.</p>
<p>(b) the ablation of a large fraction of M/T cells first causes the axons of OSN to project abnormally onto multiple glomeruli in the bulb, and this in turn causes the dendrite of remaining M/T cells to sprout onto multiple glomeruli.</p>
<p>We now include a comment on the manuscript explaining this point. (Lines 473-492)</p>

<p>(7) It remains unclear how the observed structural changes can explain the behavioral effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the relationship between structural changes and behavior was not appropriately explained in our manuscript. Our manipulations cause two major changes in the olfactory system, one primary, and several secondary. The primary change is a large reduction in the number of M/T cells both in the MOB and AOB. This reduction in M/T cell number triggers significant secondary changes in the connectivity of the bulb, including an abnormal projection of OSNs onto the OB, and the growth of ectopic dendrites from the remaining M/T cells into multiple glomeruli.</p>
<p>The behavioral abnormalities displayed by these mice is ultimately caused by the reduction in the number of M/T cells, but it is likely that the secondary structural changes could regulate some of the behavioral phenomena that we observed. For example, in principle, it is possible that the ectopic dendrites innervating several glomeruli could help the bulb to perceive smells with a much reduced number of M/T cells. On the other hand, this promiscuous growth of dendrites into multiple glomeruli could make it more difficult for the animals to discriminate between smells. The same argument could be made about the fact that OSN axons project onto multiple glomeruli: we simply do not know if this change helps or makes it more difficult for the animal to detect smells.</p>

<p>Additional experiments and a more thorough discussion of the results, as suggested in the public review, would significantly strengthen the paper. Below are some specific parts that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>There is a lack of information on how M/T cell numbers are quantified. Without the information, it is difficult to evaluate the claim. Using the tdTomato signal may miss cells that are not labeled due to the transgenic effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we cannot conclude that we are identifying the complete set of M/T cells (because the transgenic lines may fail to label some M/T cells), the number of M/T cells that we observed is similar to that previously reported (Richard et al., 2010). This concern has been included in the Results section (Lines 121-124).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The volume measurement is inconsistent with the pictures shown. In Figure 1, supplemental data 2 panels B and C, it appears that the bulbs in DTA and DTR mice are about half in length in each dimension. This would translate into ~1/8 of the volume of the control mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We measured the volume of the bulbs based on the Neurolucida reconstructions, and we observed that in both DTA and iDTR mice the volumes of their bulbs are roughly 50% compared to a wild type mouse. In Figure 1 - figure supplement 2 the sections that were shown for wild type, DTA and iDTR mice were not taken at the same position in the bulb, and this gave the impression that the bulbs from DTA and iDTR were much smaller than they really are. We now show sections for these three animals at equivalent positions in the bulb.</p>

We did not quantify the possible effects of kir2.1 in the group of animals that did not receive DT because on a first inspection we did not observe any clear differences between Kir2.1 cells and neighboring wild type cells.</p>
