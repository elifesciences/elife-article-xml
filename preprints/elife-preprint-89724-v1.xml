<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are promising resources for various types of tissues in regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). To enable cell therapy from hiPSCs, the development of a large-scale manufacturing system is essential because massive cell numbers are required to compose transplantable cells which are enough to rescue the desired physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim &amp; Kino-Oka, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tannenbaum &amp; Reubinoff, 2022</xref>). In general, hiPSCs are believed to possess their scaffold dependency, thus are cultured under adhesion and monolayer culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hayashi &amp; Furue, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). However, utilizing suspension culture without microcarriers or special materials allows for massive production, automation, cost-effectiveness, and safety assurance in industrialized regenerative medicine.</p>
<p>Several attempts have been made to develop suspension culture technologies enabling rapid and large-scale preparation of hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amit <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amit <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dang <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Elanzew <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Horiguchi &amp; Sakai, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hunt <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ibuki <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kehoe <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Krawetz <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kwok <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lam <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nath <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Oh <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Olmer <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rohani <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shafa <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Singh <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Steiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zweigerdt <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) (Summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These studies have achieved long-term culture and/or mass expansion of hiPSCs and/or human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in suspension conditions. However, completed processes from clonal hiPSC generation to mass production of hiPSCs based on the precise control of cell status have not yet been achieved.</p>

<p>In this study, we have investigated what hampers the stable maintenance of undifferentiated cell states in suspension conditions. HiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions with continuous agitation without any microcarriers or extracellular matrix (ECM) components were more prone to spontaneous differentiation than those cultured in conventional adherent conditions. From screening of candidate molecules to suppress the spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs, we have identified that inhibitors of PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathways suppress their differentiation into ectoderm and mesendoderm, respectively. In these conditions, we aimed to complete the processes of handling hiPSCs including the generation of hiPSCs with the expansion of bulk population and single-cell sorted clones, long-term culture with robust self-renewal characteristics, single-cell cloning, direct cryopreservation from suspension culture and their successful recovery, and efficient mass production of a clinical-grade hiPSC line.</p>

<title>Suspension cultured hiPSCs are prone to spontaneous differentiation</title>
<p>First, we investigated whether the quality of hiPSCs in suspension and adherent conditions are equivalent or not. HiPSCs cultured in a conventional medium with continuous agitation (90 rpm) in non-adhesive cell culture plates for 2 passages (5 days during passages) were examined (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In suspension culture on day 5 and 10, hiPSCs formed round cell assemblies with slightly uneven surfaces (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Gene expression analysis with RT-qPCR revealed that the expression of differentiation markers, such as PAX6 (ectoderm), SOX17 (endoderm), and T (mesoderm) increased in suspension-cultured hiPSCs for 10 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To monitor the spontaneous differentiation at single cell resolution, we established knock-in reporter hiPSC lines of PAX6-tdTomato and SOX17-tdTomato to visualize and quantify the expression of PAX6 and SOX17 at protein level, respectively (<xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–H</xref>). tdTomato-positive cells were clearly observed in day 10 samples in suspension-cultured hiPSCs, whereas no positive cells were observed in adherent culture conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1D</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that hiPSCs in suspension-culture conditions contained non-negligible percentages of PAX6-tdTomato-positive and SOX17-tdTomato-positive cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed that protein expression of PAX6 and SOX17 in suspension-culture was significantly increased (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). The ratio of positive cells for a cell surface marker for undifferentiated hiPSCs, TRA1-60, was significantly lower in suspension-culture conditions (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). These results suggest that a portion of hiPSCs was spontaneously differentiated in suspension conditions when cultured in conventional medium. To examine global changes in gene expression patterns between suspension and adherent conditions, whole-transcriptomic RNA-seq experiments with statistical tests were performed. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of all the genes and Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA) on differentially-regulated genes revealed that, in suspension conditions, number of genes involved in differentiation toward various tissues and cell-cell adhesions were significantly up-regulated, whereas genes involved in nucleotide metabolism, hypoxic responses, and extracellular matrix organization were significantly-down-regulated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G–J</xref>). These results suggest that hiPSCs in suspension conditions are in the process of spontaneous differentiation into various cell lineages and are characterized with specific signatures of gene expression patterns.</p>

<title>Wnt signaling inhibitors suppress spontaneous mesendodermal differentiation in suspension culture condition</title>
<p>We next investigated the factors having an inhibitory effect on hiPSCs spontaneous differentiation in suspension conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Since Wnt signaling induces the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into mesendoderm lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nakanishi <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sumi <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tran <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vijayaragavan <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Woll <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), and is endogenously involved in the regulation of mesendoderm differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dziedzicka <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), we hypothesized that adding Wnt signaling inhibitors/activator may alter spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs into mesendoderm. Therefore, Wnt signaling inhibitors, IWP2 or IWR-1-endo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), or an activator, CHIR99021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ring <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), were added to the culture medium under suspension conditions. HiPSC aggregates treated with and without inhibitors showed similar shapes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, hiPSC aggregates treated with CHIR99021 formed heterogeneously shaped cyst-like structures, suggesting that they were largely differentiated. In samples treated with inhibitors, both T and SOX17 expression levels were significantly reduced to the level of adherent-cultured hiPSCs; however, there was no reduction in PAX6 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, CHIR99021-treated cell aggregates showed markedly decreased OCT4 and increased T and SOX17 expression. Additionally, SOX17 protein expression was suppressed in hiPSCs treated with IWR-1-endo in suspension-culture conditions, although its expression increased in hiPSCs in suspension conditions with conventional culture medium compared to adherent conditions (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). These results indicate that Wnt signaling inhibitors effectively suppressed mesendodermal differentiation in suspension-culture, but was insufficient to suppress ectodermal differentiation.</p>

<title>PKC signal inhibitors suppress spontaneous neuroectododermal differentiation in suspension conditions</title>
<p>To identify molecules with inhibitory activity on neuroectodermal differentiation, hiPSCs were treated with candidate molecules in suspension conditions. Out of the candidate molecules tested (listed in <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), Go6983, a pan-PKC inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gschwendt <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>), showed the strongest inhibition against PAX6 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Further, simultaneous treatment with Go6983 and IWR-1-endo decreased PAX6, T, and SOX17 expression, while maintaining OCT4 expression. To confirm these screening test results, the dose dependent effect of Go6983 or another PKCα, β, γ inhibitor GF109203X (GFX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Toullec <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>) on the inhibition of PAX6 expression was observed at constant concentration of IWR-1-endo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). These results demonstrated that the inhibition of PKC signaling pathway effectively suppress neuroectoderm differentiation in hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions. Furthermore, we tested various PKC inhibitors to suppress neuroectodermal differentiation from hiPSCs in suspension culture using the 201B7 hiPSC line (<xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The suppression of PAX6 expression in hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions was observed with PKC inhibitors, enzastaurin (Ly317615), sotrastaurin (AEB071), Ro-32-0432, Go6983, GF109203X, and LY333531, which possessed PKCβ inhibition activity (<xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-D</xref>); however, sotrastaurin and Ro-32-0432 also showed growth inhibition. Thus, for the rest of the study, a PKCβ specific inhibitor, LY333531 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jirousek <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>) was used. As compared to controls, another hiPSC line, WTc11, cultured in suspension conditions treated with IWR-1-endo and LY333531 formed homogenous, round, smooth-surfaced aggregates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3A</xref>). PAX6 expression was strongly suppressed by the addition of LY333531 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3B</xref>). Furthermore, after adding IWR-1-endo, the inhibitory effect of PAX6 expression was further enhanced, and simultaneously, OCT4 expression was restored to the same level as in the adherent-culture. PAX6 protein expression was also suppressed in hiPSCs treated with IWR-1-endo and LY333531 in suspension-culture conditions while its expression increased in suspension conditions with conventional culture medium compared to adherent-conditions (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). The ratio of TRA-1-60-positive cells was higher in suspension-culture conditions supplemented with IWR-1-endo and LY333531 than in control conditions without these inhibitors (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). These results indicate that the maintenance of suspension-cultured hiPSCs is specifically facilitated by the combination of PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibition.</p>

<p>We examined the effect of PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors on global gene expression of hiPSCs under suspension conditions. RNA-seq data were obtained from suspension conditions in absence of inhibitors (Sus), supplemented with IWR-1-endo (IWR), LY333531 (LY), IWR-1-endo and LY333531 (IWRLY), and adherent conditions (Ad). Hierarchical clustering obtained from these data showed that LY and IWRLY were grouped closely with Ad (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, Sus and IWR were both grouped as discrete populations from Ad. Additionally, hierarchical clustering in gene expression among these conditions was supported by principal component 1 (PC1) in the principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, PC2 represented genes related to the effects of specific inhibitors under these conditions. Next, we investigated the effect of LY333531 and IWR-1-endo in suspension culture. Many genes involved in pluripotency: KLF4 and ID1, and epithelial cell-cell interactions: CDH1 (E-cadherin), were significantly up-regulated in IWRLY, while many transcription factors involved in differentiation: PAX2, 3, 5, and 8, SP5, DBX1, and TFAP2B, were down-regulated in IWRLY (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). GSEA and GOEA on down-regulated genes in IWRLY showed that the expression of developmentally associated genes, whose expression was elevated in Sus, was generally reduced in IWRLY (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). GOEA on up-regulated genes revealed gene sets involved in epithelial cell types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). As compared to Ad, genes involved in sensory system development, cell-cell adhesion, and Wnt and PI3K signaling pathways were up-regulated in IWRLY, and genes involved in nucleotide metabolism and hypoxic responses were down-regulated under IWRLY conditions (<xref rid="fig3_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). These results suggest that PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibitors in suspension conditions regulate global gene expression patterns to suppress spontaneous differentiation, albeit remaining expression signatures of suspension culture, possibly due to the microenvironment within the formed aggregates and physiological differences.</p>
<p>Further, we examined the expression pattern changes in specific isoforms of PKCs in hiPSCs cultured in adherent/suspension conditions. RNA expression of PKCα (PRKCA) and PKCβ (PRKCB) was significantly up-regulated under suspension-culture conditions compared to adhesion conditions (<xref rid="fig3_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, phospho-PKCβ protein expression was significantly elevated (<xref rid="fig3_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3_S2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). These results suggest that elevated expression of PKCβ in suspension-cultured hiPSCs could affect the spontaneous differentiation.</p>

<title>Simultaneous inhibition of PKCβ and Wnt signals maintains undifferentiated hiPSCs in suspension for long-term culture</title>
<p>We next performed long-term culture for 10 passages in suspension conditions and compared hiPSC growth in presence of LY333531 or Go6983. When hiPSCs were seeded at 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well, the average cell number reached approximately 12-fold after 5 days under both conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). After 10 passages, aggregates of hiPSCs cultured in the presence of LY333531 showed a uniform spherical shape, whereas aggregates cultured in the presence of Go6983 were heterogeneously spherical (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, in LY333531-treated cells, OCT4-positive cell numbers were significantly higher than in Go6983-treated samples, as determined by immunostaining (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). To evaluate whether hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions with PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibitors for 10 passages maintain pluripotency, we performed embryoid body (EB) formation assay. These EBs contained positive cells for TUJ1, SMA, and AFP as ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal marker, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array analysis showed that hiPSCs cultured long-term in the presence of PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors retained their normal human karyotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). These results indicate that, for long-term culture, inhibition of Wnt signaling and PKCβ in suspension conditions was sufficient to maintain the self-renewal, pluripotency, and genomic integrity of hiPSCs.</p>

<p>We further investigated whether the effects of PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors on suppressing hiPSCs spontaneous differentiation in suspension-culture conditions are applicable to other culture medium. Morphologies and gene expression profile of hiPSCs, cultured in suspension conditions with another commercially available maintenance medium, StemScale (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc., MA, USA), were examined (<xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). HiPSCs cultured in suspension treated with IWR-1-endo and LY333531 formed homogenously round and smooth-surfaced aggregates compared to controls (<xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The differentiation markers expression, which was elevated under suspension conditions, was suppressed by the simultaneous addition of PKCβ and Wnt signal inhibitors, as observed with StemFit medium (<xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). These results suggest that conventional suspension culture methods might contain spontaneous differentiating cells and that the addition of inhibitors of PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathways to culture medium generally suppresses spontaneous differentiation.</p>

<title>Mass and clonal expansion of hiPSCs in suspension conditions supplemented with inhibitors of PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathways</title>
<p>For the clinical applications of hiPSCs, its homogenous mass production is required to obtain sufficient quantities. To test the feasibility of mass production under suspension-culture conditions supplemented with PKCβ and Wnt signal inhibitors, we first performed suspension-culture using healthy-donor derived hiPSC lines, 1383D6 and 1231A3, in a 30 mL bioreactor with stirring blade and demonstrated that undifferentiated hiPSCs were efficiently maintained in this condition (<xref rid="fig5_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These cell lines showed higher cell density in the bioreactor at each passage after 3 days (<xref rid="fig5_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Under these conditions, the concentration of glucose decreased daily (<xref rid="fig5_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), whereas that of L-lactic acid increased (<xref rid="fig5_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results indicate that the cell lines proliferated with active energy consumption. Further, RT-qPCR analysis showed no marked differences in the undifferentiated and differentiation markers expression between hiPSCs cultured in adhesion vs. suspension with PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors (<xref rid="fig5_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5_S1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis showed that more than 90% of these cells were positive for pluripotency marker proteins: NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 (<xref rid="fig5_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). G-band analysis of suspension-cultured hiPSCs after five passages revealed normal karyotype (<xref rid="fig5_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). These results demonstrate that undifferentiated hiPSCs were efficiently maintained in the bioreactor using the culture medium supplemented with inhibitors of PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Next, we expanded hiPSCs in a large-scale culture system under perfusion conditions in the presence of IWR-1-endo and LY333531. In this experiment, clinical-grade hiPSC line, Ff-l14s04, which is derived from PBMCs of a donor carrying homozygous alleles for major HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR) was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kitano <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Large-scale hiPSCs preparation using a perfusion-culture system with 320 mL bioreactor having stirred-wing was performed in GMP-compliant, clinical grade StemFit AK03N medium containing IWR-1-endo and LY333531 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). When the culture was started at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in 320 mL medium, hiPSCs proliferated nearly 10-fold after 3 to 4 days and reached approximately 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells in total to produce ~300 stock vials (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/vial). This large-scale culture was repeated three times (Passages 1, 2, and 3), and hiPSCs obtained at each passage were characterized. These samples showed similar or higher viability (&gt;90%) to that of adherent-culture derived cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). When compared to adherent conditions, these samples in suspension-culture showed a similar or higher proliferation rate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Cells obtained from large-suspension cultures formed typical hiPSC-like colonies, after vials were thawed and seeded in adherent-culture conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Flow cytometry detected over 90% of cells positive for pluripotent cell markers expression: TRA-1-60, SSEA4, and OCT4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Further, G-band analysis revealed that hiPSCs retained their normal karyotype even after three passages under large-scale suspension conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). When large-scale suspension-culture derived hiPSCs were incubated in each germ layer-specific differentiation medium for 4 - 7 days, the expression of early differentiation markers for ectoderm (PAX6 and SOX1), mesoderm (T and PDGFRA) and endoderm (SOX17 and CXCR4) was significantly induced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). These cells were then directly differentiated into dopaminergic neural progenitors, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes to evaluate their differentiation capacity and propensity. There were no differences in the differentiation efficiency toward these lineages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I-M</xref>). Hence, these results indicate that the characteristics and quality of clinical-grade hiPSCs cultured in large-scale suspension conditions in the presence of PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors were equivalent to those of hiPSCs maintained under adherent conditions. Taken together, we were successful in mass suspension-culture conditions supplemented with Wnt and PKCβ inhibitors.</p>

<title>Establishment of hiPSC lines in complete suspension-culture conditions supplemented with inhibitors of PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathways</title>
<p>For the clinical use of hiPSCs, more secure and efficient establishment of hiPSCs in closed systems is strongly desired. To achieve this, we aimed to establish hiPSCs in suspension-culture conditions. Using PBMCs as a starting material, we generated hiPSCs using a novel replication-defective and persistent Sendai virus vector (SeVdp) infection or episomal vector electroporation, as these methods are well-known for producing transgene-free, clinical-grade hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fusaki <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nishimura <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). PMBCs were infected with SeVdp carrying OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and L-MYC. Infected cells were kept cultured by repeating passages every 5 - 6 days. Cell aggregates cultured with IWR1-endo and LY33351 showed uniform spherical structure (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), and most of the cells were positive for OCT4 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>) and TRA-1-60 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>) on day 56. These bulk cells were able to differentiate into three germ layers in an in vitro EB formation assay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>) and in teratomas that were transplanted into immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). These bulk-hiPSCs maintained normal karyotype (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). By single cell sorting with fluorescent labeled TRA-1-60 antibody, we expanded single-cell-derived clones in suspension-culture conditions. A clone (F-10) showed OCT4 and TRA1-60 expressions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H-J</xref>).

<p>Furthermore, we were successful in establishing single-cell-derived hiPSC lines using the transfection of episomal plasmid vectors in suspension-culture conditions in the presence of PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibitors. PMBCs were transfected with episomal plasmid vector mix carrying OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, L-MYC, LIN28, and mp53DD and cultured in suspension conditions in the presence or absence of IWR-1-endo and LY33351 with repeated passages to reach enough cell numbers to make cell stocks and characterization (<xref rid="fig7_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After 36 days of culture, 59% double positive cells for TRA-1-60 and SSEA4 were observed in control, whereas 78% were seen in the presence of IWR-1-endo and LY333531 (<xref rid="fig7_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7_S1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). We performed cell sorting of TRA-1-60 and SSEA4 double positive cells and further repeated 5 more passages in the absence or presence of IWR-1-endo and LY333531. Cell aggregates cultured in culture medium supplemented with IWR-1-endo and LY333531 showed uniform spherical structures (<xref rid="fig7_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and the most of these cells were TRA-1-60 and SSEA4 double positive (<xref rid="fig7_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, cell aggregates cultured without these inhibitors showed lumpy, heterogeneous shapes, and decreased undifferentiated population. Immunostaining of OCT4 on dissociated cell aggregates resulted in higher OCT4 positive cells in IWR-1-endo and LY333531 treated cells (<xref rid="fig7_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7_S1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have developed a series of methods to generate and maintain hiPSCs in suspension conditions. First, we have identified compounds that suppress spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs in suspension cultures. Based on these findings, we have newly achieved a complete series of culture processes including hiPSC establishment, long-term culture, mass culture, single-cell cloning, and direct freeze and thaw (summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These methods require no special materials including microcarriers or dialysis bags, and are effective with various existing culture media and many hiPSC lines. Therefore, this suspension-culture of hiPSCs is anticipated to have novel industrial applications, which have been never achieved with conventional methods because suspension-culture conditions, which precisely control cellular states, have advantages in terms of mass culture, automation, and safety assurance.</p>
<p>We have identified two compounds as factors that ameliorate the disadvantages of the suspension culture of hiPSCs. Wnt signaling inhibitors specifically inhibited differentiation toward mesendoderm, whereas, the PKCβ inhibitor, LY333531, inhibited ectodermal differentiation and, when combined with IWR-1-endo, maintained the undifferentiated nature of hiPSCs with high efficiency. Go6983, a pan-PKC inhibitor, has been used to promote the self-renewal of mammalian PSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dutta <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kinehara <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rajendran <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Takashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>); however, in these cases, the role of specific isoforms in PSC self-renewal and differentiation are not fully elucidated yet. In this study, we demonstrated that PKCβ-specific inhibitor LY333531 as well as Go6983 showed the suppression of neuroectodermal differentiation. Interestingly, these combinations of chemical inhibitors against WNT and PKC signaling pathways are also being used in the induction and maintenance of naive human pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bayerl <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bredenkamp <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Khan <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). While, in suspension-culture, we did not aim to drive hiPSCs to a naïve state by the use of these combinations of chemical inhibitors conditions, it would be worthwhile to investigate the effect of adaptation of suspension-culture supplemented with PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibitors on the transition of the naïve PSCs types.</p>
<p>We successfully generated hiPSC lines from PBMCs in suspension conditions for the first time by adding the abovementioned compounds to the culture medium. Both transduction methods with SeVdp and episomal plasmid vectors enabled the establishment of hiPSCs under suspension conditions in the presence of IWR-1-endo and LY333531. Clonal expansion of hiPSCs was also performed by single-cell sorting with flow cytometry and were successfully characterized for their self-renewal, pluripotency, and genomic integrity. These results indicate that hiPSC lines generated in suspension conditions have the same quality in terms of their pluripotency, self-renewal, and genomic integrity as those generated with conventional adherent conditions. Precise control of hiPSC status in suspension culture could pave the way for their stable and automated clinical application toward autologous cell therapy of hiPSCs.</p>

Dissociated cells (0.5 or 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were collected and centrifuged at 200 × g for 3 minutes and resuspended in 500 or 1000 µL PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.5 mM EDTA, then incubated with or without anti-TRA-60 antibody or anti-SSEA4 antibody for 1 hour at 4 °C under oblique light conditions. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in 500 mL D-PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.5 mM EDTA, and filtrated with 35-mm cell strainer (Cat#352235, FALCON, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For PAX6-TEZ and SOX17-TEZ hiPSC lines, adherent- or suspension-cultured hiPSCs were dissociated into single cells and collected cells were resuspended in 500 mL PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.5 mM EDTA. After passing through the 35-mm cell strainer, cells were analyzed for tdTomato. The primary and secondary antibodies used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">Supplementary Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS4">4</xref>, respectively. Flow cytometry was performed with SH800 cell Sorter (SONY, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>RNA-Seq</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using the FastGene RNA premium kit, and strand-specific library preparation was performed. The prepared library was sequenced using a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, Inc, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed in a 150 bp × 2 paired-end conFigureuration with a data output of about 6 Gb per sample (~ 20 million paired reads). Library preparation and sequencing was performed in GENEWIZ (Azenta, MA, USA). To identify differentially regulated genes, sequencing data was analyzed with a CLC Genomics Workbench (QIAGEN, Hulsterweg, the Neterlands) and R package, edgeR (v3.30.3) in R language (v 4.1.0). An MA plot (log2 fold change versus mean average expression) comparing transcriptomes between suspension- and adherent-culture from RNA-seq data. Transcripts with log2 fold change ≧ 2 or ≦ −2 (FDR &lt;0.01) are highlighted with red and blue dots, respectively. The extracted genes were analyzed for gene ontology enrichment and biological pathways using the R package, clusterProfiler (v3.16.1). GSEA was also performed using clusterProfiler. An enrichment map was used to visualize the GSEA results with enrichment score (ES) and false discovery rate (FDR) values. Software used for the analysis is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test or Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons with a single control condition. P values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. *, ** or *** in the graphs indicate P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.001, respectively. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors have presented data showing that there is a greater amount of spontaneous differentiation in human pluripotent cells cultured in suspension vs static and have used PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors to decrease the amount of differentiation in suspension culture.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is a very comprehensive study that uses a number of different rector designs and scales in addition to a number of unbiased outcomes to determine how suspension impacts the behaviour of the cells and in turn how the addition of inhibitors counteracts this effect. Furthermore, the authors were also able to derive new hiPSC lines in suspension with this adapted protocol.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main weakness of this study is the lack of optimization with each bioreactor change. It has been shown multiple times in the literature that the expansion and behaviour of pluripotent cells can be dramatically impacted by impeller shape, RPM, reactor design, and multiple other factors. It remains unclear to me how much of the results the authors observed (e.g. increased spontaneous differentiation) was due to not having an optimized bioreactor protocol in place (per bioreactor vessel type). For instance - was the starting seeding density, RPM, impeller shape, feeding schedule, and/or any other aspect optimized for any of the reactors used in the study, and if not, how were the values used in the study determined?</p>

<p>This study by Matsuo-Takasaki et al. reported the development of a novel suspension culture system for hiPSC maintenance using Wnt/PKC inhibitors. The authors showed elegantly that inhibition of the Wnt and PKC signaling pathways would repress spontaneous differentiation into neuroectoderm and mesendoderm in hiPSCs, thereby maintaining cell pluripotency in suspension culture. This is a solid study with substantial data to demonstrate the quality of the hiPSC maintained in the suspension culture system, including long-term maintenance in &gt;10 passages, robust effect in multiple hiPSC lines, and a panel of conventional hiPSC QC assays. Notably, large-scale expansion of a clinical grade hiPSC using a bioreactor was also demonstrated, which highlighted the translational value of the findings here. In addition, the author demonstrated a wide range of applications for the IWR1+LY suspension culture system, including support for freezing/thawing and PBMC-iPSC generation in suspension culture format. The novel suspension culture system reported here is exciting, with significant implications in simplifying the current culture method of iPSC and upscaling iPSC manufacturing.</p>
<p>Another potential advantage that perhaps wasn't well discussed in the manuscript is the reported suspension culture system does not require additional ECM to provide biophysical support for iPSC, which differentiates from previous studies using hydrogel and this should further simplify the hiPSC culture protocol.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although several hiPSC suspension media are currently available commercially, the content of these suspension media remained proprietary, as such the signaling that represses differentiation/maintains pluripotency in hiPSC suspension culture remained unclear. This study provided clear evidence that inhibition of the Wnt/PKC pathways is critical to repress spontaneous differentiation in hiPSC suspension culture.</p>
<p>I have several concerns that the authors should address, in particular, it is important to benchmark the reported suspension system with the current conventional culture system (eg adherent feeder-free culture), which will be important to evaluate the usefulness of the reported suspension system. Also, the manuscript lacks a clear description of a consistent robust effect in hiPSC maintenance across multiple cell lines. There are also several minor comments that should be addressed to improve readability, including some modifications to the wording to better reflect the results and conclusions.</p>

<p>In the current manuscript, Matsuo-Takasaki et al. have demonstrated that the addition of PKCβ and WNT signaling pathway inhibitors to the suspension cultures of iPSCs suppresses spontaneous differentiation. These conditions are suitable for large-scale expansion of iPSCs. The authors have shown that they can perform single-cell cloning, direct cryopreservation, and iPSC derivation from PBMCs in these conditions. Moreover, the authors have performed a thorough characterization of iPSCs cultured in these conditions, including an assessment of undifferentiated stem cell markers and genetic stability. The authors have elegantly shown that iPSCs cultured in these conditions can be differentiated into derivatives of three germ layers. By differentiating iPSCs into dopaminergic neural progenitors, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes they have shown that differentiation is comparable to adherent cultures. This new method of expanding iPSCs will benefit the clinical applications of iPSCs.</p>
<p>Recently, multiple protocols have been optimized for culturing human pluripotent stem cells in suspension conditions and their expansion. Additionally, a variety of commercially available media for suspension cultures are also accessible. However, the authors have not adequately justified why their conditions are superior to previously published protocols (indicated in Table 1) and commercially available media. They have not conducted direct comparisons. Additionally, the authors have not adequately addressed the observed variability among iPSC lines. While they claim in the Materials and Methods section to have tested multiple pluripotent stem cell lines, they do not clarify in the Results section which line they used for specific experiments and the rationale behind their choices. There is a lack of comparison among the different cell lines. It would also be beneficial to include testing with human embryonic stem cell lines. Additionally, there is a lack of information regarding the specific role of the two small molecules in these conditions. The authors have not attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanism other than RNA expression analysis.</p>
<p>For these reasons some aspects of the manuscript need to be extended:</p>
<p>1. It is crucial for authors to specify the culture media used for suspension cultures. In the Materials and Methods section, the authors mentioned that cells in suspension were cultured in either StemFit AK02N medium, 415 StemFit AK03N (Cat# AK03N, Ajinomoto, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), or StemScale PSC416 suspension medium (A4965001, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The authors should clarify in the text which medium was used for suspension cultures and whether they observed any differences among these media.</p>
<p>2. In the Materials and Methods section, the authors mentioned that they used multiple cell lines for this study. However, it is not clear in the text which cell lines were used for various experiments. Since there is considerable variation among iPSC lines, I suggest that the authors simultaneously compare 2 to 3 pluripotent stem cell lines for expansion, differentiation, etc.</p>
<p>3. Single-cell sorting can be confusing. Can iPSCs grown in suspensions be single-cell sorted? Additionally, what was the cloning efficiency? The cloning efficiency should be compared with adherent cultures.</p>
<p>4. The authors have not addressed the naïve pluripotent state in their suspension cultures, even though PKC inhibition has been shown to drive cells toward this state. I suggest the authors measure the expression of a few naïve pluripotent state markers and compare them with adherent cultures</p>
