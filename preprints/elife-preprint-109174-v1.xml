<abstract><p>While magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) is a clinically approved therapy for alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), its precise molecular targets and mechanisms remain uncharacterized. This study aimed to define MgIG’s hepatoprotective actions in chronic-binge ALD mouse models and ethanol/palmitic acid-exposed AML-12 hepatocytes. Through an integrated strategy encompassing RNA sequencing, molecular docking, and microscale thermophoresis, we discovered that MgIG directly binds to hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 1 (HSD11B1) at residue 187, a finding corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. <italic>In vivo</italic>, MgIG markedly attenuated alcohol-induced liver injury, evidenced by ameliorated histological damage, reduced hepatic steatosis, and normalized liver-to-body weight ratios. <italic>In vitro</italic>, it effectively reduced lipid accumulation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing identified isopentenyl diphosphate delta isomerase 1 (IDI1) as a key downstream effector. Hepatocyte-specific genetic manipulations confirmed that MgIG modulates the SREBP2-IDI1 axis, thereby suppressing lipogenesis, inflammatory responses, and apoptotic pathways. We reveal HSD11B1 as a novel direct molecular target of MgIG and elucidate its therapeutic mechanism through the HSD11B1-SREBP2-IDI1 signaling axis, which profoundly impacts ALD pathogenesis. These findings not only validate MgIG’s clinical utility but also highlight a promising new therapeutic target for ALD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) encompasses a spectrum of hepatic pathologies ranging from steatosis to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and ultimately, hepatocellular carcinoma, contributing significantly to the global burden of disease and premature mortality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. With alcohol use disorder affecting approximately 283 million individuals worldwide (5.1% of the population), alcohol emerges as a leading cause of cirrhosis, conferring a 260-fold increased risk of liver-related death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Excessive alcohol consumption, the primary etiological factor in ALD, triggers a cascade of pathological events, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism dysregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Current ALD management primarily focuses on alcohol abstinence and supportive care. While potential therapeutic targets, such as oxidative stress pathways, inflammatory cascades, and the gut-liver axis, have been extensively investigated, the identification of druggable hepatic signaling pathways remains elusive <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 1 (HSD11B1), a cortisol-regenerating enzyme predominantly expressed in the liver and kidneys, elevates endogenous glucocorticoids and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and liver fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Similarly, isopentenyl diphosphate delta isomerase 1 (IDI1), a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, has been identified as a key risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and intrahepatic cholestasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence suggests that exercise may ameliorate MASLD by downregulating IDI1 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, the precise roles of HSD11B1 and IDI1 in ALD progression remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG), a fourth-generation glycyrrhizin (GL) derivative and a magnesium salt of a single stereoisomer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), exhibits enhanced pharmacological properties compared to its predecessors. As an 18α-GL, MgIG possesses greater lipophilicity than the β-isomer, facilitating superior binding to target cell receptors and steroid hormones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This enhanced binding capacity translates to potent anti-inflammatory effects, hepatoprotective properties, and improved liver function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. MgIG has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in various liver diseases, including drug-induced liver injury (DILI) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, MASLD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and liver fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Notably, MgIG has been preliminarily shown to inhibit ethanol-induced activation of the hedgehog signaling pathway in hepatocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and attenuate acute alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis in a zebrafish model by modulating lipid metabolism-related gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, MgIG has been recognized by the Chinese Society of Hepatology for its clinical utility in ALD treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Despite its therapeutic promise and proven safety, the precise molecular targets of MgIG in the liver remain poorly defined, hindering the development of optimized treatment strategies for ALD. This study employed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> ALD models to investigate the hepatoprotective mechanisms of MgIG, revealing its direct interaction with HSD11B1 as a key mediator of its therapeutic effects and the involvement of downstream signaling of the sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2)-IDI1 axis.</p>

<title>Animal experiments</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6 wild-type mice (7 weeks old; 19-21 g) were purchased from Guangzhou Qingle Biosciences Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Mice were acclimated to the housing environment for one week prior to experimental procedures. Alcoholic liver injury was induced using a modified National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Briefly, mice (n = 4 per group) were initially fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> with the control (Ctrl) Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet for 5 days to facilitate acclimation. Subsequently, the ALD groups (designated as ’A-Ctrl’ and ’MgIG’ in figures) received the Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% (v/v) ethanol for 10 days, while the control group (designated as ’Ctrl’ in figures) received an isocaloric control diet. Body weight and food intake were monitored daily. On day 11, ethanol-fed mice and their pair-fed controls were administered a single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) or an isocaloric maltose dextrin solution, respectively, via oral gavage in the early morning. Mice were euthanized 9 h later (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). A vehicle-MgIG control group was not included in this study because: (1) MgIG is a clinically approved drug with an established safety profile; (2) the dosage used in this study was calculated based on human clinical dosages using a standard conversion formula; and (3) the vehicle safety of MgIG with similar dose has been previously confirmed in an animal study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. For viral infections, mice (n = 5 per group) received tail vein injections of 5 × 10<sup>11</sup> genome copies of either AAV8 control or AAV-shRNA/plasmid. After 14 days, mice were fasted for 4 h at the end of the dark cycle and then euthanized to confirm hepatic upregulation or downregulation of <italic>Hsd11b1</italic>, <italic>Srebp2</italic>, or <italic>Idi1</italic>. These mice were then subjected to the NIAAA model and/or MgIG administration as described above. Target gene expression in the liver was verified using quantitative PCR and Western blotting. All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee of Jinan University, China (IACUC-20220708-04).</p>

<title>RNA sequencing and functional enrichment analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality was assessed using a Nanodrop ONE spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Samples with A260/A280 ratios above 1.8 and A260/A230 ratios above 2.0 were deemed acceptable for further processing. RNA integrity was evaluated using an Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and only samples with an RNA integrity number above 7.0 were used for library preparation. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was depleted from total RNA using the Epicentre Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina) and fragmented to an average size of 200 bp. First-strand and second-strand cDNA synthesis, followed by adapter ligation and low-cycle enrichment, were performed using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Library quality was assessed using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). Libraries were diluted to 10 pmol/L and subjected to cluster generation on a pair-end flow cell, followed by sequencing (2 × 150 bp) on an Illumina HiSeq 3000. Raw sequencing reads were processed to remove adapter sequences, low-quality reads, and reads containing poly-N stretches. Clean reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome using HISAT2 with default parameters. Gene expression levels were quantified using HTSeq, and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq with read counts as input. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to adjust p-values for multiple testing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as those with a fold change &gt; 2 and an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05. Heatmap visualization and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the identified DEGs. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant for KEGG pathway enrichment.</p>

<title>Liver tissue histology</title>
<p>Liver tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5 μm thickness) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Oil Red O for histological examination. Images were acquired using a LEICA Qwin Image Analyzer (Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK).

<title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
<p>The AML-12 mouse normal hepatocyte cell line was obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a cell incubator. To induce an ALD-like phenotype in AML-12 cells, cells were exposed to a combination of 25 mmol/L ethanol and 0.1-1 mmol/L palmitic acid (PA; Sigma-Aldrich; #P0500) for 24 h to determine the optimal concentration for inducing cellular injury, as previously described (12). We chose the combination of ethanol and palmitic acid in the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments because ethanol-only treatment could not phenocopy alcoholic cell death, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the dysregulated lipid metabolism in hepatocytes exhibited in early-stage ALD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Following this initial treatment, varying concentrations of MgIG were added to the culture medium for an additional 24-hour to assess its effects and determine the optimal dose. For gene knockdown and overexpression experiments, Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher; #L3000001) was used to transfect AML-12 cells with <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> or <italic>Idi1</italic>-targeting constructs in 6-well plates.</p>

<title>Cell lipid accumulation, viability, and apoptosis assays</title>
<p>Intracellular lipid droplets were visualized by staining AML-12 cells with Nile Red. Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, and then stained with Nile Red solution (0.1 mg/mL; #N8440, Solarbio, Beijing, China) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then counterstained with DAPI (5 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich; D9542) for 5 min. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed in 96-well plates using a CCK8 cell viability assay and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay kit, respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (MedChem Excess, Shanghai, China; HY-K1090 and HY-K0301).</p>

Subsequently, two steps of equilibration phases were carried out: (1) a 200 ps NPT simulation with constraints on heavy atoms followed by (2) a 1 ns NVT simulation without restraint. The temperature was maintained at 300 K using the Berendsen thermostat with 1 ps coupling constant and the pressure at 1 atm using Monte Carlo barostat with 1 ps relaxation time.

<title>MgIG alleviates liver injury in a mouse model of ALD</title>
<p>To investigate the hepatoprotective effects of MgIG <italic>in vivo</italic>, we employed a well-established chronic-binge NIAAA mouse model of ALD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Based on the drug’s clinical instructions, previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, and our preliminary experimental results (Fig. S1), we determined an optimal MgIG dose of 50 mg/kg. Compared to mice fed a normal diet (Ctrl group), mice in the alcohol-fed control group (A-Ctrl) exhibited characteristic histological features of ALD, including steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, resulting in an elevated NAS. MgIG treatment effectively attenuated these pathological changes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Consistent with these histological findings, the liver-to-body weight ratio, a marker of liver injury, was significantly increased in the A-Ctrl group, and this increase was markedly reduced by MgIG treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Notably, serum levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and triglycerides (TG), indicators of liver function and lipid metabolism, were significantly different between the A-Ctrl and MgIG-treated groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). In line with the observed histological and physiological improvements, MgIG treatment also modulated the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism (<italic>Srebp-1c</italic>, <italic>Srebp2</italic>, <italic>Acc1</italic>, and <italic>Scd1</italic>), inflammation (<italic>Tnf-α</italic> and <italic>Il-6</italic>), and apoptosis (<italic>Bax</italic> and <italic>Bcl2</italic>) in the liver tissue of A-Ctrl mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>

<title>MgIG protects against ethanol-induced hepatocyte injury via IDI1</title>
<p>To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatoprotective effects of MgIG, we performed RNA sequencing analysis on liver tissue from the NIAAA mouse model.

We first optimized the EtOH/PA concentrations to induce significant cell death and lipid accumulation (Fig. S2), identifying 250 mmol/L ethanol and 0.2 mmol/L PA as the optimal combination. MgIG treatment (0.1-1.0 mg/mL) demonstrated a dose-dependent protective effect against EtOH/PA-induced injury, as evidenced by improved cell viability, reduced lipid accumulation, and decreased apoptosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>).

<title>MgIG directly binds to HSD11B1</title>
<p>To identify potential direct binding partners of MgIG, we initially performed molecular docking simulations between MgIG and IDI1. However, the resulting Glide score of -2.74 indicated a lack of favorable binding interactions, which implied that there should be an immediate binding protein in the upstream of IDI1. To identify potential upstream regulators of <italic>Idi1</italic> expression, we utilized the ULM within the DecoupleR package to analyze transcription factor activity. This analysis identified SREBP2 as the most significantly affected transcription factor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We then expanded our search to include upstream regulators of IDI1 identified using the STRING database. Among these proteins, HSD11B1 exhibited the highest binding affinity for MgIG, with a Glide score of -8.75 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Given the homology between human and mouse <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> and the need for future translational research, we focused on validating the interaction between human HSD11B1 and MgIG. We conducted 100 ns MD simulations for Compound-HSD11B1 (MgIG-HSD11B1 binding in physiological condition) and EtOH-HSD11B1 (MgIG-HSD11B1 binding in alcoholic condition), with free HSD11B1 as a control. The results revealed that HSD11B1 exhibited high flexibility and dynamic motion in its unbound state but became significantly more rigid and stable upon binding to MgIG, particularly at residues 219–233 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). This structural stabilization was further supported by the radius of gyration curves, which indicated a more compact conformation upon binding (Fig. S4A and SB). Further analyses, including PCA and DCCM, demonstrated alterations in motion direction, dynamic patterns, and residue correlations. Specifically, upon binding, HSD11B1 exhibited reduced motion amplitude and weaker residue correlations, with its dynamic patterns becoming more disordered (Fig. S4C-4E). In the Compound-HSD11B1 system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), key interactions included hydrogen bonds (Tyr177, Tyr183), a salt bridge (Lys187) and hydrophobic interactions (Leu126, Leu217, Ala223, Ala226, and Ile230). In contrast, the EtOH-HSD11B1 system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>) exhibited hydrogen bonds (Thr124, Ser170, Tyr183, Leu217, and Arg269) along with an additional salt bridge (Tyr183 and Arg269). Notably, the EtOH-HSD11B1 system demonstrated stronger hydrogen bonding and more favorable binding free energy compared to the Compound-HSD11B1 system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> and S4F), suggesting enhanced stability and binding affinity in an ethanol environment. Based on molecular docking and MD results, we further validated the binding between MgIG and the human full-length wild-type (WT) HSD11B1 protein as well as its site-directed mutants (Tyr177, M1; Tyr183, M2; Lys187, M3) using MST. The Kd value of the WT protein was 6.35 μM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>), while those of M1, M2, and M3 were 48.6 μM, 11.5 μM, and 135.6 μM, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). These data indicate that MgIG primarily exerts its anti-ALD effect by inhibiting HSD11B1 through the critical Lys187 site.</p>

<p>To further investigate the functional significance of this interaction, we modulated <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> expression in AML-12 cells using siRNA- and plasmid-mediated knockdown and overexpression, respectively.

<title>MgIG protects hepatocyte partially through the HSD11B1–SREBP2–IDI1 axis</title>
<p>To investigate the relationship between SREBP2 and HSD11B1, we conducted co-IP experiments, which revealed a direct interaction between the precursor form of SREBP2 (p-SREBP2) and HSD11B1. This interaction was weakened following MgIG treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>).

Knockdown of <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> resulted in an accumulation of p-SREBP2, while <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> overexpression increased the levels of nuclear SREBP2 (n-SREBP2), an effect further enhanced by the EtOH/PA treatment. These findings suggest that HSD11B1 may regulate the processing and nuclear translocation of SREBP2. Immunofluorescent analysis confirmed these observations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, the co-IP results indicated that HSD11B1 also interacted with its downstream protein IDI1.

As shown in Fig. S6A-6C, knockdown or overexpression of <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> or <italic>Idi1</italic> in mice fed a normal control diet did not result in significant changes in liver histology, lipid accumulation, or serum ALT and AST levels. However, in the ALD model, knockdown of <italic>Hsd11b1</italic>, <italic>Srebp2</italic>, or <italic>Idi1</italic> attenuated ethanol-induced liver injury, as evidenced by improved histological NAS scores, reduced steatosis, and decreased inflammation. MgIG treatment further enhanced these beneficial effects. Conversely, overexpression of <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> or <italic>Idi1</italic> abolished the therapeutic effects of MgIG on ethanol-induced liver injury (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref> and S7). Interestingly, modulation of <italic>Idi1</italic> expression did not affect the expression of <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> or <italic>Srebp2</italic>, suggesting that IDI1 acts downstream of HSD11B1 and SREBP2. In contrast, modulation of <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> expression altered the levels of n-SREBP2 and IDI1 (Fig. S7E-G), confirming that HSD11B1 regulates the SREBP2-IDI1 pathway. Collectively, these data indicate that MgIG protects against ALD, at least in part, by modulating the HSD11B1-SREBP2-IDI1 axis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While previous research using a zebrafish model demonstrated that MgIG alleviates alcohol-induced liver injury by modulating lipid metabolism-related gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, the precise molecular mechanisms and direct targets of MgIG remained unclear. This lack of mechanistic understanding hindered the development of optimized therapeutic strategies for ALD. In this study, we provide compelling evidence that MgIG effectively ameliorates key features of ALD, including hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and apoptosis, in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models. Our findings shed light on the complex interplay of molecular pathways involved in ALD pathogenesis and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the HSD11B1-SREBP2-IDI1 axis.</p>
<p>Our RNA sequencing analysis identified IDI1 as a key player in ALD pathogenesis and a critical mediator of MgIG’s hepatoprotective effects. IDI1, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, is involved in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cholesterol synthesis. Dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism is a hallmark of ALD, contributing to the accumulation of lipids in the liver. Our findings demonstrate that <italic>Idi1</italic> expression is significantly upregulated in the livers of mice subjected to the NIAAA model of ALD, suggesting that increased IDI1 activity may contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis. Genetic manipulation of <italic>Idi1</italic> expression further confirmed its role in ALD. Specifically, <italic>Idi1</italic> knockdown protected against alcohol-induced liver injury, an effect further enhanced by MgIG treatment. This suggests that reducing IDI1 activity can ameliorate the detrimental effects of alcohol on the liver and that MgIG may exert its therapeutic benefits, at least in part, by suppressing IDI1. Conversely, <italic>Idi1</italic> overexpression abolished the therapeutic benefits of MgIG, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, highlighting the importance of IDI1 in mediating MgIG’s effects. These findings are consistent with recent reports highlighting the role of IDI1 in hepatic cholesterol accumulation and lipid toxicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and its involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma progression via inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our study identified SREBP2, a master regulator of lipid metabolism, as an upstream regulator of IDI1. SREBP2 belongs to a family of transcription factors that control the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. SREBP2 has been implicated in various aspects of liver pathology, including NLRP3 inflammasome activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, lipid accumulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, liver cancer progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, with its target protein IDI1 upregulated in parallel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Our findings demonstrate that both SREBP2 and IDI1 are upregulated in response to EtOH/PA treatment and that MgIG effectively inhibits their expression, consistent with the notion that SREBP2 contributes to the development of MASLD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. The identification of SREBP2 as a key regulator of IDI1 in the context of ALD provides a mechanistic link between lipid metabolism and the pathogenesis of this disease.</p>
<p>To identify the direct molecular target of MgIG, we employed a combination of molecular docking, MD, MST analysis, and genetical manipulation studies. These approaches converged on HSD11B1, a key enzyme in glucocorticoid metabolism, as a high-affinity binding partner of MgIG. HSD11B1 catalyzes the conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol in the liver, thereby increasing intracellular glucocorticoid levels. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that play a critical role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and their dysregulation has been implicated in the development of metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. As a potential inhibitor of HSD11B1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, GL can improve patients’ insulin and lipid levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In addition, the increased expression of <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> enhances the enzymatic reducing activity, promoting a fat-forming phenotype in cell models through elevated cortisol levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> deficiency prevents hepatic steatosis in high-fat diets-fed mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Our findings demonstrate that MgIG directly binds to the Lys187 of HSD11B1 and that modulation of <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> expression in hepatocytes significantly influences the development of ALD.</p>
<p>While some studies have suggested a potential pro-fibrotic role for HSD11B1 inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, our findings, along with those of other recent studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, support a protective role for <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> knockdown in the context of alcoholic liver injury. These discrepancies may be attributed to differences in experimental models and the specific cell types targeted. For instance, the study by Zou <italic>et al</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> examined the effects of global <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> deficiency, which could trigger compensatory activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or paracrine regulatory mechanisms, potentially affecting the pro-fibrotic response. In contrast, our study focused on hepatocyte-specific <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> knockdown, which may avoid these confounding factors. Importantly, our study provides evidence for a novel HSD11B1-SREBP2-IDI1 axis in the pathogenesis of ALD. We demonstrate that HSD11B1 regulates the processing and nuclear translocation of SREBP2, which in turn controls the expression of IDI1. Notably, this is consistent with previous studies showing that increased SREBP2 expression and nuclear translocation activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and the mevalonate pathway, thereby promoting inflammation and tumor progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. This regulatory axis appears to be a key target of MgIG’s therapeutic effects. By directly binding to HSD11B1, MgIG may inhibit its activity, leading to reduced SREBP2 activation and subsequent downregulation of IDI1. This, in turn, could contribute to the observed improvements in hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This study provides mechanistic evidence that MgIG directly targets HSD11B1 and modulates the HSD11B1–SREBP2–IDI1 axis to attenuate ALD. However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, our findings are derived from preclinical mouse models and hepatocyte systems, and pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and long-term safety of MgIG remain to be comprehensively evaluated in larger and more diverse populations. Second, although molecular docking and thermophoresis confirmed direct binding of MgIG to HSD11B1, high-resolution structural studies such as X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy are needed to delineate the precise binding interface and conformational changes. Third, other signaling pathways potentially influenced by MgIG have not been systematically explored and may contribute to its therapeutic effects. Future work should focus on validating these findings in human tissues, optimizing MgIG dosing strategies, and conducting multicenter clinical trials to assess its translational potential and establish HSD11B1 as a druggable target for precision therapy in ALD.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reports characterisation of hepatocyte molecular pathways affected by a glycyrrhizin derivative in both in vivo and in vitro mouse models of alcohol-associated liver disease. The authors show <bold>convincing</bold> evidence indicating that IPP delta isomerase 1 (Idi1) is an intermediate in these pharmacological effects, via the binding of the glycyrrhizin derivative to an upstream regulator of Idi1, HSD11B1, although some more quantitative analyses and better organisation of data would strengthen the study. The findings would be of interest to immunologists and pharmacologists interested in liver inflammation and its amelioration.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article by Xiao et al., the authors aimed to identify the precise targets by which magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) functions to improve liver injury in response to ethanol treatment. The authors found through a series of in vivo and molecular approaches that MgIG treatment attenuates alcohol-induced liver injury through a potential SREBP2-IdI1 axis. This manuscript adds to a previous set of literature showing MgIG improves liver function across a variety of etiologies, and also provides mechanistic insight into its mechanism of action.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors use a combination of approaches from both in-vivo mouse models to in-vitro approaches with AML12 hepatocytes to support the notion that MgIG does improve liver function in response to ethanol treatment.</p>
<p>(2) The authors use both knockdown and overexpression approaches, in vivo and in vitro, to support most of the claims provided.</p>
<p>(3) Identification of HSD11B1 as the protein target of MgIG, as well as confirmation of direct protein-protein interactions between HSD11B1/SREBP2/IDI1, is novel.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major weaknesses can be classified into 3 groups:</p>
<p>(1) The results do not support some claims made.</p>
<p>(2) Qualitative analyses of some of the lipid measures, as opposed to more quantitative analyses.</p>
<p>(3) There are no appropriate readouts of Srebp2 translocation and/or activity.</p>
<p>More specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) A few of the claims made are not supported by the references provided. For instance, line 76 states MgIG has hepatoprotective properties and improved liver function, but the reference provided is in the context of myocardial fibrosis.</p>
<p>(2) MgIG is clinically used for the treatment of liver inflammatory disease in China and Japan. In the first line of the abstract, the authors noted that MgIG is clinically approved for ALD. In which countries is MgIG approved for clinical utility in this space?</p>
<p>(3) Serum TGs are not an indicator of liver function. Alterations in serum TGs can occur despite changes in liver function.</p>
<p>(4) There are discrepancies in the results section and the figure legends. For example, line 302 states Idil is upregulated in alcohol fed mice relative to the control group. The figure legend states that the comparison for Figure 2A is that of ALD+MgIG and ALD only.</p>
<p>(5) Oil Red O staining provided does not appear to be consistent with the quantification in Figure 1D. ORO is nonspecific and can be highly subjective. The representative image in Figure 1C appears to have a much greater than 30% ORO (+) area.</p>
<p>(6) The connection between Idil expression in response to EtOH/PA treatment in AML12 cells with viability and apoptosis isn't entirely clear. MgIG treatment completely reduces Idi1 expression in response to EtOH/PA, but only moderate changes, at best, are observed in viability and apoptosis. This suggests the primary mechanism related to MgIG treatment may not be via Idi1.</p>
<p>(7) The nile red stained images also do not appear representative with its quantification. Several claims about more or less lipid accumulation across these studies are not supported by clear differences in nile red.</p>
<p>(8) The authors make a comment that Hsd11b1 expression is quite low in AML12 cells. So why did the authors choose to knockdown Hsd11b1 in this model?</p>
<p>(9) Line 380 - the claim that MGIG weakens the interaction between HSD11b1 and SREBP2 cannot be made solely based on one Western blot.</p>
<p>(10) It's not clear what the numbers represent on top of the Western blots. Are these averages over the course of three independent experiments?</p>
<p>(11) The claim in line 382 that knockdown of Hsd11b1 resulted in accumulation of pSREBP2 is not supported by the data provided in Figure 6D.</p>
<p>(12) None of the images provided in Figure 6E support the claims stated in the results. Activation of SREBP2 leads to nuclear translocation and subsequent induction of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. Manipulation of Hsd11b1 via OE or KD does not show any nuclear localization with DAPI.</p>
<p>(13) The entire manuscript is focused on this axis of MgIG-Hsd11b1-Srebp2, but no Srebp2 transcriptional targets are ever measured.</p>
<p>(14) Acc1 and Scd1 are Srebp1 targets, not Srebp2.</p>
<p>(15) A major weakness of this manuscript is the lack of studies providing quantitative assessments of Srebp2 activation and true liver lipid measurements.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG)'s hepatoprotective actions in chronic-binge alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) mouse models and ethanol/palmitic acid-challenged AML-12 hepatocytes. They found that MgIG markedly attenuated alcohol-induced liver injury, evidenced by ameliorated histological damage, reduced hepatic steatosis, and normalized liver-to-body weight ratios. RNA sequencing identified isopentenyl diphosphate delta isomerase 1 (IDI1) as a key downstream effector. Hepatocyte-specific genetic manipulations confirmed that MgIG modulates the SREBP2-IDI1 axis. The mechanistic studies suggested that MgIG could directly target HSD11B1 and modulate the HSD11B1-SREBP2-IDI1 axis to attenuate ALD. This manuscript is of interest to the research field of ALD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have performed both in vivo and in vitro studies to demonstrate the action of magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate on hepatocytes and an animal model of alcohol-associated liver disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data were not well-organised, and the paper needs proofreading again, with a focus on the use of scientific language throughout.</p>
<p>Here are several comments:</p>
<p>(1) In Supplemental Figure 1A, all the treatment arms (A-control, MgIG-25 mg/kg, MgIG-50 mg/kg) showed body weight loss compared to the untreated controls. However, Figure 1E showed body weight gain in the treatment arms (A-control and MgIG-25 mg/kg), why? In Supplemental Figure 1A, the mice with MgIG (25 mg/kg) showed the lowest body weight, compared to either A-control or MgIG (50 mg/kg) treatment. Can the authors explain why MgIG (25 mg/kg) causes bodyweight loss more than MgIG (50 mg/kg)? What about the other parameters (ALT, ALS, NAS, etc.) for the mice with MgIG (50 mg/kg)?</p>
<p>(2) IL-6 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine significantly involved in ALD, acting as a marker of ALD severity. Can the authors explain why MgIG 1.0 mg/ml shows higher IL-6 gene expression than MgIG (0.1-0.5 mg/ml)? Same question for the mRNA levels of lipid metabolic enzymes Acc1 and Scd1.</p>
<p>(3) For the qPCR results of Hsd11b1 knockdown (siRNA) and Hsd11b1 overexpression (plasmid) in AML-12 cells (Figure 5B), what is the description for the gene expression level (Y axis)? Fold changes versus GAPDH? Hsd11b1 overexpression showed non-efficiency (20-23, units on Y axis), even lower than the Hsd11b1 knockdown (above 50, units on Y axis). The authors need to explain this. For the plasmid-based Hsd11b1 overexpression, why does the scramble control inhibit Hsd11b1 gene expression (less than 2, units on the Y axis)? Again, this needs to be explained.</p>
