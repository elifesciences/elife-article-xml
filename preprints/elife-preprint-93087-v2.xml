<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Backgroud</title>
<p>Recurrent joint bleeding in patients with hemophilia frequently results in hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Drastic degradation of articular cartilage is a major characteristic of HA, but its pathological mechanisms has not yet been clarified. Here, we conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation study with the goal of identifying critical genes for HA cartilage degeneration.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>DNA was isolated from human osteoarthritis (N = 5) and HA (N = 5) articular cartilages and analyzed using the Infinium Human Methylation 850 BeadChip array. Adeno-associated virus-mediated shRNA and siRNA were used to knock down Tenascin XB (TNXB) in chondrocytes and F8<sup>-/-</sup> male mice, respectively. Then histopathological analysis, qPCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were conducted to detected chondrocyte homeostasis and HA progression.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We found that Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a protein levels were increased in cartilages from HA patients compared with OA patients. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis identified 1228 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with HA. Functional enrichment analyses then revealed that DMR genes (DMGs) were related to extracellular matrix organization. Among these DMGs, TNXB protein expression was down-regulated in human and mouse HA cartilages. Further, the loss of <italic>Tnxb</italic> in F8<sup>-/-</sup> mouse cartilage provides a disease-promoting role in HA by augmenting cartilage matrix degeneration and subchondral bone loss. <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown also promoted chondrocyte apoptosis and inhibited phosphorylation of AKT. Importantly, AKT agonist showed a chondroprotective effect following <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study demonstrated that TNXB is a central mediator of cartilage matrix degradation following joint bleeding, which functions by regulating the activation of AKT. These mechanistic insights allow targeted development of potentially new strategies for cartilage protection in HA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hemophilia is a X-linked bleeding disorder due to the deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (hemophilia A) and IX (hemophilia B). As a one of the most frequent rare diseases, hemophilia is a persistent, challenging condition for patients, physicians and society <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Joint bleeding (hemarthrosis), especially in knee joint, is the most common clinical manifestation in patients with severe hemophilia (i.e., plasma FVIII or FIX &lt; 1 U/dl) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Recent evidence also indicates that hemarthrosis may occur spontaneously in patients with moderate (plasma factor levels of 1– 5 UI/dl) or mild disease (plasma factor levels of &gt;5 UI/dl) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Repeated episodes of hemarthrosis eventually result in hemophilic arthropathy (HA), a debilitating and irreversible condition. HA often starts at an early age and characterized by joint impairment, chronic pain, and reduced quality of life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Current efforts to prevent the development of HA are mainly focused on management of acute joint bleeding and optimizing prophylactic replacement therapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, the widespread adoption of the modern hematological care has not conferred considerable protection against the development of HA; even in patients with hemophilia receiving intermediate- and high-dose prophylaxis, many still develop HA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Pathological changes of HA begin with the first joint bleedings, either breakthrough or sub-clinical, usually during the first years of life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. They consist in progressive and irreversible alterations induced by the direct and indirect toxicity of the free blood in the joint space. The joint replacement surgery, such as Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), is considered an intervention for alleviating pain and restoring joint function in patients with end-stage HA. However, it is associated with a high incidence of complications, primarily attributed to septic loosening and recurrent postoperative bleeding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Given no disease modifying therapy available to intervene in the HA perpetuating process, HA remains a persistent problem and challenge for hemophilia patients. Thus, to understand the pathogenesis of HA and subsequently explore possible targets for therapy is necessary.</p>
<p>One distinctive pathophysiological manifestation of HA is cartilage degeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Cartilage is a rather inert tissue, consisting of matrix proteins and only one cell type, chondrocytes that are responsible for production of matrix synthesis and rely on synovial fluid for nutrients as cartilage lacks blood supply <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, recurrent intra-articular bleeding creates a ‘toxic’ environment to cartilage, by inducing synovial inflammation, hemosiderin accumulation and excessive mechanical stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. As a consequence, dysregulation of metabolism and abnormal apoptosis occur in chondrocytes, ultimately resulting in deterioration of the cartilage matrix <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>DNA methylation, a core epigenetic mechanism, is high dynamic and susceptible to cues from the environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine residue of DNA molecules, which is catalyzed by DNA methyl transferase (Dnmt) family of proteins that is comprised of three members: Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b. DNA methylation is mainly located in the gene regulatory region, usually repressing gene expression by blocking the transcriptional accessibility of regulatory genomic regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Recently, multiple studies confirmed the important role of abnormal DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of arthritis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying HA-related cartilage degradation have not been explored.</p>
<p>In this study, we conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation study with the goal of identifying differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and pathways for HA. Further, we knocked down <italic>Tnxb</italic>, a key DMG, in primary mouse chondrocytes and hemophilia A (F8<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. The biological function and underlying mechanisms of TNXB in HA progression were also investigated <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our findings provide a new mechanism for articular cartilage lesion in HA, which may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of HA.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods Cartilage specimen collection</title>
<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is often used as “disease” control to reveal the characteristics in HA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, although the mechanistic and phenotypic are different between HA and OA. In this study, 5 HA and 5 OA knee cartilage specimens were collected from patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery. Knee cartilage tissues were dissected and then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. All subjects were Chinese Han and their demographic characteristics were listed in Supplementary table 1. The human cartilage samples were obtained from Department of Orthopedic Surgery at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (2019-ZX-004-02).</p>

<title>Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)</title>
<p>MRI examination: a GE 3.0 T Signa Excite superconducting MRI machine with a 32-channel body coil, a gradient field of 24 mT/m, and a creep rate of mT/(m.s) as well as a Siemens Verio 3.0 T superconducting magnetic resonance imaging machine with a 16-channel phased array coil were applied. An ultrashort echo time (UTE) pulse sequence (echo time 0.07 ms) was performed in the sagittal plane of the knee joint of the affected limb. Scanning parameters: layer thickness of 0.8 mm, field of view of 320 mm×320 mm, matrix of 160 mm×160 mm, intra-layer resolution of 0.6 mm×0.6 mm, and excitation of 2 times.

<title>Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was prepared from cartilage specimens using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and was stored at -80 °C until used. Then bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA was performed with the EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer’s procedure. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were evaluated by Infinium Human Methylation 850 K BeadChips (Illumina), which determine the methylation levels of 853,307 CpG sites. R/Bioconductor (version 3.3.3) package ChAMP was used to process the Illumina intensity data (IDAT) files from the chip.</p>
<p>DNA methylation level of each CpG site was described as a β value, ranging from zero (representing fully unmethylated) to one (representing fully methylated). Probes that had a detection <italic>P</italic> value of &gt; 0.01 and those located on the X and Y chromosome were filtered away. We also removed SNP-related probes and all multi-hit probes.</p>
<p>BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation) algorithm was used to correct for the Infinium type I and type II probe bias. Furthermore, the regression models were adjusted for age and sex. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) at significance of <italic>P</italic> &lt;□0.05 after the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg correction for multiple testing. Differentially</p>
<p>Methylated Regions (DMRs) were identified by Bumphunter with default settings. Additionally, we annotated the DMR-related genes (DMGs), and then performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG) pathway analysis by using the online tool DAVID ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link> ). The significant pathway/ GO term was identified with <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Mouse</title>
<p>The FVIII target gene knockout hemophilia (F8<sup>-/-</sup>) mouse were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All mouse were kept in the Laboratory Animal Center of Zhejiang University of Chinese Medicine. The animals were placed in the controlled environmental condition with relatively constant air humidity and temperature as well as manual control of day and night replacement for 12h. The experiment was approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (LZ12H27001).</p>

<title>The mouse experimental model of HA</title>
<p>The HA model is constructed according to the description of Hakobyan et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. F8<sup>-/-</sup> male mouse were induced with 3% isoflurane, and 1% isoflurane was maintained under anesthesia. The right knee joint capsule of mouse was pierced with a 30g needle for bleeding modeling, and the left knee of each animal was used as a control group. Mouse were sacrificed at 4 and 8 weeks after injury, and knee joints were collected for further experiments.</p>

<title>Intra-articular injection</title>
<p>F8<sup>-/-</sup> male mouse were induced with 3% isoflurane, and 1% isoflurane was maintained under anesthesia. The right knee joint capsule of mouse was pierced with a 30g needle for bleeding modeling. The needle of the insulin syringe was sagittally inserted into the intercondylar area of the mouse right knee joint, and one dose of 10 μL AAV-Tnxb (GenePharma, concentration: 1×10<sup>10</sup>/10μL) or AAV-NC was injected. After 4 weeks, mouse was sacrificed, respectively, and the right knee joints were collected for further experiments.</p>

<sec id="s1f">
<title>Micro-computed tomography (<bold>μ</bold>CT) analysis</title>
<p>Micro-computed tomography (μCT) (Skyscan 1176, Bruker μCT, Kontich, Gelgium) was used to analyze the knee joints. The area between the proximal tibia growth plate and the tibial plateau was chosen as the region of interest. The parameters collected form μCT were percent bone volume (BV/TV, %), Trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), Trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm) and Trabecular Spacing(Tb.Sp, mm).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1g">
<title>Histological analysis</title>
<p>The human cartilage samples were successively fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 days, decalcified with 14% EDTA solution for 3 months, and the mouse samples were successively fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 days, decalcified with 14% EDTA solution for 14 days. These samples subsequently embedded in paraffin. Then 3-μm thick sections at the medial compartment of the joints were cut for Alcian blue hematoxylin/Orange G (ABH) or Toluidine Blue staining to analyze the gross cartilage structural changes. Histomorphometry analysis was performed through Osteomeasure software (Decatur, GA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1h">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>The immunohistochemistry was examined to observe the expressions of protein in cartilage. Briefly, the deparaffinized sections were soaked in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to block the activity of endogenous peroxidase, then blocked with normal goat serum (diluted 1:20) for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the primary antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4° C. The next day, the sections were treated with secondary antibodies for 30 min and positive staining was visible by using diaminobenzidine solution (Invitrogen, MD, United States). Then counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin for 5 s. Anti-Col2a1 (Abcam, ab34712, 1:200), Anti-Mmp13 (Abcam, ab39012, 1:300), Anti-TNXB (Proteintech, 13595-1-AP, 1:50), Anti-Bax (Huabio, ET1603-34, 1:200), Anti-Bcl-2 (Huabio, ET1702-53, 1:200), Anti-p-Akt1 (Abclonal, AP0140, 1:200), Dnmt1(Abcam, 1: 200), Dnmt3a (Abcam, 1: 200), Dnmt3b (Huabio, 1: 200) were used in this study.</p>

MRI analysis revealed the subchondral bone loss in HA patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). ABH staining further assessed the cartilage degeneration, and detected a substantial sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) depletion in HA cartilages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, C and D). As expected, comparing to OA, HA cartilages showed prominent decrease in cartilage matrix protein Col2a1 and increase in expression of Mmp13, the primary enzymes responsible for cartilage degeneration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, E and F). Additionally, obvious increase in Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a protein levels was also detected in HA cartilages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, G and H), whereas no significant changes were found in Dnmt3b (Supplementary Figure 1).

<title>Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis reveals the epigenetic landscape of HA cartilage</title>
<p>To understand the methylation profile associated with HA cartilage degeneration, genome-wide DNA methylation alterations were examined in 10 subjects (5 OA cartilages and 5 HA cartilages) by using 850K ChIP. The methylation levels of whole genome-wide CpGs were in a classic bimodal distribution where most CpGs were either slightly or highly methylated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Of note, global DNA methylation levels exhibited systematic differences between HA and OA, as illustrated by their separation pattern in principle component analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Overall, 1288 significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (P□&lt;□0.05 after the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg correction for multiple testing) were identified, with a mean fold change in methylation difference of 0.90 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, and Supplementary Table 3). Compared with the OA, 69.95% and 30.05% DMRs were hypermethylated and hypomethylated in HA, respectively (Supplementary Figure 2A). Given the specificity of DMR, we then determined whether the identified DMRs were preferentially colocalized with some specific genomic features. The large majority (93.49%) of these DMRs were located in gene promoters, 5’-UTRs, 3’-UTRs, and exons, with only 6.51% overlapping intergenic regions (Supplementary Figure 2B).</p>

<p>To determine the biological functions of these significant DMRs, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed on DMR-related genes (DMGs). GO analysis revealed enrichment for terms largely related to extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, skeletal system development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Supplementary Table 4). The top two KEGG pathways were ECM-receptor interaction (<italic>P</italic> value = 5.2×10<sup>-6</sup>) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (<italic>P</italic> value = 5.3×10<sup>-4</sup>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, Supplementary Table 5).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HA, a common manifestation of hemophilia, is typical characterized by dramatic cartilage degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Thus, the goal of our work was to provide a novel insight into pathogenic mechanisms underlying HA cartilage degeneration. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> H summarized our findings. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed the DNA methylation changes in cartilages from hemophilia patients and identified <italic>Tnxb</italic> gene associated with HA. The decreased expression of TNXB protein was also confirmed in both human and mouse HA cartilages. Further, <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown promoted ECM catabolism and chondrocyte apoptosis, and eventually accelerated the development of HA in F8<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Meanwhile, decreased TNXB expression inhibited the activation of AKT <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Notably, AKT agonist enhanced ECM synthesis and suppressed apoptosis in <italic>Tnxb</italic>-KD chondrocytes. From these findings, it could be hypothesized that abnormal methylation and decreased expression of TNXB are responsible for disruption of cartilage homeostasis in HA.</p>
<p>In hemophlia patients, recurrent joint bleeding creates a toxic environment including multifaceted processes such as hemosiderin deposition, inflammatory response and mechanical pressure overload <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. DNA methylation is a dynamic epigenetic modification in response to environment. Since there are fewer epigenetic studies on the pathological mechanisms of HA, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, we found 1288 significant DMRs associated with HA with 69.95% hypermethylated, which was also supported by a corresponding increase in Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a protein levels in HA cartilages. These results are in line with previous reports showing that aberrant elevations of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a promote cartilage degeneration in destabilization of medial meniscus and aging models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at gene promoter region is one of the important epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The identified HA-related DMRs showed high proportion in transcriptional start sites. These data suggest that DNA methylation is a critical mediator in the pathology of HA. Nevertheless, due to the severe erosion of HA cartilage, the mRNA levels of DMR-related genes were not explored in this study. Besides, our sample size for DNA methylation sequencing is relatively small. Thus, further studies using additional more HA samples will be conducted to investigate the possible transcriptional alteration of identified genes as well as their potential roles in HA development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our enrichment analysis showed that DMR-related genes were significantly enriched in ECM organization and ECM-receptor interaction terms. It is consistent with previous reports that ECM acts as an epigenetic informational entity capable of transducing and integrating intracellular signals via ECM-receptor interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. DMR-related genes enriched in these terms, many are known to be critical compositions of cartilage matrix, such as <italic>COMP</italic>, <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL1A2</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In Articular cartilage, ECM provides nutrients and mechanical support for chondrocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and its age-related stiffening epigenetically regulates gene expression and compromises chondrocyte integrity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Above findings highlight that ECM-related genes are potential candidates for HA.</p>
<p>Tenascin-X (TNXB), an ECM glycoprotein, is the top differentially methylated gene in our DNA methylation analysis of HA cartilages. In addition, DNA methylation of TNXB has also been reported in whole blood from rheumatoid arthritis patients and in retinal pigment epithelium from patients with age-related macular degeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Using IHC staining, we detected the downregulated expression of TNXB in human and mouse HA cartilages. TNXB belongs to tenascin family, whose members (TNC, TNR, TNXB, and TNW) share a similar domain pattern: an N-terminal oligomerization domain, a series of epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a variable number of fibronectin-type III (FNIII) repeats and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence suggests the involvement of TNC in cartilage development and degeneration in arthritis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Here, we prove for the first time a role of TNXB in cartilage homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Specifically, <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown contributed to an increase in Mmp13 expression and decrease in Col2a1 expression in chondrocytes. In agreement with these findings, knockdown of <italic>Tnxb</italic> in cartilages of F8<sup>-/-</sup> mice resulted in accelerated HA-like lesions. It has been previously reported that TNXB blocks the interaction between TGF-β and its receptor in endothelial cells. Since a potent role of TGF-β in chondrocyte differentiation, we examined the effect of TNXB on TGF-β signaling, but did not observe significant alterations in this signaling in <italic>Tnxb</italic>-KD chondrocytes (Supplementary Figure 7, A and B). The FNIII repeats domain of TNXB undergoes alternative splicing to interact with different ECM proteins and growth factors, and then affects ECM network formation and three-dimensional collagen matrix stiffness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Thus, future study would benefit from exploring the effect of the FNIII repeats domain in HA development to further clarify the specific mechanisms of TNXB.</p>
<p>The process of HA development is accompanied by the chondrocyte apoptosis which in part promotes the ECM degeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. We also observed remarkably increased apoptosis following joint bleeding in F8<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Interestingly, <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown could significantly induce apoptosis in chondrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, and even aggravate apoptosis in mouse HA cartilage, by enhancing expression of markers associated pro-apoptosis (Bax, C-Caspase3) and suppressing anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2). In TNXB family, TNC was reported to inhibit human chondrosarcoma cell apoptosis by activation of AKT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. PI3K signaling pathway regulated AKT phosphorylation to suppress apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Our KEGG analysis of DMGs showed the potential association of PI3K/AKT signaling with HA. We then detected much lower phosphorylation level of AKT in <italic>Tnxb</italic>-KD chondrocytes and HA models. These results are in line with previous report showing that the expression of p-AKT1 was down-regulated in the articular cartilage of patients with HA compared with that in patients with OA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Notably, we further demonstrated that AKT agonist effectively restored the abnormal Mmp13 expression and apoptosis induced by <italic>Tnxb</italic> knockdown. Recent studies have shown that AKT signaling affected cartilage metabolism by regulating Mmp13 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. These findings indicate that AKT1 activation mediates the effect of TNXB on HA chondrocytes apoptosis and ECM catabolism. Thus, therapeutic effect of AKT agonist on HA development deserves further study.</p>

<title>Conclussions</title>
<p>Conclusively, our study provides the first comprehensive methylation profile in the progression of knee HA, and shows that abnormal expression of TNXB is important in HA cartilage degeneration by suppressing the activation of AKT1. These findings provide a new insight into mechanisms responsible for HA disease and suggest TNXB as a potentially novel therapeutic target for HA treatment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chen and colleagues first compared the cartilage tissues collected from OA and HA patients using histology and immunostaining. Then, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed, which informed the changes of a novel gene, TNXB. IHC confirmed that TNXB has a lower expression level in HA cartilage than OA. Next, the authors demonstrated that TNXB levels were reduced in HA animal model, and intraarticular injection of AAV carrying TNXB siRNA induced cartilage degradation and promoted chondrocyte apoptosis. Based on KEGG enrichment, histopathological analysis, and western blot, the authors also showed the relationship between TNXB and AKT phosphorylation. Lastly, AKT agonist, specifically SC79 in this study, was shown to partially rescue the changes of in vitro-cultured chondrocytes induced by Tnxb knock-down. Overall, this is an interesting study and provided sufficient data to support their conclusion.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Both human and mouse samples were examined.</p>
<p>

<p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript mainly studied the biological effect of tenascin XB (TNXB) on hemophilic arthropathy (HA) progression. Using bioinformatic and histopathological approaches, the authors identified the novel candidate gene TNXB for HA. Next, authors showed that TNXB knockdown lead to chondrocyte apoptosis, matrix degeneration and subchondral bone loss in vivo/vitro. Furthermore, AKT agonist promoted extracellular matrix synthesis and prevented apoptosis in TNXB knockdown chondrocytes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In general, this study significantly advances our understanding of HA pathogenesis. The authors utilize comprehensive experimental strategies to demonstrate the role of TNXB in cartilage degeneration associated with HA. The results are clearly presented, and the conclusions appear appropriate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional clarification is required regarding the gender of the F8-/- mouse in the study. Is the mouse male or female?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for comments. The reviewer raised the concerns about using human OA cartilage as control, instead of health cartilage. This is an important detail we didn’t describe in the previous version. We have added our explanation in revised Methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) More details on analyzing methods and information on replicates need to be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate your careful review and helpful suggestions. We have added detailed information to our revised draft.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Discussion can be improved by comparing findings to other relevant studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank the reviewer very much for the opportunity to improve our manuscript. We have improved discussions as reviewer suggested in Recommendation 13.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>(2) Please justify the use of OA cartilage, instead of normal tissues, as the control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. We certainly would have liked to use healthy cartilage as control, but we were extremely difficult to obtain enough control samples from healthy individuals. Despite the mechanistic and phenotypic differences between HA and OA, OA is often used as “disease” control to reveal the characteristics in HA 1,2. Thus, we measured cartilage degeneration and DNA methylation difference in HA and OA patients. We have provided the statement and evidence in revised manuscript. Please see lines 144-145.</p>

<p>(3) Please provide details of how to calculate the Cartilage wear area ratio in Figure 1D, and measure the positive staining area in Figure 1F.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the issue you pointed out. Here, we provide detailed information for how positively stained areas are calculated. Specifically, in Figure 1D, we obtained the cartilage area ratio by calculating the ratio of blue cartilage staining area to the whole tissue area by using image J software. In Figure 1F, the area of positive staining was determined upon secondary antibody treatment and color development using DAB chromogen (brown stain). We then obtained the positive staining area ratio by calculating the ratio of positive staining area to the whole cartilage area by using image J software.</p>

<p>(13) Discussion can be improved. For example, have previous studies reported the association between TNXB and methylation in other cells/tissues? In addition to apoptosis, are there other potential mechanisms underlying the protective role of TNXB in chondrocytes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. Previous studies have shown the different DNA methylation of TNXB in whole blood from rheumatoid arthritis patients and in retinal pigment epithelium from patients with age-related macular degeneration 4,5. Herein, we were the first to report the association between DNA methylation of TNXB and HA cartilage degeneration. As for TNXB, there are limited public studies regarding physiological function of TNXB, among which mostly report the effect of TNXB on extracellular matrix organization 6,7. In our work, we found that TNXB regulated the phosphorylation of AKT. Since previous reports showed AKT controlled the expression of Mmp13 8, we thought that TNXB might regulated the chondrocyte extracellular matrix organization, in addition to its function on apoptosis. We have discussed these in revised manuscript (lines 462-464, and 495-501).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript mainly studied the biological effect of tenascin XB (TNXB) on hemophilic arthropathy (HA) progression. Using bioinformatic and histopathological approaches, the authors identified the novel candidate gene TNXB for HA. Next, the authors showed that TNXB knockdown leads to chondrocyte apoptosis, matrix degeneration, and subchondral bone loss in vivo/vitro. Furthermore, AKT agonists promoted extracellular matrix synthesis and prevented apoptosis in TNXB knockdown chondrocytes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In general, this study significantly advances our understanding of HA pathogenesis. The authors utilize comprehensive experimental strategies to demonstrate the role of TNXB in cartilage degeneration associated with HA. The results are clearly presented, and the conclusions appear appropriate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional clarification is required regarding the gender of the F8-/- mouse in the study. Is the mouse male or female?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We feel sorry that we did not provide enough information about the gender of the F8-/- mouse in the previous draft. Here, we used male F8-/- mice as the study subjects for our experiments. Hemophilia A is predominantly seen in males because of the X chromosome linkage 9.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p>
<p>Some issues need to be addressed in the manuscript:</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Dr. Chen et al. investigates the genes that are differentially methylated and associated with cartilage degeneration in hemophilia patients. The study demonstrates the functional mechanisms of the TNXB gene in chondrocytes and F8-/- mice. The authors first showed significant DNA methylation differences between hemophilic arthritis (HA) and osteoarthritis through genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. Subsequently, they showed a decreased expression of the differentially methylated TNXB gene in cartilage from HA patients and mice. By knocking down TNXB in vivo and in vitro, the results indicated that TNXB regulates extracellular matrix homeostasis and apoptosis by modulating p-AKT. The findings are novel and interesting, and the study presents valuable information in blood-induced arthritis research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors adopted a comprehensive approach by combining genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, in vivo and in vitro experiments using human and mouse samples to illustrate the molecular mechanisms involved in HA progression, which is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. The study identifies Tenascin XB (TNXB) as a central mediator in cartilage matrix degradation. It provides mechanistic insights into how TNXB influences cartilage matrix degradation by regulating the activation of AKT. It opens avenues for future research and potential therapeutic interventions using AKT agonists for cartilage protection in hemophilic arthropathy. The conclusions drawn from the study are clear and directly tied to the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The study utilizes a small sample size (N=5 for both osteoarthritis and hemophilic arthropathy). A larger sample size would enhance the generalizability and statistical power of the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this deficiency. Indeed, our sample size is relatively small, although the overall sample size was sufficient for statistical analyses. And we have added this limitation in discussion in revised manuscript. Please see line 445-448. Considering the small sample size, we subsequently performed functional validation study for TNXB, one of the most significant genes, and demonstrated that TNXB exerted critical impacts on chondrocytes apoptosis in HA pathogenesis in vivo and in vitro.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The use of an animal model (F8-/- mouse) to investigate the role of TNXB may not fully capture the complexity of human hemophilic arthropathy. Differences in the biology between species may affect the translatability of the findings to human patients.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We recognize that biological differences between species can affect the clinical translation of research findings. In our work, we sequenced human cartilage samples to obtain the differentially methylated gene-TNXB. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that protein expression of TNXB protein was significantly down-regulated in HA human cartilage and F8-/- transgenic mouse cartilage. The F8-/- transgenic mouse serves as a well-accepted model for the study of hemophilia, which is phenotypically similar to that of human patients suffering from the disease and spontaneously bleeds into the joints and soft tissues. Besides, this model mouse has been widely used in the study of hemophilia and hemophilic arthritis 9-11.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The study primarily focuses on TNXB as a central mediator, but it might overlook other potentially relevant factors contributing to cartilage degradation in hemophilic arthropathy. A more holistic exploration of genetic and molecular factors could provide a broader understanding of the condition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. Since our human sample size is relatively small, we should interpret differentially methylated genes cautiously. Therefore, we mainly focused on the most top significant gene TNXB for functional study. In our further study, we will expand the sample size to more comprehensively explore the molecular mechanisms of HA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p>
<p>The following are my suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Why do the authors choose to concentrate on the knee joint in the introduction when hemophilia, characterized by a deficiency in clotting factor F8, is recognized as a systemic disease?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. Although hemophilia a systemic disease, approximately 80%-90% of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia occur within the musculoskeletal system, especially in the knee joint 12.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While Figure 1 illustrates distinct expressions of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a, only Dnmt1 results are presented in HA mice models in Figure 3. To address this, it is suggested that the expression of Dnmt3a be explored in animal models.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. According to the reviewer's suggestion, we examined the expression of Dnmt3a in mouse articular cartilage, and the expression level of Dnmt3a was significantly up-regulated in both the 4W and 8W model groups compared with the control group (Figure 3). Please see line 364.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 3, the sample size for Dnmt1 is smaller than the other indicators; therefore, supplementing the sample count is recommended.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your reminding. We have corrected it in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Regarding Figure 4G, a few apoptotic cells were observed in the AAV NC group. It is advised that this figure be reviewed for accuracy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. In Figure 5D, the AAV-NC group is the case of needle-injected with AAV. Therefore, it is normal for apoptotic cells to appear in the cartilage layer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors concluded that TNXB plays a role in apoptosis and AKT signaling. Providing expression data for Caspase9 would be valuable to strengthen this assertion, as PI3K/AKT signaling directly influences its activation during apoptosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. We have examined the expression of Cleaved-Caspase9 protein, and found that knockdown of TNXB resulted in upregulation of Cleaved-Caspase9 protein expression, which was reversed by addition of SC79. This result has added in revised Figure 6 and manuscript. Please see line 414.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Quantitative analysis of the differences between the two groups in Supplemental Figures is necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have added the quantitative analysis of the differences between the two groups in Supplemental Figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) With three major isoforms (homologs) of AKT in mammals-AKT1, 2, and 3 - why did the authors specifically focus on AKT1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. Based on the results of the KEGG enrichment analysis of differential methylated genes, we investigated the role of PI3K/AKT pathway in apoptosis of HA chondrocytes. AKT is universally acknowledged as a core factor in the PI3K/AKT pathway that plays critical roles in various cellular activities such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell apoptosis, metabolism and so on 13,14, More notably, several studies demonstrated that in AKT family, Akt1 primarily was involved in regulation of chondrocyte survival and proteoglycan synthesis 15. Therefore, we detected phosphorylation of AKT1 in HA cartilages and TNXB-KD chondrocytes, and found that TNXB regulation chondrocytes ECM and apoptosis by AKT1.
