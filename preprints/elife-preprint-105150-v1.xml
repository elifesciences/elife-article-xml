<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Previously, we reconstituted a minimal functional kinetochore from recombinant <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins that was capable of transmitting force from dynamic microtubules to nucleosomes containing the centromere-specific histone variant Cse4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al. 2020</xref>). This work revealed two paths of force transmission through the inner kinetochore: through Mif2 and through the Okp1/Ame1 complex (OA). Here, using a chimeric DNA sequence that contains crucial centromere-determining elements of the budding yeast point centromere, we demonstrate that the presence of centromeric DNA sequences in Cse4-containing nucleosomes significantly strengthens OA-mediated linkages. Our findings indicate that centromeric sequences are important for the transmission of microtubule-based forces to the chromosome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The kinetochore is an assembly of protein subcomplexes that links dynamic microtubule plus ends to chromosomes via centromeric nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ariyoshi and Fukagawa, 2023</xref>). Through this linkage, kinetochores transmit force from microtubules to chromosomes to align them on the metaphase plate during mitosis, putting both kinetochores and centromeres under tension. This tension signals that kinetochores are correctly bioriented and is a key aspect of the kinetochore’s ability to regulate entry into mitosis and prevent aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Nicklas and Ward, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Centromeres in most eukaryotes are defined by the presence of a centromere-specific histone variant, called Cse4 in budding yeast (also known as CENP-A). The yeast “point” centromere is also defined by DNA sequence – approximately 125 bp in three centromere-determining elements, CDEI, CDEII and CDEIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Clarke and Carbon, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Clarke and Carbon, 1985</xref>). Both the Cse4-containing histone octamer and the centromere specific DNA elements provide a scaffold for kinetochore assembly. Previously, we showed that kinetochore assemblies built from recombinant <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins can transmit force through either Mif2 or OA as the inner kinetochore subcomplex binding the centromeric nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>). In that study, we used recombinant nucleosome core particles wrapped with the Widom 601 DNA (W601-NCPs), which has a sequence that wraps canonical histone octamers with high efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lowary and Widom, 1998</xref>). The Widom 601 sequence has also fortuitously enabled stable wrapping of centromeric histone octamers <italic>in vitro</italic> where it would not otherwise be possible. However, Widom 601 DNA does not contain any native centromeric DNA, and therefore we could not address the relationship between centromere-specific DNA and force transmission.</p>
<p>Here, we develop a chimeric DNA sequence (CCEN) that contains both native centromeric DNA and Widom 601 DNA to reconstitute centromeric nucleosomes. The chimera includes a portion of CDEII and all of CDEIII from the native centromere to allow for DNA-dependent binding between the nucleosome core particles (NCPs) and the kinetochore, as well as segments of Widom 601 DNA at the ends to facilitate stable wrapping. Centromeric histone octamers wrapped with CCEN DNA are stable and thus provide an opportunity to measure the contribution of DNA sequence to the strength of kinetochore attachments.</p>
<p>We found that OA-based assemblies withstood significantly higher forces when nucleosomes were wrapped in the centromere chimeric DNA, while we did not detect significant strengthening of Mif2-based assemblies based on the DNA sequence used to wrap nucleosomes. Our findings show that centromeric specific DNA sequence elements make significant contributions, either directly or indirectly, to the attachment strength between the inner kinetochore and the centromeric nucleosome.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We produced nucleosome core particles (NCPs) by wrapping 147-bp long chimeric centromeric DNA (CCEN) or Widom 601 DNA (W601) around recombinant Cse4, H2A, H2B, and H4 histone octamers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The latter three histones had a polyhistidine tag (His6) to facilitate purification and allow NCP binding to the polystyrene beads used in the optical trap rupture force assay. After the initial wrapping, NCPs were purified over a size exclusion chromatography column (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). As in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>), we also purified five recombinant kinetochore subcomplexes that can self-assemble onto the NCPs to create a minimal, functional kinetochore: OA, Mif2, MIND, Ndc80c, and Dam1c.</p>

<p>Before determining the quantitative rupture strength that each kinetochore assembly could withstand, we confirmed that the recombinant elements could spontaneously build a functional kinetochore as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, the NCPs bearing His6-tags were bound directly to polystyrene microbeads via anti-His6 antibodies. The remaining subcomplexes, which did not have His6-tags, were added free in solution and bound to the beads only indirectly, by assembling together with the directly tethered, His6-tagged NCP. Using a laser trap to manipulate individual beads, we tested the kinetochore assemblies for their ability to bind microtubules. Each bead was brought to the dynamic plus end of a microtubule anchored onto the surface of the flow chamber. If the bead bound to the microtubule when released from the laser trap, then the kinetochore assembly was designated as functional, and the bead was used for the rupture force assay.</p>
<p>With either OA or Mif2 in solution, over 78% of beads coated in W601-NCPs or CCEN-NCPs could bind microtubules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Negative controls where OA or Mif2 was omitted from solution were also performed to confirm the specificity of the NCP for its inner kinetochore binding partner over the outer kinetochore components of the assembly. The negative controls showed 0% bead binding to microtubules, confirming that functional kinetochores are only assembled on NCPs when either OA or Mif2 is present in solution. After a bead was designated as functional, the rupture force of the assembled chain was tested as described in Materials and Methods.</p>

<title>W601 OA vs. CCEN OA</title>
<p>Although OA has not previously been reported to bind specific centromeric DNA sequence elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>), kinetochore assemblies that relied on OA were significantly stronger when assembled on CCEN-NCPs relative to those assembled on W601-NCPs (p=1.87×10<sup>−6</sup>). The median rupture force for OA-based assemblies on CCEN-NCPs was 6.0 pN compared to the W601-NCP median of 4.2 pN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>).</p>

<title>W601 Mif2 vs. CCEN Mif2</title>
<p>CCEN-NCP assemblies with Mif2 were not significantly stronger than assemblies with W601-NCPs (p=0.302), which was surprising given that the CDEII region of the centromere that contains a Mif2-binding footprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>) was present in our chimera. The median rupture force for Mif2-based assemblies on CCEN-NCPs was 2.9 pN, which was slightly higher but not significantly different than the W601-NCP median of 2.5 pN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous work showed that OA nonspecifically binds to both CEN3 and non-CEN3 free DNA fragments, suggesting a sequence-independent OA-DNA binding interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>). OA is also known to bind the unstructured N-terminus of Cse4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anedchenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fischbock-Halwachs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Shukla et al., 2024</xref>). Here we find that the strength of OA-based assemblies, when tested in the context of wrapped nucleosomes, is higher when the nucleosomes are wrapped with a CEN3-containing DNA sequence versus when the nucleosomes are wrapped with W601 DNA. This result together with that of Hornung and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>) implies a difference in the importance of centromeric DNA sequences when OA binds to free DNAs as opposed to DNA wrapped around a nucleosome. We propose two possibilities to rationalize this difference. First, the effect could be indirect; an NCP wrapped with the chimeric CCEN DNA might present the N-terminal tail of Cse4 more favorably to OA, thereby increasing the rupture strength of OA-mediated kinetochore assemblies. Alternatively, OA could demonstrate sequence preferences but only when the DNA is bent around a nucleosome and not when presented as free DNA. In support of this possibility, the recent structure of the inner kinetochore wrapped around a nucleosome shows that a small segment of OA is near the wrapped DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dendooven et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Xiao and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>) showed that both Cse4 and CEN DNA contribute to Mif2 binding to centromeric nucleosomes. Our prior work found that Mif2-based kinetochore assemblies could form on Cse4 containing nucleosomes wrapped with W601 DNA but not on H3-containing nucleosomes wrapped with W601 DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>), as expected given the 100-fold lower affinity Mif2 has for H3 based nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). Xiao and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>) also found that Mif2 has a 30-fold higher affinity for CEN3 DNA wrapped nucleosomes than for nucleosomes wrapped with pericentromeric DNA and 100-fold higher affinity compared to nucleosomes wrapped with W601 DNA. They showed that Mif2 footprints a thirty-five base pair section at the end of CDEII in CEN3. Here we wrapped Cse4 nucleosomes with CCEN DNA, which includes all thirty-five base pairs of the Mif2 footprint in CDEII and compared their properties to those wrapped with W601 DNA. In our experiments, Mif2 did not exhibit DNA sequence specificity for CCEN over W601. A key difference between CCEN and CEN3 DNA is that CCEN is missing 47 bp of CDEII. Our results suggest that the increased affinity of Mif2 for CEN3 DNA observed by Xiao and coworkers might require more than just the portion of CDEII that is footprinted by Mif2. Current structures of the yeast inner kinetochore assembled on NCPs either do not include Mif2 or reveal only a peptide of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dendooven et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). Our results suggest that a substantial portion of CEN3 might be required to stably assemble Mif2 on the NCP.</p>
<p>It has not yet been possible to obtain structures of yeast NCPs wrapped in authentic CEN3 DNA without using some method to stabilize the NCPs. Guan and coworkers solved a structure of yeast centromeric CEN3 DNA-wrapped NCPs bound to a stabilizing antibody. This structure did not include inner kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Guan et al., 2021</xref>). Three structures of yeast NCPs bound to inner kinetochore components have also been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dendooven et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Guan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Yan et al., 2019</xref>), all of which relied either on W601 DNA or hybrid DNAs that contained six bp of CDEII, all of CDEIII, and sequences downstream of CDEIII. Here we describe a new chimera of CEN3 and W601 DNA (CCEN) that includes 35 bp of CDEII as well as all of CDEIII and the region downstream of CDEIII. CCEN stably wrapped yeast centromeric histone octamers and revealed new DNA sequence preferences not previously appreciated.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have developed a chimeric DNA sequence (CCEN) that represents an advance towards working with a more native-like recombinant kinetochore. Using centromeric nucleosomes wrapped with CCEN DNA, we have confirmed previous findings that OA and Mif2 can independently support recombinant kinetochore assembly. We showed previously that they can distinguish centromeric versus non-centromeric nucleosomes based on histone identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>). Here we provide the first evidence that OA also distinguishes between centromeric and non-centromeric nucleosomes on the basis of DNA sequence. We also show that Mif2 requires more than the DNA binding site identified by footprinting to display sequence preferences.</p>

Plasmid pAZ144 was derived from pSc_Mf_7, which expressed Mif2-linker-(27-392)MBP-6XHis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>). Agilent’s QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (product number: 210518) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to loop out the 6XHis tag from pSc_Mf_7 and to modify the C terminal end of the MBP tag to make it identical to the E. coli MBP protein. To this end amino acids GSSHHHHHH were removed and replaced with the native C terminal sequence of the E. coli MBP protein (QTRITK) resulting in a new coding sequence encoding Mif2-linker-(27-392)MBP. The forward and reverse primers used for this were GAAAGACGCGCAGACTCGTATTACCAAATAATAAACCAACTCCATAAGG and CCTTATGGAGTTGGTTTATTATTTGGTAATACGAGTCTGCGCGTCTTTC, respectively.

CCEN is 147 bp long and includes four elements: i) the first 62 bp of W601, ii) 35 bp of CDEII that includes the Mif2 footprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>), iii) the rest of the CBF 3 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Guan et al., 2021</xref>), which is all of CDEIII (25 bp) and 17 bp downstream of CDEIII, and iv) the last 8 bp of W601. (Note that the 48-bp CBF3 binding site overlaps with the last 6 bp of the Mif2 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Guan et al., 2021</xref>).) Of 5 CEN3-W601 chimeras tested, CCEN was the only one that included the Mif2 and CBF3 binding sites and stably wrapped centromeric histone octamers such that the nucleosomes could be further purified by size exclusion chromatography. Specifically, a construct containing only CEN3 did not stably wrap histone octamers in our hands.</p>

<title>NCP wrapping</title>
<p>Yeast histones were purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>). W601 DNA and CCEN DNA were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Mononucleosome core particles were reconstituted by the standard salt dialysis method as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Witus et al., 2023</xref>) with two exceptions. First, the nucleosomes contained <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> histones Cse4, H2A, H2B, and H4, the latter three were tagged with 6X-His. Second, the W601 DNA and histones were combined in a 1:1.80 molar ratio, while CCEN DNA and histones were combined in a 1:1.55 molar ratio. Nucleosomes were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a 24 ml Superdex 200 increase 10/300 column equilibrated in NCP storage buffer (30 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM TCEP). NCPs purified by size exclusion chromatography were stored on ice at 4°C and used within 5 days of purification.</p>

<title>Purification of Kinetochore Proteins</title>
<p>OA, Mif2, MIND, Ndc80c, and Dam1c were expressed as described with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, each complex was expressed from a polycistronic vector (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) in Rosetta 2 DE3 pLysS cells (Novagen). Cells were grown to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6 and induced with 0.3 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 16-18 hours at 18°C. After the induction period, cells were pelleted and washed with PBS containing 1 mM PMSF. Cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until purification.</p>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>MIND-FLAG</title>
<p>On the day of purification, cell pellets were resuspended in MIND-lysis buffer (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and cells were lysed using a French Press and lysates were cleared by high-speed centrifugation. The cleared lysate was incubated with 2 ml of MonoRab anti-DYKDDDDK Affinity Resin (L0076; GenScript) for 30 minutes. After the resin was washed with 10 column volumes of MIND-wash buffer (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), the immobilized protein was incubated for 30 min with MIND-elution buffer (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) containing 200 µg/mL 3x FLAG peptide (F4799; Sigma). Eluate from the anti-FLAG resin was collected and further purified by size exclusion chromatography in MIND-SEC buffer on a 120 mL Superdex 200 column (28-9893-35; GE Healthcare). Eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated if necessary using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (UFC805008; Millipore). Purified protein was stored in MIND-SEC buffer with 5% glycerol at -80°C. Protein concentration was measured via the bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher and Sigma Aldrich).</p>

<title>Optical Trap Assay</title>
<p>Slide preparation for the optical trap assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Flores et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>) with changes to the buffers listed below. 40 nM His6-NCPs and anti-His6 beads were incubated in bead incubation buffer (30 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM TCEP, 2 mg/mL <italic>κ</italic>-casein) for 30 min. All kinetochore proteins were diluted in a buffer containing 1x BRB80 (80 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA) and 2 mg/mL <italic>κ</italic>-casein before addition to the reaction mix. The reaction mix contained 1x BRB80, 1 mM GTP, 8 mg/mL BSA, 0.05 mg/mL biotinylated BSA, 0.8 mM DTT, 250 µg/mL glucose oxidase, 30 µg/mL catalase, 3.6 mg/mL glucose, and 16 µM tubulin in addition to the non-His6 tagged proteins free in solution. 10 nM OA or 20 nM Mif2, 10 nM 2D-MIND, 10 nM Ndc80c, and 5 nM Dam1c were used in the trapping assays. Optical trap assays were performed at room temperature using custom instrumentation to capture and manipulate beads as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Franck et al., 2010</xref>). Rupture force assays were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>). Once beads were bound to microtubule tips, a test force of 1 pN was applied, and only beads that tracked with ∼100 nm of tip growth were subjected to ramping force of 0.25 pNs until detachment. All attachments that withstood the 1 pN preload force were included in our analysis. Each slide was used to collect data for no more than 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Centromeres are specific sites on chromosomes that are essential for mitosis and genome fidelity. This <bold>valuable</bold> work extends previous studies to <bold>convincingly</bold> show that the centromere-histone core contributes to force transduction through the kinetochore. The centromere mainly strengthens one of the two paths of force transduction, influenced by the centromeric DNA sequence, the mechanism for which remains to be determined. This work will be of interest to those studying cell division and chromosome segregation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors address the role of the centromere histone core in force transduction by the kinetochore.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They use a hybrid DNA sequence that combines CDEII and CDEIII as well as Widom 601 so they can make stable histones for biophysical studies (provided by the Widom sequence) and maintain features of the centromere (CDE II and III).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main results are shown in one figure (Figure 2). Indeed the Centromere core of Widom and CDE II and III contribute to strengthening the binding force for the OA-beads. The data are very nicely done and convincingly demonstrate the point. The weakness is that this is the entire paper. It is certainly of interest to investigators in kinetochore biology, but beyond that, the impact is fairly limited in scope.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper provides a valuable addendum to the findings described in Hamilton et al. 2020 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/">https://doi.org/</ext-link> 10.7554/eLife.56582). In the earlier paper, the authors reconstituted the budding yeast centromeric nucleosome together with parts of the budding yeast kinetochore and tested which elements are required and sufficient for force transmission from microtubules to the nucleosome. Although budding yeast centromeres are defined by specific DNA sequences, this earlier paper did not use centromeric DNA but instead the generic Widom 601 DNA. The reason is that it has so far been impossible to stably reconstitute a budding yeast centromeric nucleosome using centromeric DNA.</p>
<p>In this new study, the authors now report that they were able to replace part of the Widom 601 DNA with centromeric DNA from chromosome 3. This makes the assay more closely resemble the in vivo situation. Interestingly, the presence of the centromeric DNA fragment makes one type of minimal kinetochore assembly, but not the other, withstand stronger forces.</p>
<p>Which kinetochore assembly turned out to be affected was somewhat unexpected, and can currently not be reconciled with structural knowledge of the budding yeast centromere/kinetochore. This highlights that, despite recent advances (e.g. Guan et al., 2021; Dendooven et al., 2023), aspects of budding yeast kinetochore architecture and function remain to be understood and that it will be important to dissect the contributions of the centromeric DNA sequence.</p>
<p>Given the unexpected result, the study would become yet more informative if the authors were able to pinpoint which interactions contribute to the enhanced force resistance in the presence of centromeric DNA.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The paper demonstrates that centromeric DNA can increase the attachment strength between budding yeast microtubules and centromeric nucleosomes.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>How centromeric DNA exerts this effect remains unclear.</p>

<p>This reviewer might have missed that this is a Research Advance, not an article.  Research Advances are limited in scope by definition and provide a new development that builds on research reported in a prior paper.  They can be of any length.  Our Research Advance builds on our prior work, Hamilton et al., 2020 and provides the new result that native centromere sequences strengthen the attachment of the kinetochore to the nucleosome.</p>
