<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>While it is accepted that Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)-mediated transfer of microRNAs contributes to intercellular communication, the knowledge about molecular mechanisms controlling the selective and dynamic miRNA-loading in EVs is still limited to few specific RNA-binding proteins interacting with sequence determinants. Moreover, although mutagenesis analysis demonstrated the presence/function of specific intracellular retention motifs, the interacting protein/s remained unknown.</p>
<p>Here, PCBP2 was identified as a direct interactor of an intracellular retention motif: CLIP coupled to RNA pull down and proteomic analysis demonstrated that it binds to miRNAs embedding this motif and mutagenesis proved the binding specificity. Notably, PCBP2 binding requires SYNCRIP, a previously characterized miRNA EV-loader as indicated by SYNCRIP knock-down.</p>
<p>SYNCRIP and PCBP2 may contemporarily bind to miRNAs as demonstrated by EMSA assays and PCBP2 knock-down causes EV-loading of intracellular microRNAs.</p>
<p>This evidence highlights that multiple proteins/miRNA interactions govern miRNA compartmentalization and identifies PCBP2 as a dominant inhibitor of SYNCRIP function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) budding from cellular plasma membrane and differing for size and origin (e.g. exosomes, of 30-150 nm diameter and microvesicles, which diameter is ≥ 50 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) are uptaken by neighboring as well as by distant recipient cells thus transferring their specific informational cargo of molecules. Indeed, EVs are now considered a well assessed route for donor cells to promote changes in gene expression and cell behavior of recipient cells in several pathophysiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Notably, concerning miRNAs, the EV-cargo does not simply reflect the cell of origin content, but rather is defined by dynamic and selective cell-specific loading mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The existence of multiple players controlling miRNA compartmentalization matches with the hypothesis of a multiprotein machinery that dynamically governs not only the EV sorting but also, conceivably, the intracellular retention of specific subsets of miRNAs.</p>
<p>At present, the molecular players controlling the selective partition of miRNAs seems largely uncharacterized although recent evidence highlighted mechanisms of EV-loading depending on sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). On this regard, the first identified was the Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1), recognizing miRNAs containing the EXO motif (G/U,G,A/G/C,G/C) and guiding their inclusion in EVs secreted by human primary T-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). A functional role was successively attributed to the Synaptotagmin-binding Cytoplasmic RNA-Interacting Protein (SYNCRIP or hnRNPQ) that, by binding to miRNAs embedding a short hEXO motif (G/A/U,G/U/A,G/A/U,C/A/G,U/A,G/C) through its NURR domain and its RRMs recognizing the 5’ of the motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), guides their inclusion in EVs secreted by hepatocytes. Notably, hEXO was shown to increase the EV/cell ratio of miRNAs as demonstrated by the insertion of this sequence in a cell-retained miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) thus paving the way for further manipulative perspectives in the growing field of RNA-based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, similar functional evidence gathered by the chimeric approach has been extended to newly identified motifs, causing miRNAs export or intracellular retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). While for these export motifs two RNA-binding proteins (ALYREF and FUS) have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) for the retention motifs, defined as “CELL” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), as for the previously described “CL” motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) the identification of interacting protein/s remains unaddressed.</p>
<p>We here aimed at the investigation of molecular players responsible for miRNAs intracellular retention. Overall, we gathered evidence on the interactions among several CELL-embedding miRNAs and two RBPs: SYNCRIP and the multifunctional RNA-binding protein PCBP2. Functionally, PCBP2 promotes cellular retention in SYNCRIP-bound miRNAs and the already described SYNCRIP loading activity appears impeded by PCBP2.</p>

<title>PCBP2 recognizes a CELL motif and has a functional role in intracellular retention of miRNA-155-3p</title>

<p>Label-free nLC-MS/MS proteomic analysis allowed to identify miR-155-3p-interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Supplementary Data File 1</xref>) and Label-free quantification intensities analysis identified 21 proteins enriched in miR-155-3p pulldown with respect to miR-155-3p mutated in the Core CELL motif (miR-155-3p no-CELL) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Supplementary Data File 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Twelve of them are classified as RNA-binding proteins, with six containing at least one canonical RNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Supplementary Data File 2</xref>). For three of them, RNA-binding preferences are also known (i.e. PCBP2 prefers CU-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), LARP1 recognizes the CAP and the 5’ top motif in mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and STAU1 binds to double-stranded RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>)).</p>
<p>Among them, PCBP2 interaction with miR-155-3p was confirmed by CLIP assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel) and RNA pull-down followed by western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). A second proof of concept of the requirement of PCBP2/CELL motif interaction is provided by the observation on the CELL motif-devoid miR-365-2-5p (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, middle panel); RNA pull-down confirmed the absence of interaction with PCBP2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, the inclusion of the Core CELL motif while maintaining SYNCRIP binding, allows PCBP2 interaction with this miRNA. At least <italic>in vitro</italic>, this binding appears direct and sequence specific as demonstrated using a recombinant protein in RNA pull-down (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The introduction of specific mutations allowed to test the requirement of the CELL motif since its modification (miR-155-3p no-CELL) impairs PCBP2 binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, the inspection of the miR-155-3p sequence revealed the presence of the previously identified SYNCRIP binding site and both MS/MS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Supplementary Data File 1</xref>) and CLIP assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) confirmed SYNCRIP binding to this miRNA independently of the CELL motif mutation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the permutation of the downstream two nucleotides removing SYNCRIP-binding motif (miR-155-3p no-hEXO, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) impairs PCBP2 binding despite the conservation of the CELL retention motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>This suggests a possible SYNCRIP requirement for PCBP2 binding. To test this hypothesis, CLIP assay was performed on miR-31-3p, embedding the sole CELL motif, indicating the absence of PCBP2 binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, right panel).</p>
<p>Functionally, the role of PCBP2 in miRNA partition was addressed by its silencing (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref> and B). Notably, PCBP2 interference (PCBP2 being not expressed in the EVs, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>) enhances miRNA-155-3p loading in EVs with respect to control cell-derived EVs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, left panel). As a further control that miRNAs without the CELL motif are not affected by PCBP2 silencing, the expression levels of miR-365-2-5p (embedding the sole hEXO motif) were analyzed in EVs and cells, and resulted not differentially exported (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, middle panel). As expected SYNCRIP silencing (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1C-D</xref>) (expressed in both intracellular and EV compartment as shown in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>) reduces miR-155-3p export into EVs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, right panel); (for EVs characterization see <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2 A</xref> and B). Moreover, the effect of either PCBP2 or SYNCRIP knockdown on EVs production was ruled out by quantifying the number of EVs per cell in shPCBP2 or shSYNCRIP with respect to the shCTR conditions (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2 C</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these data demonstrated that <italic>i)</italic> PCBP2 interacts with miRNA-155-3p, as proved by CLIP analysis and RNA pull-down, <italic>ii)</italic> the interaction is CELL-motif-dependent while an unexpected role for the hEXO motif is also unveiled and <italic>iii)</italic> PCBP2 favors the intracellular localization of this miRNA.</p>

<title>PCBP2 binding to miR-155-3p is both sequence- and SYNCRIP-dependent</title>

<p>To challenge the hypothesis of a SYNCRIP-dependent PCBP2 binding, EMSA assay was performed in PCBP2-silenced and in SYNCRIP-silenced cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A, B, C and D</xref> respectively).

<p>Then, the functional role of PCBP2 was assessed by means of qRT-PCR performed on 9 miRNAs expressed in EVs and embedding both CELL and hEXO motifs (see Methods section) in comparison to 4 miRNAs embedding either the CELL (miR-31-3p, miR-195a-5p, miR-421-3p) or the hEXO motif (miR-365-2-5p) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, miR-155-5p, miR-181d-5p, miR-3084-5p, miR-122b-3p, miR-192-5p, miR-26b-3p, miR-31-3p, miR-195a-5p and miR-421-3p have the Core CELL motif (AUUA/G) described by Garcia-Martin and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Other miRNAs (miR-345-3p, miR-23a-5p and miR-214-3p) share the described CELL motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) with the most frequent nucleotides, considering also the reported variability. Regarding the hEXO motif described by Santangelo and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), the most frequent nucleotides defining the motif sequence have been taken into consideration.</p>
<p>In order to consider the possible impact of PCBP2 on miRNAs steady state level (resulting from variation in transcription and biogenesis), miRNA abundance in EVs and in the intracellular compartment was analyzed by qRT-PCR as EVs/cell ratio. Results indicate that PCBP2 silencing releases a SYNCRIP-dependent loading of miRNAs in the EVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) thus highlighting a dominant PCBP2 cell-retention function on SYNCRIP-dependent export, evaluated on these miRNAs in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>.</p>
<p>Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the PCBP2-dependent cell-retained miRNAs targets have been performed (including both validated and predicted targets, respectively obtained from TarBase v9.0 database and DIANA-microT web server). As reported in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and in the <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>, this analysis highlighted several biological pathways collectively influenced by these miRNAs (e.g. establishment of organelle localization, regulation of cell cycle and lymphocyte differentiation).</p>
<p>To preliminarily explore the functional impact of EVs deriving from WT and PCPB2-silenced cells, treatment of leukocytes obtained from C57BL/6J mice livers has been performed.</p>
<p>Specifically, as reported in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>, T cells, NK cells and myeloid cells show a higher amount of IFN-γ production upon shPCBP2 EVs treatment in comparison to the shCTR EVs; this suggests that PCBP2 silencing results in an EV-mediated modulation of the immune response.</p>
<p>With respect to the molecular mechanism, the analysis by CLIP-qPCR assay demonstrates the PCBP2 binding to miRs-345-3p, 23a-5p, 214-3p, 155-5p, 181d-5p, 3084-5p, 122b-3p, 192-5p, 26b-3p that bear both the CELL and hEXO motifs; conversely, the presence of either the sole hEXO (miR-365-2-5p) or the sole CELL (miR-31-3p, miR-195a-5p, miR-421-3p) does not allow PCBP2 binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). As expected, the presence of hEXO motif alone or in combination with the CELL motif is sufficient for SYNCRIP binding to all the analyzed miRNAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main finding of this investigation is the identification of PCBP2 as a new regulator of miRNA partition between intracellular and EV compartments. Evidence here gathered indicates that: <italic>i)</italic> PCBP2 binding requires both the miRNA CELL sequence and the RBP SYNCRIP, which in turn recognizes its specific hEXO <italic>consensus</italic>; in other words, SYNCRIP binding is a prerequisite for PCBP2 recruitment; <italic>ii)</italic> PCBP2 cell retention function is dominant over the SYNCRIP-dependent EV-loading; in other word PCBP2 impairs SYNCRIP-mediated miRNA export (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<p>While SYNCRIP EV-loading activity has been previously well characterized by means of both functional and structural analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), the role of PCBP2 as mediator of miRNA intracellular retention is here disclosed for the first time.</p>
<p>Indeed, no data were previously reported on the RBPs involved in miRNA cell retention even if the role of specific <italic>consensus</italic> sequences has been previously defined by means of functional assays involving introduction/removal of the CELL motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>PCBP2 protein (similarly to SYNCRIP) displays a pleiotropic function; specifically, it is a well-characterized member of the Poly-rC-binding proteins (PCBPs), a group of multifunctional RNA-binding proteins that contain three highly conserved RNA binding KH domains and that may shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). A large body of evidence points to its role in controlling multiple processes including RNA maturation and trafficking, RNA editing, translational activation or repression and mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>
<p>Its potential impact on miRNA biogenesis suggested us to analyze miRNA partition as the EVs/cell ratio thus circumventing variation deriving from the intracellular expression levels.</p>
<p>Here, PCBP2 was found to directly bind to miRNAs, sharing one of the CELL-motifs previously identified by <italic>in silico</italic> sequence analysis of the miRNAs that were retained in AML12 mouse hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The use of specific insertion/removal mutants and knock-down cellular systems here highlighted the SYNCRIP recruitment as a prerequisite for PCBP2 binding, this verified on miRs-155-3p, 26b-3p and 31-3p. Furthermore, this conclusion was extended by CLIP analysis to further 9 miRs selected on the basis of an NGS approach and of a bioinformatic analysis.</p>
<p>Of note, among them, miRs-155-3p, 23a-5p, 155-5p, 192-5p and 26b-3p display important EV-mediated functions in relation to pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), as also assessed by Gene Ontology analysis.</p>
<p>The here proposed mechanism implies that the export activity of SYNCRIP is specifically impaired by PCBP2 and highlights that the miRNA partition is not only related to the presence of specific RBPs/export sequences interaction. The final functional compartmentalization output appears the result of an integrated system of RNA/proteins interactions, here only partially unveiled, whose dynamics may provide elements for the explanation of the EVs miRNA cargo specificity and for its variation coherently to cellular plasticity.</p>
<p>In addition, it is conceivable to hypothesize that previously identified domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), shall mediate the protein-protein interaction dynamics between PCBP2 and SYNCRIP, impacting RBP-miRNAs recognition. Moreover, upon the interaction among SYNCRIP and the miRNAs a topological switch may occur, impacting the affinity of PCBP2 for the same miRNAs.</p>
<p>Of note, recent research highlights a further level of complexity since miRNA epitranscriptomic modifications, while impairing miRNA intracellular function, appear instrumental to miRNA loading in EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>The described multiple RNA/proteins interactions provide a further step in the process of clarification of the mechanisms that may yield value in the control of cellular communication in pathophysiological processes. Functionally, the effect of PCBP2 silenced cells-derived EVs on the immune response evaluated as IFN-γ production suggests modulation on functional states of recipient target cells. The knowledge of molecular players of miRNAs intracellular/EVs partition could be soon instrumental for the development of RNA-based manipulations holding therapeutic perspectives.</p>

Lysates were incubated on a rotating platform for 2h at 4°C and then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined with Protein Assay Dye Reagent (Bio-Rad), based on the Bradford assay.</p>
<p>2 mg of proteins (one for the specific antibody and one for the corresponding aspecific IgG) were precleared adding 40 µL of Protein A Sepharose or Protein G Sepharose (GE HealthCare) for 3 hrs at 4°C in a total volume of 1 ml of IP Lysis Buffer in rotation. Then, Protein A or G Sepharose was removed by centrifugation and the extracts were incubated with 5 µg of specific antibody α-PCBP2 (cod. RN025P - MBL), SYNCRIP (MAB11004, Merck-Millipore), Normal Rabbit IgG (12-370-Millipore) or Normal Mouse IgG (12-371-Millipore), the last two used as negative controls, to proceed with immunoprecipitation at 4°C overnight. Immuno-complexes were collected adding 50 µL of Protein A or G Sepharose for 3 hrs at 4°C in rotation. The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with Net Gel Buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40 and 0.25% gelatin) and once with RIPA Buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0,5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0,1% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8). Finally, immunoprecipitated proteins were detached from Sepharose beads by adding 50 µL of Laemli Buffer 2X. Samples were boiled at 95°C for 5 min, beads were eliminated by centrifugation and 10% of input sample and 50% of each immunoprecipitated sample were loaded on polyacrilammide gel and analyzed by Western Blotting.</p>

<title>Small RNA Sequencing</title>
<p>miRNA samples (two biological replicates per condition), to which the cel-miR-39 Spike-In (59000; NORGEN) was previously added, were sequenced at Procomcure Biotech GmbH. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEXTFLEX Small RNA-Seq Kit v4 (PerkinElmer). The sequencing reaction was performed on an llumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument in 2×40bp paired-end configuration, with a throughput of ∼40 million read pairs per sample. FastqToolkit version 2.2.5 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/informatics-products/basespace-sequence-hub/apps/fastq-toolkit.html">https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/informatics-products/basespace-sequence-hub/apps/fastq-toolkit.html</ext-link>) was used to remove adapter sequences from the 3’ end and to filter out reads whose length and average quality after trimming were &lt; 10 and &lt; 30, respectively. Only forward reads were kept for downstream analyses. The mirPRo software version 1.1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) which utilizes NovoAlign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) as its alignment engine, was used to align reads to a reference composed of miRNA hairpin sequences downloaded from miRBase v22.1 database with the addition of the spike-in, and to count reads mapping to mature miRNAs. A count matrix was assembled, including only mature miRNAs with one or more reads in at least two cell and two EV samples. Differential abundance analysis was performed using the DESeq2 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Size factors were estimated directly from spike-in counts. For each mature miRNA, a likelihood ratio test was conducted to assess differences between the EV/cell abundance ratios measured in the shPCBP2 and shCTR conditions.</p>

<title>Ex vivo Analysis</title>
<p>Female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River and were of 12- to 14-weeks old by the time of use weighing 20–25 g. All animals were housed in ventilated cages (no more than 5 mice per cage) under specific pathogen-free conditions and in a controlled environment (12-h daylight cycle, lights off at 18:00) with free access to food and water. Livers were dissected from mice, smashed using PBS and strained (100-µm filter). Leukocytes, enriched using 40% Percoll, were plated at a concentration of 1×10<sup>6</sup>/ml in complete RPMI, and supplemented with EVs-free 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS), 100U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine and with 20ng/mL recombinant murine IL-2 (Peprotech) and 20ng/mL recombinant murine IL-7 (Peprotech) at 37°C under 5% CO2. Leukocytes were cultured either alone or in the presence of 10 μg/mL control EVs or with the same amount of shPCBP2 EVs for 24 hours at 37°C under 5% CO2. Brefeldin A 5 μg/mL (Merck Life Sciences) was added in the last 3 hrs of treatment.</p>
<p>Cells were stained for cell surface markers using the following antibodies: anti-CD45.2-PercP-Cy5.5 (clone 194, Invitrogen); anti-NK1.1-PE (clone PK136, Invitrogen); anti-CD11b-BV421 (clone M1/70, Biolegend); anti-CD3-BV510 (clone 145-2C11, Biolegend) and APC-H7-conjugated Fixable viability Dye (Thermo Scientific) to identify dead cells. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) before intracellular staining with anti-IFN-γ-APC (clone XMG1.2, Biolegend). Samples were acquired by FacsCantoII and Flow cytometric analysis was performed with FlowJo 10 software (BD Bioscience). Live/dead(L/D)-/CD45.2+ cells were gated and then segregated into NK1.1<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>, NK1.1<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>, NK1.1<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>-</sup> CD3<sup>+</sup> cells to discriminate NK cells, myeloid cells and T cells, respectively. These gated cells were then analyzed for the expression of IFN-γ as reported in <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>.</p>
<p>Animal studies were conducted in accordance with all relevant ethical regulations for animal testing and research including the Italian code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes.</p>

<p>In this study, Marocco and colleagues perform a deep characterization of the complex molecular mechanism guiding the recognition of a particular CELLmotif previously identified in hepatocytes in another publication. Having miR-155-3p with or without this CELLmotif as initial focus, the authors identify 21 proteins differentially binding to these two miRNA versions. From these, they decided to focus on PCBP2. They elegantly demonstrate PCBP2 binding to miR-155-3p WT version but not to the CELLmotif-mutated version. miR-155-3p contains a hEXOmotif identified in a different report, whose recognition is largely mediated by another RNA-binding protein called SYNCRIP. Interestingly, mutation of the hEXOmotif contained in miR-155-3p did not only blunt SYNCRIP binding, but also PCBP2 binding despite the maintenance of the CELLmotif. This indicates that somehow SYNCRIP binding is a prerequisite for PCBP2 binding. EMSA assay confirms that SYNCRIP is necessary for PCBP2 binding to miR-155-3p, while PCBP2 is not needed for SYNCRIP binding. The authors aim to extend these findings to other miRNAs containing both motifs. For that, they perform a small-RNA-Seq of EVs released from cells knockdown for PCBP2 versus control cells, identifying a subset of miRNAs whose expression either increases or decreases. The assumption is that those miRNAs containing PCBP2-binding CELLmotif should now be less retained in the cell and go more to extracellular vesicles, thus reflecting a higher EV expression. The specific subset of miRNAs having both the CELLmotif and hEXOmotif (9 miRNAs) whose expressions increase in EVs due to PCBP2 reduction is also affected by knocking down SYNCRIP in the sense that reduction of SYNCRIP leads to lower EV sorting. Further experiments confirm that PCBP2 and SYNCRIP bind to these 9 miRNAs and that knocking down SYNCRIP impairs their EV sorting.</p>

<p>The author of this manuscript aimed to uncover the mechanisms behind miRNA retention within cells. They identified PCBP2 as a crucial factor in this process, revealing a novel role for RNA-binding proteins. Additionally, the study discovered that SYNCRIP is essential for PCBP2's function, demonstrating the cooperative interaction between these two proteins. This research not only sheds light on the intricate dynamics of miRNA retention but also emphasizes the importance of protein interactions in regulating miRNA behavior within cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper makes important progress in understanding how miRNAs are kept inside cells. It identifies PCBP2 as a key player in this process, showing a new role for proteins that bind RNA. The study also finds that SYNCRIP is needed for PCBP2 to work, highlighting how these proteins work together.

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, Marocco and colleages perform a deep characterization of the complex molecular mechanism guiding the recognition of a particular CELLmotif previously identified in hepatocytes in another publication. Having miR-155-3p with or without this CELLmotif as initial focus, authors identify 21 proteins differentially binding to these two miRNA versions. From these, they decided to focus on PCBP2. They elegantly demonstrate PCBP2 binding to miR-155-3p WT version but not to CELLmotif-mutated version. miR-155-3p contains a hEXOmotif identified in a different report, whose recognition is largely mediated by another RNA-binding protein called SYNCRIP. Interestingly, mutation of the hEXOmotif contained in miR-155-3p did not only blunt SYNCRIP binding, but also PCBP2 binding despite the maintenance of the CELLmotif. This indicates that somehow SYNCRIP binding is a pre-requisite for PCBP2 binding. EMSA assay confirms that SYNCRIP is necessary for PCBP2 binding to miR-155-3p, while PCBP2 is not needed for SYNCRIP binding. Then authors aim to extend these finding to other miRNAs containing both motifs. For that, they perform a small-RNA-Seq of EVs released from cells knockdown for PCBP2 versus control cells, identifying a subset of miRNAs whose expression either increases or decreases. The assumption is that those miRNAs containing PCBP2-binding CELLmotif should now be less retained in the cell and go more to extracellular vesicles, thus reflecting a higher EV expression. The specific subset of miRNAs having both the CELLmotif and hEXOmotif (9 miRNAs) whose expressions increase in EVs due to PCBP2 reduction is also affected by knocking-down SYNCRIP in the sense that reduction of SYNCRIP leads to lower EV sorting. Further experiments confirm that PCBP2 and SYNCRIP bind to these 9 miRNAs and that knocking down SYNCRIP impairs their EV sorting.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have addressed most of my concerns and questions. I believe the new experiments provide stronger support for their claims. My only remaining concern is the lack of clarity in the replicates for the EMSA experiment. The one shown in the manuscript is clear; however, the other three replicates hardly show that knocking down SYNCRIP has an effect on PCBP2 binding. Even worse is the fact that these replicates do not support at all that PCBP2 silencing has no effect on SYNCRIP binding, as the bands for those types of samples are, in most of the cases, not visible. I think the authors should work on repeating a couple of times EMSA experiment.</p>

<p>We thank this Reviewer for having appreciated the novelty and the robustness of our data. In accordance with the Reviewer’s concern, we repeated the EMSA assay, specifically to address the PCBP2-independent SYNCRIP binding. In Author response image 1, we report the new EMSA replicates (top), the quantification of each signal (bottom) and the mean of EMSA signals relative to the three independent experiments (right). We hope that the new evidence will meet the required standards.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The author of this manuscript aimed to uncover the mechanisms behind miRNA retention within cells. They identified PCBP2 as a crucial factor in this process, revealing a novel role for RNAbinding proteins. Additionally, the study discovered that SYNCRIP is essential for PCBP2's function, demonstrating the cooperative interaction between these two proteins. This research not only sheds light on the intricate dynamics of miRNA retention but also emphasizes the importance of protein interactions in regulating miRNA behavior within cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper makes important progress in understanding how miRNAs are kept inside cells. It identifies PCBP2 as a key player in this process, showing a new role for proteins that bind RNA. The study also finds that SYNCRIP is needed for PCBP2 to work, highlighting how these proteins work together. These discoveries not only improve our knowledge of miRNA behavior but also suggest new ways to develop treatments by controlling miRNA locations to influence cell communication in diseases. The use of liver cell models and thorough experiments ensures the results are reliable and show their potential for RNA-based therapies</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-structured and presents compelling data, but I noticed a few minor corrections that could further enhance its clarity:</p>
<p>Figure References: In the response to Reviewer 1, the comment states, &quot;It's not Panel C, it's Panel A of Figure 1&quot;-this should be cross-checked for consistency.</p>
<p>Supplementary Figure 2 is labeled as &quot;Panel A&quot;-please verify if additional panels (B, C, etc.) are intended.</p>
<p>Western Blot Quality: The Alix WB shows some background noise. A repeat with optimized conditions (or inclusion of a cleaner replicate) would strengthen the data. Adding statistical analysis for all WBs would also reinforce robustness.</p>
<p>These are relatively small refinements, and the manuscript is already in excellent shape. With these adjustments, it will be even stronger.</p>

<p>We deeply thank this Reviewer for having considered this new version of the manuscript and for having described its shape as excellent. In order to address the Reviewer’s concerns, we crosschecked the consistency of the described figures’ panels described in the text accordingly. Regarding the qualitative analysis of EV markers, we repeated the western blot analysis with optimized conditions as suggested and included the new panel (Author response image 2) in the supplementary figure 2, allowing to appreciate the signal relative to ALIX expression.</p>
