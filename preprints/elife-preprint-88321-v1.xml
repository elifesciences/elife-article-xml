<title>Abstract</title><p>Sensory signals are processed by the cerebellum to coordinate movements. Numerous cerebellar functions are thought to require the maintenance of a sensory representation that extends beyond the input signal. Granule cells receive sensory input, but they do not prolong the signal and are thus unlikely to maintain a sensory representation for much longer than the inputs themselves. Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons that project to granule cells and transform sensory input into prolonged increases or decreases in firing, depending on their ON or OFF UBC subtype. Further extension and diversification of the input signal could be produced by UBCs that project to one another, but whether this circuitry exists is unclear. Here we test whether UBCs innervate one another and explore how these small networks of UBCs could transform spiking patterns. We characterized two transgenic mouse lines electrophysiologically and immunohistochemically to confirm that they label ON and OFF UBC subtypes and crossed them together, revealing that ON and OFF UBCs innervate one another. A Brainbow reporter was used to label UBCs of the same ON or OFF subtype with different fluorescent proteins, which showed that UBCs innervate their own subtypes as well. Computational models predict that these feed-forward networks of UBCs extend the length of bursts or pauses and introduce delays—transformations that may be necessary for cerebellar functions from modulation of eye movements to adaptive learning across time scales.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>The cerebellum is essential for the accurate performance of behaviors ranging in complexity from stabilizing an image on the retina to playing a piano or performing a gymnastics routine. Cerebellar dysfunction disrupts the ability to produce smooth movements and leads to a disorder called ataxia. Damage to the vestibular cerebellum occurs in various disorders including medulloblastoma and leads to nystagmus, involuntary movements of the eyes that prevent normal vision. Treating disorders of motor control such as nystagmus, requires a better understanding of how representations of movements are maintained in the firing patterns of neurons in the cerebellar circuit. Here we use transgenic mice to label a type of neuron called the unipolar brush cell and revealed that these cells innervate one another and are likely to increase the length and diversity of spiking patterns in the cerebellum. These transformations may be necessary for numerous functions from controlling eye movements to learning new behaviors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Head movement signals are encoded by the firing rate of vestibular afferents that project to the cerebellum and brainstem. The vestibular nuclei maintain a sensory representation of the head movement for tens of seconds after the vestibular signal ends through a mechanism called velocity storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernandez and Goldberg, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Raphan et al., 1979</xref>). The cerebellum dynamically modulates the activity of the cells that encode velocity storage to control vestibular responses such as compensatory eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yakushin et al., 2017</xref>). It is unclear how the cerebellar circuit maintains a representation of a head movement long after the firing of the afferents cease.</p>
<p>Granule cells receive direct input from vestibular afferents, but cannot maintain the signal long enough to underlie velocity storage, because they produce only transient firing responses. The only other excitatory neuron type in the cerebellar cortex that could provide feed-forward excitation to prolong the signal to granule cells is the unipolar brush cell (UBC). UBCs are powerful circuit elements that amplify their input signals by extending them in time and projecting them to numerous granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berthie and Axelrad, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mugnaini et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nunzi et al., 2001</xref>). UBCs receive direct input from vestibular afferents, produce long duration spiking responses, and could therefore contribute to the maintenance of a sensory representation necessary to modulate low-frequency vestibular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balmer and Trussell, 2019</xref>). Although a single UBC can prolong its input for seconds, multiple UBCs connected in series could extend the signal much further. Indeed, there is some evidence suggesting that UBCs provide direct synaptic input to other UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Diño et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nunzi and Mugnaini, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to prolonging signals, UBCs may play important roles in diversifying granule cell firing patterns, which is essential for expansion recoding models of cerebellar learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ito, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). This diversity in UBC responses is due to different subtypes of UBCs that can be classified by their expression of specific proteins or neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nunzi et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sekerkova et al., 2014</xref>) or by their electrophysiological response to synaptic stimulation: ON UBCs that express mGluR1 are excited by glutamate and OFF UBCs that express calretinin are inhibited by glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>). Whether UBCs target UBCs of their own subtype, the other, or both, remains unclear, and is necessary to understand how sensory signals are extended and diversified in the granule cell layer.</p>
<p>The connectivity of different types of UBCs is difficult to address. Paired electrophysiological recordings of synaptically connected UBCs are not feasible because of their long axons and their relative scarcity among the granule cells. Labeling UBCs of the same type with a single fluorophore provides ambiguous results-the axon terminals of UBCs look similar to UBC dendritic brushes, so a UBC axon contacting a dendritic brush of the same color would appear essentially identical to a large brush. We overcame this challenge by utilizing a Brainbow approach and by combining mouse lines to label UBC subtypes with different fluorescent proteins. We find that all UBC connectivity patterns are present and develop computational models to simulate how these feed-forward circuits dynamically transform their inputs. Interconnected UBCs prolong and diversify input spiking patterns by producing an extended burst (ON to ON), extended pause (ON to OFF), pause after a delay (OFF to ON), or burst after a delay (OFF to OFF). Thus, UBCs connected in series increase the computational power of the circuit and could underlie mechanisms of cerebellar function that require transmission delays or prolonged activity.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological responses of GRP and P079 UBCs reveal that they are ON and OFF UBC subtypes</title>
<p>To label a population of UBCs that are excited by glutamate (ON UBCs), we used a mouse line that expressed Cre recombinase (Cre) under the control of the GRP (gastrin releasing peptide) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>), a promoter that had been reported to be active in mGluR1-expressing (mGluR1(+)) UBCs in a similar mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). We crossed the GRP-Cre mouse to a tdTomato reporter (Ai9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>) and targeted fluorescently labeled UBCs for whole-cell recording in acute brain slices (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The white matter of lobe X was stimulated with an extracellular electrode to evoke synaptic currents.</p>

<p>Synaptic stimulation evoked fast EPSCs and a slow inward current that began at the end of stimulation at higher frequencies, which is diagnostic of ON UBCs (n = 15) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In current-clamp recordings, synaptic stimulation produced a burst of action potentials in GRP UBCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). These currents were produced by both mGluR1 and AMPA receptors, as they were blocked by their antagonists JNJ16259685 and GYKI53655, respectively (92.86% ± 3.25; paired t-test; P=0.0066; n = 9; mean ± SEM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D-E</xref>). While the two drugs together blocked most of the inward current (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>), their individual contribution ranged widely in different cells (3-70% for JNJ16259685 and 30-100% for GYKI53655). This indicates that GRP UBCs are ON UBCs and their synaptic input varies from being mediated mainly by mGluR1 to being entirely mediated by AMPA receptors.</p>
<p>Using the same approach, we tested the response to synaptic stimulation in a population of UBCs that expressed mCitrine in a mouse line (P079) that was generated in an enhancer trap forward genetic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shima et al., 2016</xref>). In all P079 UBCs recorded, a train of synaptic stimulation evoked a slow outward current (n = 12). Faster rates of synaptic stimulation produced larger outward currents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). These outward currents hyperpolarized the cells and produced a pause in spontaneous spiking activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). The outward current was mediated by mGluR2 receptors, as it was blocked by the mGluR2 antagonist LY341495 (96.53% ± 1.79; paired t-test; P=0.0033; mean ± SEM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H-I</xref>). These electrophysiological characteristics confirm that the P079 UBCs that can be visualized in acute brains slices are OFF UBCs.</p>
<p>The slow postsynaptic currents were inward in every GRP UBCs and outward in every P079 UBC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1J</xref>). The capacitance of GRP UBCs was less than half that of P079 UBCs, which suggests that the membrane area of the OFF UBCs is greater (GRP UBCs: 11.03 pF ± 0.64, n = 13; P079 UBCs: 26.07 pF ± 7.53, n = 12; t-test; P&lt;0.0001; mean ± SEM; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1K</xref>). We did not observe a significant difference in input resistance between the two cell types (GRP UBCs: 0.54 GΩ ± 0.04, n = 8; P079 UBCs: 0.64 GΩ ± 0.087, n = 10; t-test; P = 0.36; mean ± SEM; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1L</xref>). Current steps were injected into both types of UBCs to characterize their excitability. There was a significant interaction between the UBC type and response to current steps (mixed model ANOVA, P&lt;0.0001, n = 17). GRP UBCs had a higher firing rate in response to the same level of injected current compared to P079 UBCs, despite their similar input resistance, suggesting that GRP ON UBCs are more excitable and can fire at faster rates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1M</xref>). In summary, electrophysiological recordings from GRP and P079 UBCs confirm that they are ON and OFF UBC subtypes.</p>

<title>GRP and P079 UBCs are distinct subpopulations that differ in size and distribution</title>
<p>Besides the functional differences in the GFP and mCitrine-expressing UBCs outlined above, these neurons also showed significant differences in size and distribution. Crossing the GRP-Cre/Ai9 mice with the P079 mice resulted in triple transgenic mice that expressed tdTomato and mCitrine in almost entirely separate subpopulations of UBCs—only 3 out of 944 UBCs that were labeled expressed both fluorescent proteins. GRP and P079 UBCs were present in the lobes of the cerebellar vermis in different densities (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). More GRP UBCs than P079 UBCs were present in lobes VI-IX, with few of either type in lobes II-V. The highest density of both UBC types was in lobe X, which is where we focused the following analyses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). UBCs have convoluted dendritic brushes that are similar in appearance to their axon terminals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>GRP UBCs have been reported to have smaller somas than UBCs that express calretinin (calretinin(+)), a calcium-binding protein that labels the OFF UBC population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>). We found that the cross-sectional area of GRP UBCs was significantly smaller than that of P079 UBCs (GRP: 68.75 ± 9.69 µm<sup>2</sup>, mean ± SD, n = 92; P079: 74.47 ± 12.53 µm<sup>2</sup>, mean ± SD, n = 114, t-test, P = 0.0004), which is consistent with our electrophysiological analysis of their membrane capacitance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). The distribution of GRP and P079 UBCs also supports their identity as ON and OFF UBCs, as the density of mGluR1(+) ON UBCs is higher in the dorsal leaflet of lobe X and the density of calretinin(+) OFF UBCs is higher in the ventral leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nunzi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sekerkova et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>GRP UBCs are a subset of mGluR1(+) UBCs</title>
<p>Somatodendritic expression of mGluR1 and calretinin defines two separate populations of UBCs (termed Type II and type I respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nunzi et al., 2002</xref>)) and correspond to the functionally-defined ON and OFF subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>). To investigate the expression of mGluR1 and calretinin in GRP and P079 UBCs, we immunohistochemically labeled, imaged, and counted UBCs in both ventral and dorsal areas of lobe X in 4-8 brain slices from triple transgenic mice (n = 4 mice). We found that 98.1% (155/158) of the GRP/Ai9 UBCs expressed mGluR1 in their dendritic brushes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A-B</xref>). The GRP/Ai9/mGluR1(+) population represented 20.9% (155/741) of the total population of mGluR1(+) UBCs. 0/149 GRP/Ai9 UBCs expressed calretinin in a separate series of slices (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C-D</xref>). Thus, the GRP line labels about 1/5<sup>th</sup> of the ON UBCs and does not label OFF UBCs.</p>

<title>P079 mouse line drives mCitrine expression in the majority of calretinin(+) UBCs</title>
<p>Using the same triple transgenic mice and immunohistochemical approach described above, 92.2% (284/308) of the P079 UBCs were calretinin(+) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C-D</xref>). The P079 UBCs represent 70.5% (284/403) of the total calretinin(+) population. We were surprised to find, however, that 61.3% (200/326) of the P079 UBCs appeared mGluR1(+). This represents 27.0% (200/741) of the total mGluR1(+) population. These P079/mGluR1(+) UBCs could be differentiated from P079/mGluR1(-) UBCs by their lower expression of mCitrine: the relative labeling intensity of the mGluR1(+) P079 UBCs, after amplification with an anti-GFP antibody, was less than half of the more common mGluR1(-) P079 UBCs (43.2% soma pixel intensity relative to mGluR1(-) P079 UBCs, n = 34 z-planes with at least one of each type, t-test, P = 8.403e-6). In addition, the cross-sectional area of the mGluR1(+) P079 somas was 60.62 ± 13.67 µm<sup>2</sup>, mean ± SD, n = 52 and significantly smaller than the mGluR1(-) P079 somas (72.48 ± 16.90 µm<sup>2</sup> mean ± SD, n = 40, t-test, P = 0.00035). It is likely that the P079 UBCs that express a low density of mCitrine were not able to be visualized in our electrophysiological experiments because their native fluorescence was below the level of detection. Unfortunately, the observation that some mGluR1(+) UBCs are labeled in the P079 mouse line precludes its use for expressing genes in OFF UBCs specifically.</p>

<title>GRP and P079 UBCs are distinct populations in dorsal cochlear nucleus</title>
<p>UBCs are also present in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, a cerebellum-like circuit in the auditory brainstem of mammals. Like granule cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, UBCs receive multisensory signals from various sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ryugo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balmer and Trussell, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">2022</xref>). In order to test whether our findings about the identity of UBCs labeled in GRP-cre and P079 mice is generalizable across UBC populations, we examined their distribution in the dorsal cochlear nucleus. We found that 97.8% (132/135) of the GRP/Ai9 UBCs expressed mGluR1 in their dendritic brushes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A-B</xref>). The GRP/Ai9/mGluR1(+) population represented 34.2% (132/386) of the population of mGluR1(+) UBCs, and is therefore a subpopulation of about 1/3 of the mGluR1(+) ON UBCs. In a separate series of slices, 0/115 GRP/Ai9 UBCs expressed calretinin and is therefore useful for expressing genes in a subset of ON UBCs without expression in OFF UBCs in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.</p>

This represents 32.9% (127/386) of the mGluR1(+) population. As in the cerebellum, these P079/mGluR1(+) UBCs were identifiable by their significantly lower intensity of mCitrine after antibody amplification (43.5% intensity compared to mGluR1(-) P079 UBCs, n = 19 z-planes with at least one of each type, t-test, P = 1.352e-6). In summary, in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, the P079 mouse line expresses mCitrine in 86% of the calretinin(+) UBCs and 33% of the mGluR1(+) UBCs and the GRP line expresses Cre in 34% of the mGluR1(+) UBC population and 0% of the calretinin(+) population. Thus, the expression pattern in the dorsal cochlear nucleus of UBCs in these two mouse lines mirrors that of the cerebellum.</p>

<title>Axonal projections between ON UBCs and OFF UBCs</title>
<p>Do ON and OFF UBC subtypes target one another? In the GRP/Ai9/P079 mouse line, all GRP UBCs are ON UBCs and the P079 UBCs are mostly OFF UBCs, although their OFF UBC identity must be confirmed by their expression of calretinin. Thus, we searched for red GRP UBC axon terminals that contacted green P079 UBC brushes that also expressed calretinin. These contacts were presumed to be synapses based on our previous anatomical analyses of functional synapses between mossy fibers and UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balmer and Trussell, 2019</xref>). Several examples of such synaptic connections were identified, indicating that GRP ON UBCs provide synaptic input to P079 OFF UBCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A-B</xref>). Using the same approach, we found OFF UBC axon terminals (P079 and calretinin(+)) contacting ON UBC brushes (GRP) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C-D</xref>). These projections were rare and we did not attempt to characterize the proportion of ON to OFF UBC connections, as both populations are subsets of ON and OFF UBCs and would be a significant underestimate. However, these results do reveal that UBC subtypes synapse on one another and may introduce complex spiking patterns.</p>

<p>In a second approach to investigate synaptic connections between ON UBCs, we utilized a Brainbow2.1-Confetti reporter mouse line to label GRP ON UBCs with distinct colors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Livet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Snippert et al., 2010</xref>). In the offspring resulting from the GRP-Cre/Brainbow2.1-Confetti cross, expression of the fluorescent proteins was low and it was therefore necessary to enhance with anti-GFP and anti-mCherry antibodies. In doing so, both membrane-bound mCerulean and cytoplasmic YFP were labeled with the anti-GFP antibody, and cytoplasmic tdimer2(12) was labeled with anti-mCherry. This resulted in various combinations of expression that could be identified by wavelength (green or red) and cellular localization (membrane-bound or cytoplasmic). In most labeled UBCs, multiple alleles were expressed and could be visualized in the same cells, perhaps owing to the sensitivity of the antibody amplification (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). Several examples of GRP UBC axon terminals contacting the brushes of other GRP UBCs were identified (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B-D</xref>). Thus, GRP ON UBCs project to other GRP ON UBCs in a feed-forward excitatory circuit that is likely to prolong the duration of an excitatory signal.</p>

<p>To address whether OFF UBCs project axons to other OFF UBCs, we exploited the observation that the P079 line expresses mCitrine in some, but not all, calretinin-expressing OFF UBCs. Thus, when calretinin is labeled immunohistochemically using a non-green fluorophore, all OFF UBCs are revealed and their brushes can be examined for the presence of connections from mCitrine-labeled P079 OFF UBCs axon terminals. Several examples for OFF to OFF UBC synaptic connections were confirmed anatomically (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>).

Several examples are shown, confirming that calretinin(+) OFF UBCs provide input to one another (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B-D</xref>).

<title>Computational models predict transformations of spiking patterns through synaptically connected ON and OFF UBCs</title>
<p>To address how spiking activity may be transformed by different types of UBCs, computational models were developed to simulate the essential features of ON and OFF UBCs, including their passive electrical properties, synaptic current responses and spiking patterns. UBCs can fire spontaneously or be silent in acute brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2015</xref>). We chose to make the OFF UBCs spontaneously active in this model so that synaptic input would produce a pause in firing (OFF response) that could be easily measured. By contrast, we made ON UBCs not spontaneously active so that synaptic input would produce a burst of action potentials (ON response). Action potentials triggered glutamate concentration transients that drove the conductance of model AMPA receptors in ON UBCs and mGluR2 in OFF UBCs (see Methods). We contrasted simple cases of an excitatory input to either and ON or OFF UBC, with a more complex case in which the excitatory input drove an “intermediate” UBC which then synapsed on a second UBC. In this way, we could examine the predicted outcomes of ON to ON, ON to OFF, OFF to ON, and OFF to OFF scenarios.</p>

<title>Serial ON UBCs multiply burst duration</title>
<p>Presynaptic input to an ON UBC produced bursts of action potentials that multiplied in duration in a circuit with an intermediate ON UBC (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A-C</xref>). Three presynaptic spikes in a burst lasting 19.6 ms produced a burst of 12 action potentials in the first UBC, lasting 358.0 ms, and 35 action potentials in the second UBC, lasting 1175.3 ms, ∼60 times longer than the initial presynaptic input (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A-B</xref>). The enhancement of the spiking duration both in the first and second ON UBC were more pronounced with shorter bursts of presynaptic input and began to plateau at longer durations of input (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10C</xref>). The plateau in spiking duration occurs because the rebound AMPA receptor-mediated slow EPSC that occurs at the end of synaptic stimulation in ON UBCs reaches a maximum after ∼100 ms of synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lu et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Intermediate ON UBCs extend the pause in postsynaptic OFF UBCs</title>
<p>A burst of presynaptic spikes causes a pause in spontaneous firing in OFF UBCs, due to the outward current produced by mGluR2 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10D</xref>). When an intermediate ON UBC was present between the presynaptic axon and the OFF UBC, the synaptic signal to the OFF UBC was extended, and therefore increased the mGluR2 current, markedly lengthening the duration of the pause in spiking (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10E-F</xref>). Indeed, the presence of an intermediate ON UBC increased the duration of the pause in the postsynaptic OFF UBC by ∼940 ms following 1-10 presynaptic action potentials (indicated by an upward shift in the curve in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10G</xref>). The small difference in how much the pause was lengthened across the range of 1-10 presynaptic spikes is due to the intermediate ON UBC’s response—even a single presynaptic spike produces a burst of action potentials that is only slightly extended by longer trains of presynaptic input. Across a population of ON UBCs, however, the size and duration of the slow inward currents that drive their firing vary and would thus extend the pause of a postsynaptic OFF UBC for different durations.</p>

<title>Intermediate OFF UBC produce a delayed pause in postsynaptic ON UBC</title>
<p>Because OFF UBCs fired spontaneously in our model, an ON UBC postsynaptic to an intermediate OFF UBC fired with an irregular spiking pattern (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>). Presynaptic input to the intermediate OFF UBC paused both its firing and its release of glutamate onto the postsynaptic ON UBC, which therefore produced a pause in the postsynaptic ON UBC. However, this pause only occurred after a delay of about 370 ms, due to the slow AMPA receptor mediated EPSC in the ON UBC that decayed slowly until it no longer drove spiking. The length of the delay before the pause began is related to the strength of the AMPA receptor-mediated current in the postsynaptic ON UBC. The length of the pause in the ON UBC depends on how long the intermediate OFF UBCs pauses. Thus, an intermediate OFF UBC converts the usual excitatory ON UBC response to a pause that is similar to that of the OFF UBC itself.</p>

<title>Serial OFF UBCs produce a delayed burst in postsynaptic OFF UBC</title>
<p>Finally, we considered the case of a connection between two OFF UBCs. In a circuit with a spontaneously firing OFF UBC synapsing onto another OFF UBC (labeled OFF1 and OFF2 respectively, in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11C-D</xref>), the tonic glutamatergic input and mGluR2 inhibition prevented spontaneous spiking in the postsynaptic cell. When the intermediate OFF UBC received a burst of presynaptic input, it was inhibited by its own mGluR2 current and therefore stopped firing, thereby disinhibiting the postsynaptic OFF UBC, which then fired after a delay (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11C</xref>). Note that this firing would be more pronounced had we incorporated calcium and TRP conductances that contribute to a ‘late onset response’ in UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Subramaniyam et al., 2014</xref>). The duration of the delayed firing in the second postsynaptic OFF UBC depended on the duration of presynaptic input signal to the intermediate UBC (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11D</xref>). Moreover, the delay between the last spike in the intermediate OFF UBC and the first spike in the postsynaptic OFF UBC was contingent on the slow decay of the mGluR2 current and was 1082.7 ms in the example in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11C</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, our modeling suggests that feed-forward circuits of ON and OFF UBCs transform presynaptic signals by producing an extended spike burst (ON to ON), extended pause (ON to OFF), pause after a delay (OFF to ON), or burst after a delay (OFF to OFF) (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig 12</xref>). This diversification of spiking patterns and durations may be important for maintaining sensory representations of movement and mechanisms of adaptive learning.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>GRP and P079 mouse lines label distinct UBC subtypes that form parallel and convergent pathways</title>
<p>Transgenic mice were generated that expressed a green fluorescent protein in OFF UBCs and a red fluorescent protein in ON UBCs in the same tissue. Virtually no neurons expressed both fluorescent proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that all GRP UBCs expressed mGluR1 and most P079 UBCs expressed calretinin in both cerebellum and dorsal cochlear nucleus. GRP and P079 UBCs had different average soma sizes and distributions in the cerebellum. Whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices confirmed that the GRP UBCs produce excitatory ON responses mediated by mGluR1 and AMPA receptors, and that P079 UBCs produce inhibitory OFF responses mediated by mGluR2. Their membrane capacitance and excitability were so distinct that the distributions of these properties were almost non-overlapping. These results provide further evidence that some UBC subtypes are genetically and functionally distinct, despite the observation that when the entire population of UBCs is examined, their electrophysiological responses form a continuum from entirely excited by glutamate to entirely inhibited by glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The UBCs in these mouse lines expressed the fluorescent proteins throughout their axons and presynaptic terminals, which revealed for the first time that axon terminals from one UBC subtype contact the dendric brushes of the other UBC subtype. We also showed that UBCs of the same subtype provide input to one another, by labeling GRP or calretinin-Cre UBCs with different fluorescent proteins using the Brainbow2.1-Confetti reporter line. This result was confirmed with additional approaches that utilized the incomplete labeling of mGluR1(+) ON UBCs in the GRP line and the incomplete labeling of calretinin(+) OFF UBCs in the P079 line. Earlier work reported that that mGluR1(+) UBCs and calretinin(+) UBCs form parallel pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nunzi et al., 2002</xref>). Our current data extends the previous result by showing that the even more specific subtypes of GRP or P079 UBCs provide input to members of their own subtype. These networks of UBCs could provide the granule layer with a circuit mechanism to diversify and extend the pattern of spiking produced by mossy fiber input.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to reveal the postsynaptic targets of UBCs with a focus on ON and OFF UBC subtypes. However, it is important to emphasize that the final output and main target of UBCs is granule cells. Most of the labeled UBC axon terminals did not synapse on UBCs and are therefore presumed to synapse on numerous granule cells. Even the axon terminals that targeted UBCs likely also contacted granule cells. Thus, UBCs are interneurons that, when positioned between mossy fibers and granule cells, modify the input to granule cells and have the capacity to synchronize the firing of large ensembles of granule cells via their branching axons and large terminals.</p>
<p>The approaches used here were not able to determine the existence of networks of more than 2 UBCs connected one after the other. If present, 3 or more UBCs in series could extend and transform the input in even more dramatic ways. The temporal diversity that UBC circuits generate may underlie the flexibility of the cerebellum to coordinate movements over a broad range of behaviors.</p>

<title>UBC circuits generate a broad range of firing patterns and may be essential for cerebellar learning</title>
<p>Vestibular afferents that encode head movements synapse on both UBCs and granule cells. Granule cells that receive this input are likely to fire in phase with the input signal. A single intermediate UBC would shift the phase of firing of its postsynaptic granule cells, depending on the UBC’s response to glutamatergic input, which varies from nearly complete inhibition (e.g. P079 OFF UBC) to complete excitation (e.g. GRP ON UBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>). For example, an intermediate ON</p>
<p>UBC between a presynaptic input and another UBC extended the signal markedly in our models. In circuits with an intermediate OFF UBC, the postsynaptic UBCs signal was inverted: ON UBCs paused when they were no longer driven by glutamate, and OFF UBCs fired when they were no longer inhibited by glutamate. The signal that granule cells subsequently receive would be a burst or pause in firing that lasts for hundreds or thousands of milliseconds. We suggest that these transformations could provide a circuit mechanism for maintaining a sensory representation of movement for seconds, which is thought to be necessary to modulate low-frequency vestibular responses such as compensatory eye movements.</p>
<p>The delays introduced by an intermediate UBC were due to the slow decay of the excitatory or inhibitory synaptic currents produced by the presynaptic input. Other cellular and synaptic properties that would shape the timing of pauses, delays, and bursts, include the amount of glutamate released and the rate of its removal, the geometry of the extracellular space, glutamate receptor number and localization, short-term synaptic plasticity, currents underlying rebound spiking, and intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kinney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zampini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balmer et al., 2021</xref>). The combination of numerous mechanisms that shape the signal as it is transmitted along the granule layer circuit could produce tunable delay lines essential for sensory representation on an enormous range of time scales.</p>
<p>Extending the duration of a sensory feedback signal may also be essential for motor learning when there is a significant delay between the motor output and the sensory feedback, for example, when throwing an object at distant target, a challenge referred to as the credit assignment problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sutton and Barto, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Raymond and Lisberger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Suvrathan, 2019</xref>). There are a variety of ways that the cerebellum could extend a signal in time, such as slow axonal conduction, long membrane time constants, inhibition followed by rebound spiking, and slow intracellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Braitenberg, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fiala et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hooper et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">D’Angelo and De Zeeuw, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2014</xref>). UBCs circuits represent another mechanism that could prolong granule cell firing and contribute to the maintenance of sensory signals that underly motor learning in behaviors with delayed sensory feedback.</p>
<p>The diversification of spiking patterns by intermediate UBCs may contribute to the pattern separation that is necessary for theories of cerebellar learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ito, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zampini et al., 2016</xref>). In one of the best understood cerebellum-like circuits, the electrosensory lobe of electric fish, UBCs are essential to produce temporally diverse and delayed spiking patterns that are necessary for accurate cancellation of self-generated signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). The authors report that a post-inhibitory rebound that occurred in UBCs may account for the delayed spiking patterns. The presence of synaptic pathways with multiple UBCs could contribute to these long pauses and delays that may be critical for adaptive learning on time scales ranging from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds.</p>

<title>Sources of synaptic input to UBC subtypes</title>
<p>The firing rates of putative UBCs recorded in vivo in the vestibular cerebellum of mammals follow head velocity and eye movements, in some cases with delays of hundreds of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Simpson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barmack and Yakhnitsa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hensbroek et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggests that these long delays could be implemented by feed-forward circuits containing multiple UBCs. It is unknown whether UBCs that are labeled in the GRP or P079 mouse lines are a subtype that receives a specific source of input. In lobe X, ON UBCs defined by their electrophysiological response or mGluR1-expression receive input from both primary vestibular afferents and second-order mossy fibers from the vestibular nucleus, while OFF UBCs only receive vestibular nuclear input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balmer and Trussell, 2019</xref>). Understanding whether the UBCs labeled in these mouse lines receive head or eye movement signals, integrated signals that encode head orientation relative to gravity, or another type of signal, would help elucidate their specific roles in cerebellar functions.</p>

<title>Brain slice preparation</title>
<p>For acute brain slice electrophysiology, male and female P079 and GRP-Cre/Ai9 mice were used at ages P21-35. Animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and the brain was extracted under ice-cold high-sucrose artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 87 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, 2 Na-pyruvate, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub>. Parasagittal cerebellum sections 200-300 μm thick were cut with a vibratome (7000smz-2, Campden Instruments) in ice-cold high-sucrose ACSF. Slices recovered at 35°C for 30-40 minutes, in ACSF containing the following (in mM): 130 NaCl, 2.1 KCl, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3 Na-HEPES, 10 glucose, 20 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, 2 Na-pyruvate, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub> (300–305 mOsm).

<title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>Acute brain slices were perfused with ACSF using a peristaltic pump (Ismatec) at 2-3 ml/min, and maintained at 32-34°C with an inline heater (Warner Instruments). ACSF contained 0.5 µM Strychnine and 5 µM SR95531 to block synaptic inhibition. The recording set up was composed of an Olympus BX51 fixed-stage microscope with Dodt gradient contrast optics (Dodt et al., 2002), and 4X and 60X (water immersion) Olympus objectives. UBCs were initially identified by soma size or transgenic fluorescence and confirmed by intracellular filling with 5 μM Alexa Fluor 568 or 488 hydrazide sodium salt (Life Technologies). Patch electrodes were pulled with borosilicate glass capillaries (OD 1.2 mm and ID 0.68 mm, AM Systems) with a horizontal puller (P1000, Sutter Instruments). Intracellular recording solution contained (mM): 113 K-gluconate, 9 HEPES, 4.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, 14 Tris-phosphocreatine, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.3 tris-GTP, 0.1-0.3% biocytin, 290 mOsm, pH 7.2-7.25. All recordings were corrected for a -10 mV junction potential. Data were acquired using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and pClamp 11 software (Molecular Devices). Signals were acquired with 5-10X gain, sampled at 50-100 kHz using a Digidata (1550A, Molecular Devices) analog-digital converter, and low-pass filtered at 10 kHz, with further filtering applied offline. Patch pipettes tip resistance was 5-8 MΩ; series resistance was compensated with correction 20-40% and prediction 50-70%, bandwidth 2 kHz. Membrane potential was held constant at -70 mV in voltage clamp experiments. Electrical stimulation was performed using a concentric bipolar electrode (CBBPC75, FHC) placed in the white matter of the sagittal cerebellar slice. Stimuli were evoked using a stimulus isolation unit (Iso-Flex, A.M.P.I.) delivering 100-250 μs duration pulses of 0-90 V.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and imaging</title>
<p>Mice were overdosed with isoflurane and perfused through the heart with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, 7.4 pH (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were extracted from the skull and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C. 50 µm thick sections were made on a vibratome (7000smz-2, Campden Instruments). To recover cells that were filled with biocytin during whole-cell recording, acute brain slices were fixed 1-2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by storage in PBS. Both floating 50 µm sections and 200-300 µm thick acute slices were treated with the following procedures. Sections were rinsed 3 x 5 min in PBS, blocked and permeabilized in 5% BSA, 2% fish gelatin, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for &gt;1 hr at room temperature. Sections were incubated in primary antibodies overnight in 1% fish gelatin in PBS at 4°C on an orbital shaker. Primary antibodies included chicken polyclonal anti-GFP (1:2000, Aves Labs, GFP-1020, AB_10000240), goat polyclonal anti-mCherry (1:2000, Sicgen, AB0040, AB_2333093), mouse monoclonal anti-rat mGluR1a (1:800, BD Pharmingen, 556389, AB_396404), rabbit polyclonal anti-calretinin (1:2000, Swant, 7697, AB_10000342). Sections were rinsed 3 x 5 min in PBS, followed by secondary antibodies (1:500) and streptavidin (1:2000) that were diluted in 1% fish gelatin in PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C on an orbital shaker. Secondary antibodies included donkey anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715-545-155, AB_2340375), donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715-605-151, AB_2340863), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-605-152, AB_2492288), donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-165-152, AB_2307443), donkey ant-goat Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 705-165-147, AB_2307351), streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 647 (ThermoFisher Scientific, S21374, AB_2336066). Sections were mounted on microscope slides (Superfrost Plus, Fisher Scientific) and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images were acquired a confocal microscope (LSM800, Zeiss) with the Airyscan system that reconstructs super-resolution images from a series of images acquired under spatially structured illumination. Images are single optical planes unless otherwise specified.</p>

<title>Image quantification</title>
<p>Sagittal brain slices containing lobe X were imaged systematically across the medial-lateral axis. One area in the dorsal region and one area in the ventral region of lobe X in each selected slice was imaged using a 63x objective. The volume was 202.8 µm x 202.8 µm x 10.8 µm for each image using ∼12 z-planes. Images were annotated for transgenic expression of tdTomato or mCitrine as well as mGluR1 or calretinin labeling. tdTomato, mCitrine and calretinin labeling is cytoplasmic and UBCs were easily counted if they had a labeled soma and attached dendritic brush. mGluR1 is mostly expressed in the dendrite, but labeling is also present in the soma membrane, which can be observed as a circle. mGluR1 UBCs were counted if there was labeling in the dendritic brush that was attached to an apparent mGluR1-labeled soma. This necessarily conservative method of identifying mGluR1-labeled UBCs likely resulted in an underestimation of the total number of mGluR1(+) UBCs.</p>
<p>The labeling intensity of mCitrine in P079 UBCs that were mGluR1(+) was compared to P079 UBCs that were mGluR1(-) by measuring the mean pixel intensity in the somas of each type of UBCs. At least one of each type was measured in the same image and same z-plane to account for differences in brightness that could be due to differences in immunohistochemical labeling, image acquisition settings, and depth in the slice (deeper cells are less well labeled due to more limited antibody penetration). For each z-plane with at least one mGluR1(+) and one mGluR1(-) P079 UBC, a difference in brightness was calculated and reported as a relative brightness of the mGluR1(+) P079 UBCs to the brighter mGluR1(-) P079 UBCs.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings about synaptic connectivity among subsets of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), a specialized interneuron primarily located in the vestibular lobules of the cerebellar cortex. The evidence supporting the claims are interesting although <bold>incomplete</bold> in some areas. The work will be of interest to cerebellar neuroscientists as well as those focussed on synaptic properties and mechanisms. Substantial work remains to be conducted in order for the hypothesis and predictions of the manuscript to play out in the actual brain circuit and how it would impact the processing of feedback or feedforward activity that would be required to promote behavior.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Hariani et al. presents experiments designed to improve our understanding of the connectivity and computational role of Unipolar Brush Cells (UBCs) within the cerebellar cortex, primarily lobes IX and X. The authors develop and cross several genetic lines of mice that express distinct fluorophores in subsets of UBCs, combined with immunocytochemistry that also distinguishes subtypes of UBCs, and they use confocal microscopy and electrophysiology to characterize the electrical and synaptic properties of subsets of so-labelled cells, and their synaptic connectivity within the cerebellar cortex. The authors then generate a computer model to test the possible computational functions of such interconnected UBCs.</p>
<p>Using these approaches, the authors report that:</p>
<p>1. GRP-driven TDtomato is expressed exclusively in a subset (20%) of ON-UBCs, defined electrophysiologically (excited by mossy fiber afferent stimulation via activation of UBC AMPA and mGluR1 receptors) and immunocytochemically by their expression of mGluR1.</p>
<p>2. UBCs ID'd/tagged by mCitrine expression in Brainbow mouse line P079 are expressed in a similar minority subset of OFF-UBCs defined electrophysiologically (inhibited by mossy fiber afferent stimulation via activation of UBC mGluR2 receptors) and immunocytochemically by their expression of Calretinin. However, such mCitrine expression was also detected in some mGluR1 positive UBCs, which may not have shown up electrophysiologically because of the weaker fluorophore expression without antibody amplification.</p>
<p>3. Confocal analysis of crossed lines of mice (GRP X P079) stained with antibodies to mGluR1 and calretinin documented the existence of all possible permutations of interconnectivity between cells (ON-ON, ON-OFF, OFF-OFF, OFF-ON), but their overall abundance was low, and neither their absolute nor relative abundance was quantified.</p>
<p>4. A computational model (NEURON ) indicated that the presence of an intermediary UBC (in a polysynaptic circuit from MF to UBC to UBC) could prolong bursts (MF-ON-ON), prolong pauses (MF-ON-OFF), cause a delayed burst (MF-OFF-OFF), cause a delayed pause (MF-OFF-ON) relative to solely MF to UBC synapses which would simply exhibit long bursts (MF-ON) or long pauses (MF-OFF).</p>
<p>The authors thus conclude that the pattern of interconnected UBCs provides an extended and more nuanced pattern of firing within the cerebellar cortex that could mediate longer-lasting sensorimotor responses.</p>
<p>The cerebellum's long-known role in motor skills and reflexes, and associated disorders, combined with our nascent understanding of its role in cognitive, emotional, and appetitive processing, makes understanding its circuitry and processing functions of broad interest to the neuroscience and biomedical community. The focus on UBCs, which are largely restricted to vestibular lobules of the cerebellum reduces the breadth of likely interest somewhat. The overall design of specific experiments is rigorous and the use of fluorophore expressing mouse lines is creative. The data that is presented and the writing are clear. However, the overall experimental design has issues that reduce overall interpretation (please see specific issues for details), which combined with a lack of thorough analysis of the experimental outcomes severely undermines the value of the NEURON model results and the advance in our understanding of cerebellar processing in situ (again, please see specific issues for details).</p>
<p>Specific issues:</p>
<p>1. All data gathered with inhibition blocked. All of the UBC response data (Fig. 1) was gathered in the presence of GABAAR and Glycine R blockers. While such an approach is appropriate generally for isolating glutamatergic synaptic currents, and specifically for examining and characterizing monosynaptic responses to single stimuli, it becomes problematic in the context of assaying synaptic and action potential response durations for long-lasting responses, and in particular for trains of stimuli, when feed-forward and feed-back inhibition modulates responses to afferent stimulation. That is, even for single MF stimuli, given the &gt;500ms duration of UBC synaptic currents, there is plenty of time for feedback inhibition from Golgi cells (or feedforward, from MF to Golgi cell excitation) to interrupt AP firing driven by the direct glutamatergic synaptic excitation. This issue is compounded further for all of the experiments examining trains of MF stimuli. Beyond the impact of feedback inhibition on the AP firing of any given UBC, it would also obviously reduce/alter/interrupt that UBC's synaptic drive of downstream UBCs. This issue fundamentally undermines our ability to interpret the simulation data of Vm and AP firing of both the modeled intermediate and downstream UBC, in terms of applying it to possible cerebellar cortical processing in situ.</p>
<p>2. No consideration for the involvement of polysynaptic UBCs driving UBC responses to MF stimulation in electrophysiology experiments. Given the established existence (in this manuscript and Dino et al. 2000 Neurosci, Dino et al. 2000 ProgBrainRes, Nunzi and Mugnaini 2000 JCompNeurol, Nunzi et al. 2001 JCompNeurol) of polysynaptic connections from MFs to UBCs to UBCs, the MF evoked UBC responses established in this manuscript, especially responses to trains of stimuli could be mediated by direct MF inputs, or to polysynaptic UBC inputs, or possibly both (to my awareness not established either way). Thus the response durations could already include extension of duration by polysynaptic inputs, and so would overestimate the duration of monosynaptic inputs, and thus polysynaptic amplification/modulation, observed in the NEURON model.</p>
<p>3. Lack of quantification of subtypes of UBC interconnectivity. Given that it is already established that UBCs synapse onto other UBCs (see refs above), the main potential advance of this manuscript in terms of connectivity is the establishment and quantification of ON-ON, ON-OFF, OFF-ON, and OFF-OFF subtypes of UBC interconnections. But, the authors only establish that each type exists, showing specific examples, but no quantification of the absolute or relative density was provided, and the authors' unquantified wording explicitly or implicitly states that they are not common. This lack of quantification and likely small number makes it difficult to know how important or what impact such synapses have on cerebellar processing, in the model and in situ.</p>
<p>4. Lack of critical parameters in NEURON model.</p>
<p>5. Lack of quantification of various electrophysiological responses. UBCs are defined (ON or OFF) based on inward or outward synaptic response, but no information is provided about the range of the key parameter of duration across cells, which seems most critical to the current considerations. There is a similar lack of quantification across cells of AP duration in response to stimulation or current injections, or during baseline. The latter lack is particularly problematic because, in agreement with previous publications, the raw data in Fig. 1 shows ON UBCs as quiescent until MF stimulation and OFF UBCs firing spontaneously until MF stimulation, but, for example, at least one ON UBC in the NEURON model is firing spontaneously until synaptically activated by an OFF UBC (Fig. 11A), and an OFF UBC is silent until stimulated by a presynaptic OFF UBC (Fig. 11C). This may be expected/explainable theoretically, but then such cells should be observed in the raw data.</p>

<p>In this paper, the authors presented a compelling rationale for investigating the role of UBCs in prolonging and diversifying signals. Based on the two types of UBCs known as ON and OFF UBC subtypes, they have highlighted the existing gaps in understanding UBCs connectivity and the need to investigate whether UBCs target UBCs of the same subtype, different subtypes, or both. The importance of this knowledge is for understanding how sensory signals are extended and diversified in the granule cell layer.</p>
<p>The authors designed very interesting approaches to study UBCs connectivity by utilizing transgenic mice expressing GFP and RFP in UBCs, Brainbow approach, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological analysis, and computational models to understand how the feed-forward circuits of interconnected UBCs transform their inputs.</p>
<p>This study provided evidence for the existence of distinct ON and OFF UBC subtypes based on their electrophysiological properties, anatomical characteristics, and expression patterns of mGluR1 and calretinin in the cerebellum. The findings support the classification of GRP UBCs as ON UBCs and P079 UBCs as OFF UBCs and suggest the presence of synaptic connections between the ON and OFF UBC subtypes. In addition, they found that GRP and P079 UBCs form parallel and convergent pathways and have different membrane capacitance and excitability. Furthermore, they showed that UBCs of the same subtype provide input to one another and modify the input to granule cells, which could provide a circuit mechanism to diversify and extend the pattern of spiking produced by mossy fiber input. Accordingly, they suggested that these transformations could provide a circuit mechanism for maintaining a sensory representation of movement for seconds.</p>
<p>Overall, the article is well written in a sound detailed format, very interesting with excellent discovery and suggested model, however, I have some comments/suggestions that may help to improve this manuscript:</p>
<p>• The discovery of UBCs innervating each other and their own subtypes, suggesting the presence of feed-forward networks in the cerebellum, is an incredibly fascinating and exciting finding followed by an intriguing model by authors. However, it is worth considering an alternative model as well. I acknowledge that visualizing such interactions using current tools and methods can be challenging (&quot;The approaches used here were not able to determine the existence of networks of more than 2 UBCs connected one after the other. If present, 3 or more UBCs in series could extend and transform the input in even more dramatic ways. The temporal diversity that UBC circuits generate may underlie the flexibility of the cerebellum to coordinate movements over a broad range of behaviors.&quot;). Therefore, if this is the case in which more than 2 UBCs connected one after the other, then an alternative model PERHAPS resembles the basal nuclei, with its direct and indirect circuits, can be considered (maybe a type of circular model). The basal nuclei circuits are also regulated by modulators such as D1 dopamine receptors in the direct pathway, causing depolarization, and D2 dopamine receptors in the indirect pathway, resulting in hyperpolarization upon dopamine activation. This approach could involve using computational models to gain insight into potential alternatives within this pathway (may be a future direction).</p>
<p>• GRP UBCs are more densely distributed in lobes VI-IX, while P079 UBCs are more densely distributed in the dorsal leaflet of lobe X in sagittal sections. While the cerebellum is well known for its characteristic stripy pattern, are UBC distributions the same in coronal/transverse section?</p>
<p>• The extension of the axons from both subtypes of UBCs show they are long enough to pass several UBCs and even projections are directed toward the white matter (e.g. Fig 9A), suggesting targeting the UBCs or granule cells in other lobules. Is it suggesting UBCs connectivity between different lobules (perhaps longitudinal connectivity)? Is there any observation or information in coronal/transverse section to visualize mediolateral connectivity?</p>
<p>• The limitation in identifying networks involving more than two sequentially connected UBCs was briefly noted. I suggest including a paragraph describing limitations and discussing the implications of the findings would enhance the overall impact of the research and broaden our understanding of cerebellar function.</p>
<p>• It is a pity that there is no clear conclusion to the discussion of this very interesting study. I suggest providing the key points as a conclusion.</p>
<p>• Please make the correction in Figure 2A by relabeling it as IXa, IXb, and IXc to correct the typographical error.</p>
<p>• I recommend rotating Figure 7A to align its orientation with the other figures for consistency.</p>

<body>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to manage the reviews of this manuscript. Many helpful suggestions were presented by the two reviewers that will certainly strengthen the revised version of the manuscript. We would like to take the opportunity to provide a provisional response to address concerns and factual errors in the eLife assessment and public reviews. Please see below.</p>
<p>Response to eLife assessment:</p>
<p>The assessment does not appear to reflect reviews entirely accurately. While reviewer 1 was unsatisfied by the “lack of thorough analysis of the experimental outcomes”, the criticism of a lack of sufficient support of our claims was not present in the reviews. Thus, the sentence,  “The evidence supporting the claims are interesting although incomplete in some areas”, seems to us excessively negative. Furthermore, while we agree that this work inspires new studies to determine how UBC circuits function in the intact brain and how they promote behaviors, and that “substantial work remains to be conducted” to explore these new avenues, the way the sentence is constructed, and placed directly after “incomplete in some areas”, makes it read as a negative related to the current manuscript, whereas opening doors to new lines of research is certainly positive for the field.</p>
<p>Response to Reviewer 1:</p>
<p>•   One of the main criticisms appears to be a lack of quantification of our electrophysiological data and clear explanation of how the model reproduces the behavior of the cells reported here and in previous work. We are thankful for the identification of these omissions. Our extensive work in UBC electrophysiology instructed the development of these models and they reproduce the essential features of ON and OFF UBC spiking responses and mGluR2 and AMPAR conductances accurately, although we agree that we did not present sufficient evidence for this in the manuscript.</p>
<p>•   Another major criticism was a lack of consideration of feedback and feedforward inhibition. The goal of Figure 1 was to determine the cell types of labeled UBCs in transgenic mouse lines, which is determined entirely by their synaptic responses to glutamate (Borges-Merjane &amp; Trussell, 2015). Thus, blocking inhibition was essential to produce clear results. Feedback and feedforward inhibition from Golgi cells, which is certainly important in the intact circuit, is not possible to produce in a physiologically realistic way in acute brain slices, because electrical stimulation produces synchronous excitation and inhibition (by directly exciting Golgi cells, rather than their synaptic inputs). The main inhibition that UBCs receive is through mGluR2, which lasts for 100-1000s of milliseconds, and the main excitation that UBCs receive is through mGluR1 and AMPA, which also both last 100-1000s of milliseconds. Thus, these large conductances are unlikely to be significantly shaped by 1-10 ms IPSCs from feedforward and feedback inhibition. For these reasons, it was not our intention to explore GABAergic/glycinergic feedforward and feedback inhibition in the present study.</p>
<p>Factual errors in public reviews:</p>
<p>Reviewer 1, specific point 4:</p>
<p>A) The reviewer accurately points out that the model did not incorporate a change in the amount of glutamate released across release events during trains of presynaptic spikes.  We did not find this to be necessary to reproduce the AMPA and mGluR2 currents accurately, because the majority of the response occurs after the last presynaptic stimulus. Short term plasticity during the stimulus train would be expected to change the total amount of glutamate released, but not the time course of the slow current response. We previously showed that the predominant synaptic plasticity that occurs at this synapse during the train is short-term depression that is due in large part to postsynaptic desensitization of AMPA receptors, rather than a change in presynaptic release.</p>
<p>B) The reviewer states that the model does not include desensitization of AMPA receptors. Although there is not a variable that defines desensitization explicitly, the detailed kinetic AMPA receptor model used here accounts for desensitization, which, in fact, mediates slow ON UBC current and is the focus of our previous work. This AMPA receptor model (developed in Balmer et al., 2021 using UBC data from Lu et al., 2017) is a 13-state model, including 4 open states with 1-4 glutamates bound, 4 closed states with 1-4 glutamates bound, 4 desensitized states with 1-4 glutamates bound, and 5 closed states with 0-4 glutamates bound.  The transition rates between different states in the model were fit to AMPA receptor currents recorded from dissociated UBCs and they approximate well the ON UBC currents evoked by synaptic stimulation (Balmer et al., 2021).</p>
