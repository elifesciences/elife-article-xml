<title>Abstract</title><p>Spliceosomopathies, which are a group of disorders caused by defects in the splicing machinery, frequently affect the craniofacial skeleton and limb, but the molecular mechanism underlying this tissue-specific sensitivity remains unclear. Splicing factors and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are core components of splicing machinery, and splicing factors are further controlled by post-translational modifications, among which arginine methylation is one of the most frequent modifications. To determine the splicing mechanisms in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs), which give rise to the majority of the craniofacial skeleton, we focused on upstream regulators for splicing proteins responsible for arginine methylation, protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT). These enzymes catalyze arginine methylation of splicing factors to modify splicing factor expression and activity, influencing the splicing product. PRMT1 is the highest expressing enzyme of the PRMT family in CNCCs and its role in craniofacial development is evident based on our earlier investigation, where CNCC-specific <italic>Prmt1</italic> deletion caused cleft palate and mandibular hypoplasia. In the present study, we uncover the roles of PRMT1 in CNCCs in the regulation of intron retention, a type of alternative splicing where introns are retained in the mature mRNA sequence. Mandibular primordium of <italic>Prmt1</italic>-deficient embryos demonstrated an increase in the percentage of intron-retaining mRNA of matrix genes, which triggered NMD, causing a reduction in matrix transcript expression. We further identified SFPQ as a substrate of PRMT1 that depends on PRMT1 for arginine methylation and protein expression in the developing craniofacial structures. Depletion of SFPQ in CNCCs phenocopied PRMT1 deletion in that matrix, Wnt signaling components and neuronal gene transcripts contained higher IR and exhibited lower expression. We further recognized gene length as a common feature among SFPQ-regulated genes in CNCCs. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the PRMT1-SFPQ pathway modulates matrix Wnt signaling components and neuronal gene expression via intron retention in CNCCs during craniofacial development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Craniofacial abnormalities affecting bone formation in the skull and face are the most common birth defects in infants. Proper formation of these structures involves coordinated processes including proliferation, migration, and differentiation of cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) (Martik and Bronner 2017; Plein, Fantin, and Ruhrberg 2015). CNCCs are a transient population of progenitor cells that populate the first and second pharyngeal arches and give rise to the maxilla, mandible, palates, and other structures of the developing head (Chai et al. 2000; Jiang et al. 2002; Martik and Bronner 2017). Dysregulation of transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, RNA regulatory proteins, and signaling molecules have been implicated in impaired neural crest development that results in craniofacial defects (Bélanger et al. 2018; Martik and Bronner 2017; Plein, Fantin, and Ruhrberg 2015; Strobl-Mazzulla, Marini, and Buzzi 2012). Spliceosomopathies, which are a group of disorders caused by defects in the splicing machinery, frequently affect the craniofacial skeleton and limb. However, why these tissues are more sensitive to spliceosomal defects remain incompletely understood. Splicing factors and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are core components of splicing machinery, which control pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA maturation through the process of alternative splicing (AS). AS includes seven types of events, exon skipping, mutually exclusive exons, alternative 5’ and 3’-splice sites, alternative promoters, alternative polyadenylation, and intron retention (Hooper et al. 2020). Intron retention (IR) is a type of AS abundant in plants and fungi, where introns are retained within the mature mRNA sequence (E.T. Wang et al. 2008). Although initially overlooked in mammals due to low occurrence and challenges in detection, recent technical advances have unveiled its significant roles in various aspects, including cell differentiation and stress response, especially in neuronal, immune, and cancer cells (Marquez et al. 2012; Monteuuis et al. 2019; Braunschweig et al. 2014; Wong and Schmitz 2022).</p>
<p>In exploring the splicing mechanisms in CNCCs, we focused on upstream regulators for splicing factors. The activity of splicing factors is tightly controlled by post-translational modifications, among which methylation is the most abundant, surpassing phosphorylation (Thandapani et al. 2013; Ruta, Pagliarini, and Sette 2021). Splicing regulator methylation mostly occurs on arginine motifs, catalyzed by the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family of enzymes. PRMTs-mediated methylation of splicing factors determines their subcellular localization, expression, and activity, influencing the splicing product (Blanc and Richard 2017; Liu and Dreyfuss 1995; Snijders et al. 2015). PRMT1 is the most abundant PRMT in most cell types and specifically catalyzes methylation of arginine (R) residues within RG/RGG/GAR repeats, which are motifs enriched in RNA-binding proteins, particularly splicing regulators, resulting in asymmetric dimethylation of arginine (ADMA) (Thandapani et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2004). The importance of PRMT1 in craniofacial development is evident from our earlier investigation in which genetic deletion of <italic>Prmt1</italic> in CNCCs leads to cleft palate and mandibular hypoplasia (Gou, Li, Wu, et al. 2018; Gou, Li, Jackson-Weaver, et al. 2018). In the present study, we uncovered a previously unrecognized role of PRMT1 in regulating intron retention (IR) in CNCCs. The mandibular primordium of <italic>Prmt1</italic>-deficient embryos demonstrated augmented retention of introns in mRNAs that encode bone and cartilage matrix components. We further identified SFPQ as a downstream mediator of PRMT1 in the developing craniofacial structures, that depends on PRMT1 for arginine methylation and protein expression. Depletion of SFPQ in CNCCs partially phenocopied PRMT1 deletion, causing elevated retention of introns in mRNA transcripts of matrix, neuronal, and Wnt signaling pathways genes. We further recognized long gene/intron splicing as a common feature among SFPQ-regulated introns and demonstrated these retained introns contain premature termination codons (PTCs) that trigger nonsense-mediate decay (NMD) to reduce mRNA expression levels. Together, these findings demonstrate that the PRMT1-SFPQ pathway modulates CNCC gene expression via control of splicing. Deficiency of this pathway leads to aberrant intron retention, which induces mRNA decay that downregulates matrix expression in CNCCs during craniofacial development.</p>

<title>CNCCs from the embryonic mandibular process exhibit abundant intron retention, which was further elevated by loss of <italic>Prmt1</italic></title>
<p>PRMT1 is the most abundant enzyme of the arginine methyltransferase family in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs), with an expression level 10∼100 folds higher than other PRMTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure-1A</xref>). We previously demonstrated critical roles for PRMT1 in CNCCs during craniofacial skeleton formation using genetic deletion, whereby neural crest-specific deletion of <italic>Prmt1</italic> resulted in cleft palate and shorter mandibles (Gou, Li, Wu, et al. 2018; Gou, Li, Jackson-Weaver, et al. 2018). Shorter mandibles, or mandibular hypoplasia is a craniofacial phenotype shared by most spliceosomopathies. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying PRMT1’s role in mandible development, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of <italic>Prmt1</italic> deletion-induced transcriptional and splicing alterations within the embryonic mandibles. For this purpose, CNCCs, the cell lineage that gives rise to the bone and cartilages in the mandible were isolated from mandibular processes of control (<italic>Wnt1-Cre; Rosa<sup>Td</sup></italic>) or <italic>Prmt1 CKO</italic> mutant (<italic>Wnt1-Cre; Prmt1<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Rosa<sup>Td</sup></italic>) mice at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) for mRNA extraction and sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure-1B</xref>). The ensuing comparative analysis using rMATS (Y. Wang et al. 2024) unveiled changes across five types of alternative splicing events (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure-1C</xref>), echoing our earlier finding where PRMT1 regulates exon usage during cardiac morphogenesis (Jackson-Weaver et al. 2020). In contrast to embryonic epicardial cells, we noted a higher abundance of altered intron retention (IR) in mandibular CNCCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure-1C</xref>), with a predominance of IR increase when compared to control CNCCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure-1Ca</xref>’). The IR changes were further exemplified by the elevation of intronic expression in <italic>Pex12, Nkx3-2, Nkiras1, 1810026B05Rik,</italic> and the reduction of intronic expression in <italic>Tbx1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure-1D-F</xref>). To analyze the intronic expression comprehensively at a gene-specific level, we employed IRI (intron reads index) analysis, which is an algorithm that quantifies the ratio of normalized read counts between intronic and exonic regions (Ni et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2023; Tian et al. 2020). Subsequent analysis for retained introns demonstrated that <italic>Prmt1</italic> deficiency-induced change in intron retention altered an array of biology pathways. We noted protein binding, metal ion binding, and cartilage development among genes that present increased intronic expression, while mitochondrion and metabolic pathways were identified among genes with decreased intronic expression (Supplemental Table S1). These findings identify intron retention as a prevalent phenomenon in CNCCs during craniofacial development, and the deletion of <italic>Prmt1</italic> further enhanced intron retention in genes involved in diverse biological processes.</p>

<title>Neural crest-specific deletion of <italic>Prmt1</italic> caused a significant reduction of matrix gene expression in the developing mandibles</title>
<p>The main documented roles of retained intron in mature mRNA is to reduce gene expression via non-sense mediated decay (NMD) (Schmitz et al. 2017). When intron-retaining transcripts are incorporated into the translation machinery, introns that contain premature termination codons (PTCs) within their open reading frames trigger NMD, leading to transcript degradation and reduced expression of genes harboring these introns (Wong et al. 2016). We observed that intron-retaining transcripts illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure-1</xref>, <italic>Pex12,</italic> and <italic>Nkiras1</italic> demonstrated increased intronic expression and decreased exonic expression, suggesting reduced gene expression. To systematically analyze genes that are differentially downregulated, we compared the transcriptional profile between control and <italic>Prmt1</italic> CKO mutant of mandibular CNCCs and revealed downregulation of 303 genes and concurrent upregulation of 160 genes by <italic>Prmt1</italic> deletion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure-2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Upon pathway analysis, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) degradation (35 out of 303 genes) and extracellular matrix (ECM) (33 out of 303 genes) emerged as the top pathways among downregulated genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure-2C</xref>). Findings from GAG degradation and ECM genes align with our understanding that these downregulated genes encode matrix proteins pivotal to osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation and the formation of bone and cartilage matrix. This notion was supported by bioinformatic analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) based on downregulated genes, which suggested a disruption in bone, cartilage, and connective tissue development within <italic>Prmt1</italic> CKO mutant mandibles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure-2D</xref>). The data collected from transcriptional analysis underscore the importance of PRMT1 in orchestrating matrix gene expression critical to bone, cartilage, and connective tissue formation during mandible morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Deletion of <italic>Prmt1</italic> in CNCCs elevated intron retention in mRNAs that encode ECM and GAG degradation enzymes</title>
<p>To determine whether the downregulation of matrix genes is regulated by intron retention, we first examined the intronic expression profile of ECM genes. A prominent elevation of intron retention within ECM genes was revealed by scatter plot where most ECM data points landed above the red line that denotes unchanged intron retention (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure-3A</xref>). ECM genes with the most significant increase in intron expression were labeled and highlighted as red dots, and further exemplified by the track view of <italic>Bmp7</italic> and <italic>Cthrc1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure-3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). In these ECM genes, the increased intron retention correlated with the reduced exonic expression, indicated by intronic expression and exonic expression respectively <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">(Figure-3C</xref>). To validate the reproducibility of elevated intron retention in ECM transcripts, we expanded our analysis to incorporate four additional embryos from each group, isolated mature mRNA using poly(A)+ magnetic beads, and designed primers for RT-PCR analysis of intronic and exonic region of additional ECM genes. In line with our initial observations, intronic expression increased significantly, coupled with decreased exonic expression in <italic>Dcn, Tnn, Lox, Loxl1, Matn2, Col14a1, Adamts12, Adamts2, Adam12,</italic> and <italic>Scara5</italic> of the mutant CNCCs as compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure-3D</xref>). These findings demonstrate that ECM transcripts in <italic>Prmt1</italic> CKO mandibles exhibited elevated intron retention, which correlates with a reduction in mRNA expression levels. Next, we analyzed the intronic reads profile of GAG degradation genes, which is the top downregulated gene cluster in the <italic>Prmt1</italic> CKO group and clinically associated with craniofacial birth defects. Similar to ECM genes, the majority of GAG degradation genes showed elevation of intron retention indicated by scatter plot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure-3E</xref>). The increased intron retention of <italic>St6galnac3</italic> and <italic>Galn11</italic>, indicated by higher intronic expression, correlated with reduced mRNA expression, indicated by lower mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure-3F</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). Upon further inspection of the retained introns in ECM and GAG degradation transcripts, retained introns in the significantly downregulated genes all contain PTCs within their open reading frames, suggesting PTC-triggered transcript degradation via NMD-mediated RNA surveillance system (Supplemental Table S2) (Wong et al. 2016). Altogether, these data indicate that <italic>Prmt1</italic> deletion elevates intron retention in matrix genes encoding ECM proteins and GAG degradation enzymes and downregulated their mRNA expression within CNCCs.</p>

<title>PRMT1 methylates SFPQ in CNCCs</title>
<p>PRMT1 is a methyltransferase that catalyzes methylation of arginine (R) residues within RG/RGG/GAR repeats, which are motifs highly enriched in RNA-binding proteins, particularly splicing regulators (Thandapani et al. 2013). PRMT1 catalyzes asymmetric dimethylation of arginine (ADMA) residues, which regulates the turnover, subcellular localization, and splicing activity of splicing regulators (Smith et al. 2004). We therefore hypothesized that PRMT1 regulates intron retention via methylation of splicing regulators. Earlier studies by Graham et al. and our team have characterized the landscape of arginine methylation governed by PRMT1 and identified a cohort of RNA processing proteins exhibiting PRMT1-dependent methylation (Hartel et al. 2019). Among these, six splicing regulators are highly expressed in embryonic CNCCs: SFPQ, SRSF1, EWSR1, TAF15, TRA2B, and G3BP1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure-4A</xref>). To discern whether any of the splicing regulators are accountable for elevated IR in <italic>Prmt1</italic> deficient CNCCs, we conducted an in-silico analysis of the RNA-seq data of mandibular CNCCs from control and <italic>Prmt1 CKO</italic> embryos utilizing rMATS (multivariant analysis of transcript splicing, MATS), followed by rMAPS2 (RNA map analysis) (Hwang et al. 2020; Y. Wang et al. 2024). This integrated approach detects differential splicing events, and then generates visual maps illustrating the spatial distribution of RNA binding protein (RBP) motifs, and finally ranks RBPs based on motif density score and p-value (Park et al. 2016). Through this in-silico analysis, we identified a subset of RBPs with significantly differential binding in splicing events altered by PRMT1 (p&lt;0.00001) (Supplemental Table S3). To pinpoint the most pertinent RBPs, we cross-referenced this significant RBP list with the previously identified six PRMT1-dependent and CNCC-enriched splicing regulators (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure-4A</xref>). SFPQ emerged as the prime candidate, boasting the highest motif scores and the lowest P-values (Supplemental Figure-S1A-E, Supplemental Table S4).</p>

<p>Subsequently, we set out to determine whether SFPQ is methylated by PRMT1 in the craniofacial structures. Employing the proximity ligation assay (PLA), a technique designed for the in-situ detection of protein modifications, we probed the E13.5 embryo sections with anti-SFPQ and anti-methyl-arginine ADMA antibodies utilizing the PLA kit, which revealed the presence of methylated SFPQ as distinct green punctate staining. Within the craniofacial complex, a substantial presence of SFPQ methylation was observed in the mandibular processes at E13.5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure-4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4Ca-d</xref>). In <italic>Prmt1</italic> CKO embryos, the signal of methyl-SFPQ showed marked diminishment within the CNCC-derived mesenchyme region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure-4Ce-h</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). The same analysis was conducted in the maxillary regions, which demonstrated robust SFPQ methylation in the control group and a dramatic reduction of methylation in <italic>Prmt1</italic> CKO embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure-4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4Ea-h</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). This CNCC-specific deletion of PRMT1 only reduced SFPQ methylation in the CNCCs, as non-CNCC lineages within the epithelium continued to display methyl-SFPQ signals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure-4Ga-f</xref>, Supplemental Figure-S2). These findings establish SFPQ’s methylation within the craniofacial complex as a PRMT1-dependent phenomenon.</p>
<p>PRMT1-induced methylation controls the activity of splicing regulators by modifying their stability, subcellular distribution, or RNA binding ability (Rho et al. 2007). We then proceeded to examine whether SFPQ protein expression was regulated by PRMT1 in the craniofacial complex. In control embryos, SFPQ exhibited prominent expression in CNCCs and mainly localized in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure-4Ha-c</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4Ja-c</xref>). In <italic>Prmt1</italic>-deficient CNCCs, the protein’s expression level witnessed a significant reduction within the mandibular and maxillary processes (Figure-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4K</xref>). A corroborating Western blot (WB) analysis using tissues from the craniofacial structures, including facial and anterior skull regions of embryonic heads, confirmed this decline in SFPQ expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure-4L</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4M</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PRMT1 methylates SFPQ and promotes SFPQ protein expression in the craniofacial complex.</p>

<title>PRMT1-SFPQ pathway regulates the splicing of matrix genes in CNCCs</title>
<p>To investigate the role of SFPQ in intron retention and gene expression within CNCCs, we isolated primary CNCCs from control (<italic>Wnt1-Cre; Td</italic>) embryos at E13.5 and enriched CNCCs by Td+ signal using cell sorting. Within a day, Td+ CNCCs were transfected with control or two independent SFPQ siRNAs to deplete SFPQ, and then poly(A)+ mRNA was purified followed by sequencing. To determine whether these primary isolated CNCCs retained CNCC characteristics after siRNA-mediated knockdown, the expression of CNCC markers <italic>Twist1, Sox10, Msx1, Snai2,</italic> and <italic>Tfap2a</italic> was examined (Achilleos and Trainor 2012; Ishii et al. 2012), which demonstrates that the CNCC marker expression in siRNA-transfected CNCCs after isolation from E13.5 embryos is comparable to that in fresh isolated CNCCs from E13.5 or E15.5 embryos (Supplemental Figure-S3), validating CNCC identity and supporting this method as a feasible approach for mechanistic study of CNCCs using developmental stage-specific embryos. Subsequently, using sequencing data from these siRNA-transfected CNCCs, we conducted bioinformatic analyses of differentially retained introns and differentially expressed genes between control and <italic>Sfpq</italic>-depleted CNCCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure-5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Genes with differential intron retention were assessed by IRI analysis, which revealed elevated intron retention in 397 (siSFPQ #1 vs. siCont) or 388 (siSFPQ #2 vs. siCont) genes and reduced intron retention in 129 (siSFPQ #1 vs. siCont) or 151 (siSFPQ #2 vs. siCont) genes caused by <italic>Sfpq</italic> depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure-5A</xref>). Genes showing increased IR in <italic>Sfpq</italic> depleted CNCCs encompassed “proteoglycan metabolic process” and “proteoglycan biosynthesis process”, which included GAG degradation genes, and “connective tissue development”, which includes ECM genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure-5Ca</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5Cb</xref>). <italic>Sfpq</italic> depletion also led to downregulation of 269 (siSFPQ #1 vs. siCont) or 232 (siSFPQ #2 vs. siCont) genes, among which 81 (siSFPQ #1 vs. siCont) and 60 (siSFPQ #2 vs. siCont) genes overlapped with elevated IR, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure-5B</xref>). To determine intron retention co-regulated by SFPQ and PRMT1, we cross-analyzed genes with increased intronic expression in <italic>Sfpq</italic>-depleted CNCCs and <italic>Prmt1</italic>-deficient CNCCs and uncovered a partial overlap of a total of 64 genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure-5D</xref>), represented by matrix genes <italic>Col4a2, Adam12, Ntn1, App, St6galnac3, Galnt11 Galnt10,</italic> and <italic>Asph</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure-5E</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). The elevation of intronic retention in these genes also correlated with a reduction of gene expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure-5G</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). GO analysis of differentially downregulated genes by both SFPQ-specific siRNAs (cluster 4 within the heatmap) further confirmed extracellular matrix, extracellular structure, and adhesion as the top categories (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure-5I</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>). These data indicate that depletion of SFPQ is sufficient to enhance IR and reduce gene expression for a cluster of matrix genes, suggesting loss of SFPQ as a regulatory mechanism for these genes in <italic>Prmt1</italic>-deficient CNCCs and SFPQ as a downstream effector for PRMT1 in CNCCs.</p>

<title>Disturbance of SFPQ activity impaired splicing of long genes and long introns</title>
<p>SFPQ predominantly binds to intronic regions and regulates splicing (Hosokawa et al. 2019).

<p>To understand the molecular basis of how SFPQ targets these matrix, Wnt and neuronal genes and introns, we evaluated characteristics shared among SFPQ-regulated genes, and recognized that they are either long genes (&gt;100kd in length) or retain long introns (&gt;10kd in length). Of note, Wnt pathway gene <italic>Wwox</italic> and matrix genes <italic>St6galnac3</italic> are 913kd and 526kd in length, and their retained introns are extremely long, 639kd and 215kd, respectively, in contrast to a median intron size of 0.6 ∼ 2.4kb in the mouse genome (Hong, Scofield, and Lynch 2006). In the human and mouse genome, long genes mostly occur because of long introns (Breschi, Gingeras, and Guigó 2017; Lopes et al. 2021). We then plotted the length of SFPQ-regulated genes against genes across the genome and uncovered that the genes with increased IR in <italic>Sfpq</italic> depleted CNCCs have a median length of ∼100kb, which is much longer than genes in the control groups, where the medial length is around 10kb (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure-7D</xref>).

<title>SFPQ depletion reduces matrix and Wnt signaling gene expression via IR-induced NMD</title>
<p>In <italic>Sfpq</italic>-depleted CNCCs, retained introns contain PTCs within their open reading frames, suggesting PTC-triggered NMD as the mechanism of degradation (Supplemental Table S5).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we revealed prevalent intron retention within CNCCs during embryonic development and propose intron-regulated expression of long genes as a causal mechanism for craniofacial deformity. This study demonstrated PRMT1-SFPQ pathway-regulated intron retention and subsequent control of matrix and Wnt pathway component gene expression during craniofacial development. Genetic deletion of <italic>Prmt1</italic> or depletion of <italic>Sfpq</italic> in CNCCs caused aberrant intron retention in genes encoding matrix proteins and Wnt pathway components, which triggers NMD to degrade these transcripts. Matrix and Wnt pathway genes regulated by this mechanism share a common feature as long genes with a median length of 100kb, suggesting higher susceptibility of these genes to perturbation of the PRMT1-SFPQ pathway or splicing defects during craniofacial development. IR has been linked to diseases like cancer and autoimmune diseases (Dvinge and Bradley 2015). This study on PRMT1-regulated IR in controlling the expression of matrix genes in CNCCs, to our knowledge, is the first characterization of IR in craniofacial development. Many of the PRMT1-SFPQ pathway regulated matrix and Wnt signaling genes are linked to congenital conditions. For example, in our study, the long gene <italic>Wwox</italic> exhibited increased retention of long introns (introns 3 and 4) and decreased expression upon <italic>Prmt1/Sfpq</italic> deficiency. In human patients, pathogenic variants of <italic>WWOX</italic> with large deletion within long introns have been associated with epileptic encephalopathy syndrome manifesting shared facial phenotype (Dvinge and Bradley 2015). This deletion within these long introns may affect SFPQ binding or splicing that impairs PRMT1-SFPQ pathway-regulated splicing of human <italic>WWOX</italic> genes. Another SFPQ target, <italic>Ptk7</italic> is associated with neural tube defects and scoliosis (Berger, Wodarz, and Borchers 2017). <italic>SFPQ</italic> itself is linked to neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease, and was recently identified by a transcriptional study as a genetic regulator in CNCCs (Feng et al. 2021).</p>
<p>A main feature shared by SFPQ-regulated genes in CNCCs is gene length, with a median length of 100kb in contrast to a median length of ∼10kb across the genome. In each SFPQ-regulate gene, introns exhibiting the highest retention also tend to be longer introns, for example, intron 4 of <italic>Col4a2</italic> which displayed the most dramatic increase in intronic reads within <italic>Col4a2</italic> boasts a length of 45kb. Increased IR in neuronal and immune cells has been proposed to facilitate a rapid response to external stimuli, allowing a time frame shorter than that required for de novo transcription (Ni et al. 2016; Mauger, Lemoine, and Scheiffele 2016). Thus, during craniofacial morphogenesis, IR represents a developmental process that enables rapid production of proteins when they are required. Long genes over 100kb in length require two to several hours for transcription, which presents a challenge for the fast tempo during embryogenesis. This intron-regulated mechanism allows cells to control the rate of production post-transcriptionally, and to achieve rapid protein translation without waiting for the time period required for transcription. Long genes regulated by this mechanism are highly enriched in matrix pathways, and responsible for the production of building blocks for bone, cartilage, and connective tissues. Since spliceosomopathies preferentially affect the craniofacial skeleton and limb, intron retention-regulated matrix expression provides mechanistic insights for the higher susceptibility of these tissue types to spliceosome dysfunction.</p>
<p>PRMT1 is a critical regulator of RNA splicing. In mammalian cells, it methylates over forty splicing factors to modulate protein stability and subcellular localization, thereby influencing their accessibility to mRNA (Thandapani et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2022). PRMT1-catalyzed arginine methylation also affects their RNA binding affinity and specificity, altering their activity and the splicing product (Fedoriw et al. 2019; Fong et al. 2019). Therefore, it is not surprising that the disruption of this methyltransferase leads to splicing defects. However, the elevation of IR in this study presented a distinct role for PRMT1 in CNCCs. IR has been linked to diseases like cancer and autoimmune diseases (Dvinge and Bradley 2015). This study on PRMT1-regulated IR in controlling the expression of matrix genes in CNCCs, to our knowledge, is the first characterization of IR in craniofacial development, adding developmental insights to our knowledge of the roles of IR in pathophysiology. Manipulation of SFPQ expression (knockdown with 50% efficiency) demonstrated that SFPQ shares around 10% overlap with PRMT1 in IR-regulated neural crest gene expression. Given that PRMT1 methylates over 40 splicing factors in mammals and many of these splicing factors are abundantly expressed in embryonic CNCCs, we expect that PRMT1-governed splicing will be mediated by multiple splicing regulators besides SFPQ. The functional network of splicing regulation during craniofacial morphogenesis awaits further investigation.</p>
<p>We recognized SFPQ as a key PRMT1 substrate in CNCCs based on an unbiased in silico analysis and further validation in the mandibular and maxillary primordium. This aligns with previous work demonstrating that PRMT1 is responsible for the association of SFPQ with mRNA in mRNP complexes in mammalian cells (Snijders et al. 2015). Our findings on altered neuronal genes in <italic>Sfpq-</italic>depleted CNCCs also echoed previous reports in which SFPQ regulates many neuronal genes involved in axon extension, branching, viability, and synaptogenesis via direct binding to their intronic regions (Ruskin, Zamore, and Green 1988; Cosker et al. 2016) and loss of SFPQ function compromises splicing patterns, especially the accurate splicing of long introns in embryonic brain and AML samples (Luisier et al. 2018; Taylor et al. 2022; Thomas-Jinu et al. 2017). Findings in this study further revealed previously unappreciated roles of SFPQ in the regulation of matrix genes through IR, which bear functional significance in CNCCs and craniofacial skeleton formation.</p>
<p>Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the PRMT1-SFPQ pathway regulates intron retention in CNCCs and suggests intron retention in long introns or long genes as a mechanism that controls matrix and Wnt signaling gene expression during craniofacial morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Bioinformatic Analysis of Differentially Regulated Genes (DEG) and differential Intron Retention (IR)</title>
<p>The sequencing quality of RNA-seq libraries was assessed by FastQC v0.11.8 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). Low-quality bases and adapters were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.6.7,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/</ext-link>). The reads were mapped to mouse genome mm10 using hisat2 (v2.1.0) (Kim et al. 2019). The mapped sam files from hisat2 were converted to bam files which were then further turned to sorted bam files by samtools (v1.7) (Li et al. 2009). Mapped reads were then processed by htseq-count (v1.99.2) to calculate the read count of all genes (Anders, Pyl, and Huber 2015). The sorted bam files were then given to IRTools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/WeiqunPengLab/IRTools/">https://github.com/WeiqunPengLab/IRTools/</ext-link>) to calculate the IR of each gene and the read count of genes’ constitutive intronic regions (CIRs) and constitutive exonic regions (CERs). The expression level of a gene was expressed as TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million) value. EdgeR was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by requiring ≥ 1.5-fold expression changes and adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 (Robinson, McCarthy, and Smyth 2010). The intron retention index (IRI) of a gene is defined as the ratio of the overall read density of its CIRs to the overall read density of its CERs. Genes with 0&lt; IRI &lt;1 and CER expression greater than 1 were selected to identify differential IR genes. Student’s t-test was used to identify differential IR genes by requiring ≥ 1.5-fold log2(IR) changes and p-value &lt; 0.05. Gene Ontology analysis was done by DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp</ext-link>) and Metascape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1">https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1</ext-link>) (Sherman et al. 2022; Zhou et al. 2019).

Wang et al. 2024). rMATS was first used to identify differential alternative splicing events between wild type and PRMT1 CKO samples by requiring FDR &lt; 0.05.

<p>The central finding of the current manuscript is that embryonic ablation of PRMT1 results in a craniofacial phenotype that is primarily linked to downstream intron splicing defects. This manuscript is one of several to underscore the relative importance of intron splicing to gene expression regulation during development, and moreover, to recapitulate splicing-related craniofacial defects. Specifically, authors introduce a regulatory axis consisting of PRMT1-SFPQ that directs mechanisms of long intron retention. This finding represents a significant contribution to our understanding of splicing regulation, in the sense that it highlights the regulatory impact that post-translational modification of splicing-related proteins can have on intron processing. Further, it emphasizes the importance of extending the study of splicing regulation beyond core components of the spliceosome, to include their upstream regulators as well.</p>
<p>The significance of neural crest cells in the development of craniofacial structures has long been considered a major contributor to developmental phenotypes. This specific symptomology is heavily associated with spliceosomopathies, wherein disruption of spliceosome components is the primary mechanism of disease pathogenesis. Thus, the PRMT1 associated phenotype is noteworthy. The role of PRMT1 in methylating downstream splicing factors introduces a new avenue of research focused on the mechanisms of spliceosome component activation and their effects on splicing. The strength of the current study lies in their establishing the molecular mechanism through which PRMT1 could alter craniofacial development through regulation of the transcriptome, but the data presented to support the claim that a PRMT1-SFPQ axis directly regulates intron retention of the relevant gene networks should be robust and with multiple forms of clear validation. For example, elevated intron retention findings are based on the intron retention index, and according to the manuscript, are assessed considering the relative expression of exons and introns from a given transcript. However, delineating between intron retention and other forms of alternative splicing (i.e., cryptic splice site recognition) requires a more comprehensive consideration of the intron splicing defects that could be represented in data. A certain threshold of intron read coverage (i.e., the percent of an intron that is covered by mapped reads) is needed to ascertain if those that are proximal to exons could represent alternative introns ends rather than full intron retention events. In other words, intron retention is a type of alternative splicing that can be difficult to analyze in isolation given the confounding influence of cryptic splicing and cryptic exon inclusion. If other forms of alternative splicing were assessed and not detected, more confident retention calls can be made.</p>
<p>While data presented to support the PRMT1-SFPQ activation axis is quite compelling, that this is directly responsible for the elevated intron retention remains enigmatic. First, in characterizing their PRMT1 knockout model, it is unclear whether the elevated intron retention events directly correspond to downregulated genes. Moreover, intron splicing is a well-documented node for gene regulation during embryogenesis and in other proliferation models, and craniofacial defects are known to be associated with 'spliceosomopathies'. However, reproduction of this phenotype does not suggest that the targets of interest are inherently splicing factors, and a more robust assessment is needed to determine the exact nature of alternative splicing in this system. Because there are several known splicing factors downstream of PRMT1 and presented in the supplemental data, the specific attribution of retention to SFPQ would be additionally served by separating its splicing footprint from that of other factors that are primed to cause alternative splicing.</p>
<p>Clarifying the relationship between SFPQ and splicing regulation is important given that the observed splicing defects are incongruous with published data presented by Takeuchi et al., (2018) regarding SFPQ control of neuronal apoptosis in mice. In this system, SFPQ was more specifically attributed to the regulation of transcription elongation over long introns and its knockout did not result in significant splicing changes. Thus, to establish the specificity for the SFPQ in regulating these retention events, authors would need to show that the same phenotype is not achieved by mis-regulation of other splicing factors. That the authors chose SFPQ based on its binding profile is understandable but potentially confounding given its mechanism of action in transcription of long introns (Takeuchi 2018). Because mechanisms and rates of transcription can influence splicing and exon definition interactions, the role of SFPQ as a transcription elongation factor versus a splicing factor is inadequately disentangled by authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Lima et al examines the role of Prmt1 and SFPQ in craniofacial development. Specifically, the authors test the idea that Prmt1 directly methylates specific proteins that results in intron retention in matrix proteins. The protein SFPQ is methylated by Prmt1 and functions downstream to mediate Prmt1 activity. The genes with retained introns activate the NMD pathway to reduce the RNA levels. This paper describes an interesting mechanism for the regulation of RNA levels during development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The phenotypes support what the authors claim that Prmt1 is involved in craniofacial development and splicing. The use of state-of-the-art sequencing to determine the specific genes that have intron retention and changes in gene expression is a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Some of the data seems to contradict the conclusions. And it is unclear how direct the relationships are between Prmt1 and SFPQ.</p>
