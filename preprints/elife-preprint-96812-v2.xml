<title>Abstract</title><p>The adaptive T cell response is accompanied by continuous rewiring of the T cell’s electric and metabolic state. Ion channels and nutrient transporters integrate bioelectric and biochemical signals from the environment, setting cellular electric and metabolic states. Divergent electric and metabolic states contribute to T cell immunity or tolerance. Here, we report that neuritin (Nrn1) contributes to tolerance development by modulating regulatory and effector T cell function. Nrn1 expression in regulatory T cells promotes its expansion and suppression function, while expression in the T effector cell dampens its inflammatory response. Nrn1 deficiency causes dysregulation of ion channel and nutrient transporter expression in Treg and effector T cells, resulting in divergent metabolic outcomes and impacting autoimmune disease progression and recovery. These findings identify a novel immune function of the neurotrophic factor Nrn1 in regulating the T cell metabolic state in a cell context-dependent manner and modulating the outcome of an immune response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Peripheral T cell tolerance is important in restricting autoimmunity and minimizing collateral damage during active immune reactions and is achieved via diverse mechanisms, including T cell anergy, regulatory T (Treg) cell mediated suppression, and effector T (Te) cell exhaustion or deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">ElTanbouly and Noelle, 2021</xref>). Upon activation, Treg and conventional T cells integrate environmental cues and adapt their metabolism to the energetic and biosynthetic demands, leading to tolerance or immunity. Tolerized versus responsive T cells are characterized by differential metabolic states. For example, T cell anergy is associated with reduced glycolysis, whereas activated T effector cells exhibit increased glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Geltink et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Peng and Li, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>). Cellular metabolic states depend on electrolyte and nutrient uptake from the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chapman and Chi, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Olenchock et al., 2017</xref>). Ion channels and nutrient transporters, which can integrate environmental nutrient changes, affect the cellular metabolic choices and impact the T cell functional outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babst, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bohmwald et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ramirez et al., 2018</xref>). Each cell’s functional state would correspond with a set of ion channels and nutrient transporters supporting their underlying metabolic requirements. The mechanisms coordinating the ion channel and nutrient transporter expression changes to support the adaptive T cell functional state in the immune response microenvironment remain unclear.</p>
<p>Nrn1, also known as candidate plasticity gene 15 (CPG15), was initially discovered as a neurotrophic factor linked to the neuronal cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nedivi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhou and Zhou, 2014</xref>). It is highly conserved across species, with 98% overall homology between the murine and human protein. Nrn1 plays multiple roles in neural development, synaptic plasticity, synaptic maturation, neuronal migration, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cantallops et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Javaherian and Cline, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nedivi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Putz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zito et al., 2014</xref>). In the immune system, Nrn1 expression has been found in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg and follicular regulatory T cells (Tfr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gonzalez-Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Vahl et al., 2014</xref>), T cells from transplant tolerant recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lim et al., 2013</xref>), anergized CD8 cells or CD8 cells from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in mouse tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schietinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Schietinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Singer et al., 2016</xref>), and in human Treg infiltrating breast cancer tumor tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Plitas et al., 2016</xref>). Soluble Nrn1 can be released from Tfr cells and act directly on B cells to suppress autoantibody development against tissue-specific antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gonzalez-Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>). Despite the observation of Nrn1 expression in Treg cells and T cells from tolerant environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gonzalez-Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Plitas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schietinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Schietinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Singer et al., 2016</xref>), the roles of Nrn1 in T cell tolerance development and Treg cell function have not been explored, and functional mechanism of Nrn1 remains elusive. This study demonstrates that the neurotrophic factor Nrn1 can moderate T cell tolerance and immunity through both Treg and Te cells, impacting Treg cell expansion and suppression while controlling inflammatory response in Te cells.</p>

<title>Nrn1 expression and function in T cell anergy</title>
<p>To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying peripheral tolerance development, we utilized a system we previously developed to identify tolerance-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). We compared the gene expression patterns associated with either a T effector/memory response or tolerance induction triggered by the same antigen but under divergent <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen-specific TCR transgenic CD4 T cells were adoptively transferred into WT recipients with subsequent HA-Vaccinia virus (VacHA) infection to generate T effector/memory cells while tolerogenic HA-specific CD4s were generated by transfer into hosts with transgenic expression of HA as self-antigen (C3-HA mice, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>.)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). One of the most differentially expressed genes upregulated in the anergy-inducing condition was Nrn1. Nrn1 expression was significantly higher among cells recovered from C3-HA hosts vs. cells from VacHA infected mice at all time points tested by qRT- PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To further confirm the association of Nrn1 expression with T cell anergy, we assessed Nrn1 expression in naturally occurring anergic polyclonal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Ta), which can be identified by surface co-expression of Folate Receptor 4 (FR4) and the ecto-5’-nucleotidase CD73 (Ta, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>FR4<sup>hi</sup>CD73<sup>hi</sup> cells)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kalekar et al., 2016</xref>). Nrn1 expression was significantly higher in Ta than in naïve CD4 (Tn, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>-</sup>FR4<sup>-</sup>CD73<sup>-</sup>) and antigen- experienced cells (Te, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>FR4<sup>-</sup>CD73<sup>-</sup>) under steady-state conditions measured by both qRT-PCR and western blot (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Given that Treg cells, like anergic cells, have roles in maintaining immune tolerance, we queried whether Nrn1 is also expressed in Treg cells. Nrn1 expression can be detected in nTreg and induced Treg (iTreg) cells generated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To evaluate Nrn1 expression under pathological tolerant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cuenca et al., 2003</xref>), we evaluated Nrn1 expression in T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Nrn1 expression in murine Treg cells and non-Treg CD4<sup>+</sup> cells from tumor infiltrates were compared to the Treg cells and non-Treg CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from peripheral blood. Nrn1 mRNA level was significantly increased among tumor-associated Treg cells and non-Treg CD4 cells compared to cells from peripheral blood (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with our findings in the mouse tumor setting, the Treg and non-Treg T cells from human breast cancer infiltrates reveal significantly higher Nrn1 expression compared to the peripheral blood Treg and non-Treg cells (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Plitas et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may pass through an effector stage after activation before reaching an anergic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Opejin et al., 2020</xref>). To evaluate the potential role of Nrn1 expression in T cell tolerance development, we further examined Nrn1 expression kinetics after T cell activation. Nrn1 expression was significantly induced after CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Using an Nrn1-specific, monoclonal antibody, Nrn1 can be detected on activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). The significant enhancement of Nrn1 expression after T cell activation suggests that Nrn1 may contribute to the process of T cell tolerance development and/or maintenance. Although Treg cells express Nrn1, we were not able to consistently detect substantial cell surface Nrn1 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref>), likely due to Nrn1 being produced in a soluble form or cleaved from the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gonzalez-Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand the functional implication of Nrn1 expression in immune tolerance, we analyzed Nrn1-deficient (Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fujino et al., 2011</xref>). In the first evaluation of the Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> colony, Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> mice had consistently reduced body weight compared to heterozygous Nrn1<sup>+/-</sup> and WT (Nrn1<sup>+/+</sup>) mice (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref>). The lymphoid tissues of Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were comparable to their Nrn1<sup>+/-</sup> and WT counterparts except for a slight reduction in cell number that was observed in the spleens of Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, likely due to their smaller size (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B</xref>). Analysis of thymocytes revealed no defect in T cell development (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2C</xref>), and a flow cytometric survey of the major immune cell populations in the peripheral lymphoid tissue of these mice revealed similar proportions of CD4, CD8 T cells, B cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2D</xref>). Similarly, no differences were found between the proportions of anergic and Treg cells in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>, Nrn1<sup>+/-</sup> and WT mice (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2E, F</xref>), suggesting that Nrn1 deficiency does not significantly affect anergic and Treg cell balance under steady state. Additionally, histopathology assessment of lung, heart, liver, kidney, intestine and spleen harvested from 13 months old Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and Nrn1<sup>+/-</sup> littermates did not reveal any evidence of autoimmunity (data not shown). The comparable level of anergic and Treg cell population among Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>, Nrn1<sup>+/-</sup> and WT mice and lack of autoimmunity in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> aged mice suggest that Nrn1 deficiency is not associated with baseline immune abnormalities or overt dysfunction. Due to the similarity between Nrn1<sup>+/-</sup> and WT mice, we have used either Nrn1<sup>+/-</sup> or WT mice as our control depending on mice availability and referred to both as “ctrl” in the subsequent discussion.</p>
<p>To evaluate the relevance of Nrn1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance development, we employed the classic peptide-induced T cell anergy model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Vanasek et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, we crossed OVA antigen-specific TCR transgenic OTII mice onto the Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> background. Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII<sup>+</sup> or control_OTII<sup>+</sup> (ctrl_OTII<sup>+</sup>) cells marked with Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> congenic marker (Thy1.1<sup>+</sup>Thy1.2<sup>-</sup>), were co-transferred with polyclonal WT Tregs (marked as Thy1.1<sup>-</sup>thy1.2<sup>+</sup>), into TCRα knockout mice (TCRα<sup>-/-</sup>), followed by injection of soluble OVA peptide to induce clonal anergy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chappert and Schwartz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Martinez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mercadante and Lorenz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). On day 13 after cell transfer, the proportion and number of OTII cells increased in the Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII compared to the ctrl_OTII hosts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Moreover, Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII cells produced increased IL2 than ctrl_OTII upon restimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Anergic CD4 Tconv cells can transdifferentiate into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> pTreg cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">DL, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kalekar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kuczma et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with reduced anergy induction, the proportion of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> pTreg among Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). In parallel with the phenotypic analysis, we compared gene expression between Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII and ctrl_OTII cells by RNA Sequencing (RNASeq). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the gene set on T cell anergy was enriched in ctrl relative to Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Safford et al., 2005</xref>). Also, consistent with the decreased transdifferentiation to Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells, the Treg signature gene set was prominently reduced in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII cells relative to the ctrl (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). Anergic T cells are characterized by inhibition of proliferation and compromised effector cytokines such as IL2 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Choi and Schwartz, 2007</xref>). The increased cell expansion and cytokine production in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII cells and the reduced expression of anergic and Treg signature genes all support the notion that Nrn1 is involved in T cell anergy development.</p>
<p>Anergic T cells are developed after encountering antigen, passing through a brief effector stage, and reaching an anergic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chappert and Schwartz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Silva Morales and Mueller, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zha et al., 2006</xref>). Enhanced T cell activation, defective Treg cell conversion or expansion, and heightened T effector cell response may all contribute to defects in T cell anergy induction and/or maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chappert and Schwartz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kalekar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Silva Morales and Mueller, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zha et al., 2006</xref>). We first examined early T cell activation to understand the underlying cause of defective anergy development in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cells showed reduced T cell activation, as evidenced by reduced CellTrace violet dye (CTV) dilution, activation marker expression, and Ca<sup>++</sup> entry after TCR stimulation (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3A, B, C</xref>). The reduced early T cell activation observed in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> CD4 cells suggests that the compromised anergy development in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII cells was not caused by enhanced early T cell activation. The defective pTreg generation and/or enhanced effector T cell response may contribute to compromised anergy development.</p>

<title>Compromised Treg expansion and suppression in the absence of Nrn1</title>
<p>The significant reduction of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> pTreg among Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII cells could be caused by the diminished conversion of Foxp3<sup>-</sup> Tconv cells to pTreg and/or diminished Treg cell expansion and persistence. To understand the cause of pTreg reduction in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup>_OTII cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), we turned to the induced Treg (iTreg) differentiation system to evaluate the capability of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg development and expansion in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Similar proportions of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl cells under the iTreg culture condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that Nrn1 deficiency does not significantly impact Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cell differentiation. To examine the capacity of iTreg expansion, Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl iTreg cells were restimulated with anti-CD3, and we found reduced live cells over time in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> iTreg compared to the ctrl (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The reduced live cell number in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> was accompanied by reduced Ki67 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Although Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> iTregs retained a higher proportion of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells three days after restimulation, however, when taking into account the total number of live cells, the actual number of live Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells was reduced in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Treg cells are not stable and are prone to losing Foxp3 expression after extended proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Floess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). The increased proportion of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells was consistent with reduced proliferation observed in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells.

<p>The defects observed in iTreg cell expansion <italic>in vitro</italic> prompt further examination of Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> nTreg expansion and suppression function <italic>in vivo.</italic> To this end, we tested the suppression capacity of congenically marked (CD45.1<sup>-</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> or ctrl nTreg toward CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>-</sup> responder cells in Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).

Although the CD45.1<sup>-</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup> Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl cell proportions were not significantly different among hosts splenocytes at day 7 post transfer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells retained a higher Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cell proportion and reduced Ki67 expression comparing to the ctrl (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, H). These findings were similar to our observation of iTreg cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, D). Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> Tregs also showed reduced suppression toward CD45.1<sup>+</sup> responder cells, evidenced by increased CD45.1<sup>+</sup> proportion and cell number in host splenocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the functional implication of Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> Treg suppression in disease settings, we challenged the Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> hosts with the poorly immunogenic B16F10 tumor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).

<p>The “Neurotransmitter receptor activity involved in regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential” gene set was significantly enriched under resting and activation conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C and D</xref>; <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Figure 3-figure supplement Table 3</xref>). The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunits Gria2 and Gria3 are the major components of this gene set and showed increased expression in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). AMPAR is an ionotropic glutamate receptor that mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission in neurons. Nrn1 has been reported as an accessory protein for AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pandya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schwenk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Subramanian et al., 2019</xref>), although the functional implication of Nrn1 as an AMPAR accessory protein remains unclear. The enrichment of MP related gene set prompted the examination of electric status, including MP level and ion channel expressions. We examined the relative MP level by FLIPR MP dye, a lipophilic dye able to cross the plasma membrane, which has been routinely used to measure cell MP changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dvorak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Joesch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Whiteaker et al., 2001</xref>). When the cells are depolarized, the dye enters the cells, causing an increase in fluorescence signal. Conversely, cellular hyperpolarization results in dye exit and decreased fluorescence. Compared to ctrl iTreg cells, Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> exhibits significant hyperpolarization under both resting and activation conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistent with the MP change, the “MF_metal ion transmembrane transporter activity” gene set, which contains 436 ion channel related genes, was significantly enriched and showed a different expression pattern in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> iTregs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref> and B). The changes in cellular MP and differential expression of ion channel and transporter genes in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> implicate the role of Nrn1 in the balance of electric state in the iTreg cell.</p>
<p>MP changes have been associated with changes in amino acid (AA) transporter expression and nutrient acquisition, which in turn influences cellular metabolic and functional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). To understand whether MP changes in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> are associated with changes in nutrient acquisition and thus the metabolic state, we surveyed AA transport-related gene expression using the “Amino acid transmembrane transporter activity” gene set and found differential AA transporter gene expression between Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl iTregs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Upon AA entry through transporters, the electric charge carried by these molecules may transiently affect cell membrane potential. Differential AA transporter expression patterns may have different impacts on cellular MP upon AA entry. Thus, we loaded Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl iTreg with FLIPR MP dye in the HBSS medium and tested cellular MP change upon exposure to MEM AAs. The AA-induced cellular MP change was reduced in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> compared to the ctrl, reflective of differential AA transporter expression patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Electrolytes and AAs entry are critical regulators of mTORC1 activation and T cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saravia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sinclair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). We examined mTORC1 activation at the protein level by evaluating mTOR and S6 phosphorylation via flow cytometry. We found reduced phosphorylation of mTOR and S6 in activated Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> iTreg cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1C). We further performed a nutrient- sensing assay to evaluate the role of ion and nutrient entry in mTORC1 activation. Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl iTreg cells were starved for one hour in a nutrient-free buffer, followed by adding RPMI medium with complete ions and nutrients, and cultured for two more hours. While adding the medium with nutrients clearly increased the mTOR and S6 phosphorylation, the degree of change was significantly less in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> than in the ctrl (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Consistently, GSEA on Hallmark gene sets reveal reduced gene set enrichment relating to the mTORC1 signaling, corroborating the reduced pmTOR and pS6 detection in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Moreover, Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells also showed reduced expression of glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation related gene sets under both resting and activating conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating changes in metabolic status. Since previous work has identified mTORC1 to be an important regulator of aerobic glycolysis and given that our GSEA data suggested changes in glycolysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Salmond, 2018</xref>), we performed the seahorse assay and confirmed reduced glycolysis among Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Examination of mitochondrial bioenergetic function revealed a similar oxygen consumption rate (OCR) between Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus, Nrn1 expression can affect the iTreg electric state, influence ion channel and nutrient transporter expression, impact nutrient sensing, modulate metabolic state, and contribute to Treg expansion and suppression function.</p>
<p>We have observed significant changes in the electrical and metabolic state among Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> iTreg compared to the ctrl. Because Nrn1 can be expressed on the cell surface, one question arises whether the changes observed in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells were caused by the functional deficiency of Nrn1 or arose secondary to potential changes in cell membrane structure originating at the Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> naïve T cell stage. To answer this question, we first examined potential changes in electrical and metabolic status among Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> naïve CD4 T cells. The Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> naïve CD4 T cells showed similar resting MP and AA-induced MP changes compared to the ctrl cells (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-supplement figure 2 A, B</xref>). We also observed comparable glycolysis and mitochondrial bioenergetic function between Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> naïve CD4 T cells and the ctrl (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-supplement figure 2 C</xref>). These results suggest the electrical and metabolic state in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> T cells are comparable to the ctrl cells at the naïve cell stage. To further rule out the possibility that the observed changes in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> iTreg are secondary to developmental structural changes, not Nrn1 functional deficiency, we differentiated WT T cells in the presence of antagonistic Nrn1 antibody and compared to the WT ctrl and Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> iTreg cells. WT iTreg cells differentiated in the presence of Nrn1 antibody exhibit reduced resting MP, similar to Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-supplement figure 2 D</xref>). Moreover, upon restimulation, WT iTreg cells differentiated under Nrn1 antibody blockade showed a similar phenotype as Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, with reduced live cell number, reduced Ki67 expression, and increased Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cell proportion among live cells (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-supplement figure 2 E, F</xref>). These results suggest that Nrn1 functional deficiency likely contributes to the electrical and metabolic state change observed in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> iTreg cells.</p>

<p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can pass through an effector stage on their way to an anergic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang et al., 2003</xref>).

<p>To identify molecular changes responsible for Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> Te phenotype, we compared gene expression between Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl Te cells by RNASeq. GSEA and Cytoscape analysis identified a cluster of gene sets on “membrane repolarization”, suggesting that Nrn1 may also be involved in the regulation of MP under Te context (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Figure 4-figure supplement Table 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). While the “membrane_repolarization” gene set was enriched in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), the “Neurotransmitter receptor activity involved in regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential” gene set was no longer enriched, but the AMPAR subunit Gria3 expression was still elevated in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> Te cells (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although MP in Te cells was comparable between Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>), the “MF_metal ion transmembrane transporter activity” gene set was significantly enriched in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> with different gene expression patterns (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicative of different electric state. The significant enrichment of ion channel related genes in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> Te cells was in line with the finding in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> iTreg cells, supporting the notion that Nrn1 expression may be involved in ion balance and MP modulation.</p>
<p>Examination of nutrient transporters revealed that the “Amino acid transmembrane transporter activity” gene set was significantly enriched in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells than the ctrl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). We further examined AA entry-induced cellular MP change in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl Te cells. AA entry caused enhanced MP change among Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> Te than the ctrl, in contrast with the finding under iTreg cell context (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). Along with the enrichment of ion channel and nutrient transporter genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I and J</xref>), we found enhanced mTOR and S6 phosphorylation in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> Te cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-supplemental figure 1C). We also compared nutrient sensing capability between Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl Te cells, as outlined in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>. Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> Te showed increased mTOR and S6 phosphorylation after sensing ions and nutrients in RPMI medium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>), confirming the differential impact of ions and nutrients on Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl Te cells. GSEA on Hallmark collection showed enrichment of mTORC1 signaling gene set (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>), corroborating with increased pmTOR and pS6 detection in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> Te cells. Along with increased mTORC1 signaling, Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> Te cells also showed enrichment of gene sets on glycolysis and proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>). Evaluation of metabolic changes by seahorse confirmed increased glycolysis in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, while the OCR remained comparable between Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4N</xref>).

<title>Nrn1 deficiency exacerbates autoimmune disease</title>
<p>The coordinated reaction of Treg and Te cells contributes to the outcome of the immune response. We employed the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS) to evaluate the overall impact of Nrn1 on autoimmune disease development. Upon EAE induction, the incidence and time to EAE onset in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were comparable to the ctrl mice, but the severity, disease persistence, and body weight loss were increased in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Exacerbated EAE was associated with significantly increased CD45<sup>+</sup> cell infiltrates, increased CD4<sup>+</sup> cell number, increased proportion of MOG- specific CD4 cells, and reduced proportion of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD4 cells in the Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> spinal cord (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>T cell expansion and functional development depend on adaptive electric and metabolic changes, maintaining electrolyte balances, and appropriate nutrient uptake. The negative charge of the plasma membrane, ion channel expression pattern, and function are key characteristics associated with the cellular electric state in different systems, impacting cell proliferation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blackiston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Emmons-Bell and Hariharan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kiefer et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Monroe and Cambier, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sundelacruz et al., 2009</xref>). The electrolytes and nutrients, including amino acids, metabolites, and small peptides transported through ion channels and nutrient transporters, are also regulators and signaling agents impacting the choice of cellular metabolic pathways and functional outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hamill et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we report that the neurotropic factor Nrn1 expression influences CD4 T cell MP, ion channels, and nutrient transporter expression patterns, contributing to differential metabolic states in Treg and Te cells. Nrn1 deficiency compromises Treg cell expansion and suppression while enhancing Te cell inflammatory response, exacerbating autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>Bioelectric controls have been defined as a type of epigenetics that can control information residing outside of genomic sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Levin, 2021</xref>). The sum of ion channels and pump activity generates the ionic gradient across the cell membrane, establishing the MP level and bioelectric state. Cells with the same MP can have different ion compositions, and the same ion channel may have a differential impact on MP when in combination with different ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdul Kadir et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this notion, Nrn1 deficiency has differential impacts on the cellular electric state under the Treg and Te cells with different ion channel combinations. Altered MP was detected in Nrn1 deficient Treg cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), while comparable MP was observed between Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl Te cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). The MP level determined by ion channels and pump activity can influence the nutrient transport pattern, establishing a metabolic and functional state matching the MP level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blackiston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Emmons-Bell and Hariharan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kiefer et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Monroe and Cambier, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sundelacruz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Yu et al. reported that macrophage MP modulates plasma membrane phospholipid dynamics and facilitates cell surface retention of nutrient transporters, thus supporting nutrient uptake and impacting the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Nutrient transport is key to T cell fate decisions and has been considered signal 4 to T cell fate choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chapman and Chi, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Long et al., 2021</xref>). The changes in ion channel related gene expression and MP level in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells were accompanied by differential expression of AA transporter genes and nutrient sensing activity that impacted mTORC1 pathway activation and cellular glycolytic state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These results corroborate previous observations on the connection of MP in nutrient acquisition and metabolic change and support the role of Nrn1 in coordinating T cell electric and metabolic adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yu et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Although Nrn1, as a small GPI-anchored protein, does not have channel activity by itself, it has been identified as one of the components in the AMPAR complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pandya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schwenk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Subramanian et al., 2019</xref>). Na<sup>+</sup>-influx through the AMPA type ionotropic glutamate receptor can quickly depolarize the postsynaptic compartment and potentiate synaptic transmission in neurons. We have observed increased expression of AMPAR subunits in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> iTreg and Te cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>), implicating potential change in AMPAR activity in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> under Treg and Te cell context. Glutamate secreted by proliferating cells may influence T cell function through AMPAR. High glutamate levels are detected at the autoimmune disease site and tumor interstitial fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bonnet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">McNearney et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, AMPAR has been implicated in exacerbating autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bonnet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sarchielli et al., 2007</xref>). The increased expression of AMPAR subunits in Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> cells supports the potential connection of Nrn1 and AMPAR and warrants future investigation on the possibility that Nrn1 functions through AMPAR, impacting T cell electric change. Besides AMPAR, Nrn1 has been reported to function through the insulin receptor and fibroblast growth factor pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shimada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yao et al., 2012</xref>). Subramanian et al have suggested that rather than a traditional ligand with its cognate receptor, Nrn1 may function as an adaptor to receptors to perform diverse cell-type-specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Subramanian et al., 2019</xref>). Our results do not rule out these possibilities.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that Nrn1 expression in Treg and Te cells can impact cellular electric state, nutrient sensing, and metabolism in a cell context dependent manner. The predominant enrichment of ion channel related gene sets in both Treg and Te cell context underscores the importance of Nrn1 in modulating ion balance and MP. The changes in ion channels and nutrient transporter expression in Treg and Te cells and associated functional consequences highlight the importance of Nrn1 in coordinating cell metabolic changes through channels and transporters during the adaptive response and contribute to the balance of tolerance and immunity.</p>

<p>To measure Ca<sup>++</sup> flux, CD4 cells were loaded with Fluo4 dye at 2μM in the complete cell culture medium at 37°C for 30min. Cells were washed and resuspended in HBSS Ca<sup>++</sup> free medium and plated into 384 well glass bottom assay plate (minimum of 4 wells per sample). Ca<sup>++</sup> flux was measured using the FDSS6000 system (Hamamatsu Photonics). To measure store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), after the recording of the baseline T cells Ca<sup>++</sup> fluorescent for 1min, thapsigargin (TG) was added to induce store Ca<sup>++</sup> depletion, followed by the addition of Ca<sup>++</sup> 2μM in the extracellular medium to observe Ca<sup>++</sup> cellular entry.</p>
<p>Membrane potential was measured using FLIPR Membrane Potential Assay kit (Molecular devices) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Specifically, T cells were loaded with FLIPR dye by adding an equal volume of FLIPR dye to the cells and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Relative membrane potential was measured by detecting FLIPR dye incorporation using flow cytometry.</p>
<p>To measure changes of MP after AAs transport, T cells were plated and loaded with FLIPR dye at 37°C for 30 minutes in 384 well glass bottom assay plate (minimum of 6 wells per sample). After recording the baseline T cell MP for 1min, MEM AAs (Gibco MEM Amino Acids #11130-051) were injected into each well, and the change of MP was recorded for 5 min.</p>

<title>Extracellular flux analysis (Seahorse assays)</title>
<p>Real-time measurements of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were performed using an XFe-96 Bioanalyser (Agilent). T cells (2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well; minimum of four wells per sample) were spun into previously poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates (Seahorse) in complete RPMI-1640 medium. ECAR was measured in RPMI medium in basal condition and in response to 25mM glucose, 1μM oligomycin, and 50mM of 2-DG (all from Sigma Aldrich). OCR was measured in RPMI medium supplemented with 25mM glucose, 2mM L- glutamine, and 1mM sodium pyruvate, under basal condition and in response to 1μM oligomycin, 1.5μM of carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) and 1μM of rotenone and antimycin (all from Sigma Aldrich).</p>

<title>RNAseq and data analysis</title>
<p>RNASeq samples: 1. Anergic T cell analysis. Ctrl and Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> OTII cells were sorted from the host mice (n=3 per group). 2. iTreg cell analysis. In vitro differentiated Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl iTreg cells were replated in resting condition (IL2 100u/ml) or stimulation condition (IL2 100u/ml and aCD3 5ug/ml). Cells were harvested 20 hr after replating for RNASeq analysis. 3. Effector T cells. Nrn1<sup>-/-</sup> and ctrl CD4 Tn cells were activated for 3 days (aCD3 5ug/ml, aCD28 2ug/ml), followed by replating in IL2 medium (100u/ml). Te cells were harvested two days after replating and subjected to RNASeq analysis.</p>
<p>RNA-sequencing analysis was performed by Admera Health (South Plainfield, NJ). Read quality was assessed with FastQC and aligned to the Mus Musculus genome (Ensembl GRCm38) using STAR aligner (version 2.6.0)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Aligned reads were counted using HTSeq (version 0.9.0)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anders et al., 2015</xref>), and the counts were loaded into R (The R Foundation). DESeq2 package (version 1.24.0)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used to normalize the raw counts. GSEA was performed using public gene sets (HALLMARK, and GO)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). Cytoscape was used to display enriched gene sets cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Statistical analysis. All numerical data were processed using Graph Pad Prism 10. Data are expressed as the mean +/- the SEM, or as stated. Statistical comparisons were made using an unpaired student t-test or ANOVA with multiple comparison tests where 0.05 was considered significant, and a normal distribution was assumed. The p values are represented as follows: * p&lt;0.05; ** p&lt;0.01; *** p&lt;0.001, **** p&lt;0.0001.</p>

<p>The neurotrophic factor Neuritin can moderate T-cell tolerance and immunity through both regulatory T (Treg) and effector T cells, promoting Treg cell expansion and suppression while dampening effector T cells to mediate the inflammatory response. Neuritin expression influences the membrane potential, ion channels, and nutrient transporter expression patterns of CD4+ T cells, contributing to differential metabolic states in Treg and effector T cells. These findings are <bold>solid</bold> and <bold>important</bold> for understanding immune regulation involving Treg cells and effector T cells.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Yu et al seeks to investigate the role of neuritin (Nrn1), identified as a marker of anergic cells, in the biology of regulatory (Tregs) and conventional (Tconv) T cells. Although the role of Nrn1 expressed by Tregs has already been explored (Gonzalez-Figueroa 2021 cited in the manuscript), this manuscript shows original new data suggesting that this molecule would be important in promoting Treg function and inhibiting Tconv effector function by acting at the level of membrane potential and molecule transport across the plasma membrane. However, multiple models have been used, but none has been studied thoroughly enough to provide really conclusive and unambiguous data. For example, 5 different models were used to study T cells in vivo. It would have been preferable to use fewer, but to go further in the study of mechanisms. In the absence of more in-depth study, the conclusions drawn by the authors are often open to questions. Major points concern the fact that there are not enough biological replicates for most experiments and some critical controls and data are lacking. Also, the authors have used iTregs rather than nTregs for many experiments (see below). This is unfortunate because the role of neuritin in T cell biology studied here is new and interesting.</p>
<p>Major points (in the order in which they appear in the text).</p>
<p>(1) A real weakness of this work is the fact that in most of the results shown, there are few biological replicates with differences that are often small between Ctrl and Nrn1 -/-. The systematic use of student's t test may lead to think that the differences are significant, which is often misleading given the small number of samples, which makes it impossible to know whether the distributions are Gaussian and whether a parametric test can be used. RNAseq bulk data are based on biological duplicates, which is open to criticism.</p>
<p>
(2) The authors use Nrn1+/+ and Nrn1+/- cells indiscriminately as control cells on the basis of similar biology between Nrn1+/+ and Nrn1+/- cells at homeostasis. However, it is quite possible that the Nrn1+/- cells have a phenotype in situations of in vitro activation or in vivo inflammation (cancer, EAE). It would be important to discriminate Nrn1+/- and Nrn1+/+ cells in the data or to show that both cell types have the same phenotype in these conditions too.</p>
<p>
(3) Fig 1A-D. Since the authors are using the Nrp1 KO mice, it would be important to confirm the specificity of the anti-Nrn1 mAb by FACS. Once verified, it would be important to add FACS results with this mAb in Figs 1A-C to have single-cell and quantitative data as well.</p>
<p>
(4) Fig 1E-H. The authors assume that this immunization protocol induces anergic cells, but they provide no experimental evidence for this. It would be useful to show that T cells are indeed anergic in this model, especially those that are OVA-specific. The lack of IL-2 production by Cltr cells could be explained by the presence of fewer OVA-specific cells, rather than by an anergic status.</p>
<p>
(5) Fig 2A-C and Fig 3. The use of iTregs to try to understand what is happening in vivo is problematic. iTregs are cells that have probably no equivalent in vivo, and so may have no physiological relevance. In any case, they are different from pTreg cells generated in vivo. Working with pTreg may be challenging, that is why I would suggest to generate data with purified nTreg.</p>
<p>
(6) Fig 2D-L. The model is designed to study the role of Nrn1 in nTreg. However, the % of Foxp3+ among CD45.2 nTreg cells fell to 5-15% of CD4+ cells (Fig 2F). Since we do not know what is the % of Foxp3 among the injected cells, we do not know whether this very low % is due to very high Treg instability or to preferential expansion of contaminating Tconvs. It is possible that the % of Tconv contaminant is high since Treg were sorted using beads and not FACS on some experiments. As it is very likely that there are Tconv contaminants that would be Nrn1-/- in the group transferred with Nrn1-/- &quot;nTreg&quot;, the higher tumor rejection could be due to an overactivation of Nrn1-/- Tconvs (rather than a defect in Nrn1-/- Treg function).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript explores the role of Nrn1 in T cell tolerance. A previous study has demonstrated that Nrn1 is up-regulated in the Tfr fraction of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells. These authors now confirm expression of Nrn1 in iTregs as well as report here that Nrn1 is also greatly over-expressed in anergic CD4 T cells, and this is the stepping off point for this investigation.</p>
<p>Most remarkably, experiments show that anergy induction is defective when T cells cannot express Nrn1. Furthermore, differentiation to a Foxp3+ iTreg phenotype is inhibited in the absence of Nrn1, and the iTregs that do develop appear functionally defective. On the other hand, the differentiation and expansion of Teff cells appears to be enhanced following deletion of Nrn1. With such defects in anergy induction as well as dysregulated Treg and Teff cell survival and function, auto reactive effector T cell activation becomes unrestrained and Nrn1-/- mice are more susceptible to severe EAE development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The characterizations of T cell Nrn1 expression both in vitro and in vivo are comprehensive and convincing. The author's use of both Nrn1-/- T cells as well as anti-Nrn1 neutralizing Ab to achieve similar results is a strength. The in vivo functional studies of anergy development, Treg suppression, and EAE development are also well performed and strengthen the notion that Nrn1 is an important regulator of CD4 responsiveness.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness of this study stems from a lack of a clear molecular mechanism involving Nrn1. Previous studies of Nrn1 have suggested its role as a soluble molecule involved in intracellular communication, perhaps influencing cellular ion channel function and/or triggering downstream NFAT and mTOR activation. However, a unique receptor for Nrn1 has not been discovered and it remains unclear whether it acts in a cell-intrinsic or cell-extrinsic fashion for any particular cell type.</p>
<p>Data shown here provide evidence for alterations in the electrical and metabolic state of iTreg and Teff cells when the Nrn1 gene is deleted. Nrn1-/- Tregs and Teff cells each express a unique pattern of genes associated with Neurotransmitter receptor, Metal ion transmembrane transport, Amino acid transport, and mTORC1 signaling activities, different than that seen in wild-type mice. It remains unclear how Nrn1 reinforces the membrane potential and facilitates aerobic glycolysis during and after iTreg differentiation, and yet suppresses the membrane potential and restrains aerobic glycolysis during Teff cell differentiation. Importantly, naive cells lacking Nrn1 expression show normal electrical and metabolic behaviors.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p>
<p>We thank you for sending our manuscript for the second round of review.  We are encouraged by the comments from reviewer #2 that our supplementary work on naïve T cells and antibody blockade work satisfied their previous concerns and is important for our work.</p>
<p>The Editors raised concerns that we have shared preliminary data on Nrn1 and AMPAR double knockout mice.  We apologize for our enthusiasm for these studies.  Because of the publication model by eLife, we shared that data not because we needed to persuade the reviewer for publication purposes but rather to agree with the reviewer that the molecular target of Nrn1 is important, and we are progressing in understanding this subject.</p>
<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p><bold>To Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Thank you for your thorough review and comments on our work, which you described as “the role of neuritin in T cell biology studied here is new and interesting.”.  We have summarized your comments into two categories: biology and investigation approach, experimental rigor, and data presentation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Biology and Investigation approach comments:</p>
<p>(1) Questions regarding the T cell anergy model:</p>
<p>Major point “(4) Figure 1E-H. The authors assume that this immunization protocol induces anergic cells, but they provide no experimental evidence for this. It would be useful to show that T cells are indeed anergic in this model, especially those that are OVA-specific. The lack of IL-2 production by Cltr cells could be explained by the presence of fewer OVA-specific cells, rather than by an anergic status.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>T cell anergy is a well-established concept first described by Schwartz’s group. It refers to the hyporesponsive T cell functional state in antigen-experienced CD4 T cells (Chappert and Schwartz, 2010; Fathman and Lineberry, 2007; Jenkins and Schwartz, 1987; Quill and Schwartz, 1987).  Anergic T cells are characterized by their inability to expand and to produce IL2 upon subsequent antigen re-challenge. In this paper, we have borrowed the existing in vivo T cell anergy induction model used by Mueller’s group for T cell anergy induction (Vanasek et al., 2006).  Specifically, Thy1.1+ Ctrl or Nrn1-/- TCR transgenic OTII cells were co-transferred with the congenically marked Thy1.2+ WT polyclonal Treg cells into TCR-/- mice.  After anergy induction, the congenically marked TCR transgenic T cells were recovered by sorting based on Thy1.1+ congenic marker, and subsequently re-stimulation ex vivo with OVA323-339 peptide. We evaluated the T cell anergic state based on OTII cell expansion in vivo and IL2 production upon OVA323-339 restimulation ex vivo.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“The authors assume that this immunization protocol induces anergic cells, but they provide no experimental evidence for this.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because the anergy model by Mueller's group is well established (Vanasek et al., 2006), we did not feel that additional effort was required to validate this model as the reviewer suggested. Moreover, the limited IL2 production among the control cells upon restimulation confirms the validity of this model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“The lack of IL-2 production by Cltr cells could be explained by the presence of fewer OVAspecific cells, rather than by an anergic status”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Cells from Ctrl and Nrn1-/- mice on a homogeneous TCR transgenic (OTII) background were used in these experiments. The possibility that substantial variability of TCR expression or different expression levels of the transgenic TCR could have impacted IL2 production rather than anergy induction is unlikely.</p>
<p>Overall, we used this in vivo anergy model to evaluate the Nrn1-/- T cell functional state in comparison to Ctrl cells under the anergy induction condition following the evaluation of Nrn1 expression, particularly in anergic T cells.  Through studies using this anergy model, we observed a significant change in Treg induction among OTII cells. We decided to pursue the role of Nrn1 in Treg cell development and function rather than the biology of T cell anergy as evidenced by subsequent experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points “(6) On which markers are anergic cells sorted for RNAseq analysis?”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Cells were sorted out based on their congenic marker marking Ctrl or Nrn1-/- OTII cells transferred into the host mice.  We did not specifically isolate anergic cells for sequencing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Question regarding the validity of iTreg differentiation model.</p>
<p>Major point: “(5) Figure 2A-C and Figure 3. The use of iTregs to try to understand what is happening in vivo is problematic. iTregs are cells that have probably no equivalent in vivo, and so may have no physiological relevance. In any case, they are different from pTreg cells generated in vivo. Working with pTreg may be challenging, that is why I would suggest generating data with purified nTreg. Moreover, it was shown in the article of Gonzalez-Figueroa 2021 that Nrn1-/- nTreg retained a normal suppressive function, which would not be what is concluded by the authors of this manuscript. Moreover, we do not even know what the % of Foxp3 cells is in the iTreg used (after differentiation and 20h of re-stimulation) and whether this % is the same between Ctlr and Nrn1 KO cells.”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for their feedback. While it is true that iTregs made in vitro and in vivo generated pTregs display several distinctions (e. g., differences in Foxp3 expression stability, for example), we strongly disagree with this statement by Revieweer#1 “The use of iTregs to try to understand what is happening in vivo is problematic. iTregs are cells that have probably no equivalent in vivo, and so may have no physiological relevance.”  The induced Treg cell (iTreg) model was established over 20 years ago (Chen et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2002), and the model is widely adopted with over 2000 citations. Further, it has been instrumental in understanding different aspects of regulatory T cell biology (Hurrell et al., 2022; John et al., 2022; Schmitt and Williams, 2013; Sugiura et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Because we have observed reduced pTreg generation in vivo, we choose to use the in vitro iTreg model system to understand the mechanistic changes involved in Treg cell differentiation and function, specifically, neuritin’s role in this process. We have made no claim that iTreg cell biology is identical to pTreg generated in vivo or nTreg cells. However, the iTreg culture system has proved to be a good in vitro system for deciphering molecular events involved in complex processes. As such, it remains a commonly used approach by many research groups in the Treg cell field (Hurrell et al., 2022; John et al., 2022; Sugiura et al., 2022). Moreover, applying the iTreg in vitro culture system has been instrumental in helping us identify the cell electrical state change in Nrn1-/- CD4 cells and revealed the biological link between Nrn1 and the ionotropic AMPA receptor (AMPAR), which we will discuss in the subsequent discussion. It is technically challenging to use nTreg cells for T cell electrical state studies due to their heterogeneous nature from development in an in vivo environment and the effect of manipulation during the nTreg cell isolation process, which can both affect the T cell electrical state.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Moreover, it was shown in the article of Gonzalez-Figueroa 2021 that Nrn1-/- nTreg retained a normal suppressive function, which would not be what is concluded by the authors of this manuscript.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have also carried out nTreg studies in vitro in addition to iTreg cells. Similar to Gonzalez-Figueroa et al.'s findings, we did not observe differences in suppression function between Nrn1-/- and WT nTreg using the in vitro suppression assay. However, Nrn1-/- nTreg cells revealed reduced suppression function in vivo (Fig. 2D-L). In fact, Gonzalez-Figueroa et al. observed reduced plasma cell formation after OVA immunization in Treg-specific Nrn1-/- mice, implicating reduced suppression from Nrn1-/- follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells. Thus, our observation of the reduced suppression function of Nrn1-/- nTreg toward effector T cell expansion, as presented in Fig. 2D-L, does not contradict the results from Gonzalez-Figueroa et al. Rather, the conclusions of these two studies agree that Nrn1 can play important roles in immune suppression observable in vivo that are not captured readily by the in vitro suppression assay.</p>

<p>“Moreover, we do not even know what the % of Foxp3 cells is in the iTreg used (after differentiation and 20h of re-stimulation) and whether this % is the same between Ctlr and Nrn1 KO cells.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have stated in the manuscript on page 7 line 208 that “Similar proportions of Foxp3+ cells were observed in Nrn1-/- and Ctrl cells under the iTreg culture condition, suggesting that Nrn1 deficiency does not significantly impact Foxp3+ cell differentiation”. In the revised manuscript, we will include the data on the proportion of Foxp3+ cells before iTreg restimulation.</p>

<p>(3) Confirmation of transcriptomic data regarding amino acids or electrolytes transport change</p>
<p>Minor point“(3) Would not it be possible to perform experiments showing the ability of cells to transport amino acids or electrolytes across the plasma membrane? This would be a more interesting demonstration than transcriptomic data.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate Review# 1’s suggestion regarding “perform experiments showing the ability of cells to transport amino acids or electrolytes across the plasma membrane”.  We have indeed already performed such experiments corroborating the transcriptomics data on differential amino acid and nutrient transporter expression. Specifically, we loaded either iTreg or Th0 cells with membrane potential (MP) dye and measured MP level change after adding the complete set of amino acids (complete AA).  Upon entry, the charge carried by AAs may transiently affect cell membrane potential. Different AA transporter expression patterns may show different MP change patterns upon AA entry, as we showed in Author response image 1. We observed reduced MP change in Nrn1-/- iTreg compared to the Ctrl, whereas in the context of Th0 cells, Nrn1-/- showed enhanced MP change than the Ctrl. We can certainly include these data in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(4) EAE experiment data assessment</p>
<p>Minor point ”(5) Figure 5F. How are cells re-stimulated? If polyclonal stimulation is used, the experiment is not interesting because the analysis is done with lymph node cells. This analysis should either be performed with cells from the CNS or with MOG restimulation with lymph node cells.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the EAE study, the Nrn1-/- mice exhibit similar disease onset but a protracted non-resolving disease phenotype compared to the WT control mice.  Several reasons may contribute to this phenotype: 1. Enhanced T effector cell infiltration/persistence in the central nervous system (CNS); 2. Reduced Treg cell-mediated suppression to the T effector cells in the CNS; 3. Protracted non-resolving inflammation at the immunization site has the potential to continue sending T effector cells into CNS, contributing to persistent inflammation. Based on this reasoning, we examined the infiltrating T effector cell number and Treg cell proportion in the CNS.  We also restimulated cells from draining lymph nodes close to the inflammation site, looking for evidence of persistent inflammation.  When mice were harvested around day 16 after immunization, the inflammation at the local draining lymph node should be at the contraction stage.  We stimulated cells with PMA and ionomycin intended to observe all potential T effector cells involved in the draining lymph node rather than only MOG antigen-specific cells.  We disagree with Reviewer #1’s assumption that “This analysis should either be performed with cells from the CNS or with MOG restimulation with lymph node cells.”. We think the experimental approach we have taken has been appropriately tailored to the biological questions we intended to answer.</p>

<p>General comments:</p>
<p>“However, it is disappointing that reading this manuscript leaves an impression of incomplete work done too quickly.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We were discouraged to receive the comment, “this manuscript leaves an impression of incomplete work done too quickly.” Our study of this novel molecule began without any existing biological tools such as antibodies, knockout mice, etc.  Over the past several years, we have established our own antibodies for Nrn1 detection, obtained and characterized Nrn1 knockout mice, and utilized multiple approaches to identify the molecular mechanism of Nrn1 function. Through the use of the in vitro iTreg system described in this manuscript, we identified the association of Nrn1 deficiency with cell electrical state change, potentially connected to AMPAR function. We have further corroborated our findings by generating Nrn1 and AMPAR T cell specific double knockout mice and confirmed that T cell specific AMPAR deletion could abrogate the phenotype caused by the Nrn1 deficiency (see Support Figure 2).  We did not include the double knockout data in the current manuscript because AMPAR function has not yet been studied thoroughly in T cell biology, and we feel this topic warrants examination in its own right.  However, the unpublished data support the finding that Nrn1 modulates the T cell electrical state and, consequently, metabolism, ultimately influencing tolerance and immunity.  In its current form, the manuscript represents the first characterization of the novel molecule Nrn1 in anergic cells, Tregs, and effector T cells. While this work has led to several exciting additional questions, we disagree that the novel characterization we have presented Is incomplete. We feel that our present data set, which squarely highlights Nrn1’s role as an important immune regulator while shedding unprecedented light on the molecular events involved, will be of considerable interest to a broad field of researchers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Multiple models have been used, but none has been studied thoroughly enough to provide really conclusive and unambiguous data. For example, 5 different models were used to study T cells in vivo. It would have been preferable to use fewer, but to go further in the study of mechanisms.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have indeed used multiple in vivo models to reveal Nrn1's function in Treg differentiation, Treg suppression function, T effector cell differentiation and function, and the overall impact on autoimmune disease. Because the impact of ion channel function is often context-dependent, we examined the biological outcome of Nrn1 deficiency in several in vivo contexts.  We would appreciate it if Reviewer#1 would provide a specific example, given the Nrn1 phenotype, of how to proceed deeper to investigate the electrical change in the in vivo models.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Major points</p>
<p>(1) A real weakness of this work is the fact that in most of the results shown, there are few biological replicates with differences that are often small between Ctrl and Nrn1 -/-. The systematic use of student's t-test may lead to thinking that the differences are significant, which is often misleading given the small number of samples, which makes it impossible to know whether the distributions are Gaussian and whether a parametric test can be used. RNAseq bulk data are based on biological duplicates, which is open to criticism.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with Reviewer #1 on the question of statistical power and significance to our work. We have used 5-8 mice/group for each in vivo model and 3-4 technical replicates for the in vitro studies, with a minimum of 2-3 replicate experiments. These group sizes and replication numbers are in line with those seen in high-impact publications. While some differences between Ctrl and Nrn1-/- appear small, they have significant biological consequences, as evidenced by the various Nrn1-/- in vivo phenotypes. Furthermore, we believe we have subjected our data to the appropriate statistical tests to ensure rigorous analysis and representation of our findings.</p>
<p><bold>To Reviewer #2.</bold></p>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for the careful review of the manuscript. We especially appreciate the comments that “The characterizations of T cell Nrn1 expression both in vitro and in vivo are comprehensive and convincing. The in vivo functional studies of anergy development, Treg suppression, and EAE development are also well done to strengthen the notion that Nrn1 is an important regulator of CD4 responsiveness.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“The major weakness of this study stems from a lack of a clear molecular mechanism involving Nrn1. “</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully understand this comment from Reviewer #2. The main mechanism we identified contributing to the functional defect of Nrn1-/- T cells involves novel effects on the electric and metabolic state of the cells. Although we referenced neuronal studies that indicate Nrn1 is the auxiliary protein for the ionotropic AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) and may affect AMPAR function, we did not provide any evidence in this manuscript as the topic requires further in-depth study.</p>
<p>For the benefit of this discussion, we include our preliminary Nrn1 and AMPAR double knockout data (Author response image 2), which indicates that abrogating AMPAR expression can compensate for the defect caused by Nrn1 deficiency in vitro and in vivo. This preliminary data supports the notion that Nrn1 modulates AMPAR function, which causes changes in T cell electric and metabolic state, influencing T cell differentiation and function.</p>

<p>Ion channels can influence cell metabolism through multiple means (Vaeth and Feske, 2018; Wang et al., 2020). First, ion channels are involved in maintaining cell resting membrane potential. This electrical potential difference across the cell membrane is essential for various cellular processes, including metabolism (Abdul Kadir et al., 2018; Blackiston et al., 2009; Nagy et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2022). Second, ion channels facilitate the movement of ions across cell membranes. These ions are essential for various metabolic processes. For example, ions like calcium (Ca2+), potassium (K+), and sodium (Na+) play crucial roles in signaling pathways that regulate metabolism (Kahlfuss et al., 2020). Third, ion channel activity can influence cellular energy balance due to ATP consumption associated with ion transport to maintain ion balances (Erecińska and Dagani, 1990; Gerkau et al., 2019). This, in turn, can impact processes like ATP production, which is central to cellular metabolism. Thus, ion channel expression and function determine the cell’s bioelectric state and contribute to cell metabolism (Levin, 2021).</p>
<p>Because the AMPAR function has not been thoroughly studied using a genetic approach in T cells, we do not intend to include the double knockout data in this manuscript before fully characterizing the T cell-specific AMPAR knockout mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Although the biochemical and informatics studies are well-performed, it is my opinion that these results are inconclusive in part due to the absence of key &quot;naive&quot; control groups. This limits my ability to understand the significance of these data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Specifically, studies of the electrical and metabolic state of Nrn1-/- inducible Treg cells (iTregs) would benefit from similar data collected from wild-type and Nrn1-/- naive CD4 T cells.”</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. This comment reflects two concerns in data interpretation:</p>
<p>(1) Are Nrn1-/- naïve T cells fundamentally different from WT cells? Does this fundamental difference contribute to the observed electrical and metabolic phenotype in iTreg or Th0 cells? This is a very good question we will perform the experiments as the reviewer suggested. While Nrn1 is expressed at a basal (low) level in naïve T cells, deletion of Nrn1 may cause changes in naïve T cell phenotype.</p>
<p>(2) Is the Nrn1-/- phenotype caused by Nrn1 functional deficiency or due to the secondary effect of Nrn1 deletion, such as non-physiological cell membrane structure changes?</p>
<p>We have done the following experiment to address this concern.  We have cultured WT T cells in the presence of Nrn1 antibody and compared the outcome with Nrn1-/- iTreg cells (Figure 3-figure supplement 2D,E,F). WT iTreg cells under antibody blockade exhibited similar changes as Nrn1-/- iTreg cells, confirming the physiological relevance of the Nrn1-/- phenotype.</p>

<p>We appreciate Review# 1’s suggestion regarding “perform experiments showing the ability of cells to transport amino acids or electrolytes across the plasma membrane”.  We have used AAinduced cellular MP changes to confirm differential AA transporter expression patterns and their impact on cellular MP levels.  The data are included in the revised manuscript in Figure 3H and Figure 4K.</p>

<p>We appreciated Reviewer #1’s suggestion and have included the histogram staining data for Figure 3E. We have moved the original Figure 3H to the supplemental figure and included the histogram staining data in Figure 3-figure supplement 1C.  Similarly, we have included the histogram staining data in Figure 4-figure supplement 1C.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate Reviewer#2’s suggestion and have carried out experiments on naïve CD4 cells derived from Nrn1-/- and WT mice. We have compared membrane potential, AA-induced MP change between Nrn1-/- and WT naïve T cells, and the metabolic state of Nrn1-/- and WT naïve T cells by carrying out glucose stress tests and mitochondria stress tests using a seahorse assay.  Moreover, to investigate whether the phenotype revealed in Nrn1-/- CD4 cells was caused by a secondary effect of cell membrane structure change due to Nrn1 deletion, we carried out Nrn1 antibody blockade in WT CD4 cells and investigated the phenotypic change. These new results are included in Figure 3-figure supplement 2.</p>
