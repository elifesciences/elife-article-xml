<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Kainate receptors are key modulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. Different kainate receptor isoforms with distinct spatiotemporal expression have been identified in the brain. The GluK1-1 splice variant receptors, which are abundant in the adult brain, have extra fifteen amino acids inserted in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the receptor resulting from alternative splicing of exon 9. However, the functional implications of this post-transcriptional modification are not yet clear. We employed a multi-pronged approach using cryogenic electron microscopy, electrophysiology, and other biophysical and biochemical tools to understand the structural and functional impact of this splice insert in the extracellular domain of GluK1 receptors. Our study reveals that the splice insert alters the key gating properties of GluK1 receptors and their modulation by the cognate auxiliary Neuropilin and tolloid-like (Neto) proteins 1 and 2. Mutational analysis identified the role of key splice residues that influence receptor properties and their modulation. Furthermore, cryoEM structure of the variant shows that the presence of exon 9 in GluK1 does not affect the receptor architecture or domain arrangement in the desensitized state. Our study thus provides the first detailed structural and functional characterization of GluK1-1a receptors, highlighting the role of the splice insert in modulating receptor properties and their modulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kainate receptors (KARs), a subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), are required in the vertebrate brain for postsynaptic neurotransmission and presynaptic regulation of transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Erreger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huettner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lerma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pinheiro and Mulle, 2006</xref>). They are known to mediate characteristic small-amplitude excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) with slow kinetics in the hippocampal regions of the central nervous system compared to their counterparts, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Castillo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lerma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, they play a vital role in the maturation of neuronal circuits during development by interacting with G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lerma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>). Any functional defect predisposes the brain to various disorders such as autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bowie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Valbuena and Lerma, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Kainate receptors are composed of subunits from two gene families: low kainate affinity and high kainate affinity. The first gene family includes GluK1-GluK3, which can form both homomeric and heteromeric receptors with subunits from the same family or from the high-kainate affinity family. On the other hand, GluK4-GluK5 are high-affinity subunits that must assemble with low-affinity subunits in order to create functional receptors. The assembly of different subunits results in the formation of various receptor configurations, which contribute to the wide range of functional properties observed in kainate receptors.</p>
<p>The functional repertoire of kainate receptors is further enhanced by RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbon and Barlati, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seeburg, 2002</xref>) and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jaskolski et al., 2004</xref>). In particular, GluK1-containing KARs that are mainly present in the hippocampus, cortical interneurons, Purkinje cells, and sensory neurons, undergo alternative splicing and RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bernard and Khrestchatisky, 1994</xref>). Alternative splicing of the C-terminal domain that produces four isoforms, GluK1-a (shortest C-terminal), GluK1-b, GluK1-c, and GluK1-d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bettler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gregor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pinheiro and Mulle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sommer et al., 1992</xref>) has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ren et al., 2003</xref>). However, the functional impact of the mRNA splicing of the N-terminal domain (exon 9) resulting in isoforms GluK1-1 and GluK1-2, with GluK1-1 containing an additional 15 amino acids in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) is not understood. The splice junctions for GluK1-1 were reported to be more frequent than those for GluK1-2, and both variants showed similar expression in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Herbrechter et al., 2021</xref>). This 15-amino acid insertion in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) is exclusive to the GluK1 subunit and may impart unique properties to KARs containing this variant. Therefore, investigations of functional differences between GluK1 receptors with and without the 15 amino acid splice insert are necessary but missing in the field. Furthermore, the impact of the N-terminal splice insert in GluK1-1 receptors on its modulation by cognate auxiliary subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vinnakota et al., 2021</xref>), neuropilin and tolloid-like (Neto) proteins is also unknown.</p>
<p>Therefore, we conducted structure-function studies to understand the mechanisms of GluK1-1a receptor function and the effects of the ATD splice on receptor assembly, stability, and modulation by Neto proteins. Whole-cell and excised outside-out patch-clamp-based functional assays were performed to investigate the differences between the ATD splice variants GluK1-1a (exon 9) and GluK1-2a (lacking exon 9), and their modulation by Neto proteins. Furthermore, mutational analysis was performed to identify important splice residues that affect receptor functions and their modulation by Neto proteins. Additionally, we expressed and purified rat GluK1-1a from HEK293 GnTI-cells and determined the single-particle cryo-EM structures of the receptors trapped in the desensitized state to understand effect of splice on receptor architecture.</p>

<title>The ATD splice imparts functional diversity to GluK1 receptors</title>
<p>Previous studies on functional analysis of GluK1 receptors have primarily focused on GluK1-2 isoform that lacks the ATD splice insert. Therefore, we carried out extensive electrophysiological investigation to assay the functional differences between GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a. The only difference between these two variants is the presence of 15 amino acid (KASGEVSKHLYKVWK) insertion in the R2 subdomain (lower lobe) of the GluK1-1a ATD. We evaluated multiple gating properties of the two variants by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Interestingly, we observed that GluK1-1a receptors desensitize significantly slowly when compared to GluK1-2a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a: 5.21 ± 0.50 ms; GluK1-2a: 3.55 ± 0.23 ms **P=0.0092) on prolonged treatment with 10 mM glutamate (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>). We also tested receptor desensitization on application of saturating concentrations of kainate (1mM). Since the receptors displayed very slow desensitizing kainate currents, instead of the rate (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>), we calculated the % desensitization values at 1 s for comparison. We observed that the % desensitization with kainate was distinct for both ATD splice variants with significantly slower desensitization in the variant with the splice insert (GluK1-1a: 72.06 ± 2.33 %, GluK1-2a: 93.2 ± 0.55 ***P=0.0006) consistent with the glutamate evoked currents (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>Next, we evaluated glutamate sensitivity for the two variants. Dose-response experiments (glutamate, GluK1-1a: 0.1-2 mM, and GluK1-2a: 0.01-3 mM), showed a significantly lower potency of glutamate for GluK1-1a variant compared to the non-spliced form (EC<sub>50</sub> glutamate, GluK1-1a: 379.3 ± 52 µM, GluK1-2a: 187.7 ± 33 µM *P=0.0129 (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>). However, for high-affinity agonist kainate, the dose-response curves for both variants were similar likely indicating differences in the stability of glutamate <italic>versus</italic> the kainate-bound states in GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; Figure 2-figure supplement 1</italic></bold>). Thus, the potency of kainate (1mM) <italic>versus</italic> glutamate (10 mM) (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratio) is significantly higher for GluK1-1a compared to GluK1-2a (GluK1-1a: 1.51 ± 0.13, GluK1-2a: 0.56 ± 0.4 ****P&lt; 0.0001) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Further, we investigated the voltage-dependent polyamine block and found significant differences between the two variants. The presence of splice residues seemed to enhance outward currents at positive potentials in GluK1-1a compared to GluK1-2a (rectification index, +90mV /-90 mV; GluK1-1a = 0.96 ± 0.11; GluK1-2a = 0.61 ± 0.10 *P=0.0385) without affecting the reversal potential (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>). It’s unclear how splice residues situated ∼30 Å away from the TM domain affect the pore properties. This property is mainly affected by the TM2 region of the KAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bowie and Mayer, 1995</xref>), although a recent report in which the ATD of GluK2 was deleted showed enhanced rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2019</xref>). It’s likely that the presence of splice residues alters pore structure thereby affecting rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Perrais et al., 2009</xref>). We also carried out outside-out patch recordings to examine GluK1-1a receptors. However, we observed extremely weak electrical currents with low amplitudes when GluK1-1a was expressed in isolation. As a consequence, the data we obtained from these recordings did not provide reliable results for curve fitting or thorough analysis.</p>

<title>ATD splice insert impacts GluK1 receptor modulation by Neto proteins</title>
<p>Neto 1 and Neto 2 proteins significantly influence the surface expression, synaptic localization, and functional properties of the GluK1-2a receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>). It has been demonstrated that desensitization of GluK1-2a is accelerated by Neto1 but delayed by Neto2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, to understand the influence of these KAR auxiliary proteins on GluK1-1a, we performed an electrophysiological analysis of GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a receptors co-expressed with either Neto1 or Neto2. Co-expression of Neto1 hastened desensitization of GluK1-1a significantly but not of GluK1-2a at saturating glutamate concentrations (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 3.56 ± 0.22 ms **P=0.0090; GluK1-2a +Neto1: 4.32 ± 0.34 P=0.1495). On the other hand, Neto2 led to a ∼ 13.4-fold decrease in the desensitization rate of GluK1-1a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a: 5.21 ± 0.50 ms, +Neto2: 69.62 ± 9.98 ms **P=0.0024) while the desensitization rate of GluK1-2a was delayed only by ∼ 6.1-fold (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-2a: 3.55 ± 0.23 ms, +Neto2: 21.68 ± 2.64 ms **P=0.0017). Thus, while Neto1 accelerated the desensitization of GluK1-1a, Neto2 significantly slowed it at saturating glutamate concentrations. When both GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a were coexpressed with Neto2, the rate of desensitization for GluK1-1a was approximately 3.2 times slower compared to GluK1-2a (***P=0.0009) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>. Thus, the presence of splice insert leads to differential modulation of GluK1 desensitization by Neto proteins.</p>

<p>Moreover, Neto1 also enhanced the recovery from desensitization for both the variants (Ʈ<sub>Recovery</sub>, GluK1-1a: 3.53 ± 0.81 s, +Neto1: 0.68 ± 0.07 s *P=0.0390; GluK1-2a: 5.31 ± 0.50 s +Neto1: 1.15 ± 0.12 s ***P=0.0002). GluK1-1a recovers ∼ 1.7 times faster than GluK1-2a (*P=0.0125) when co-expressed with Neto1. Neto 2, on the other hand, slowed recovery for both variants to a similar extent (Ʈ<sub>Recovery</sub>, GluK1-1a: 3.53 ± 0.81 s, +Neto2: 8.32 ± 0.81 s **P=0.0044; GluK1-2a: 5.31 ± 0.50 s, +Neto2: 7.91 ± 0.71 s *P=0.0430) and did not show differential modulation (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>). In addition, both Neto1 and Neto2 increased the potency of glutamate for GluK1-1a by 9.7-fold (39 ± 10 µM) and 11.2-fold (34 ± 8 µM), respectively (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>; Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</italic></bold>). This is similar to the effect observed in GluK1-2 receptors whereby the glutamate EC<sub>50</sub> was shown to increase by Neto proteins [Neto1: 34-fold and Neto2: 7.5-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>) and Neto1/2: 10-30X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>)].</p>
<p>Since we observed a significant increase in the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1 due to the presence of splice insert, we next aimed to determine the influence of co-expressing Neto proteins on this parameter. Interestingly, we observed that while Neto 1 and Neto2 reduced the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1-1a (GluK1-1a: 1.51 ± 0.13, +Neto1: 1.25 ± 0.04 P=0.1500, +Neto2: 1.0 ± 0.07 **P=0.0090), they increased it for the non-spliced variant (GluK1-2a: 0.56 ± 0.04, +Neto1: 1.37 ± 0.12 ****P&lt;0.0001, +Neto2: 1.16 ± 0.04 ****P&lt;0.0001) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>; Figure 3-figure supplement 1B; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) highlighting the effect of splice residues. Interestingly, this differential modulation of the two variants by Neto proteins resulted in comparable I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the effects of Neto1 and Neto2 on the voltage dependent endogenous polyamine block since presence of splice insert had enhanced the outward rectification of GluK1. We observed that both Neto1 and Neto2 significantly enhanced the outward rectification of GluK1-2a (GluK1-2a: 0.61 ± 0.10, +Neto1: 1.14 ± 0.14 *P=0.0338, +Neto2: 1.37 ± 0.10 **P= 0.0022). However, they did not significantly increase it for GluK1-1a (GluK1-1a: 0.96 ± 0.11, +Neto1: 1.16 ± 0.09 P=0.1880, +Neto2: 0.80 ± 0.05 P=0.2401) and did not show differential modulation (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>We also calculated desensitization and deactivation kinetics in excised outside-out patches. However, GluK1-1a receptors when expressed alone, exhibited low peak amplitudes in outside-out recordings that prevented reliable calculation of gating kinetics. Hence, we only compared properties of receptors co-expressed with Neto proteins and the results obtained were consistent with those obtained from whole-cell recordings. Neto 2 slowed down desensitization of GluK1-1a by ∼ 1.5 times compared to GluK1-2a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto2: 31.89 ± 4.08 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto2: 20.91 ± 2.11; P=0.0665) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></italic></bold>). The desensitization rates for GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a receptors coexpressed with Neto1 was also significantly altered (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 4.83 ± 0.46 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto2: 2.84 ± 0.35; *P=0.0310) (<bold><italic>Figure G, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></italic></bold>. Faster solution exchange times in excised patch recordings allowed us to also measure deactivation kinetics using 1 ms application of 10 mM glutamate. Surprisingly, unlike desensitization, for receptors coexpressed with Neto2, the deactivation rate of GluK1-1a is significantly faster compared to that of GluK1-2a (Ʈ<sub>Dea</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto2: 5.18 ± 0.65 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto2: 10.74 ± 1.48; **P=0.0077). In contrast, Neto1 did not significantly alter deactivation kinetics of both GluK1 variant receptors (Ʈ<sub>Dea</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto2: 2.83 ± 0.20 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto2: 2.14 ± 0.37; P) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></italic></bold>). Thus, both whole-cell and excised patch recordings confirm the unique functional properties and differential modulation by Neto proteins due to the presence of fifteen amino acid insert in GluK1-1a receptors.</p>

<title>Mutations in GluK1-1a splice insert alter channel properties</title>
<p>Since our electrophysiological analysis revealed functional differences between the two splice variants and their modulation by Neto proteins, we generated receptors with splice residue mutants and performed functional assays to identify key residues. The splice insert (KASGEVSKHLYKVWK) is dominated by positively charged residues and contains four lysins and one histidine. We hypothesized that these charged residues might affect the interactions at the ATD-LBD interface and influence receptor functions. To investigate this, we prepared charge-reversal (K/H to E) and charge neutral mutants (K/H to A) <bold><italic>(Figure 4-table supplement 1)</italic></bold> and carried out functional assays. Our cell surface biotinylation assay showed that all mutants (glutamate or alanine) reached the cell surface efficiently (data not shown). However, the charge neutral mutants (K/H to A) gave either very low peak amplitudes (&lt;40 pA) or were not functional, and hence, were not included in the study. The charge reversal mutants K<sub>368</sub>-E, and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E revealed fascinating insights into the role of splice residues in altering GluK1 receptor properties (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></italic></bold>). Interestingly, both mutants, K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E exhibited a significantly slower rate of glutamate-evoked desensitization compared to wild-type GluK1-1a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a: 5.21 ± 0.50 ms; K<sub>368</sub>-E: 7.89 ± 1.14 ms *P=0.0334; K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E: 9.61 ± 1.47 *P=0.0290) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>. We also observed a significant delay in the recovery from desensitized state for K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant (K<sub>368</sub>: 5.61 ± 0.95 s *P=0.0417) compared to wild-type GluK1-1a. In addition, K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutant also exhibited a slowdown in the recovery (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E: 4.83 ± 0.31 s P=0.2774) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>). Our investigations of glutamate-and kainate-evoked responses for wild-type and mutant receptors considering their peak amplitudes (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>) revealed a significant decrease for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant (GluK1-1a: 1.51 ± 0.13; K<sub>368</sub>-E: 0.81 ± 0.13 **P=0.0037) and a reduction was observed for K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E receptors (1.17 ± 0.28 P=0.3733) compared to wild-type (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>). This observation is reciprocal to the effect of splice when compared to the non-spliced form indicating importance of these residues in influencing receptor desensitization and recovery. A similar reversal in trend was also observed for the measurements of rectification index for these mutants at positive and negative potentials (+90 mV and -90 mV). The rectification index was significantly reduced in the case of mutant K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E: 0.62 ± 0.14 *P=0.0499). Surprisingly, no outward rectification was observed for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant and must be further investigated to fully understand the reasons (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2C; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>GluK1-1a splice residues K<sub>368</sub>, K<sub>375</sub>, H<sub>376</sub>, K<sub>379</sub> and K<sub>382</sub> influence receptor modulation by Neto proteins</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the effects of splice mutants on receptor modulation by Neto proteins. To test whether mutations in splice residues disrupted interactions with Neto proteins, we performed receptor pull-downs using an antibody against the His-tag of the receptor. Our results showed that the mutant receptors could efficiently pull down Neto1 (detected using the Neto1 antibody) and Neto2 (detected using the GFP antibody) (<bold><italic>Figure 5-figure supplement 1)</italic></bold> suggesting that mutants don’t completely abolish GluK1-1a and Neto interactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we conducted experiments using electrophysiology to investigate whether coexpression of Neto proteins can restore the functionality and influence the functions of splice mutants. We observed that mutants K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E, desensitize significantly slower in the presence of Neto1 (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 3.56 ± 0.22 ms; K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto1: 4.37 ± 0.25 ms *P=0.0393; K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 3.74 ± 0.20 ms P=0.5390; K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 4.86 ± 0.67 ms P=0.1242) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2A; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>). This observation suggests that GluK1-1a modulation by Neto1 is influenced by the splice residues. On the other hand, Neto2 does not have a significant effect on the desensitization of these mutant receptors compared to wild-type-Neto2 (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2A; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>Similarly, K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants recover significantly faster from the desensitized state when coexpressed with Neto1. On the other hand, the recovery from the desensitized state is slower on coexpression of mutants with Neto2. Thus, the pattern of mutant receptor recovery from desensitized state is comparable to that of wild-type receptors, indicating that K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants do not influence receptor recovery (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, to determine whether the agonist efficacy of mutant receptors changed in the presence of Neto proteins, I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios were measured. Neto1 increased the agonist efficacy for the K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants (K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto1: 6.99 ± 0.47 ***P=0.0002; K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 1.69 ± 0.15 *P=0.0326; K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 1.15 ± 0.20 P=0.6495) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2B; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>). Similarly, Neto2 also considerably increased the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> values for mutant K<sub>368</sub>-E, rescuing the kainate efficacy (K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto2: 2.13 ± 0.13 ***P=0.0007), while it does not seem to have any significant effect on the K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutant (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto2: 0.86 ± 0.08 P=0.2045) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2B</italic></bold>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the observation above, our examination of the rectification index revealed a significant increase in outward current for K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant (K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto1: 2.84 ± 0.16 **P=0.0021). However, K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E did not show any difference compared to wild-type receptors, while K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E displayed a decrease in the outward current (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 1.23 ± 0.07 P=0.5351; K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 0.59 ± 0.13 **P=0.0081) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2C; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>). Interestingly, similar to Neto1, Neto2 was also able to rescue the outward rectification of the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant (K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto2: 0.76 ± 0.26), suggesting the importance of this residue in receptor modulation by Neto proteins (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2C; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Thus, our analysis of the gating properties of GluK1-1a mutants co-expressed with Neto proteins suggests that positively charged residues at positions 368, 375, 376, 379, and 382 in the splice insert influence receptor modulation by Neto proteins. While Neto1 could primarily influence receptors with K/H to E splice mutations, Neto 2 did not show such differential effects and could not influence the gating properties of the mutants studied here significantly. This suggests that while the modulation of the receptor by Neto 1 is affected by mutations in splice insert, the modulation by Neto 2 remains largely unaffected.</p>

<title>The structure of GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> shows an overall conserved architecture of desensitized state in kainate receptors</title>
<p>To evaluate the effects of splice residues on domain organization and structure of GluK1-1a receptors we pursued its structure determination <italic>via</italic> single particle cryo-EM.

In the case of iGluRs, the 38 amino acid residue preceding TM4, known as flip and flop isoforms, is a well-characterized module of AMPARs that affects receptor expression, and gating kinetics and is involved in various pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sommer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stine et al., 2001</xref>). For kainate receptors, the combination of different subunits (GluK1-GluK5) and post-transcriptional modifications, such as RNA editing and splicing provides a broader range of pharmacological and gating properties, which can affect synaptic physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kumar and Mayer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lerma, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Straub et al., 2016</xref>). GluK1 is the most diversified subunit of KARs due to multiple post-transcriptional events and has been widely studied as a potential drug target. A recent report highlighted the equivalent presence of GRIK1-1 (exon 9) with respect to GRIK1-2 (lacking exon 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Herbrechter et al., 2021</xref>). The dominant presence of the GRIK1-1 gene was also reported in retinal Off bipolar cells of ground squirrel. Interestingly, a N-terminal splice (exon 5) in a similar position has been observed in the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors which is known to influence the interactions at the ATD-LBD interface, and therefore proton sensitivity and channel kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Regan et al., 2018</xref>). However, this is the first report to decipher the role of the N-terminal splice insert in the kainate receptor family.</p>
<p>Our study compared the role of ATD splice in the kinetics of the GluK1-1a to a previously extensively characterized equivalent receptor without the splice region, GluK1-2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fisher and Fisher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sommer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Swanson and Heinemann, 1998</xref>). We found that the presence of splice insert affects the desensitization, recovery from desensitization, glutamate sensitivity, and channel rectification of the GluK1 receptor. Moreover, the splice also had a profound impact on desensitization with kainate, suggesting that the receptor follows different functional pathways for the two agonists. Our results showed a significant deviation from GluK1-2a in kainate-versus glutamate-evoked currents (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>), implying a role for splice residues in imparting higher efficacy for kainate. This likely explains the enhanced stability of the kainate-bound state in GluK1-1a, leading to slower desensitization compared to GluK1-2a. Our functional assays of GluK1-1a receptors co-expressed with Neto proteins showed that Neto1 facilitates faster recovery from the desensitized state, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>). However, we did not observe the fast onset of desensitization previously reported for GluK-2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, our results show that Neto2 retards recovery from desensitization for both GluK1 variants, contradicting earlier reports of conflicting recovery rates with Neto2 for GluK1-2a. This indicates that Neto1 and Neto2 may interact with both GluK1 variants in a mutually exclusive manner, or that the splice position may regulate the modulation behavior of Neto2 and Neto1. Our comparison of kainate and glutamate efficacies for the two variants also showed differential modulation by Neto proteins. Both Neto1 and Neto2 reduced the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1-1a, while they significantly increased the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1-2a, highlighting the impact of the splice insert on receptor response to the agonists (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>; Figure 3-figure supplement 1B; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Our mutational analysis showed that K<sub>368</sub>, a splice insert residue, affects channel kinetics. The charge reversal mutant (K<sub>368</sub>-E) showed significant differences from the wild-type GluK1-1a for all tested properties, indicating a role for K<sub>368</sub> in protein-protein and/or protein-glycan interactions at the ATD-LBD interface.</p>
<p>Although our cryo-EM map poorly resolved the splice region, its position can be ascertained close to the ATD-LBD interface. Based on our functional assays, the splice seems to affect the interaction between the receptor and auxiliary proteins. The modulatory effects of Neto1 and Neto2 on GluK1 splice variants might be mediated by multiple conserved positively charged patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vinnakota et al., 2021</xref>). The complex between GluK2-Neto2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">He et al., 2021b</xref>) provides a model that suggests K<sub>183</sub> and K<sub>187</sub> of GluK1 can potentially interact with a negative patch on Neto1 (D<sub>140</sub>-E<sub>144</sub>) and Neto2 (D<sub>144</sub>-E<sub>148</sub>). However, the splice insert appears to be positioned away from this interacting surface. Thus, it is plausible that the splice residues could come in contact with Neto proteins during a different conformation of the receptor during gating. Additionally, splice residues could also have an indirect or allosteric influence on the modulation of receptor functions and regulation by Neto proteins.</p>
<p>Our research, which encompasses structural, biochemical, biophysical, and functional investigations, highlights the significance of the unique N-terminal splice insert in the functions of GluK1 kainate receptors and opens avenues for further studies to understand its physiological effects. We also elucidated the important residues within the splice insert that could impact the modulatory behavior of auxiliary proteins. Our study emphasizes the need to investigate all possible combinations of KAR splice variants to appreciate their contributions at different developmental stages better. This comprehensive understanding of the distribution and functional diversity is essential for a rational therapeutic approach involving kainate receptors.</p>

<title>Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology</title>
<p>To understand the functional differences between GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a, as well as their modulation by Neto proteins, a whole-cell patch-clamp analysis was performed. HEK293 WT mammalian cells were seeded on siliconized glass coverslips in 35 mm dishes using Dulbecco’s Modification of Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, and 10 units/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin. Cells were transfected with <italic>GRIK1-1a</italic> or <italic>GRIK1-2a</italic> cloned in pRK7 (in the presence or absence of r<italic>Neto1</italic>/r<italic>Neto2</italic> cloned in IE-pRK8 as indicated) with EGFP expressing plasmid using Xfect (Clontech) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Similar protocols were followed to test the functionality of the <italic>GRIK1-1a<sub>EM</sub></italic> and <italic>GRIK1-1a</italic> splice mutant constructs. The whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed with an EPC 10 USB amplifier (HEKA) 24-48 h post-transfection. Cells were lifted using 1.5 mm diameter thin wall glass capillary tubes (30-0066 Harvard Apparatus), pulled to a fine tip with a Sutter P-1000 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) containing internal solution (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM CsF, 30 mM CsCl, 4 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA and 300 mOsm). Cells were continuously perfused with external/bath solution (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 300 mOsm) through a peristaltic perfusion system (Multichannel systems). Current was measured by holding the membrane at -60 mV, using a 2-kHz low-pass filter. Ligands (10 mM glutamate, 1 mM kainate, 2 mM SYM2081, or 10 µM UBP301) were applied through a double-barrelled theta pipette connected with an ultra-fast piezo-based perfusion system (Multichannel systems) <italic>via</italic> v8 Perfusion Fast-Step System (VC-77SP). Recordings were controlled and measured using Patchmaster-v2x90.2 (Heka Elektronik). The raw files were analyzed using Clampfit 11.2 and</p>
<p>Fitmaster-v2x90.4. All traces were normalized before being used for calculations. The exponential fit was used to estimate the rate of desensitization (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>) for 100 ms glutamate application, measured as the decline of the current from 80% of its peak amplitude. Mean-weighted Tau (τ<sub>Des</sub>) values were determined using the single exponential, two-term fitting (Levenberg-Marquardt). To compute the recovery from desensitization, a paired-pulse experiment was performed, where the amplitudes of the test pulse were normalized to that of the desensitizing pulse (calculated as relative amplitude); and plotted in comparison to the time between the desensitizing pulse and test pulse in seconds. The rate of recovery (Ʈ<sub>Recovery</sub>) was obtained by fitting the one-phase association exponential function. Dose-response experiments were performed for GluK1-1a (co-expressed with or without Neto proteins) and GluK1-2a with different concentrations of glutamate or kainate in the range of 1 µM to 3 mM or 0.5 µM to 600 µM, respectively. Dose-response values were calculated as the percentage of maximum response against log[agonist] concentrations and fitted using variable slope (Hill’s equation) in GraphPad Prism 8.0.1. For calculating kainate efficacy (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>), the ratio of peak amplitudes evoked by kainate versus glutamate was employed. For the calculation of the rectification index, a ratio of peak amplitudes obtained at +90/-90 mV was utilized. Current-voltage (IV) plots were prepared using the voltage ramp from -90 to + 90 mV with a 10 mV increment step, and the current amplitude was normalized to that obtained at -90 mV. For kainate-evoked currents, the percentage desensitization was calculated. The steady-state current measured at the end of 1 s kainate application was divided by peak current. This ratio was then subtracted from 1 and multiplied by 100 to give percentage (%) desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fisher and Fisher, 2014</xref>).</p>

<p>HEK 293-T/17 cells were used for outside-out patch experiments 48-96 h post transfection.

<p>The extracellular solution used for the experiment contained 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM glucose, The intracellular solution contained 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 110 mM CsF, 30 mM CsCl, 5 mM EGTA, 4 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM CaCl2.</p>
<p>Patch micropipettes were pulled using a P-97 Sutter puller, and the resistance was maintained at 2.3-2.6 megaohms. After forming the whole-cell configuration, the patch was pulled away from the cell to facilitate an outside-out patch. The cells were voltage-clamped at -70 mV, and a saturated concentration of glutamate (10 mM) was rapidly applied using a three-barrelled theta glass attached to a Siskiyou MXPZT-300 solution switcher. Glutamate applications of 1 ms were used to determine deactivation, while applications of 100 or 1000 ms were used to determine desensitization.</p>

<title>Site-Directed Mutagenesis (SDM)</title>
<p>Based on our electrophysiology analysis of the wild-type GluK1-1a/GluK1-2a receptors, structural analysis of GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub>, and recent reports that suggest that the presence of the positive patches in GluK2 ATD affects the interaction with Neto proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">He et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vinnakota et al., 2021</xref>), we performed SDM to understand the role of splice residues in the receptor kinetics.

<title>Co-immunoprecipitation (<italic>in vitro</italic>)</title>
<p>To understand the effect of mutations on GluK1-1a and Neto1/2 interaction, co-immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-His monoclonal antibody against the receptor. Similar constructs and transfection protocols were followed for surface expression analysis. Cells were pelleted 65-70 h post-transfection and washed with TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl). These cells were sonicated and solubilized in 500 uL lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail, 30 mM DDM). Post solubilization, debris was removed by centrifuging at 17,000 x g for 45 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated for pre-clearing with 20 µL of pre-equilibrated Protein A agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h on a rotator at 4 °C. Post-pre-clearing, ∼ 10% sample was saved as input, and the rest was used for pull-downs. Simultaneously, an antibody (anti-His, Cell Signaling Technology) was added to 40 µL pre-equilibrated Protein A agarose (Thermo Scientific) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of pre-cleared lysate. It was further incubated at 4 °C overnight (14-16 h). The unbound fraction was removed and washed four times with 500 µL wash buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 0.75 mM DDM) to remove non-specific interactions. Protein was eluted in 30 µL elution buffer (100 mM Tris pH 6.8, 12% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10 mM DTT, 2% β-mercaptoethanol) by heating at 95 ° C for 10 minutes. Rabbit IgG controls were set up to confirm the validity of the experiment. To analyze the pull-down, 8% SDS-PAGE followed by western transfer was performed. The immunoblots were probed using anti-actin (Sigma), anti-His (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-Neto1 (Sigma)/anti-GFP (Sigma) to detect the internal control (actin), the receptors and the co-immunoprecipitated Neto proteins respectively.</p>

<title>Construct design for Expression and purification of GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub></title>
<p>To obtain functional GluK1 receptors, rat <italic>GRIK1</italic> with ATD splice insert and the shortest C-terminal domain, <italic>GRIK1-1a</italic> (1-871 amino acid residues), was cloned in the pEGBacMam vector. The receptor was cloned in-frame with a thrombin recognition site (LVPRGSAAAA), EGFP (A<sub>207</sub>K; non-dimerizing mutant), and His<sub>8</sub> at the C-terminus. The wild-type protein generated very low amounts of the tetramer, as observed in fluorescence-assisted size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC). Therefore, based on the alignments of the sequence with GluK2<sub>EM</sub>, GluK3EM and GluA2, we mutated free cysteines in the TM1 region to residues corresponding to those of GluK2<sub>EM</sub> or GluA2 [1x Cys (C<sub>576</sub>S), 2x Cys (C<sub>552</sub>Y, C<sub>557</sub>V) and 3x Cys (C<sub>552</sub>Y, C<sub>557</sub>V, C<sub>576</sub>S)] to obtain good yields of the tetrameric receptor. All clones were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. The expression of all the mutants was confirmed by immunoblotting against His-tag and FSEC. GluK1-1a with 2x Cys mutations (C<sub>552</sub>Y, C<sub>557</sub>V) gave us the best receptor quality as observed in FSEC and therefore was used as GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> for large-scale purification for structural studies.</p>

<p>Three liters of Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 GnTI<sup>-</sup> suspension-adapted cultures (∼1.5-2.0 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) at 0.5 µg/mL were transfected (or infected with P2 virus) with <italic>GRIK1-1a<sub>EM</sub></italic> plasmid [or virus, prepared in DH10Bac as per established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>)] using polyethyleneimine (PEI-MAX, Polysciences; 1 DNA: 3 PEI w/w) as the transfection agent (or, infected at a multiplicity of infection of ∼2). To boost the protein production, 10 mM sodium butyrate (Sigma) was added 16 h post-transfection/infection, and cultures were incubated at 30°C for protein expression. Cells were harvested 65-70 h after transfection / infection, washed with buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8 and 150 mM NaCl, and stored at -80 ° C until further processing. The cell pellet was resuspended (20 mL/L culture volume) in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). These resuspended cells were disrupted using sonication (QSonica sonicator, 3 cycles of 90 s; 10 s ON/ 20 s OFF; temperature cut-off: 15 °C). The lysate was clarified using low-speed spin (4307 x g for 20 minutes at 4 °C). The membranes were pelleted using ultracentrifugation (118991 x g for 1 h at 4 °C). Solubilization of membrane fraction was done in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM DDM (Anatrace, D310LA), 5% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole, and protease inhibitor cocktail for 1 h on rotator at 4 °C. The non-solubilized fraction was separated by centrifugation at 47850 x g for 1 h at 4 °C and 4 mL of cobalt-charged TALON resin (Clontech, Takara) was added to the solubilized fraction for batch binding (3 h at 4 °C).

The bound receptor was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DDM, 1% glycerol, 250 mM imidazole). The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated at 1.3 mg / mL, and digested overnight at 4 ° C with thrombin (1:100 w/w). Simultaneously, purified GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> was also reconstituted in MSP1E3D1 nanodiscs with soybean polar lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, 541602P) in a 1:2:140 ratio (GluK1-1a: MSP: lipids) following already established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ritchie et al., 2009</xref>).

<title>Spatiotemporal distribution of exon 9 of GluK1 using transcriptomics data analysis</title>
<p>To understand the abundance of <italic>GRIK1-1</italic> splice in the human brain, we resorted to RNA-Seq data from the BrainSpan atlas that constitutes various databases to study transcriptional mechanisms in human brain development. The RNA-Seq data were downloaded (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.brainspan.org/rnaseq/gene/1099967">https://www.brainspan.org/rnaseq/gene/1099967</ext-link>), plotted in Excel, and analyzed using RStudio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</ext-link>) to determine the presence of GluK1 in different regions of the brain at different developmental stages. Further, we narrowed it down to the <italic>GRIK1-1</italic> splice (exon 9; start position 30968845, 45 nucleotides in length) and tried to understand how it overlaps with the entire <italic>GRIK1</italic> gene expression. These data explored the presence of the ATD splice irrespective of which C-terminal splice variant is present.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study shows that a splice variant of the kainate receptor Glu1-1a that inserts 15 amino acids in the extracellular N-terminal region substantially changes the channel's desensitization properties, the sensitivity to glutamate and kainate, and the effects of modulatory Neto proteins. The functional data supporting the role of the 15 amino acid insert are <bold>solid</bold>, although some clarifications and more data are needed to determine the molecular mechanism by which the insert changes the functional profile of the channel. Even so, these findings substantially advance our understanding of splice variants among glutamate receptors and will be of interest to neuro- and cell-biologists and biophysicists in the field.</p>

<p>Kainate receptors play various important roles in synaptic transmission. The receptors can be divided into low affinity kainate receptors (GluK1-3) and high affinity kainate receptos (GluK4-5). The receptors can assemble as homomers (GluK1-3) or low-high affinity heteromers (GluK4-5). The functional diversity is further increased by RNA splicing. Previous studies have investigated C-terminal splice variants of GluK1, but GluK1 N-terminal (exon 9) insertions have not been previously characterized. In this study Dhingra et al investigate the functional implications of a GluK1 splice variant that inserts a 15 amino acid segment into the extracellular N-terminal region of the protein using whole-cell and excised outside-out electrophysiology.</p>
<p>
The authors produce solid data to show that the insertion profoundly impacts the function of GluK1-1a - the channels that have the insertion are slower to desensitize. The data also shows that the insertion changes the modulatory effects of Neto proteins, resulting in altered rates of desensitization and recovery from desensitization. To determine the mechanism by which the insertion exerts these functional effects, the authors perform pull-down assays of Neto proteins, and extensive mutagenesis on the insert.</p>
<p>The electrophysiological part of the study is very rigorous and meticulous.</p>
<p>The biggest weakness of the manuscript is the structural work. Due to issues with preferred orientation (a common problem in cryo-EM), the 3D reconstructions are at a low resolution (in the 5-8 Å range) and cannot offer much mechanistic insight into the effects of the insertion. Based on the available data, the authors posit that the insertion does not change the arrangement of the subunits in the desensitized state. However, there is no comparison with a structure that does not contain the insertion, so while the statement may well be true, no data is shown to support it.</p>
<p>Overall, the cryo-EM contributes little and distracts from the good parts of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Another part that does not contribute much is the RNAseq data that has been pulled from a database and analyzed for the paper. It is being used to show that the exon 9 insertion variant is predominantly expressed in the cerebellar cortex at early stages of brain development. The methods do not describe in detail how the data has been analyzed (e.g., is the data scaled per sample/gene or globally?) so it is hard to know what we can compare in the heat plots. In Figure 1- supplement 1 there aren't striking differences in expression (at least not obviously visible in the current illustration).</p>
<p>Despite these weaknesses, the study is an important contribution to the field because it characterizes a GluK1 variant that has not been studied before and highlights the functional diversity that exists within the kainate receptor family.</p>

<p>Among ionotropic glutamate receptors, kainate receptors (KAR) are still the object of intense investigation to understand their role in normal and pathological excitatory synaptic transmission. Like other receptors, KAR appear under different splicing variants and their respective physiological function is still debated. In this manuscript Dhingra et al explored the impact of the presence and of the absence of Exon9 of the GluK1 receptors on the pharmacological, biophysical and structural properties of the receptors. They further investigated how it is impacted by the association of KAR with their cognate auxiliary subunit Neto 1 and 2. This study represents a large body of work and data. The authors addressed the issue in a very systematic and rigorous manner.</p>
<p>First, by exploring RNAseq database, authors showed that GluK1 transcripts containing the exon 9 are present in many brain structures and especially in the cerebellum suggesting that a large part of GluK1 contains effectively this exon9.</p>
<p>
Using HEK cells as an expression system, they characterized many gating and biophysical properties of GluK1 receptors containing or not the exon9. Evaluated parameters were desensitization, relative potency of glutamate versus kainite, polyamine block.</p>
<p>It is known that the association of GluK1 with auxiliary proteins Neto1/2 modulate the properties of the receptors. Authors investigated systematically whether Neto1 and 2 similarly alter GluK1 properties in function of the presence of exon9. This study provides many quantitative data that could be reused for modeling the role of kainate receptors. Given the change shown by the authors, the presence of exon in GluK1 is noticeable and likely should have an impact of synaptic transmission.</p>
<p>
Interestingly, authors used a mutational approach to identify critical residue encoded by exon9 that are responsible for the functional differences between the two splice variants. In many cases, the replacement of a single amino acid lead to the absence of current confirming the crucial role of the segment of the receptor. However, it made the comparison and the identification of critical residues more challenging.</p>
<p>
Authors attempted to establish the structure GluK1 receptors comprising the exon9 using different preparation methods. They succeeded in obtaining structures with equivalent or lower resolution compared with previous report on GluK1 and GluK2 receptors. However, the organization of the peptide coded by exon is poorly defined and limited possible analyses. Despite this they could observe that the presence of the exon9 does not alter significantly the structure of GluK1.</p>

<p>GluK1 forms glutamate-gated ion channels with an important function in synaptic transmission and neuron excitability. Particularly, a GluK1 splice-variant (Gluk1-1) with significant expression in different regions of the brain has not been characterized before. The paper of Dhingra et al. aims to evaluate the role of the Exon 9 splice insert in GluK1 on channel function. This study relies mainly on electrophysiological approaches to determine the effect of the splice insert on GluK1 gating properties, including desensitization, agonist efficacy, recovery, and rectification. Overall, this work provides two major milestones: 1) the first functional characterization of the Gluk1-1a variant and 2) the first structure of this channel. The functional data supporting the role of the insert on channel properties are solid, although the current data does not provide significant insights about the mechanisms behind this. Also, the little information associated with the resolved structure precludes providing further insights about the structural basis that account for the impact of the insert on channel function. Overall, I consider this an interesting paper that represents an important advance in the study of glutamate receptors.</p>
