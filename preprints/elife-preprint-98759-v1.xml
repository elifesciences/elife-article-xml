<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Objective</title>
<p>Post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is a significant complication that has a negative impact on the prognosis and quality of life of ischemic stroke patients. We collected medical records from multiple hospitals and created an interpretable machine learning model for prediction.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We collected medical records, imaging reports, and laboratory tests from 21459 patients with a history of ischemic stroke in several hospitals. We conducted traditional univariable and multivariable statistics analyses to compare and identify important features. Then the data was divided into a 70% training set and a 30% testing set. We employed the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique method to augment the positive class in the training set. Nine commonly used methods were used to build machine learning models, and relevant prediction metrics were compared to select the best-performing model. Finally, we used SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability analysis, assessing the contribution and clinical significance of different features to the prediction.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>In the traditional regression analysis, complications such as hydrocephalus, cerebral hernia, uremia, deep vein thrombosis; significant brain regions included the involvement of the cortical regions including frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe, subcortical region of basal ganglia, thalamus and so on contributed to PSE. General features such as age, gender, and NIHSS(the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) score, as well as laboratory indicators including WBC count, D-dimer, lactate, HbA1c and so on were associated with a higher likelihood of PSE. Patients with conditions such as fatty liver, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, and low HDL had a higher likelihood of developing PSE. The machine learning models, particularly tree models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, demonstrated good predictive performance with an AUC of 0.99.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The model built on a large dataset can effectively predict the likelihood of PSE, with tree-based models performing the best. The NIHSS score, WBC count and d-dimer were found to have the greatest impact.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with an annual mortality rate of approximately 5.5 million, and also the leading cause of disability globally, accounting for 50% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Generally, ischemic stroke accounts for the majority, about 80% of stroke cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. PSE is a significant complication, with studies indicating that as many as 3-30% of stroke patients develop epilepsy, which has a negative impact on patients’ prognosis and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. It can exacerbate cognitive, psychiatric, and physical impairments caused by cerebrovascular disease and comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, the highest incidence of PSE occurs within the first year after acute stroke, accounting for about half of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Therefore, early prediction and intervention for PSE, especially ischemic ones, are crucial.</p>
<p>Currently, most studies utilize clinical data to establish statistical models, survival analysis and cox regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], and multiple linear regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] to construct simple models. Last year, Lin et al. developed a model based on radiomics that outperformed the conventional clinical model in predicting PSE related to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). They suggested that a combined radiomics-clinical model could better assist clinicians in assessing the individual risk of PSE after the first occurrence of ICH and facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of PSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. However, subsequent studies have raised doubts regarding the application of radiomics, suggesting the need for further research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Overall, there is still a relative scarcity of research on PSE prediction, with most studies focusing on the analysis of specific or certain risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. No study has proposed or established a more comprehensive and scientifically accurate prediction model.</p>
<p>Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach in recent years for constructing medical models, as it excels in handling large volumes of data and complex information, and has been increasingly applied in neuroscience and clinical prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Previous studies have utilized machine learning for related research on post-stroke cognitive impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], stroke and myocardial infarction risk prediction models in large artery vasculitis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], post-stroke depression prediction models based on liver function test indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], and prediction of hematoma expansion in traumatic brain injury (TBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Models constructed using machine learning algorithms can automatically handle linear or complex nonlinear relationships between different variables and provide insights into the contribution of different features to the prediction target, which is challenging for traditional statistical models. However, machine learning methods require a substantial amount of data and are prone to overfitting when trained on small sample data. The more valid and high-quality data input, the better machine learning algorithms can capture the underlying patterns between the data, thereby achieving more accurate predictions.</p>
<p>This study try to select important risk factors from mutiple fearures extracted from the clinical records and examination data of ischemic stroke patients and subsequently develops a prediction model for PSE using machine learning methods. By utilizing relevant early admission features of ischemic stroke patients, we aim to automatically predict the probability of PSE occurrence and further guide clinical decision-making and nursing care.</p>

<title>Research patients</title>
<p>This study retrospectively included all stroke patients admitted to the Chongqing Emergency Center between June 2017 and June 2022 for the development of the prediction model. Subsequently, patient data from three external validation centers, namely, Qianjiang Central Hospital, Bishan District People’s Hospital, and Yubei District Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, were collected between July 2022 and July 2023 for external validation and evaluation of the model. The external validation cohort focused more on collecting positive cases to examine the model’s ability to identify positive samples.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria: (1) Age between 18 and 90 years at admission; (2) Diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke and hospitalized for treatment.</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria: (1) Patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); (2) Patients with a history of other conditions such as traumatic brain injury, intracranial tumors, or cerebral vascular malformations that may cause epilepsy; (3) Patients with a history of epilepsy or who have received antiepileptic drugs for the prevention of seizures or for other diseases (such as migraine or psychiatric disorders); (4) Patients who died within 72 hours after stroke onset.</p>
<p>This study collected de-identified data from relevant patients for the construction of a multi-modal database for stroke patients. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of Chongqing University Center Hospital, Chongqing University Qianjiang Central Hospital, Bishan District People’s Hospital, and Yubei Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital.

<title>Data processing and model building</title>
<p>(Processing of missing data) We counted the values of all laboratory indicators for the first time after stroke admission, excluded indicators with missing values of more than 10%, and filled the data of the remaining indicators with missing values of more than 1000 cases by random forest algorithm.</p>
<p>(Distribution of characteristics) Univariate analysis was used to examine the distribution of characteristics between the negative group and the positive group. The data were then divided into a training set and a test set at a ratio of 7:3.</p>
<p>(Processing of unbalanced data) Considering the low incidence of PSE and the small proportion of positive patients, the positive data of the training set were augmented by smote oversampling method.</p>
<p>(Processing of categorical data) For categorical data, the one-heat method is used for transformation. The LASSO method was then used in the training set to screen the important features.</p>
<p>(Model building) Select the 20 features with the largest absolute value of LASSO Regression coefficient, and use NB(Naive Bayes), LR(Logistic Regression), DT(Decision Tree), RF(Random Forest),GB (GradientBoosting), MLP, XGB(XGBoost), LGBM(LightGBM), KNN(KNeighbors) these 9 common methods to build machine learning models. Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-score, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were used to evaluate the performance of the model. The area under the ROC(receiver operating characteristic curve) was used to measure the discrimination of the model, and the calibration plot and Brier score were used to evaluate the calibration of the model. DCA(decision curve analysis) was used to evaluate the net benefit of the model for patients. (External validation of the model) The generalization performance of the model was evaluated using patient data from the external validation cohort. (Influencing factor analysis) After screening the best model, the interpretable analysis of the model was performed by SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) algorithm to analyze the contribution of different features to the prediction and their clinical significance.</p>

<title>Statistical approach</title>
<p>PostgreSQL v15 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.postgresql.org/">http://www.postgresql.org/</ext-link>) was used to search and extract the data from the local database.</p>
<p>The open-source statistical package &quot;Scipy.stats&quot; in Python was used for statistical analysis. The details of the univariate significance analysis for each feature are as follows:</p>
<p>First, the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check the normality of the distribution for each feature. For features that did not follow a normal distribution, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess their significance with respect to the target variable.</p>
<p>For features that exhibited a normal distribution, the Levene test was employed to assess the homogeneity of variances. Features with homogeneous variances were analyzed using the Student’s t-test to determine their significance with respect to the target variable, while features with heterogeneous variances were analyzed using the Welch’s t-test.</p>
<p>The confidence intervals for the AUC values and Brier scores were obtained by performing 1000 bootstrap resampling iterations on the corresponding datasets. The binary classification thresholds for the predicted probabilities generated by all models were established using the maximum Youden index derived from the training cohort.</p>
<p>Throughout the study, a two-tailed p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Analysis of SHAP risk factors</title>
<p>Shap analysis, individual decision attempts and overall decision curves are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>. Among the general characteristics, female were prone to PSE. About the nihss score, the higher the nihss score, the more likely to be PSE, nihss score has a third effect just below white blood cell count and D-dimer. Higher wbc, d-dimer,crp,ast,ck_mb,hba1c bilirubin,tco2,ldh and lower hbdh,plt,aptt at admission were more likely to develop PSE. However, the relevant regions of the brain as the single factor had little effect on the whole. Among the complications, only hypertension is more prone to pse, coronary heart disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver and so on are less prone to PSE.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study utilized comprehensive clinical data, imaging data, laboratory test data, and other data from stroke patients. We employed machine learning algorithms to establish a predictive model, achieving an AUC score of above 0.95, which demonstrated more accurate predictions compared to traditional statistical methods. Our research found that tree-based ensemble models showed superior overall prediction capabilities when dealing with large sample sizes and high-dimensional features.</p>
<p>During the modeling process, due to the extreme imbalance between negative and positive samples, we employed SMOTE oversampling to augment the data, resulting in improved training performance. Through SHAP analysis, we conducted interpretability analysis of the model and determined the importance of different features.</p>
<p>In our study, age and NIHSS score were treated as continuous variables. We found that, overall, female patients, older patients, and those with higher NIHSS scores were more prone to develop PSE, which is consistent with recent articles. High NIHSS scores, indicative of more severe stroke, increased the risk of complications, ranking only to white blood cell count and d-dimer in our model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. However, there are conflicting opinions regarding the impact of age. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] suggested that age &lt;65 is a high- risk factor, which aligns with our findings, while some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] confirmed that advanced age is the determining factor. Yamada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] also concurred with our study in identifying a higher risk of complications among females, whereas Waafi’s research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] indicated that the likelihood of male patients developing complications is 3.325 times that of females, which contradicts our findings.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, depression, or dementia are at an increased risk of developing vascular epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In our study, statistics and multiple ML models analyzed the association between comorbidities and complications, revealing that patients with coronary heart disease, diabetes, fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, or large artery stenosis or plaques(CCA and ICA) were less likely to develop epilepsy. According to the TOAST classification, ischemic stroke is categorized into five types: large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small vessel occlusion, other determined etiology, and undetermined etiology. Patients with combined comorbidities generally fall into the categories of large artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism, which are relatively well-defined and easier to intervene, thus resulting in a lower likelihood of developing epilepsy. Conversely, strokes with undetermined etiology usually have a poor prognosis and are more likely to lead to epilepsy. Among diabetes patients, higher HbA1c levels indicate poorer blood sugar control, resulting in a higher probability of developing complications, which significantly affects certain patients, while those with good control have a lower overall risk of developing complications.</p>
<p>Alain et al. found that cortical infarction was more likely to result in epilepsy in patients hospitalized with anterior circulation ischemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Lin et al. found that factors such as cortical involvement and intracerebral hemorrhage volume increased the likelihood of PSE, which is consistent with our research findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Al-Sahli et al. also suggested that cortical brain injury and large-area lesions increased the risk of PSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. In our study, statistics showed affections of cortical and subcortical regions both increased the possibility of PSE, but had lower affection than the other features so didn’t be selected in lasso regression.</p>
<p>Previous studies have found that acute infection is a risk factor for ischemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. C-reactive protein (CRP) reflects the level of inflammation and is an independent prognostic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In our study, SHAP analysis showed that white blood cell count had the greatest impact among the routine blood test parameters, surpassing the NIHSS score. High white blood cell count may indicate severe inflammation and infection, as well as increased blood viscosity, making patients more susceptible to secondary complications. In general, high red blood cell count and low platelet count also have some influence.</p>
<p>A large-scale study on Chinese individuals found a negative correlation between plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration and the risk of ischemic stroke, a weak positive correlation between plasma triglyceride (TG) concentration and the risk of ischemic stroke, and a strong correlation between plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration and apolipoprotein B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. High HDL-C levels are associated with better prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Our study is consistent with previous research, indicating that high LDL-C, low HDL-C, and high TG levels are more likely to lead to PSE. This can be easily understood as high cholesterol and triglyceride levels lead to increased blood viscosity and vascular sclerosis, making it easier for clots to form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Higher D-dimer levels indicate greater brain tissue damage and a higher likelihood of PSE. Overall, lower activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and fibrinogen levels are associated with an increased risk of PSE. INR, PT, and TT have a smaller impact. Among liver function parameters, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) has the greatest influence on PSE, while high AST levels, low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and low albumin levels all have a certain degree of impact. Lingling Ding et al. found that liver enzyme subgroups characterized by alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were associated with a high risk of adverse function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], which is consistent with our research.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that subgroups identified by renal function biomarkers such as urinary microalbumin, cystatin C, and creatinine have significantly higher stroke recurrence and poorer prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. In our study, low urea levels and high uric acid levels had a negative impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Our research is similar to their conclusions. While elevated uric acid levels at admission are positively associated with PSE, patients previously diagnosed with hyperuricemia are less likely to develop epilepsy. Considering that uric acid functions as a strong reducing agent and has neuroprotective properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], patients with normal liver and kidney function and a certain degree of hyperuricemia have stronger resistance to emergencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. However, excessively high uric acid levels indicate metabolic disorders and poor liver and kidney function, which are associated with poor prognosis.</p>
<p>When stroke patients are admitted, cardiac enzyme profile tests are often performed to rule out concurrent myocardial ischemia. However, studies have shown that elevated CK-MB in stroke patients may not be related to the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Multiple cardiac enzymes are important prognostic indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] and have been included in stroke scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Some studies have shown a higher incidence of abnormal serum cardiac enzyme profiles in the acute phase of stroke. Although the incidence of abnormalities is unrelated to the nature of the stroke, it is associated with the severity of the stroke, with patients with consciousness disorders having a significantly higher incidence of abnormal cardiac enzyme profiles than those without consciousness disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. In our study, CK, CK- MB, and IMA in the cardiac enzyme profile had a significant impact and high predictive value, but the specific mechanisms require further research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Deficiency and prospect</p>
<p>Although our study incorporates a large amount of information and utilizes almost all available data, including clinical data, imaging data, and laboratory test data, in an attempt to establish more accurate prediction models beyond traditional statistics using machine learning algorithms, there are still several limitations in the modeling process.</p>
<p>The data is not sufficiently representative, and the model’s generalization ability needs further assessment. Firstly, although we collected data from multiple tertiary hospitals, encompassing over 20,000 cases, earlier data was lost due to hospital system upgrades. The collected data mainly represents patients diagnosed in the past five years and is primarily concentrated in the Chongqing region, resulting in a limited temporal and spatial span that may restrict its generalizability to other regions.</p>
<p>Restricted by retrospective research, some important predictive indicators are missing. As our study is retrospective, many potentially meaningful indicators, such as hemorheology, thromboelastography, hormone levels, are significantly missing and had to be excluded. If additional features were included, it might be possible to further improve the accuracy of the model.</p>
<p>Consider incorporating features related to patients’ baseline for more accurate predictions. Secondly, regarding imaging and laboratory examinations, we mainly extracted the results from the first examination upon admission, without fully utilizing the results of subsequent examinations. In the future, the use of recurrent neural networks to comprehensively extract features will be considered. In subsequent research, data standardization should be improved, and the number of cases and important indicators should continue to increase. It is also advisable to explore more scientifically advanced methods, such as deep learning, and fully leverage all available data to make more accurate predictions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, we developed an interpretable machine learning model to predict the risk of PSE in hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke. Based on a large volume of medical records, our artificial intelligence model demonstrates good predictive ability for PSE. Significant predictors include NIHSS score, D-dimer levels, lactate levels, and white blood cell count, followed by indicators related to liver function and cardiac enzyme profiles. The transparency and interpretability of the model’s predictions can foster trust among clinical practitioners and facilitate decision-making. However, further prospective studies are needed to validate the utility of this tool before its application in clinical settings.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study reports machine learning models derived from large-scale data to predict the risk of post-stroke epilepsy. The evidence supporting the conclusions is, however, <bold>incomplete</bold>, as many critical methodological aspects have been omitted or described too briefly, the analysis of the results is not complete, and the dataset and code have not been disclosed, which represents an obstacle to reproducibility. The study may be of some interest in the field of clinical neurology.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The authors present multiple machine-learning methodologies to predict post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) from admission clinical data.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The Statistical Approach section is very well written. The approaches used in this section are very sensible for the data in question.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>There are many typos and unclear statements throughout the paper.</p>
<p>There are some issues with SHAP interpretation. SHAP in its default form, does not provide robust statistical guarantees of effect size. There is a claim that &quot;SHAP analysis showed that white blood cell count had the greatest impact among the routine blood test parameters&quot;. This is a difficult claim to make.</p>
<p>The Data Collection section is very poorly written, and the methodology is not clear.</p>
<p>There is no information about hyperparameter selection for models or whether a hyperparameter search was performed. Given this, it is difficult to conclude whether one machine learning model performs better than others on this task.</p>
<p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria are unclear - how many patients were excluded and for what reasons?</p>
<p>There is no sensitivity analysis of the SMOTE methodology: How many synthetic data points were created, and how does the number of synthetic data points affect classification accuracy?</p>
<p>Did the authors achieve their aims? Do the results support their conclusions?</p>
<p>The paper does not clarify the features' temporal origins. If some features were not recorded on admission to the hospital but were recorded after PSE occurred, there would be temporal leakage.</p>
<p>The authors claim that their models can predict PSE. To believe this claim, seeing more information on out-of-distribution generalisation performance would be helpful. There is limited reporting on the external validation cohort relative to the reporting on train and test data.</p>
<p>For greater certainty on all reported results, it would be most appropriate to perform n-fold cross-validation, and report mean scores and confidence intervals across the cross-validation splits</p>
<p>The likely impact of the work on the field</p>
<p>If this model works as claimed, it will be useful for predicting PSE. This has some direct clinical utility.</p>
<p>Analysis of features contributing to PSE may provide clinical researchers with ideas for further research on the underlying aetiology of PSE.</p>
<p>Additional context that might help readers</p>
<p>The authors show force plots and decision plots from SHAP values. These plots are non-trivial to interpret, and the authors should include an explanation of how to interpret them.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report the performance of a series of machine learning models inferred from a large-scale dataset and externally validated with an independent cohort of patients, to predict the risk of post-stroke epilepsy. Some of the reported models have very good explicative and predictive performances.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The models have been derived from real-world large-scale data.</p>
<p>Performances of the best-performing models are very good according to the external validation results.</p>
<p>Early prediction of the risk of post-stroke epilepsy would be of high interest to implement early therapeutic interventions that could improve prognosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are issues with the readability of the paper. Many abbreviations are not introduced properly and sometimes are written inconsistently. A lot of relevant references are omitted. The methodological descriptions are extremely brief and, sometimes, incomplete.</p>
<p>The dataset is not disclosed, and neither is the code (although the code is made available upon request). For the sake of reproducibility, unless any bioethical concerns impede it, it would be good to have these data disclosed.</p>
<p>Although the external validation is appreciated, cross-validation to check the robustness of the models would also be welcome.</p>
