<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Ubiquitination typically involves covalent linking of ubiquitin (Ub) to a lysine residue on a protein substrate. Recently, new facets of this process have emerged, including Ub modification of non-proteinaceous substrates like ADP-ribose by the DELTEX E3 ligase family. Here we show that the DELTEX family member DTX3L expands this non-proteinaceous substrate repertoire to include single-stranded DNA and RNA. Although the N-terminal region of DTX3L contains single-stranded nucleic acid binding domains and motifs, the minimal catalytically competent fragment comprises the C-terminal RING and DTC domains (RD). DTX3L-RD catalyses ubiquitination of the 3’-end of single-stranded DNA and RNA, as well as double-stranded DNA with a 3’ overhang of two or more nucleotides. This modification is reversibly cleaved by deubiquitinases. NMR and biochemical analyses reveal that the DTC domain binds single-stranded DNA and facilitates the catalysis of Ub transfer from RING-bound E2-conjugated Ub. Our study unveils the direct ubiquitination of nucleic acids by DTX3L, laying the groundwork for understanding its functional implications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ubiquitination—the covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to a substrate—is a versatile post-translational modification involved in the regulation of various cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The most widely studied examples of this modification involve conjugation of Ub to lysine residues in proteinaceous substrates. Non-lysine ubiquitination of protein substrates via serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) and threonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) residues has also been demonstrated. The modification of these residues produces an ester linkage in contrast to the canonical isopeptide amide bond that is observed in the ubiquitination of lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In recent years, non-proteinaceous ubiquitination substrates have emerged. These substrates include bacterial lipopolysaccharide which is ubiquitinated by RNF213 in the immune response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), glucosaccharides which are ubiquitinated by HOIL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) and adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP)–ribose (ADPr) which is ubiquitinated by the Deltex family of ubiquitin ligases (E3s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Collectively, these studies have uncovered that the diversity of substrates undergoing ubiquitination expands beyond that of proteinaceous substrates. Additionally, they highlight that this mechanism is not limited to one E3 ligase family.</p>
<p>The Deltex (DTX) E3 family is comprised of five RING E3s, DTX1, DTX2, DTX3, DTX3L and DTX4, which share a conserved C-terminal region containing the RING and DELTEX C-terminal (DTC) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Whilst the RING domain functions by recruiting E2 thioesterified with Ub (E2∼Ub) to catalyse Ub transfer to a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), the DTC domain, which is connected to the RING domain through a short flexible linker remained, until recently, without a reported function. DTX3L, which forms a heterodimer with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 9 (PARP9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), was initially proposed to be an activator of PARP9 ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, with the complex being shown to catalyse ADP-ribosylation of Ub in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) and ubiquitination components including E1, E2, Ub, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). It was originally proposed that PARP9 was responsible for this activity, despite previous reports of its catalytic inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). When we tested DTX3L independently of PARP9, it was sufficient to catalyse ADP-ribosylation of the C-terminus of Ub(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Notably, the C-terminal RING and DTC domains (hereafter referred to as RD domains) are the minimal fragment required to catalyse this reaction and all members of the DTX family share this capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Structural analyses of RD domains revealed that the DTC domain contains a pocket that binds ADPr and NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). This enables RD domains to recruit ADPr-modified substrates and catalyse their ubiquitination in a poly-ADP-ribose (PAR)-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In addition, in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> and ubiquitination components, RD domains catalyse ADP-ribosylation of Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The chemical linkage of ADP-ribosylated Ub was recently discovered to occur between the carboxylate group of Ub Gly<sup>76</sup> and the 3’-hydroxyl group of the adenosine-proximal ribose of ADPr or NAD<sup>+</sup>, highlighting Ub modification of ADPr or NAD<sup>+</sup> rather than the canonical ADP-ribosylation of substrate that involves the release of nicotinamide from NAD<sup>+</sup> followed by attachment of ADPr via the C1” atom of the nicotinamide ribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that the RD domains of both DTX2 and DTX3L can ubiquitinate the 3’-hydroxyl group of the adenosine-proximal ribose of free ADPr as well as ADPr moieties present on ADP-ribosylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) and ADP-ribosylated nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>DTX3L has a unique N-terminus lacking the WWE domains and proline-rich regions found in the other DTX family members. The development of AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) has allowed prediction of unsolved protein structures to a higher degree of confidence than previously possible. For DTX3L, this allowed the generation of a model of the protein that revealed putative domains in the N-terminal region. When queried in the DALI server, which enables protein structures to be compared in 3D, these domains were found to be structurally similar to K Homology (KH) domains and RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) which bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA (ssRNA). Here, we showed that DTX3L was able to bind a variety of sequences of ssDNA and ssRNA. Unexpectedly, we discovered that DTX3L was able to ubiquitinate ssDNA and ssRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses established that DTX3L-RD domain binds single-stranded nucleic acids (ssNAs) and catalyzes the ubiquitination of ssNAs. These findings present a previously unidentified direct Ub modification of nucleic acids.</p>

<title>DTX3L binds and ubiquitinates ssRNA and ssDNA</title>
<p>To gain insight into the function of DTX3L, we took the AlphaFold-predicted structural domains of DTX3L (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and conducted a search on the DALI server to compare the proposed 3D domains of DTX3L to structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Several of these domains share structural similarity to KH domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) with the N-terminal domain resembling an RRM. KH domains, which bind both ssRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), comprise a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet packed alongside three α-helices whereas RRMs are composed of two α-helices and four anti-parallel strands packed together in a β-α-β-β-α-β fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). To determine if DTX3L binds ssRNA or ssDNA, we used ssDNA and ssRNA oligonucleotides labelled with 6-FAM on the 5’-end (D1-D9 and R1-R9, respectively; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1A</xref>) and either full-length (FL) DTX3L or a truncated 232-C construct containing the two tandem KH-like (KHL) domains and C-terminal RING-DTC that is competent in binding PARP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Both DTX3L constructs bound to all tested sequences of ssRNA and ssDNA, inducing at least a two-fold change in polarisation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1, B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Likewise, at least a two-fold change in polarisation was observed when DTX3L-PARP9 complex binding was tested with these nucleic acids, demonstrating that PARP9 does not occlude ssDNA or ssRNA binding by DTX3L (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1, D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on the structural similarity between ADPr and nucleic acids (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1F</xref>), we hypothesised that RNA and DNA could also be ubiquitinated by DTX3L. To investigate, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assays of FAM-labelled ssDNA or ssRNA by DTX3L with the following components: E1, UBE2D2, Ub, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP. Ubiquitination of FAM-labelled ssDNA and ssRNA was detected by SDS-PAGE using a fluorescent scanner (Typhoon FLA7000). The appearance of a ∼15 kDa band closely matched the combined molecular weights of Ub (8564 Da) and 20 nt FAM-labelled single-stranded nucleic acid (∼6900-7300 Da), suggesting that both ssDNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) and ssRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>) were ubiquitinated by DTX3L. Due to the high signal-to-noise ratio observed with D4 compared to other oligonucleotides, this sequence was used for subsequent experiments. Because R4 is the corresponding sequence of ssRNA this was also taken forward.</p>
<p>The minimal fragment of DTX3L required for Ub-ADPr formation is the conserved C-terminal RING-DTC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). To investigate the minimal fragment of DTX3L necessary for the ubiquitination of ssNAs, we tracked the formation of ubiquitinated ssDNA (Ub-DNA) or ssRNA (Ub-RNA) by DTX3L 232-C, RD, RING or DTC. DTX3L 232-C lacks the N-terminal RRM and KHL1 domains, where KHL1 domain was recently proposed to enable oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). While DTX3L 232-C exhibited reduced autoubiquitination compared to DTX3L FL (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1G</xref>), the rates of UBE2D2∼Ub discharge were comparable (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1H</xref>). This suggests that DTX3L 232-C is catalytically competent as DTX3L FL, but lacks accessible lysine sites necessary for autoubiquitination. DTX3L 232-C exhibited similar activity as DTX3L FL in catalysing the formation of Ub-DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>) and Ub-RNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). DTX3L-RD also catalysed formation of Ub-DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>) and Ub-RNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), whereas neither the RING (R) nor the DTC (D) alone sufficed. Hints of the ∼15 kDa Ub-DNA band were also observed on the corresponding Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1I</xref>, arrows).</p>
<p>We took advantage of the Coomassie staining method of detection for Ub-DNA, along with an increased concentration of D4, to confirm this and demonstrate that formation of Ub-DNA is time-dependent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). To validate that Ub modification did not occur on the FAM label, we tested ssDNA labelled with IRDye® 800 (D10, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1J</xref>) and unlabelled ssDNA (D11, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in a ubiquitination assay. A ∼15 kDa band corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of Ub-DNA was also observed using ssDNA with the alternative label (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>) and unlabelled ssDNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1L</xref>). Together, our data demonstrate that DTX3L binds and ubiquitinates ssNAs and that DTX3L-RD is the minimal fragment required to catalyse this reaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>The 3’-end of ssDNA is modified on its 3’ hydroxyl</title>
<p>Based on the finding that the RD was sufficient to catalyse ubiquitination of ssDNA D4, we confirmed that this fragment was able to ubiquitinate the same ssDNAs as FL DTX3L (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1K</xref>). Hence, this fragment was used to probe the additional requirements of the reaction. Initially, to confirm that product formation was dependent on the ubiquitination process, we removed each reactant individually. Formation of Ub-DNA or Ub-RNA by DTX3L-RD was only detected when all components of the ubiquitination cascade (E1, UBE2D2, Ub, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP) were present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). To validate that ssDNA and ssRNA were modified with Ub and not another component in the reaction, we treated the resulting product with USP2, a promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme. The ∼15 kDa band disappeared upon treatment with USP2, which is consistent with removal of Ub from ssDNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and ssRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and shows that this modification is reversible. Treatment of Ub-DNA and Ub-RNA with Benzonase, an endonuclease which degrades DNA and RNA, caused the disappearance of both the Ub-DNA and DNA bands (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and Ub-RNA and RNA bands (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), an ADPr hydrolase that cleaves ADPr-linked to substrate, was recently shown to cleave Ub-ADPr attached to nucleic acid substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Treatment with PARG had no effect on the Ub-DNA band (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) or Ub-RNA band (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), thereby demonstrating that this reaction is distinct from the attachment of Ub to the ADPr moiety on ADP-ribosylated nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). These findings showed that the 15 kDa product was ubiquitinated ssNAs.</p>

<p>Our experiments suggested a common mechanism of modification between ssRNA and ssDNA, therefore we focused our subsequent experiments on the most readily detectable substrate, ssDNA D4. To ascertain whether this reaction was specific to ssDNA, we followed the formation of Ub-DNA with 6-FAM-labelled dsDNA and DTX3L-RD. Based on the finding that the RD fragment was sufficient to catalyse ubiquitination of ssDNA, this fragment was used to probe the additional requirements of the reaction. DTX3L-RD did not ubiquitinate dsDNA (D12, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) suggesting that the protein is specific for ssDNA. We then compared ubiquitination of ssDNA labelled with 6-FAM on the 5’-end or 3’-end (D13, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1, A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">L</xref>) and found that the 6-FAM label on the 3’-end blocked ubiquitination of ssDNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Based on this finding we hypothesised that the 3’ end of the oligonucleotide is (1) the site of modification or (2) important for oligonucleotide binding. We next investigated the chemical nature of the covalent bond between Ub and ssDNA. To see if the bond was hydrolysed under basic conditions, we treated our reaction with pH 9.5 buffer which led to the disappearance of the Ub-DNA band over time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Additionally, treatment with NH<sub>2</sub>OH resulted in the rapid disappearance of the Ub-DNA band (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Together, this suggested that the linkage is likely to be an ester, and that the modification occurs on a ribose moiety, leaving only the 3’ ribose as a viable modification site. To validate this hypothesis, we designed an array of 5’-FAM labelled ssDNAs in which various positions on the ribose ring of the 3’-end nucleotide were modified and tested their ability to act as a substrate for ubiquitination by DTX3L-RD. Whilst ssDNA with a fluorine atom attached at the 2’ position of the ribose ring (D14) was ubiquitinated, the addition of a phosphate moiety to the 3’ hydroxyl of the ribose ring (D15) ablated the formation of Ub-DNA, thereby confirming this is the site of modification (D10, D14-D15, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). This is consistent with the site of Ub modification of ADPr where Ub is also attached to the 3’ hydroxyl of the adenine-proximal ribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). These data support that Ub modification of ssDNA occurs at the 3’ hydroxyl of the 3’ nucleotide.</p>

<title>Nucleotide sequence requirements for Ub-DNA formation</title>
<p>How the sequence and length of ssDNA affect Ub-DNA formation is unclear. To investigate, we first probed the base preference at the last or penultimate position by varying the nucleic acid to A, T, C or G of oligonucleotide D4. Whilst only the sequences ending with A and to some extent with G could be ubiquitinated by DTX3L-RD, the requirement for the penultimate nucleotide was less strict, with sequences ending CA, TA and AA all being ubiquitinated (D16-D21, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Thus far we had only tested sequences of 20 nucleotides in length; therefore, we next took the D4 sequence and generated four ssDNA nucleotides with this same CAA repeat unit and ranging in length from five to 80 nucleotides (D22-D25, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). When tested in our assays, all four of these nucleotide substrates were ubiquitinated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Despite dsDNA being unable to act as a substrate for ubiquitination, our discovery that ubiquitination occurs on the 3’ nucleotide of ssDNA prompted us to test the hypothesis that dsDNA with a 3’ overhang could be ubiquitinated. Whilst dsDNA with a single 3’ nucleotide overhang could not be ubiquitinated, dsDNA with a two or three 3’ nucleotide overhang could be modified with Ub (D26-D29, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Our data show that DTX3L modification of DNA requires that the two nucleotides at the 3’ end be single-stranded. Overall, these data demonstrate the ability of DTX3L-RD to ubiquitinate ssDNA of varying lengths and specific 3’ dinucleotides.</p>

<title>ssNA and ADPr share a binding site on DTX3L’s DTC domain</title>
<p>Because the modification of ssDNA and ADPr occurs at the same position on the nucleoside, we next explored the possibility that they share the same binding site on DTX3L-RD. ADPr binds the DTC domain of DTX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), a region which is conserved in the DTX family. Therefore, we purified <sup>15</sup>N-DTX3L-RD and acquired <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of <sup>15</sup>N-DTX3L-RD alone and in the presence of ADPr or unlabelled ssDNA. We utilised the unlabelled version of the 5-mer oligonucleotide ssDNA (D30, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) for NMR analysis, which was sufficient to produce the Ub-DNA product (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Upon titration of ADPr or 5-nucleotide ssDNA, chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) occurred, indicating DTX3L-RD binds both ADPr and ssDNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">fig. S2, A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The similarity in the CSPs indicates that there is some overlap in the binding sites of ADPr and ssDNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A–C</xref>). To further verify that there is conservation between the binding sites of these two substrates, excess ADPr was added to the ubiquitination reaction components along with DTX3L-RD and ssDNA D4. The presence of ADPr inhibited the formation of Ub-DNA and Ub-RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">fig. S2C</xref>), suggesting they share the same binding site. We next added excess ssDNA D31, a ssDNA with the same sequence as D4 but with a phosphate moiety attached to the 3’ hydroxyl, to the ubiquitination reaction components along with DTX3L-RD and biotin-NAD<sup>+</sup>. As labelled ADPr is not readily available, we used biotin-NAD<sup>+</sup> to monitor Ub-biotin-NAD<sup>+</sup> formation. The addition of D31 inhibited the formation of Ub-NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Because D31 has a phosphate moiety blocking the 3’ hydroxyl ubiquitination site, it cannot be ubiquitinated; therefore, it must be directly competing for binding.</p>

<p>To assess DTX3L-RD preference for nucleic acid or ADPr, we performed kinetic analysis of Ub-D4 and Ub-F-NAD<sup>+</sup> formation by DTX3L-RD using D4 and 6-Fluo-10-NAD<sup>+</sup> (F-NAD<sup>+</sup>), respectively, as substrates. DTX3L-RD displayed a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> value of 0.0358 ± 0.0034 min<sup>−1</sup> and a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value of 6.56 ± 1.80 μM for Ub-D4 formation, whereas the Michaelis-Menten curve did not reach saturation for Ub-F-NAD<sup>+</sup> formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">fig. S2, D-G</xref>). Comparison of the estimated catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 5457 M<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> for D4 and estimated <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 1190 M<sup>−1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> for F-NAD<sup>+</sup>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>) suggested that DTX3L-RD exhibited 4.5-fold higher catalytic efficiency for D4 than F-NAD<sup>+</sup>. This difference primarily results from a better <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for D4 compared to F-NAD<sup>+</sup>. Although DTX3L-RD showed weak <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for F-NAD<sup>+</sup>, it displays a higher rate for converting F-NAD<sup>+</sup> to Ub-F-NAD<sup>+</sup> at higher substrate concentration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Thus, substrate concentration will play a role in determining the preference.</p>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated the importance of DTX2 His<sup>594</sup> located in the DTC pocket for the interaction with ADPr (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). We examined the effect of mutating the corresponding residue (Tyr<sup>719</sup>) in DTX3L (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>) and found that the Y719A mutant was defective in ubiquitination of ssDNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). Two catalytic residues in the DTC domain of DTX2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), His<sup>582</sup> and Glu<sup>608</sup>, have been previously identified as important for the ubiquitination of ADPr, and are conserved across the DTX family members (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">H</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">fig. S3A</xref>). Based on the similarities in mechanism and conservation of the binding site between ADPr and ssDNA, we next investigated if these catalytic residues were involved in the ubiquitination of ssDNA. Substitution of His<sup>707</sup> by alanine in FL DTX3L completely abolished the formation of Ub-DNA, whilst substitution of Glu<sup>733</sup> by alanine considerably impaired product formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). To test whether this mechanism was conserved across ssNAs, we repeated the mutant DTX3L ubiquitination assay with ssRNA R4 and found similar results (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">fig. S2H</xref>). Overall, the data support the idea that DTX3L utilises the ADPr-binding pocket and the same catalytic residues in the DTC domain to bind and catalyse ubiquitination of ssNAs.</p>

<title>Ubiquitination of ssDNA is unique to DTX3 and DTX3L</title>
<p>Since the DTC domains are conserved between DTX family members and share the ability to ubiquitinate ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), we tested whether ubiquitination of ssDNA was a universal feature of the DTX family. Unexpectedly, only DTX3L and to a lesser extent DTX3 were able to ubiquitinate ssDNA under our assay conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A–D</xref>). Several potential explanations were considered for this preference: (1) other DTX DTCs might not bind ssDNA; (2) other DTXs might favour different sequences of ssDNA; (3) or the arrangement of the RING and DTC domains in relation to each other might play a crucial role in catalysis. To probe this further, we titrated DTX3L-RING with excess DTX3L-DTC and tracked the formation of Ub-DNA, comparing the ability of the separate domains to ubiquitinate DNA <italic>in trans</italic> with that of DTX3L-RD. No ubiquitination of ssDNA was observed even at a 10:1 molar ratio of DTC to RING domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), indicating that the ubiquitination of ssDNA only occurs at an appreciable rate <italic>in cis</italic>. Next, we examined whether DTX2 could catalyse the ubiquitination of ssDNA using 9 different ssDNA sequences and found that DTX2 was unable to ubiquitinate them (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Lastly, we produced domain-swapped variants of DTX2 and DTX3L in which their respective RING and DTC domains were swapped (DTX2<sup>R</sup>-DTX3L<sup>D</sup> and DTX3L<sup>R</sup>-DTX2<sup>D</sup>) and examined the ability of these chimeras to ubiquitinate biotin-NAD<sup>+</sup> or ssDNA D4. We hypothesised that the DTX3L DTC domain of DTX2<sup>R</sup>-DTX3L<sup>D</sup> would be sufficient to enable binding and ubiquitination of ssDNA. Both chimeras were competent in performing ubiquitination of biotin-NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) but were unable to produce Ub-DNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). These results suggest that the specific arrangement of the RING and DTC domains in DTX3L is crucial in specifying Ub modification of ssDNA. Taken together, we propose a mechanism for the ubiquitination of ssNAs by the DTX3L-RD domains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>): the DTC domain binds ssNAs, the RING domain recruits E2∼Ub, and the RD domains bring the thioester linked Ub into proximity with the 3’ end of ssNA. This allows the catalytic residues in the DTC domain to enable the covalent attachment of Ub to the 3’ hydroxyl group on the 3’-end of ssNA. Subsequently, the complex dissociates, releasing ssNA-Ub. The substrates for the DTC domain also include ADPr, NAD<sup>+</sup>, and ADPr-modified nucleic acids and proteins.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The diversity of non-proteinaceous substrates that have been demonstrated to undergo ubiquitination has been steadily expanding over the last few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Here, we report additional examples of non-canonical substrates, namely ssRNA, ssDNA and dsDNA with a 3’ overhang of at least two nucleotides, that undergo ubiquitination by DTX3L. Our biochemical and NMR analyses show that the DTX3L DTC domain binds ssNAs, whilst the RING domain is required for formation of the Ub-NA product. Mutational studies herein reveal three residues, His<sup>707</sup>, Tyr<sup>719</sup> and Glu<sup>733</sup>, within the DTC domain that are required for the formation of Ub-NA. These residues are conserved within the DTC domain, are known to coordinate ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and are proposed to constitute a catalytic triad essential for DTX E3-mediated ubiquitination of ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). These findings, coupled with knowledge that the 3’-hydroxyl of the nucleotide ribose is the modification site, suggest a potential similarity in the mechanism of Ub modification of ssDNA, ssRNA, and ADPr by DTX3L.</p>
<p>The chemical structures of ssNAs and ADPr share a ribose-5-phosphate moiety and potentially an adenine base, depending on the ssNA sequence. While our data suggest that DTX3L prefers to ubiquitinate ssDNA ending with adenosine and to some extent guanosine – both purine bases, pyrimidine bases are also tolerated. This raises uncertainty about how DTX3L DTC binds ssNA. Our experiments with dsDNA with a 3’ overhang in one strand showed that dsDNA with a single nucleotide overhang cannot be ubiquitinated, whereas dsDNA with a two-nucleotide overhang was ubiquitinated. Notably, alterations in the sequence of the last two nucleotides at the 3’ end influenced Ub-DNA product formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). These observations suggest that the DTX3L DTC NA-binding pocket may accommodate a dinucleotide. Upon examining the ssDNA sequences utilised in our study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), it appears that the DTX3L DTC pocket might accommodate diverse sequences in the last two nucleotides at the 3’ end, with adenine being the preferred last nucleotide and cytosine being the least favoured. Despite the sequence conservation of the RING-DTC domain with other DTX proteins, our biochemical data revealed that only DTX3L and DTX3 were able to ubiquitinate ssDNA. A comparison of the aligned sequences of the DTX RING-DTC domains reveals some differences (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">fig. S3A</xref>). The RING domains of DTX3L and DTX3 lack insertions found in DTX1, DTX2 and DTX4, making their RING domains appear smaller (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">fig. S3, A–C</xref>). Furthermore, DTX3L and DTX3 lack an AR motif found near the DTC pocket. The absence of the AR motif causes a slight conformational change near the DTC pocket, resulting in an extended β-strand and the loss of a bulge containing the arginine residue (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">fig. S3, A, D, E</xref>). Consequently, DTX3L has an extended groove adjacent to the DTC pocket that could accommodate one or more of the nucleotides 5’ to the targeted terminal nucleotide. Replacing DTX2-RD’s DTC domain with that of DTX3L produced a chimeric construct that was able to ubiquitinate NAD<sup>+</sup> but not ssDNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">H</xref>), suggesting that additional factors beyond the catalytic residues and ssDNA binding properties of the DTC domain likely play a role in ubiquitination. Our findings show that this reaction only occurs <italic>in cis</italic>, pointing to the orientation of the RING relative to the DTC domain as an important feature in the formation of Ub-DNA. Future structural characterisation of DTX3L-RD binding to ssDNA or ssRNA should provide insights into its binding mode and sequence selectivity, thereby potentially revealing whether the biological substrate is ssDNA, ssRNA or both.</p>
<p>Typically, KH domains contain a GXXG motif within the loop between the first and second α helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). However, analysis of the sequence of the KHL domains in DTX3L shows these domains lack this motif. Multiple studies have shown that mutation in this motif abolishes binding to nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Our findings show the DTX3L DTC domain binds nucleic acids but whether the KHL domains contribute to nucleic acid binding requires further investigation. Additionally, the structure of the first KHL domain was recently reported and shown to form a tetrameric assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Our analysis with DTX3L 232-C, which lacks the first KHL domain and RRM, indicate that it can still bind ssDNA and ssRNA. Despite this, a more detailed analysis will be required to determine whether oligomerization plays a role in nucleic acid binding and ubiquitination.</p>
<p>In recent years, several studies have unveiled diverse reactions catalysed by DTX3L. It forms a heterodimeric complex with PARP9, facilitating the direct ubiquitination of substrates such as H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). This complex can recruit PARylated substrates, either through PARP9 macrodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) or DTX3L DTC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), for direct substrate ubiquitination. Notably, it can catalyse the transfer of Ub to NAD<sup>+</sup> or ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), including ADPr moieties of PARylated substrates, encompassing both proteins and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Moreover, we have expanded its substrate repertoire by demonstrating its ability to directly ubiquitinate the 3’ end of ssNAs. Whether this reaction occurs in cells and what the native substrate (RNA, DNA or both) are yet to be determined. Due to the labile nature of the ribose ester bond and cleavage of Ub conjugates by DUBs, as well as the digestion of nucleic acids by nucleases, our ability to probe the Ub modification of ssNAs in a cellular context has so far been limited. Connecting these chemical reactions to precise biological functions requires carefully designed experiments aimed at distinguishing these functions. Based on the known functions of the DTX3L/PARP9 complex and the findings of this study, we propose several hypotheses for future research. The DTX3L/PARP9 complex has a known involvement in DNA damage repair, utilising PARP9’s macrodomains to recognise PAR and assist in complex recruitment to the damaged foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). RNA itself contributes to DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Likewise, these damage sites may involve DNA breaks with 3’ overhangs. Our findings reveal that DTX3L can recognise and ubiquitinate ssRNA, or dsDNA with a 3’ overhang of two or more nucleotides. This observation suggests a possible substrate for DTX3L in DNA damage repair pathways, which requires further investigation. In eukaryotic cells, messenger RNA (mRNA) is a source of ssRNA that commonly possesses a poly-A tail at the 3’ end. Our data indicated that DTX3L can ubiquitinate ssRNA containing a poly-A sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, lane R9), offering a possibility for future exploration. Viruses contain a diverse range of genetic materials including ssNAs, which might be plausible ubiquitination targets. Studies have shown that expression of DTX3L/PARP9 complex is induced after viral infection, and the complex plays a role in antiviral defense mechanisms by ubiquitinating both host and viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Ubiquitination of viral ssNAs by DTX3L presents another intriguing hypothesis for future research.</p>
<p>Our study reports the first example of direct ubiquitination of ssNAs by DTX3L and illustrates the possibility of additional roles for ubiquitination beyond that of a conventional post-translational modification.</p>

<p>Constructs were generated by standard polymerase chain reaction–ligation techniques and verified by automated sequencing. GST-tagged constructs were cloned into a modified form of pGEX4T-3 (GE Healthcare) with a TEV cleavage site and a second ribosomal binding and multiple cloning site (pABLO TEV) and His-tagged constructs were cloned into a modified form of pRSF_Duet-1 (Novagen) with a TEV cleavage site following the hexahistidine tag. All proteins are from human sequences. RD domains are comprised of residues 388-C of DTX1, residues 390-C of DTX2, residues 148-C of DTX3, residues 387-C of DTX4 and residues 544-C of DTX3L. DTC of DTX3L comprises residues 607-C. PARG comprises residues 448-C. USP2 comprises residues 260-C. The complex, DTX3L(232-C)/PARP9(509-C), was cloned into a bicistronic vector in which PARP9(509-C) was cloned into the first MCS of pRSF_Duet-1 with an N-terminal His-MBP tag followed by a TEV cleavage site, and DTX3L(232-C) was cloned into the second MCS untagged.

<p>In the article by Dearlove et al., the authors present evidence in strong support of nucleotide ubiquitylation by DTX3L, suggesting it is a promiscuous E3 ligase with capacity to ubiquitylate ADP ribose and nucleotides. The authors include data to identify the likely site of attachment and the requirements for nucleotide modification.</p>
<p>While this discovery potentially reveals a whole new mechanism by which nucleotide function can be regulated in cells, there are some weaknesses that should be considered. Is there any evidence of nucleotide ubiquitylation occurring cells? It seems possible, but evidence in support of this would strengthen the manuscript. The NMR data could also be strengthened as the binding interface is not reported or mapped onto the structure/model, this seems of considerable interest given that highly related proteins do have the same activity.</p>
<p>The paper is for the most part well well-written and is potentially highly significant</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript has addressed many of the concerns raised and clarified a number of points. As a result the manuscript is improved.</p>
<p>The primary concern that remains is the absence of biological function for Ub-ssDNA/RNA and the inability to detect it in cells. Despite this the manuscript will be of interest to those in the ubiquitin field and will likely provoke further studies and the development of tools to better assess the cellular relevance. As a result this manuscript is important.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Dearlove et al. entitled &quot;DTX3L ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates single-stranded nucleic acids&quot; reports a novel activity of a DELTEX E3 ligase family member, DTX3L, which can conjugate ubiquitin to the 3' hydroxyl of single-stranded oligonucleotides via an ester linkage. The findings that unmodified oligonucleotides can act as substrates for direct ubiquitylation and the identification of DTX3 as the enzyme capable of performing such oligonucleotide modification are novel, intriguing, and impactful because they represent a significant expansion of our view of the ubiquitin biology. The authors perform a detailed and diligent biochemical characterization of this novel activity, and key claims made in the article are well supported by experimental data. However, the studies leave room for some healthy skepticism about the physiological significance of the unique activity of DTX3 and DTX3L described by the authors because DTX3/DTX3L can also robustly attach ubiquitin to the ADP ribose moiety of NAD or ADP-ribosylated substrates. The study could be strengthened by a more direct and quantitative comparison between ubiquitylation of unmodified oligonucleotides by DTX3/DTX3L with the ubiquitylation of ADP-ribose, the activity that DTX3 and DTX3L share with the other members of the DELTEX family.</p>
<p>Comment on revised version:</p>
<p>In my opinion, reviewers' comments are constructively addressed by the authors in the revised manuscript, which further strengthens the revised submission and makes it an important contribution to the field. Specifically, the authors perform a direct quantitative comparison of two distinct ubiquitylation substrates, unmodified oligonucleotides and fluorescently labeled NADH and report that kcat/Km is 5-fold higher for unmodified oligos compared to NADH. This observation suggests that ubiquitylation of unmodified oligos is not a minor artifactual side reaction in vitro and that unmodified oligonucleotides may very well turn out to be the physiological substrates of the enzyme. However, the true identity of the physiological substrates and the functionally relevant modification site(s) remain to be established in further studies.</p>

The authors include data to identify the likely site of attachment and the requirements for nucleotide modification.</p>
<p>While this discovery potentially reveals a whole new mechanism by which nucleotide function can be regulated in cells, there are some weaknesses that should be considered. Is there any evidence of nucleotide ubiquitylation occurring cells? It seems possible, but evidence in support of this would strengthen the manuscript. The NMR data could also be strengthened as the binding interface is not reported or mapped onto the structure/model, this seems of considerable interest given that highly related proteins do have the same activity.</p>
<p>The paper is for the most part well well-written and is potentially highly significant, but it could be strengthened as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The authors start out by showing DTX3L binding to nucleotides and ubiquitylation of ssRNA/DNA. While ubiquitylation is subsequently dissected and ascribed to the RD domains, the binding data is not followed up. Does the RD protein alone bind to the nucleotides? Further analysis of nucleotide binding is also relevant to the Discussion where the role of the KH domains is considered, but the binding properties of these alone have not been analysed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have tested DTX3L RD for ssDNA binding using NMR (see Figure 4A and Figure S2), which showed that DTX3L RD binds ssDNA. We have now tested the DTX3L KH domains for RNA/ssDNA binding using an FP experiment. However, the FP experiment did not show significant changes upon titrating RNA/ssDNA, suggesting that the KH domains alone are not sufficient to bind RNA/ssDNA. We have opted to put this data in the response-to-review as future investigation will be required to examine whether other regions of DTX3L cooperate with RD to bind RNA/ssDNA. We have revised the Discussion on the KH domains. We now state that “Our findings show the DTX3L DTC domain binds nucleic acids but whether the KHL domains contribute to nucleic acid binding requires further investigation.”</p>

<p>(2) With regard to the E3 ligase activity, can the authors account for the apparent decreased ubiquitylation activity of the 232-C protein in Figure 1/S1 compared to FL and RD?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We found that the 232-C protein batch used in the assay was not pure and have subsequently re-purified the protein. We have repeated the ubiquitination of ssDNA and RNA (Fig. 1H and 1I) and 232-C exhibited similar activity as WT. Furthermore, we performed autoubiquitination (Fig. S1G) and E2~Ub discharge assay (Fig. S1H) to compare the activity. 232-C was slower in autoubiquitination (Fig. S1G), but showed similar activity in the E2~Ub discharge assay as WT. These findings suggest that the RING domain in 232-C is functional and 232-C likely lacks ubiquitination site(s) present in 1-231 region necessary for autoubiquitination.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Was it possible to positively identify the link between Ub and ssDNA/RNA using mass spectrometry? This would overcome issues associated with labels blocking binding rather than modification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tried to use mass spectrometry to detect the linkage between Ub and ssDNA/RNA, but was unable to do so. We suspect that the oxyester linkage might be labile, posing a challenge for mass spectrometry techniques. Similarly, a recent preprint from Ahel lab, which utilises LC-MS, detects the Ub-NMP product rather than the linkage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.19.590267v1.full.pdf">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.19.590267v1.full.pdf</ext-link>).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Furthermore, can a targeted MS approach be used to show that nucleotides are ubiquitylated in cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This will require future development and improvement of the MS approach, specifically the isolation of labile oxyester-linked products from cells and the optimisation of the MS detection method.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Do the authors have the assignments (even partial?) for DTX3L RD? In Figure 4 it would be helpful to identify the peaks that correspond to the residues at the proposed binding site. Also do the shifts map to a defined surface or do they suggest an extended site, particularly for the ssDNA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We only collected HSQC spectra which was insufficient for assignments. We have performed a competition experiment using ADPr and labelled ssDNA, showing that ADPr competes against the ubiquitination of ssDNA (Figure 4D). We have also provided an additional experiment showing that ssDNA with a blocked 3’-OH can compete against ubiquitination of ADPr (Figure 4E). These data, together with our NMR analysis, further strengthen the evidence that ssDNA and ADPr compete the same binding pocket in DTX3L RD. Understanding how DTX3L RD binds ssDNA/RNA is an ongoing research in the lab.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Does sequence analysis help explain the specificity of activity for the family of proteins?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed sequence alignment and structure comparison of DTX proteins using both RING and DTC domains (Fig. S3). These analyses showed that DTX3 and DTX3L RING domains lack a N-terminal helix and two loop insertions compared to DTX1, DTX2 and DTX4. These additions make DTX1, DTX2 and DTX4 RING domain larger than DTX3L and DTX3. It is not clear how these would influence the orientation of the recruited E2~Ub. Comparison of the DTC domain showed that DTX1, DTX2 and DTX4 contain an Ala-Arg motif, which causes a bulge at one end of DTC pocket. In the absence of Ala-Arg motif, DTC pockets of DTX3 and DTX3L contain an extended groove which might accommodate one or more of the nucleotides 5' to the targeted terminal nucleotide. It seems that both features of RING and DTC domains might attribute to the specificity of DTX3L and DTX3. We have included these comparisons in the discussion and suggested that future structural characterization is necessary to unveil the specificity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) While including a summary mechanism (Figure 5I) is helpful, the schematic included does not necessarily make it easier for the reader to appreciate the key findings of the manuscript or to account for the specificity of activity observed. While this figure could be modified, it might also be helpful to highlight the range of substrates that DTX3L can modify - nucleotide, ADPr, ADPr on nucleotides etc.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Dearlove et al. entitled &quot;DTX3L ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates single-stranded nucleic acids&quot; reports a novel activity of a DELTEX E3 ligase family member, DTX3L, which can conjugate ubiquitin to the 3' hydroxyl of single-stranded oligonucleotides via an ester linkage. The findings that unmodified oligonucleotides can act as substrates for direct ubiquitylation and the identification of DTX3 as the enzyme capable of performing such oligonucleotide modification are novel, intriguing, and impactful because they represent a significant expansion of our view of the ubiquitin biology. The authors perform a detailed and diligent biochemical characterization of this novel activity, and key claims made in the article are well supported by experimental data. However, the studies leave room for some healthy skepticism about the physiological significance of the unique activity of DTX3 and DTX3L described by the authors because DTX3/DTX3L can also robustly attach ubiquitin to the ADP ribose moiety of NAD or ADP-ribosylated substrates. The study could be strengthened by a more direct and quantitative comparison between ubiquitylation of unmodified oligonucleotides by DTX3/DTX3L with the ubiquitylation of ADP-ribose, the activity that DTX3 and DTX3L share with the other members of the DELTEX family.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript reports a novel and exciting observation that ubiquitin can be directly attached to the 3' hydroxyl of unmodified, single-stranded oligonucleotides by DTX3L. The study builds on the extensive expertise and the impactful previous studies by the Huang laboratory of the DELTEX family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The authors perform a detailed and diligent biochemical characterization of this novel activity, and all claims made in the article are well supported by experimental data. The manuscript is clearly written and easy to read, which further elevates the overall quality of submitted work. The findings are impactful and will help illuminate multiple avenues for future follow-up investigations that may help establish how this novel biochemical activity observed in vitro may contribute to the biological function of DTX3L. The authors demonstrate that the activity is unique to the DTX3/DTX3L members of the DELTEX family and show that the enzyme requires at least two single-stranded nucleotides at the 3' end of the oligonucleotide substrate and that the adenine nucleotide is preferred in the 3' position. Most notably, the authors describe a chimeric construct containing RING domain of DTX3L fused to the DTC domain DTX2, which displays robust NAD ubiquitylation, but lacks the ability to ubiquitylate unmodified oligonucleotides. This construct will be invaluable in the future cell-based studies of DTX3L biology that may help establish the physiological relevance of 3' ubiquitylation of nucleic acids.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the study is in the lack of direct evidence that the ubiquitylation of unmodified oligonucleotides reported by the authors plays any role in the biological function of DTX3L. The study leaves plenty of room for natural skepticism regarding the physiological relevance of the reported activity, because, akin to other DELTEX family members, DTX3 and DTX3L can also catalyze attachment of ubiquitin to NAD, ADP ribose and ADP-ribosylated substrates. Unfortunately, the study does not offer any quantitative comparison of the two distinct activities of the enzyme, which leaves plenty of room for doubt. One is left wondering, whether ubiquitylation of unmodified oligonucleotides is just a minor and artifactual side activity owing to the high concentration of the oligonucleotide substrates and E2~Ub conjugates present in the in-vitro conditions and the somewhat lower specificity of the DTX3 and DTX3L DTC domains (compared to DTX2 and other DELTEX family members) for ADP ribose over other adenine-containing substrates such as unmodified oligonucleotides, ADP/ATP/dADP/dATP, etc. The intriguing coincidence that DTX3L, which is the only DTX protein capable of ubiquitylating unmodified oligonucleotides, is also the only family member that contains nucleic acid interacting domains in the N-terminus, is suggestive but not compelling. A recently published DTX3L study by a competing laboratory (PMID: 38000390), which is not cited in the manuscript, suggests that ADP-ribose-modified nucleic acids could be the physiologically relevant substrates of DTX3L. That competing hypothesis appears more convincing than ubiquitylation of unmodified oligonucleotides because experiments in that study demonstrate that ubiquitylation of ADP-ribosylated oligos is quite robust in comparison to ubiquitylation of unmodified oligos, which is undetectable. It is possible that the unmodified oligonucleotides in the competing study did not have adenine in the 3' position, which may explain the apparent discrepancy between the two studies. In summary, a quantitative comparison of ubiquitylation of ADP ribose vs. unmodified oligonucleotides could strengthen the study.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. We agree that evidence for the biological function is lacking. While we have tried to detect Ub-ssDNA/RNA from cells, we found that isolating and detecting labile oxyester-linked Ub-ssDNA/RNA products remain challenging due to (1) low levels of Ub-ssDNA/RNA products, (2) the presence of DUBs and nucleases that rapidly remove the products during the experiments, and (3) our lack of a suitable MS approach to detect the product. For these reasons, we feel that discovering the biological function will require future effort and expertise and is beyond the scope of our current manuscript.</p>
<p>In the manuscript (PMID: 38000390), the authors used PARP10 to catalyse ADP-ribosylation onto 5’-phosphorylated ssDNA/RNA. They used the following sequences which lacks 3’-adenosine, which could explain the lack of ubiquitination.</p>

<p>We agree that it is crucial to compare ubiquitination of oligonucleotides and ADPr by DTX3L to find its preferred substrate. We have challenged oligonucleotide ubiquitination by adding excess ADPr and found that ADPr efficiently competes with oligonucleotide (Figure 4D). We have also performed an experiment showing that ssDNA with a blocked 3’-OH can compete against ubiquitination of ADPr (Figure 4E). These data support that ADPr and ssDNA compete for the same binding site on DTX3L.</p>
<p>We also performed kinetic analysis of ubiquitination of fluorescently labelled ssDNA (D4) and NAD+ by DTX3L-RD (Fig. 4F and Fig. S2D–G) to assess substrate preferences. Here, we used fluorescent-labelled NAD+ (F-NAD+) in place of ADPr as labelled NAD+ is commercially available. With the known concentration of fluorescently labelled ssDNA and NAD+ as the standard, we could estimate the rate of ubiquitinated product formation across different substrate concentrations. We have included this finding in the main text “DTX3L-RD displayed _k_cat value of 0.0358 ± 0.0034 min-1 and a _K_m value of 6.56 ± 1.80 mM for Ub-D4 formation, whereas the Michaelis-Menten curve did not reach saturation for Ub-F-NAD+ formation (Fig. 4F and fig. S2, D-G). Comparison of the estimated catalytic efficiency (_k_cat/_K_m = 5457  M-1 min-1 for D4 and estimated _k_cat/_K_m = 1190  M-1 min-1 for F-NAD+; Fig. 4F) suggested that DTX3L-RD exhibited 4.5-fold higher catalytic efficiency for D4 than F-NAD+. This difference primarily results from a better _K_m value for D4 compared to F-NAD+. Although DTX3L-RD showed weak _K_m for F-NAD+, it displays a higher rate for converting F-NAD+ to Ub-F-NAD+ at higher substrate concentration (Fig. 4F). Thus, substrate concentration will play a role in determining the preference.”</p>

<p>(11) Line 295 onwards - this paragraph discusses the role of the KH domains in nucleotide binding, but it is not clear that the authors have directly demonstrated that the KH domains bind nucleotides as all constructs used in the binding experiments in Figure 1/S1 include the RING-DTC domains.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We found that KH domains alone did not bind ssDNA or RNA. We have modified line 295. This section now reads “Typically, KH domains contain a GXXG motif within the loop between the first and second α helix (<italic>22</italic>). However, analysis of the sequence of the KHL domains in DTX3L shows these domains lack this motif. Multiple studies have shown that mutation in this motif abolishes binding to nucleic acids (<italic>23-26</italic>). Our findings show the DTX3L DTC domain binds nucleic acids but whether the KHL domains contribute to nucleic acid binding requires further investigation. Additionally, the structure of the first KHL domain was recently reported and shown to form a tetrameric assembly (<italic>20</italic>). Our analysis with DTX3L 232-C, which lacks the first KHL domain and RRM, indicate that it can still bind ssDNA and ssRNA. Despite this, a more detailed analysis will be required to determine whether oligomerization plays a role in nucleic acid binding and ubiquitination.”</p>
