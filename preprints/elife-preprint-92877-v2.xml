<abstract>
<p>Hearing loss is the most common form of sensory deficit. It occurs predominantly due to hair cell (HC) loss. Mammalian HCs are terminally differentiated by birth, making HC loss challenging to replace. Here, we show the pharmacogenetic downregulation of <italic>Cldn9</italic>, a tight junction protein, generates robust supernumerary inner HCs (IHCs) in mice. The ectopic IHC shared functional and synaptic features akin to typical IHCs and were surprisingly and remarkably preserved for at least fifteen months &gt;50% of the mouseâs life cycle. <italic>In vivo</italic>, <italic>Cldn9</italic> knockdown using shRNA on postnatal days (P) P2-7 yielded analogous functional ectopic IHCs that were equally durably conserved. The findings suggest that Cldn9 levels coordinate embryonic and postnatal HC differentiation, making it a viable target for altering IHC development pre- and post-terminal differentiation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian cochlear hair cells (HCs) comprise a single row of inner hair cells (IHCs) and three rows of outer hair cells (OHCs). HCs transduce sound-mediated mechanical force into neural electrical codes for ear-brain intercommunication. The IHCs are the predominant afferent transducers, while the OHCs amplify low-level sound. Mammalian HCs are terminally differentiated by birth, and they are susceptible to damage by ototoxic drugs, noise-overexposure, aging, and environmental insults, resulting in hearing loss, the most common sensory deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Neitzel and Fligor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rybak and Ramkumar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wilson and Tucci, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Emerging understanding of the mechanisms of transcription factors that induce HC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bermingham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Anoveros et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zheng and Gao, 2000</xref>), and potential induction for regeneration are promising, but none have produced new HCs with sustained functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iyer et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zine et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the current treatment for hearing loss ensuing from HC loss is cochlear implants, despite the potential advantages of HC-replacement therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hinton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sullivan et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In the mammalian cochlea, each HC is separated from the next by intervening supporting cells (SCs), forming an invariant and alternating mosaic along the cochleaâs length. Cochlear SCs can divide and trans-differentiate into HCs in the neonatal stage, serving as a potential resource for HC differentiation using transcription and developmental signaling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">White et al., 2006</xref>). At the neonatal stage, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, a basic helix-loop-helix factor, induces SCs trans-differentiation into HCs. Upregulation of <italic>Atoh1, GFI1,</italic> and <italic>POU4F3</italic> triggers HC differentiation, but the fledgling HCs invariably degenerate, suggesting pre-maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Iyer et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, inhibition of the Notch signaling or upregulation of the wnt1 pathway suffices to drive HC formation from SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tang et al., 2023</xref>), but the functional features of the newly developed HCs are circumspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mizutari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Waqas et al., 2016</xref>). While transcription factors are potent targets for developmental regulation, a cadre of these essential DNA-binding proteins and the precise timing of expression are required to complete the developmental cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jahan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the key is identifying HC-developing bands of transcription and signaling factors to treat hearing loss. Recent studies identified the transcription factors INSM1 and IKZF2 as the regulators of OHC fate, while the transcription factor TBX2 specifies and maintains HC and SC fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaiser et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2023</xref>), advancing understanding of HC-subtype developmental specification mechanisms.</p>
<p>Contact-mediated lateral inhibition is among the final developmental events, where once a cell fate is determined, it inhibits neighboring cells from becoming that cell type. The HC-SC interphase is laced with tight junction proteins (TJPs), which may mediate lateral inhibition mechanisms in nonmammalian vertebrates, though their additional function is unclear in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chrysostomou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goodyear and Richardson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petrovic et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, TJPs were also found to regulate cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">DÃ­az-CorÃ¡nguez et al., 2019</xref>). The TJP scaffold cingulin regulates lateral inhibition in HC-SC rearrangements in the avian basilar papilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goodyear and Richardson, 1997</xref>), and claudin b (<italic>cldnb</italic>), an ortholog of the <italic>cldn4</italic> in humans, upregulation controls cellular patterning during HC regeneration in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Montalbano et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, damaged HC extrusion and the breaking of intercellular junctional adhesions may trigger differentiation and regenerative proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Corwin et al., 2007</xref>). In mammals, E-cadherinâs junctional expression negatively alters HC regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burns et al., 2013</xref>), while <italic>Cldn9</italic> is a positive regulator of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zavala-Zendejas et al., 2011</xref>). Although the high expression of <italic>Cldn9</italic> in the organ of Corti (OC) is well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kudo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>), it is unknown whether regulation of the TJP contributes to sensory cell differentiation.</p>

The genetically modified ES cells containing one copy of the tTA cassette were injected into the healthy albino B6 blastocysts, and the injected blastocysts were transplanted into the uterus of an albino B6 mouse to generate the chimeric mouse. The chimeric mouse was then bred with albino B6 mice to produce the F1 heterozygous mouse, and the germline transmission was confirmed by tail DNA genotyping.

<p>To determine the roles in vivo of Cldn9, we generated doxycycline (dox)-tet-OFF-Cldn9 transgenic mice to regulate expression levels of Cldn9. The downregulation of Cldn9 resulted in functional supernumerary (ectopic) putative IHCs along the cochlear contour. Auditory neurons innervated ectopic mechanically transducing IHCs with synaptic features resembling normal IHCs. Analogous additional putative IHCs differentiation was observed when Cldn9-shRNA was injected through the round window to postnatal (P) days (P2, P4, and P7) mice, suggesting that regulation of Cldn9 levels coordinates embryonic and postnatal development differentiation of SC into IHCs. Notably, the ectopic IHCs at the apical and middle-frequency contour of the cochlea were preserved for over half the mouseâs life cycle (15 months), making Cldn9 a viable target for generating supernumerary IHCs.</p>

<p>To control <italic>Cldn9</italic> levels <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a mouse model with a site-specific genetic switch regulated by dietary doxycycline (dox) and dox-containing drinking water without interfering with the typical profile of <italic>Cldn9</italic> expression ((Supplement figure 1 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>)). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D-F</xref> show the design constructs and Southern blot analysis to confirm the insertion cassette in the ES cells. The genotyping was performed using PCR with the tail tissue. Transgene was generated on mixed C57/B6 and backcrossed into a CBA-CaJ (CBA) background after 12 generations to reduce accelerated progressive hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Peguero and Tempel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sergeyenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Willott and Erway, 1998</xref>). Results of quantitative RT-PCR from the three groups of animals, including wild-type littermates (<italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup>)</italic>, heterozygote <italic>(Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup>),</italic> and homozygous (<italic>Cldn9<sup>T/T</sup>)</italic> with (1 mg/ml) and without dox treatment. Without dox treatment, <italic>Cldn9<sup>T/T</sup></italic> and <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic>mice demonstrate â¼55 and a 40-fold increase in <italic>Cldn9</italic> mRNA expression in cochlear tissue compared with <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cochleae (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). Treatment of <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice with dox (1 mg/ml) resulted in an â¼0.4-0.6-fold decline in mRNA levels compared to <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cochleae (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>), translating to a marked difference in Cldn9 protein expression (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). Immunoelectron microscopic analysis showed that Cldn9 levels reduced by â¼8-fold in the <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> cochlea (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>). The <italic>Cldn9<sup>T/T</sup></italic> mice had a reduced survival rate (1.5Â±0.3 months) relative to the <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> littermates (23Â±2 months<italic>)</italic>. Thus, all experiments were restricted to <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup> and Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermates fed on dox-water (1 mg/ml). There were no recognizable differences in body weight between <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> and <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice for both females and males (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). All animals were in the CBA background. <italic>Cldn9</italic> downregulation in the <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> cochlea showed a qualitative decrease in the Cldn6 and an increase in ILDR1 TJP levels but no comparative differences in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kitajiri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kitajiri and Katsuno, 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Downregulation of <italic>Cldn9</italic> induces the production of ectopic cochlear HCs</title>
<p>5-week-old mice <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> cochleae displayed a notable row of ectopic HCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-E</xref>). The ectopic HCs were observed along the cochlear contour, ranged in abundance from base to apex (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>), and had contact with innervating neurons, shown in cochlear sections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The ectopic HCs were positively labeled with anti-myosin VIIa antibody and phalloidin-labeled stereocilia bundles, which are features of typical HCs. Moreover, the ectopic HCs were not labeled with antibodies to prestin (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>), a marker for OHCs, suggesting the new HCs were likely derived from the IHC lineage. A distinctive &quot;U&quot;-shaped IHC bundle was apparent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) was used for high-resolution analyses to evaluate IHC and their bundle morphology. The original and ectopic IHCs in <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic>mice had normal morphology, including intact hair bundles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). However, the stereocilia bundle orientation was less orderly when compared to those in <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cochlea (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). In addition to their shape, the ectopic HCs expressed multiple CtBP2 labeled synaptic structures in contrast to typical OHCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), and reacted positively to otoferlin antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pangrsic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Roux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Strenzke et al., 2016</xref>) (data not shown). We denote the new HCs as &quot;ectopic&quot; IHCs. IHC counts at different ages (P2-P21) and the cochlear frequency segments (8 kHz and 32 kHz) demonstrate that the <italic>Cldn9</italic>-induced ectopic IHCs were most prominent at the cochlear apex but remained statistically significant at the base (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2E-F</xref>).

<title>Functional features of <italic>Cldn9</italic>-induced ectopic IHCs resemble normal IHCs</title>
<p>Motor responses of both mouse genotypesâ (<italic>Cldn9<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>T</sup>) to auditory stimuli (Preyerâs test) were normal. To evaluate the status of IHC function, we analyzed auditory brainstem responses (ABR) to various sound-pressure levels. <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic>mice responses exhibited similar characteristic responses to broadband clicks and pure tones at 8, 16, and 32 kHz stimuli (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), with â¼5-15 dB threshold elevation in the <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice [<italic>F</italic> (12, 579) =2.07, <italic>P</italic>=0.02]. The pattern of hearing threshold remained virtually constant from 2-8 months of monitoring [<italic>F</italic> (12, 319) =0.50, <italic>P</italic>=0.91]. Moreover, <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic>mice yielded similar distortion products [<italic>F</italic> (6, 357) =0.45, P=0.84] (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting normal OHC function. Besides, a significant drop of ABR wave 1 amplitude was observed in the 2 months <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>T</sup> mice comparing to the wild-type littermates (8 kHz <italic>F</italic> (10, 235)=2.91, <italic>P</italic>=0.02; 16 kHz <italic>F</italic> (10, 237)=1.99, <italic>P</italic>=0.04; 32 kHz <italic>F</italic> (10, 233)=7.80, P=0.00; click <italic>F</italic> (10, 233)=3.99, <italic>P</italic>=0.00 (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8A-D</xref>).

The apparent normal morphology of the ectopic IHCs led to the hypothesis that the IHCs may exhibit functional mechano-electrical transducer (MET) currents. Since active MET channels are partially open at rest, the rapid uptake of the channel permeable lipophilic dye FM1-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gale et al., 2001</xref>), was assessed. Results were determined from FM1-43 dye loading of apically located original and ectopic IHCs in 4-week-old <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> cochlear site representing â¼4-6-kHz characteristic frequencies (CFs). Local perfusion of 10-<italic>Î¼</italic>M FM1-43 resulted in intense dye labeling at the hair bundle level of original and ectopic IHCs. The dye-membrane partitioning and diffusion across the IHCsâ basal aspects occurred within seconds. Z-stacked-time-lapse images were taken below hair bundle level 2-sec post dye exposure and at the basolateral compartment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The time constants (<italic>Ï</italic>) of dye loading at the bundle and supra-nuclear basal membrane levels for original IHCs were (data from 4 mice); 19.4Â±1.1 sec (n=27) and 29.0Â±3.8 sec (n=27), and for ectopic IHCs were 23.1Â±4.5 sec (n=27) and 47.0Â±8.4 sec (n=27) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These results are consistent with functioning IHCs at rest. We conclude that the ectopic IHC bundles are set at the optimum dynamic range to transduce MET current at rest like the original counterparts. IHC MET current magnitudes and kinetic profiles from the original and ectopic rows at the â¼3-4-kHz cochlear-place map in P21 mice were comparable, as summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figures <bold>4E-G</bold></xref>. The normalized current-displacement relationships were well-fitted with a two-state Boltzmann function, portraying marked similarities between the original and the ectopic IHC MET currents (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). However, the displacement-response relationship for the ectopic IHCs was right-shifted, indicative of reduced sensitivity.</p>

<title>Synaptic features of ectopic IHCs and original IHCs</title>

<title>The endocochlear potential and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations in <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>The cochlear duct is furnished with cellular syncytia, K<sup>+</sup> channels, and transporters/pumps that operate to orchestrate a unidirectional (basal to apical) flux of K<sup>+</sup> at the lateral wall to produce the endocochlear potential (EP, â¼+80 mV), an extracellular potential, subserving the proverbial powerhouse for HC functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Von Bekesy, 1952</xref>). A remnant of K<sup>+</sup> flux is a high K<sup>+</sup> endolymph (â¼140 mM) restricted from leakage into the basolateral aspects of HCs by TJ between HCs and SCs. At four months of age, the magnitude of the EP and the K<sup>+</sup> concentration of the endolymph and perilymph of <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice were variable significantly from age-matched littermates. A slight decline in the amplitude of the EP and a substantial rise in perilymph K<sup>+</sup> was detected in 8-month-old <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup>,</italic> but there is no statistical difference compared with the detection in 4-month-old Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup>(<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">S10</xref>).

<title>Discussions</title>
<p>Fate determination is typically completed by birth in cochlear HCs, the primary receptors for mechanosensory sound detection. Generating functional HCs in the mammalian cochlea, with a proper cellular organization that allows for cochlear sound frequency selectivity, has been a demanding yet unsolved challenge. Consequently, deafness resulting from HC loss, which constitutes a significant portion of sensorineural hearing loss, is incurable. Multiple aspects must be considered in inducing HC differentiation since HCs have distinct functional and structural features along the cochlear axis. For optimal sensing of different sound frequencies, cochlear apical-to-basal HCs have diverse structural configurations and ion channel configurations and densities that sculpt and preserve low-to-high frequency sound processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimitsuki et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, HCs are connected to SCs by TJ proteins, enhancing the sensitivity of cochlear OHC sound amplification and maintaining high K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the endolymph at the apical surface and low K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the perilymph milieu surrounding HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cohen-Salmon et al., 2002</xref>). This process establishes a unidirectional K<sup>+</sup> flux in the cochlear duct to generate the EP, which boosts the receptor potential of HC by â¼80 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hudspeth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Von Bekesy, 1952</xref>). Thus, besides overcoming the insurmountable terminal differentiation of HCs, newly differentiated HCs <italic>in vivo</italic> should be equipped with features that resemble the original primary HCs to integrate into the specialized cochlear environment.</p>
<p>Among the multiple approaches used with limited success in HC replacement are overexpressing transcription factors involved in prosensory cell differentiation and silencing inhibitory factors in the induction of HC fate. These methods include 1) Transfecting proneural genes, such as <italic>Atoh1</italic>, in embryonic, newborn, and damaged mature cochlear tissue. However, HC-competent cells invariably lose their responsiveness post-birth and in adult animals. In the case of the damaged cochlea, it is challenging to distinguish between transdifferentiated and repaired HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gubbels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Izumikawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">White et al., 2006</xref>). 2) Simulating cell division using cell-cycle inhibitors, this strategy activates apoptotic genes, leading to cell death and deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lowenheim et al., 1999</xref>). 3) Inhibiting Notch signaling using a <italic>Î³</italic>-secretase inhibitor to stimulate HC differentiation from potential inner ear resident stem cells after noise trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jeon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mizutari et al., 2013</xref>). The scarcity of resident stem cells in adult cochlea may limit this strategy. Thus, multiple therapeutic armamentariums are required to restore hearing in the translational setting.</p>
<p>Previous studies demonstrated that claudin-9 is essential for hearing function and the maintenance of auditory HCs, using an ethyl nitrosourea-induced <italic>Cldn9</italic> mutant mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>), which resulted in OHC degeneration. The current results demonstrate that embryonic regulation of <italic>Cldn9</italic> levels, but not null deletion using the dox-tet-OFF-<italic>Cldn9</italic> transgenic strategy induces functional ectopic IHCs, but not OHCs, along the cochlear contour with increasing numbers from base to apex. These <italic>Cldn9</italic> downregulated-induced IHCs mature, acquiring robust MET currents and neural innervation with synaptic structures markedly like resident IHCs. Results also revealed that postnatal downregulation of <italic>Cldn9</italic> levels <italic>in vivo</italic>, using shRNA, suffice to coordinate SC differentiation into IHCs. Because the ectopic IHCs remain viable for a sizable duration of the mouseâs lifespan, the Cldn9 regulatory strategy to induce IHC differentiation subserves a feasible approach to replace lost HCs. The downregulation of Cldn9-mediated selective IHC-increase indicates Cldn9âs role during the latter phase of HC differentiation, perhaps post-OHC-fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Anoveros et al., 2022</xref>). The findings suggest Cldn9-mediated effects may be upstream of the transcriptional factor-mediated trans-differentiation of HCs since the ectopic HCs had features of IHCs, in contrast to primordial HCs generated by <italic>Atoh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). It deepens our understanding of the importance of tapping into later stages of HC differentiation, which will likely result in end-organ-specific HCs.</p>
<p>Moreover, a pragmatic strategy requires titrated levels of the TJP to render new HCs without compromising the sensory epithelial cellular syncytial, a decline in the EP, and, significantly, a gradual extracellular K<sup>+</sup> increase that mediates undue HC depolarization and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>). The critical period at which alteration of TJP level can induce ectopic and new IHCs remains unclear, although, in the current report, we have demonstrated that functional and viable mature ectopic IHCs can be generated by regulating Cldn9 levels.</p>
<p>Our findings that downregulation in the TJP, Cldn9, can regulate IHC differentiation are in conceptual agreement with reports demonstrating that lateral inhibition can affect HC specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lanford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stone and Rubel, 1999</xref>). Similar accounts are described where newly formed HCs express delta1-like (DII1) and jagged 2 (Jag2) ligands to mediate Notch1-receptor activation in adjacent antecedent cells, thereby inducing the expression of hairy and enhancer of split (Hes1/5), which suppresses pro-HC transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bermingham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chrysostomou et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this scheme, interruption of Notch1 signaling during HC development leads to HC overproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brooker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lanford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zine et al., 2000</xref>). In lateral inhibition, the foremost developing cells adopting HC fate antagonize the neighboring cells from differentiating into HCs through direct cell-to-cell communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brown and Groves, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mizutari et al., 2013</xref>). A possible explanation for the current findings is that TJ proteins, mainly Cldn9, are signaling in Notch-mediated lateral induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daudet and Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lewis, 1998</xref>). Canonical Notch signaling is activated when a Notch ligand, such as Delta-like1 (DI1) in an adjacent HC, binds to a receptor in the SC, resulting in the release of the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor (NICD), which translocate to the nucleus to activate the Notch-targeted gene transcriptions. The findings also confirm that the Notch signaling pathway is responsible for homeostatic TJP expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and promotes barrier function <italic>in vivo</italic> in the RAG1-adoptive transfer model of colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mathern et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, occluding junction depletion disrupts Notch and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in intestinal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fairchild et al., 2016</xref>). In the scheme provided in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, Cldn9 may subserve the signaling catalyst to activate NICD cascades that suppress neighboring SCs from trans-differentiation. A limitation of the model is that if <italic>Cldn9</italic>-induced effects were solely dependent on the Notch signaling, ectopic OHCs and IHCs would have ensued. Alternatively, <italic>Cldn9</italic> levels disruption may alter the mechanical properties of the developing and maturing organ of Corti that may trigger ectopic IHC differentiation, an epiphenomenon independent of the Notch signaling. Future studies and emerging findings on HC differentiation will likely address these shortcomings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaiser et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2023</xref>). In cochlear tissue, downregulation of Cldn9 led to concomitant reduced expression of Cldn6 and increased ILDR1. It is unclear whether the induction of ectopic resulted from reduced expression of <italic>Cldn9</italic> alone or combined TJP alterations. It is conceivable that targeting a different TJP may have similar effects on OHC differentiation, requiring impending studies.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>All procedures were performed under research guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee of the University of Nevada, Reno. Mice of either sex were studied. Doxycycline (dox)-tet-OFF-Cldn9 transgenic mice were generated. In the mouse line, dox concentration can regulate the level of Cldn9 gene expression. The construct consisted of a tetracycline-based genetic switch (tTA cassette) made of three main modules: 1) The tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA); 2) The neomycin resistance gene flanked by LoxP sites; and 3) Six copies of the tet operator (tetO) fused to the minimal CMV promoter. The tTA cassette was inserted at the â110 -nucleotide position upstream of the translational start of <italic>Cldn9</italic> to generate the targeting vector. The targeting vector was electroporated into B6 mouse embryonic stem cells. Following the selection in G418, DNA samples from the neomycin-resistant ES cell clones were prepared for short-arm PCR/sequencing analysis and Southern blot analysis to confirm the insertion of the tTA cassette into ES cells. Genetically modified ES cells containing one copy of the tTA cassette were injected into healthy albino B6 blastocysts, and the injected blastocysts were transplanted into the uterus of an albino B6 mouse to generate the chimeric mouse. The chimeric mouse was then bred with albino B6 mice to produce the F1 heterozygous mouse, and the germline transmission was confirmed by tail DNA genotyping. The selection marker was deleted in the tTA cassette by crossing the F1 mouse with the embryonic Cre line (B6.129S4-<italic>Meox2<sup>tm1(cre)Sor</sup></italic>/J). We backcrossed the B6/129S4 background unto the CBA/CaJ mouse background for 12 generations to prevent the masking of age-related hearing loss effects. 1.0 mg/ml of dox water were fed to <italic>Cldn9</italic> breeding pairs from breeding day one, and heterozygote <italic>(Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup>)</italic> and Homozygous (<italic>Cldn9<sup>T/T</sup>)</italic> mice and wild-type littermates (<italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup>)</italic>, through the time until for the sample collections. The body weights of mice were recorded. Genotyping was performed by PCR using a set of primers that flank the knockin in the <italic>Cldn9</italic> gene: forward primer Cldn9 knockin-F (knockin-sequence): 5ââATCCACGCTGTTTTGACCTCâ3â, Cldn9 R3 (Reverse): 5ââ TCTGGACCACACAGGACATCâ 3â. PCR fragments were separated with 2% agarose gel for an 800 bp product in wild-type, 365 bp in homozygous mutants, and two in heterozygous littermate mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Auditory brainstem recordings (ABR) and Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) measurements</title>
<p><italic>Cldn9</italic> mice (<italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic>, and <italic>Cldn9<sup>T/T</sup></italic>) littermates were tested at 2-8 months of age. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine by intraperitoneal (IP) injection (25 mg/kg). Body temperature was monitored using a rectal probe and maintained at 36.8Â±1.0Â°C using a homeothermic device (Harvard Apparatus). ABR and DPOAE measurements were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dou et al., 2004</xref>). For ABR assays, thresholds were obtained by presenting tone bursts at 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz and a clicking sound from 0 dB to 90 dB sound pressure levels (SPL) in 5 dB intervals. Tones were 2.5 ms, while click was 0.1 ms in duration, with a repetition rate of 21/s. Electrodes were placed sub-dermally behind the tested ear (reference), the vertex (active), and the back (ground). Evoked potentials were averaged over 512 repetitions and collected using a Tucker Davis Technology (TDT) RZ6 processor and BioSigRZ software. The threshold was defined as the lowest intensity of stimulation that yielded a repeatable waveform based on an identifiable ABR wave.</p>
<p>DPOAE measurements were performed using the same TDT system with two calibrated MF1 speakers connected to an ER10B+ microphone. Data was collected every 21 ms and averaged 512 times. DPOAEs were recorded using two pure tones with frequencies f1 and f2, using an f2/f1 ratio of 1.2. Input/output (I/O) functions were obtained by increasing the primary tone L1 (and corresponding L2) in 5-dB steps from 20 to 80 dB SPL at 8, 16, and 32 kHz frequencies. During DPOAE testing, the probe assembly was placed in the mouseâs left ear canal after visual inspection to ensure no ear infection or inflammation of the tympanic membrane. DPOAE thresholds were defined as the lowest level of f1 required to produce a DPOAE â¥ â5 dB SPL(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

Five to eight-week-old <italic>Cldn9</italic> mice and littermates were sacrificed for TEM, and the cochleae were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at 4Â°C overnight. After several washes with buffer alone, cochleae were fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide at RT for 1-hr. After that, the fixed cochleae were decalcified in 10% EDTA for 3â4 days. Fixed and decalcified cochleae were dehydrated using a graded ethanol series and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut with a diamond knife. Specimens were examined using an electron microscope.</p>
<p>For SEM, mice were perfused with 4% PFA in 1x PBS, inner ears were isolated, and the stapes footplate was removed. Ears were flushed and fixed overnight in 4% PFA and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 1x PBS. After washing in ddH<sub>2</sub>O 3X for 1 hour, the samples were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for approximately 1 hour.

Three-way ANOVA was used to analyze the ABR and DPOAE threshold. Two-way ANOVA was applied for the ABR wave 1 amplitude/latency data, synapse count, and HCs count. Significance was assumed at a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.05 in all statistical analyses.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic diagram of the construct used to regulate translation of CLDN9.</title> <p>We will use the tTA (âtet-offâ) cassette developed by Seeburg and Adelman for expressing the SK3 channel {Bond, 2000 #182} (Bond et al., 2000) and modified to include unique <italic>Not</italic> I and <italic>Xho</italic> I cloning sites at each end of the cassette. The cassette contains three motifs: i.) tTA preceded by the tri-partite leader sequence that confers highly efficient translational initiation followed by the SV40 polyA and transcriptional termination sequence, ii.) bacterial neomycin (G418) resistance gene driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter and the yeast URA3 gene; these selectable markers are flanked by loxP sites and followed by the human growth hormone (hGH) polyA and transcriptional termination sequence, iii.) six copies of the tet operator (tetO6) fused to the minimal cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The native <italic>Cldn9</italic> promoter drives the expression of tTA, which in CLDN9 from the tetO6/CMV promoter. In the presence of Dox (crossed circles), tTA is bound and cannot bind to the tetO6/CMV promoter, thereby turning off the transcription of CLDN9.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study reports the induction of supernumerary inner hair cells in the mouse cochlea upon reducing the expression level of a tight-junction protein (claudin-9) at developmental stages. Although these ectopic hair cells are functional and persists through adulthood, the evidence supporting some of the claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>, particularly regarding the underlying mechanisms of cell differentiation and the potential of the approach for hair-cell regeneration. The work will be of interest to scientists working in the development and regeneration of hair cells in the inner ear.</p>

<p>The focus of this manuscript was to investigate the role of Cldn9 in the development of the mammalian cochlea. The main rationale of the study is the fact that cochlear hair cells do not regenerate, so when damaged they are lost forever, causing irreparable hearing loss. The authors have attempted to address this problem by inducing the ectopic production of additional hair cells and test whether they acquire the morphological and functional characteristics of native hair cells. They show that downregulation of Cldn9 using a well-established genetic manipulation of transgenic mice led to the production of extra numerary inner hair cells, which were able to survive for several months. By performing a large battery of experiments, the authors were able to determine that the native and ectopic inner hair cells have comparable morphological and physiological characteristics. There are several conclusions highlighted by the authors in different parts of the manuscript, including the key role of Cldn9 in coordinating embryonic and postnatal development, the differentiation of supporting cells into inner hair cells, and the possible use of Cldn9 to induce inner hair cell differentiation following deafness induced by hair cell loss.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed the following points raised during the first submission: statistical analysis and wave 1 analysis. However, very little was done to address the other key aspects of my report, which are essential for the interpretation of the results. As mentioned in my previous report, some aspects of the work are not justified by the current data and will require either a tone-down of the claims or further experiments.</p>
<p>For example, one puzzling finding that is not addressed in the manuscript is the lack of functional benefit from these additional inner hair cells. In fact, it appears to be detrimental based on the increased ABR thresholds and EP. So, it is not clear to this reviewer the advantage of this approach.</p>
<p>It is not clear what direct evidence there is, apart from some immunostaining, indicating that the ectopic inner hair cells derive from the supporting cells. This part would benefit from a more careful consideration and maybe an attempt at a more direct experimental approach. Alternatively, the text should be modified accordingly.</p>
<p>One point that should be made clear throughout the manuscript is that the ectopic inner hair cells are generated in a cochlea that is undergoing normal maturation. Thus, there is no guarantee that modulating the expression levels of Cldn9 in a deaf mouse lacking hair cells would produce the same result as that shown in this study. This point should be at least discussed.</p>

<p>The study by Chen et al reports an interesting and previously unknown phenomenon of generation of supernumerary inner hair cells (IHCs) in response to downregulation of Cldn9 during embryonic or postnatal development. The authors developed an inducible doxycycline (dox)-tet-OFF-Cldn9 transgenic mice to regulate expression levels of Cldn9 and show that downregulation of Cldn9 resulted in additional, although incomplete row of IHCs immediately adjacent to the original IHC row. These induced extra IHCs had similar well-developed hair bundles, able to mechanotransduce and were innervated by auditory neurons, resembling wild-type IHCs. In addition, the authors knock down Cldn9 postnatally using shRNA injections in P1-7 mice with similar induction of extranumerary IHCs next to the original row of IHCs. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by the data. However, some data analyses are limited, and some important controls are not shown.</p>
<p>
The data from this study are important and promising for future gene therapy applications. The generation of extra IHCs postnatally using downregulation of Cldn9 by shRNA could potentially be used as a replacement of IHCs lost after noise-induced trauma, ototoxic agents, or other environmental trauma. However, it is not clear if downregulation of CLDN9 in adult mice would lead to extranumerary IHCs. On the other hand, the replacement of lost inner hair cells due to various genetic mutations by inducing supernumerary mutant IHCs with the same abnormalities would not be reasonable.</p>
<p>The authors show that postnatally generated ectopic IHCs are viable and mechanotransducive, but the hearing function of the mice with ectopic hair cells is not improved. However, the ectopic hair cells seems to be generated from supporting cell trans-differentiation, and the intricate mosaic of the organ of Corti is altered (the extra row of IHCs seems to be positioned immediately adjacent to the original IHC row), which could by itself lead to hearing issues. It is not clear if the newly formed unusual junctions between the ectopic and original IHCs are sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of the endolymph to the basolateral surface of IHCs. Also, it is not clear if the other organ of Corti tight junctions could lose their tightness due to the downregulation of Cldn9, which could over time affect the endocochlear potential and hearing abilities as shown by this study.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript could be of interest to scientists working in the inner ear development and regeneration field, and to the hearing researchers in general and perhaps developmental biologists and cell biologists interested in tight junction proteins and their function.</p>
<p>Strength</p>
<p>The methodologies used are solid and convincing. There is a great potential for practical use of these valuable findings and new knowledge on IHC developmental regulation by Cldn9 expression.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>Some of the data in this study would benefit from showing corresponding negative controls and higher-resolution images of CLDN9 localization, which the authors chose not to show in the revised manuscript. Importantly, CLDN9 immunofluorescence staining data look different from previously published observations and show cytoplasmic staining of supporting cells only and did not show the staining of tight junctions between the OHCs and supporting cells as well as between the IHCs and supporting cells as reported previously (Kitajiri et al., 2004; Nakano et al., 2009, Ramzan et al., 2021). The organ of Corti schematics showing CLDN9 expression reflects the authors' immunostaining data but is unusual considering that CLDN9 localizes to the tight junctions of the reticular lamina as was shown by immuno-EM in this study and described in previous publications (Kitajiri et al., 2004; Nakano et al., 2009, Ramzan et al., 2021). However, the authors did not provide an explanation for these discrepancies in the Discussion of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Also, more detailed investigations would in some instances clarify the data. For example, it is not clear if the downregulation of Cldn9 affects the other genes known to participate in cell fate determination, and why downregulation of Cldn9 expression resulted in production of extranumerary inner hair cells only and not the other cell types, like OHCs, for example.</p>

<p>The work by Yingying Chen, Jeong Han Lee, and co-authors summarizes the morphological and functional outcomes of Cldn9 loss in the inner ear, particularly in the organ of Corti. While the study does not provide mechanistic insights into how the developmental loss of Cldn9 leads to ectopic hair cell formation, the phenomenon itself is curious. The work primarily focuses on a detailed characterization of the ectopic hair cells, which is well done. Despite the lack of mechanistic insights, the study will be of interest to the inner ear field if several major issues with the manuscript are addressed.</p>
<p>(1) The title, &quot;Genetic and pharmacologic alterations of claudin9 levels suffice to induce functional and mature inner hair cells,&quot; is misleading. First, both manipulations (knockout and knockdown) are genetic, and no pharmacology is involved. Second, both manipulations are carried out during the embryonic and neonatal periods, and there is no evidence of mature hair cell regeneration in this study. The title should be revised to reflect this. A more accurate title could be: &quot;Developmental loss of Cldn9 results in functional ectopic inner hair cells that persist through adulthood.&quot;</p>
<p>
(2) Contact-mediated lateral inhibition in hair cell fate determination is one of the most well-studied phenomena in the inner ear field, and numerous groups have shown that it is mediated by Notch signaling. This must be added to the introduction.</p>
<p>
(3) A large body of literature has demonstrated that Notch inhibition alone is not sufficient to regenerate hair cells in adult mice. Therefore, if the loss of claudins disrupts Notch signaling-the proposed mechanisms in the discussion - it is unlikely to be a viable therapeutic strategy for hair cell regeneration in the adult ear. Furthermore, no hair cell ablation experiments were conducted to demonstrate what could be considered true regeneration. These speculative statements should be removed or revised accordingly.</p>
<p>
(4) Cldn9 is a tight junction protein and should localize to the membrane. Yet, the data presented show what appears to be diffuse cytoplasmic staining, which is concerning.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We revised parts of the results section and added the statistical analysis to the ABRs and DPOAE (lines 151-159; Page 29, lines 846-880).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The generation of functional extranumerary inner hair cells (IHCs) in postnatal mice, particularly with virus-mediated knockdown of Cldn9 mRNA expression in the neonatal cochlear duct, is an important observation. It is significant because not many studies exist that report molecular manipulations of the neonatal organ of Corti that result in the generation of new hair cells that remain functional and appear to be intact for an extended time, here more than one year. Overall, this is a carefully conducted study; the observations are clear, and the methods are solid. Two independent methods for reducing the expression of Cldn9 mRNA were used: a conditional transgenic model and AAV-mediated knockdown with shRNA. The lack of a functional explanation of how the reduced expression of Cldn9 specifically leads to the formation of extranumerary IHCs leaves open questions. For example, it is not clear whether there is indeed a fate change happening and whether Cldn9 reduction affects developmental processes. The discussion of how Cldn9 reduction potentially affects Notch signaling, without hard evidence, is handwaving.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is a very interesting observation and somewhat unexpected in its specificity for inner hair cells. Using two different approaches to manipulate Cldn9 expression provides a strong experimental foundation. The study is conducted quantitatively and with care.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The lack of mechanistic insight results in an open-ended story where at least the potential interaction of Cldn9 reduction with known and well-characterized signaling pathway components should have been investigated. This missed opportunity limits the scope of the study and should be addressed: How does Cldn9 downregulation affect the expression levels of other known genes linked to hair cell production and cell fate decisions? Quantitative RT-PCR works well for the authors, and comparing the expression of Notch or other known pathway components could provide mechanistic insight.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We did quantitative RT-PCR to compare the expression of Notch or other known pathway components in our future work. Besides, we used smFISH with ccnd1 probe and cdkn1b probe to detect cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27) separately in the mouse cochlea. GAPDH was selected as a reference gene. The quantification results showed no significant difference between <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice at P2, P7, and P14.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is unclear how P21 inner hair cells were identified for the patch-clamp experiments shown in Fig 4E-H. This is a challenging endeavor without the possibility of using specific markers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not have a specific marker for IHCs. However, one with experience in hair bundle morphology and knowledge of their location in the epithelia can identify IHCs from the upright microscope.</p>

<p>This important study by Chen et al help in advancing our knowledge about the regulation of inner hair cell (IHC) development and revealed the role of Cldn9 in IHC embryonic and postnatal induction by transdifferentiation from the supporting cells. The authors developed an inducible doxycycline (dox)-tet-OFF-Cldn9 transgenic mice to regulate expression levels of Cldn9 and show that downregulation of Cldn9 resulted in additional, although incomplete row of IHCs immediately adjacent to the original IHC row. These induced extra IHCs had similar well developed hair bundles, able to mechanotransduce and were innervated by auditory neurons resembling wild-type IHCs. In addition, the authors knock down Cldn9 postnatally using shRNA injections in P1-7 mice with similar induction of extranumerary IHC next to the original row of IHCs. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by the data, but some data analysis needed to be clarified and some crucial controls should be provided to improve the confidence in the presented results. There is a great potential for practical use of these valuable findings and new knowledge on IHC developmental regulation to design Cldn9 gene therapy in the future.</p>
<p>The described by Chen et al mechanisms of extra hair cell generation by suppression of the tight junction protein Cldn9 expression level are very interesting and previously unknown. In particular, the generation of extra IHCs postnatally using downregulation of Cldn9 by shRNA could potentially be very useful as a replacement of HCs lost after noise-induced trauma, ototoxic agents, or other environmental trauma. On the other hand, the replacement of lost hair cells due to various genetic mutations by inducing a supernumerary IHCs with the same abnormalities would not be reasonable.</p>
<p>The authors show that postnatally generated ectopic IHCs are viable and mechanotransducive, but it would be nice to show the maturation steps of ectopic IHC during this postnatal period. For example, stereocilia bundles of the ectopic hair cells should mature later than the original IHCs. A few days after viral delivery of shRNA, you should be able to observe immature IHC bundles that unequivocally will define newly generated IHCs. Unfortunately, the authors show only examples of already mature ectopic IHCs at P21 and in 5-6 weeks old mice and at relatively low resolution. Also, during maturation, IHCs usually have transient axo-somatic synapses that are not present in mature IHCs. It would be great to see if, in 5-6 weeks old mouse, the ectopic IHCs still have axo-somatic synapses or not, and if the majority of the ectopic IHCs have innervation. Some of the data in this study would benefit from showing corresponding controls and some - from higher resolution imaging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. The objective of the paper is to report the phenomenon and present the coarse features of the Cldn9-mediated induced ectopic hair cells. The systematic details are for future studies, which are ongoing and out of the current scope.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the mammalian cochlea, each HC is separated from the next by intervening supporting cells, forming an invariant and alternating mosaic along the cochlea's length. Cochlear supporting cells in some conditions can divide and trans-differentiate into HCs, serving as a potential resource for HC differentiation, using transcription and other developmental signaling factors.</p>
<p>However, when ectopic hair cells are generated from supporting cell trans-differentiation, the intricate mosaic of the organ of Corti is altered, which could by itself lead to hearing issues. In case of downregulation of Cldn9, the extra row of IHCs seems to be positioned immediately adjacent to the original IHC row. It is not clear if the newly formed unusual junctions between the ectopic and original IHCs are sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of the endolymph to the basolateral surface of IHCs. Also, it is not clear if the other organ of Corti tight junctions could lose their tightness due to the downregulation of Cldn9, which could over time affect the endocochlear potential as shown by this study and hearing abilities.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There was a slightly increased ABR threshold (5 dB -15 dB) (Fig. 4A) and a decrease in the magnitude of the EP and the rise in the K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the endolymph and perilymph of Cldn9+/T mice compared to from age-matched littermates (S10) indicated there might be a compromised epithelium tight junction. The downregulation of Cldn9 affected the endocochlear potential and hearing abilities ((Fig. 4A, S10) after 2m, suggesting an age-dependent effect. The effective downregulation of Cldn9 would require proper titration of Cldn9 levels to induce extra hair cells with intact epithelial integrity; work may require additional studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Importantly, CLDN9 immunofluorescence staining data that show cytoplasmic staining of supporting cells should be revisited and the organ of Corti schematics showing CLDN9 expression should be corrected, considering that CLDN9 localizes to the tight junctions of the reticular lamina as was shown by immunoEM in this study and described in previous publications (Kitajiri et al., 2004; Nakano et al., 2009, Ramzan et al., 2021). While the current version of the manuscript will interest scientists working in the inner ear development and regeneration field, it could be more valuable to hearing researchers outside this immediate field and perhaps developmental biologists and cell biologists after proper revision.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments. We were concerned about the observation, but the results were consistent. Indeed, that was the motivation for performing the immunoEM (S3). A follow-up report may address it further.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Please address the points I made about the presentation (word choice, inconsistencies in labeling, etc). It ultimately helps a reader to understand and to follow your logic. This is an important observation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We corrected the inconsistencies in labeling and addressed the points you suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Making the extra effort to investigate a possible interaction between Cldn9 and Notch signaling would substantially increase the significance of the work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions. We will explore it in our future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>Some sentences would benefit from revision:</p>
<p>- The abstract argues that hearing loss is incurable because mammalian hair cells are terminally differentiated (3rd sentence). This is not accurate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Mammalian HCs are terminally differentiated by birth, making HC loss challenging to replace.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The second sentence of the second paragraph of the introduction, &quot;Cochlear SCs can divide and trans-differentiate into HCs, serving as a potential resource for HC differentiation, using transcription and developmental signaling factors (White et al., 2006),&quot; should be referenced in the context of the animal's age. This feature of supporting cells is transient and only observed in neonatal mice. The following sentences in the same paragraph would also benefit from being placed into the same context when appropriate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. These sentences have been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Introduction: &quot;But functional features of the newly developed HC are circumspect.&quot; The authors probably meant &quot;circumspect,&quot; but is this the appropriate word? Also, please use the plural of HC = HCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The sentence has been corrected to âbut the functional features of the newly developed HCs are circumspectâ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Introduction: Isn't an essential function of tight junctions in the organ of Corti the separation of fluid-filled spaces? Perhaps additional functions of tight junction proteins are unclear, but at least this one function appears clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We added the âadditionalâ before the âfunctionâ in this sentence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Introduction: &quot;using shRNA injection in postnatal (P) days (P1-7) mice.&quot; This is a rather vague statement that could be better defined. Perhaps mention that the injections targeted the round window and that an AAV-based method was used. Also, it is not clear from the methods whether the injection needle pierced the round window. Please clarify. Likewise, the methods state that these experiments were conducted in P1-P15 mice, but the main text says P1-P7. Later, in the results section and in the figure legend for Fig 7, the mice are between P1-P7 and P14; the figure itself is labeled with P1 and P14. However, data is presented (Fig 6) for injections at P2, P4, P7, and P14. In the text referring to Fig 6B in the results section, it is stated, &quot;By contrast, the P14-21 inner ear transfected with Cldn9-shRNA produced no detectable increase...&quot; Only data for P2, P4, P7, and P14 injections are presented. These are minor issues, but please check the inconsistencies because they make it difficult to follow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We corrected this sentence to âAnalogous additional putative IHCs differentiation was observed when Cldn9-shRNA was injected through the round window to postnatal (P) days (P2-7, and P14) miceâ¦â.  The label in Fig 7A has been changed to P2-7, and the text referring to Fig 6B in the result section has been changed to âthe P14 inner ear transfected with Cldn9-shRNA produced no detectable increase...&quot;.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Last statement of the Introduction: &quot;making Cldn9 a viable target for generating transformed IHCs.&quot; It is not clear what transformed IHCs are.</p>

<p>We replaced the transformed with supernumerary.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>- Results, Fig 1. Please add a schematic drawing showing all elements of the inducible gene expression cassette in the final transgenic allele, and please illustrate how the system works. This helps the reader to understand the strong Cldn9 mRNA upregulation in Cldn9(T/T) mice, where expression is likely driven by the CMV promoter and reciprocally, in the presence of doxycycline, the suppression of transcription by binding of the tTA-dox protein to the TRE elements of the modified CMV promoter.

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Below are my suggestions, questions, and criticisms.</p>
<p>(1) The red outline on Fig1A schematic does not correspond to the previously published expression pattern of CLDN9 in the organ of Corti reticular lamina tight junctions (Kitajiri et al, 2004, Nakano et al., 2009, Ramzan et al., 2021). Also, there are no tight junctions all around the pillar cells. The tight junctions are restricted to the sites of tight attachments between two cells. The immunofluorescence staining using CLDN9 antibody looks rather cytoplasmic (Fig 1 and Fig S1) than associated with the tight junctions as it was shown by immunoEM data here and reported previously (Kitajiri et al, 2004; Nakano et al, 2009; Ramzan et al, 2021). Please correct the schematic and explain your data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have redrawn the diagram (Fig. 7).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The CLDN9 staining in Figure 1, B and C, highlights the cytoplasm of the supporting cells, and hair cells devoid of the staining. From the images in Fig. S1C, it also looks like CLDN9 is present only in supporting cells and not in hair cells? How would the authors reconcile their data with Cldn9 expression data from the gEAR database and Ramzan et al.'s 2021 RNAscope data? Please provide the validation of the antibody used in this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recognize the reviewerâs concern but RNA and protein levels are not always in parallel.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 1D. The dash lines from the targeting vector to the wt allele seem to indicate a recombination event. Please do not show the recombination event, instead just show what part of the targeting vector was incorporated to replace wt Cldn9. There is no description in the figure 1 legend what purple arrows and arrowheads mean and what yellow and orange line segments in the floxed allele schematic indicate. Please also show where the BstAPI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites are.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided supplement Fig 1., and have noted the BstAPI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites in Fig. 1D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) What does the organ of Corti that has 40-to-55-fold increase in Cldn9 mRNA expression looks like before dox treatment? Any abnormalities at all? How is CLDN9 protein localization looks in the Cldn9+/T untreated mice? Do they have normal number of IHCs? Cldn9+/T untreated mice should be used as another control at least in Figure S1. What does the organ of Corti that has a 40-to-55-fold increase in Cldn9 mRNA expression look like before dox treatment? Are there any abnormalities at all?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The untreated <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice can grow normally but are not fertile. So, we used a very low concentration of dox water (0.1 mg/ml) instead of normal water to keep the breeding pairs. The protein level increased in the <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice compared with <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic>mice. With 0.1 mg/ml dox water, they also showed ectopic IHCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) It is interesting that decline of 0.4-0.6-fold in mRNA level leads to about 8-fold decrease in protein level based on your immunoEM data on tight junctions of IHC with supporting cells. Do you observe the same effect in OHC-SC tight junctions, or the decrease was observed selectively around IHCs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is alluding to matching RNA and protein levels. It appears that for Clnd9 one cannot expect a closely matched relationship.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The quality of the immunoEM data is great, but a control of secondary antibody alone staining in wt and Cldn9+/T dox treated should be shown and compared to the Cldn9+/T treated sample.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising the issue. Secondary antibodies are used as a control in all immunoEMs in the laboratory. We opted not to show negative results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors observed a decrease in Cldn6 expression albeit not quantitative in response to Cldn9 downregulation. How were the immunofluorescence signals compared and evaluated? Please provide a detailed description of the method used. Did the authors used the same image acquisition parameters? Was the Cldn9 and Cldn6 immunostaining done using same protocol with the same aliquot and dilution of the secondary antibodies, etc.? The staining for CLDN6 seems to be concentrated in the cytoplasm of supporting cells, and not in the tight junctions, similar to CLDN9 immunoreactivity shown in Fig. S1C and to the ILDR1 pattern of staining in Fig. S3. How can the authors explain this? How were the antibodies validated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Cldn9 and Cldn6 immunostaining were done using the same protocol with the same aliquot and dilution of the secondary antibodies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) CLDN14 is also expressed in the organ of Corti tight junctions. What happened to this TJ protein during CLDN9 downregulation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We detected Cldn14 with immunostaining in the <italic>Cldn9+/T</italic> mice and <italic>Cldn9+/+</italic> mice fed with 0.25 mg/ml dox water, and the results showed increased expression of Cldn14 in <italic>Cldn9+/T</italic> mice. Detail alterations of other TJ proteins have been reserved for future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) When supernumerary IHCs were observed in Cldn9+/T mice, have the authors noticed a corresponding decrease in supporting cells surrounding IHCs? Quantification of the IHCs supporting cells would be useful. Do the ectopic IHCs have apical tight junctions with original IHCs or they are surrounded by supporting cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We quantified the SCs around the IHCs but did not detect significant differences among the groups.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) The authors indicated that viable PE IHCs were observed in 15 months old Cldn9+/T dox treated mice. How stereocilia bundles look in these ectopic hair cells? Are they preserved similar to the original IHCs or degenerated? It is hard to see this in Fig 3, phalloidin panel. High-resolution SEM would show this better.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the remaining ectopic IHCs in 15 months, we did not detect apparent differences in hair bundles compared with the original IHCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Interestingly, the authors indicate that the highest number of the ectopic IHCs were developed in the apical turn and the higher elevation of ABR threshold was also observed at low frequencies end. This may indicate that extra IHCs do not help hearing function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The extra IHCs showed along the whole cochlea, even though it is more obvious in the apical turn. The declined hearing may have resulted from the leakage of the endolymph K+ to the perilymph and EP decline.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) No age-matched wt control is shown for decreased expression of Cldn9 after shRNA injection at P2 (Fig. 6A).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As indicated earlier, we opted to state but did not show negative results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) Figure 6C. The better- quality SEM images showing a longer stretch of IHCs are needed to convince readers that there are ectopic IHCs that are well preserved in 5-6 weeks old mice in all cochlear turns after GFP-Cldn9 shRNA treatment at P2-P7.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In S4, we showed that there are ectopic IHCs along the cochlear axis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(14) Do scrambled shRNA control samples had some ectopic IHCs? This control is missing in Fig.6D.</p>
