Their study at these resolutions is key toward achieving a better understanding of their ecology. We focus on cellulose degradation of the canonical <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic> system to comprehend how microbes build and use their cellulosomal machinery at these nanometer scales. Degradation of cellulose, the most abundant organic polymer on Earth, is instrumental to the global carbon cycle. We reveal that bacterial cells form ‘cellulosome capsules’ driven by catalytic product-dependent dynamics, which can increase the rate of hydrolysis. Biosynthesis of this energetically costly machinery and cell growth are decoupled at the single-cell level, hinting at a division-of-labor strategy through phenotypic heterogeneity. This novel observation highlights intrapopulation interactions as key to understanding rates of fiber degradation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic></kwd><kwd>cellulosome</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2476/2 -1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medalia</surname><given-names>Ohad</given-names></name><name><surname>Mizrahi</surname><given-names>Itzhak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>64084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mizrahi</surname><given-names>Itzhak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_207453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medalia</surname><given-names>Ohad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014456</institution-id><institution>Center for Bioenergy Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bomble</surname><given-names>Yannick J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phenotypic heterogeneity at the single-cell level of cellulosomal machinery biosynthesis suggests a division-of-labor strategy as revealed by the nanoscale mechanistic and ecological investigation of in situ structure and distribution of cellulosomes on bacteria while interacting with the cellulosic substrate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants represent the largest reservoir of biomass on the planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bar-On et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, plant cell-wall degradation is essential for carbon recycling, environmental homeostasis, and of major significance to waste management and mammalian gut ecosystems. Bacteria are central players in this process, as some are capable of deconstructing cellulosic fibers into simple sugars that fuel microbial growth and fermentation cascades essential for nutrient cycling as well as their use in industrial processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Himmel and Bayer, 2009</xref>). The intricate chemical composition of the plant cell wall is the major barrier to biomass recycling, and there is a long ongoing scientific and global interest to unravel how such microorganisms achieve the complex task of fiber degradation.</p><p>Several anaerobic bacteria have evolved energy-effective strategies to solve the challenge of fiber breakdown through the biosynthesis of multienzymatic complexes called cellulosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artzi et al., 2017</xref>). Cellulosomes are massive multimodular protein machineries, composed of numerous enzymes attached via complementary cohesin–dockerin interactions to enzyme-integrating subunits called ‘scaffoldins’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bayer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fontes and Gilbert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamed et al., 1983b</xref>). Genomes of the different cellulosome-producing bacterial species can encode up to 200 different types of dockerin-bearing proteins (notably enzymes) which bind tenaciously to the cohesins of the scaffoldin subunit. The resultant multiprotein complexes, heterogeneous in their enzyme content, are highly efficient in deconstructing plant cell-wall polysaccharides. Although extensive research has been dedicated to investigate cellulosome activity and its composition in various cellulosome-producing bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artzi et al., 2017</xref>), how cellulosomes are structured and organized on the bacterial cell wall in situ remains largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>). Understanding how these complexes interact with their substrates while they are situated on the bacterium would therefore contribute immensely to our comprehension and control of such an efficient enzymatic strategy. Moreover, the question of how and whether the molecular organization of these complexes on single cells is interconnected with functional and regulatory aspects of cellulosomes at the population level remains unanswered and is essential to our understanding of both the fiber-degradation process and these canonical enzymatic complexes.</p><p>Conventional methods have identified structural features of individual cellulosomal modules, as well as crucial interface residues that are responsible for the specific tenacious intermodular cohesin–dockerin binding between these definitive cellulosomal modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carvalho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carvalho et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nash et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Noach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noach et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salama-Alber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wojciechowski et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, larger cellulosome fragments have been structurally studied by complementary approaches, that is, crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering, computational modeling, and negative-staining transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bomble et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bule et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García-Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayer et al., 1987</xref>). Additional studies have revealed some of the structural features of a cellulosome fragment composed of five separate cellulosomal modules from three different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Currie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, truncated recombinant minicellulosome complexes, from the canonical and most-studied cellulosome-producing bacterium <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic>, comprising a trivalent truncated scaffoldin and three copies of the Cel8A cellulosomal endoglucanase, have been analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García-Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>). These in vitro studies, focused mainly on specific enzymatic and structural components of the complex, without the presence of the microbial cells on which the cellulosomal complexes are situated. Pioneering studies published in the 1980s, using electron microscopic imaging, have provided a two-dimensional glimpse into the massive size and organization of the cellulolytic machinery on the bacterial cell surface of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/FdP6Fx/fdNKe+738tL+Y4BWu+yRHlo+6ixIM">Artzi et al., 2017;</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/FdP6Fx/fdNKe+738tL+Y4BWu+yRHlo+6ixIM">Bayer and Lamed, 1986;</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/FdP6Fx/fdNKe+738tL+Y4BWu+yRHlo+6ixIM">Lamed et al., 1983b;</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/FdP6Fx/fdNKe+738tL+Y4BWu+yRHlo+6ixIM">Madkour and Mayer, 2003;</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayer et al., 1987</xref>). Nevertheless, these studies employed dehydration and chemical fixation procedures, which thus restrict the structural information and characterization of these bacterial cell-wall systems.</p><p>Hence, structural and ecological insights into the in situ fiber-degrading process at the molecular scale, while these complexes are in their active state, remains unknown. To this end, we exploited current technological advances that combined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2015</xref>) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beck and Baumeister, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weber et al., 2019</xref>) together with conventional approaches of microbial genetics, physiology, and biochemistry. Using these complementary approaches, we gained insights into the in vitro and in situ structure of the cellulosomal enzymes, from the single-enzyme level to the distribution of cellulosome complexes across single cells in a population, to reveal how cellulosome structure and distribution may be connected to gene expression and regulation at the population level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cellulosomes surround the bacterium as an extensive layer of complexes at constant distance from the cell wall</title><p>To examine the detailed organization of the cellulosome complexes in situ, we applied cryo-EM and cryo-ET imaging to intact <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> bacterial cells.

The cellulose was identified within the dense cellulosome layer, suggesting a flexible organization of the enzymes within the cellulosome layer while encompassing the cellulose substrate, presumably offering an advantage for its degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). To further understand the enzyme–substrate interface and gain more insight into the density of enzymes around the substrate, we employed a template-matching procedure. For this procedure, we purified a recombinant form of the most expressed <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> dockerin-containing enzyme, which is crucial for enzymatic digestion of MCC, Cel48S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morag et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoav et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zverlov et al., 2005</xref>) and determined its structure at 3.4 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). The enzyme-matching structures were found in close proximity to the cellulose and appeared to localize between the cellulose chains, presumably, to increase the efficiency of degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In order to better understand and validate our observation for the interactions between cellulosome and cellulose, we purified Cel48S together in a designer cellulosomal complex with a recombinant divalent truncated CipA scaffoldin that contains two cohesin modules (cohesin numbers 2 and 3) and the inherent CBM3a (see Materials and methods). This in vitro minicellulosome complex was incubated with MCC and analyzed by cryo-ET. The architecture found in this in vitro experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C, D</xref>) shows an overwhelming resemblance to that found in situ around the bacterium, further corroborating our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Indeed, our analysis revealed that the structure of cellulose undergoes major organizational changes during the interaction with the cellulosomes, transforming from a well-ordered crystalline cellulose structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) to deconstructed crystalline packaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, arrowheads). It should be noted that at the resolution of individual tomograms, we cannot distinguish the Cel48S from the other large globular enzymes of the cellulosome. Therefore, it is plausible that the depicted densities in our rendered view can be attributed the Cel48S enzyme as well as to additional cellulosome containing enzymes. Since the contrast of the globular cellulolytic enzymes is relatively high in comparison to the flexible rod-like appearance of scaffoldins, we could not reliably follow the densities of scaffoldins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Interactions of cellulosomes with the cellulosic substrate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An <italic>x</italic>–<italic>y</italic> projection through a tomogram of a bacterium grown on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC; cyan), ~1 nm in thickness, shows the MCC densities and globular protein densities.

Interestingly, in the late stages of growth, when the high-density subpopulation comprises only 20% of the overall population, the amount of the soluble sugar concentration remained stable and did not decrease even when the population growth reached its peak. This observation supports the notion that soluble sugar is provided in saturating amounts at this stage, and the 1:5 ratio of the high-density subpopulation is therefore maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, 30–50 hr).

To this end, we devised an experiment in which we added cellobiose, the major degradation product of cellulose, at the onset of cellulosomal expression (10 hr after exposure of the cells to cellulose). Addition of cellobiose resulted in a negative effect on Cel48S expression, the main cellulosome component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), thereby suggesting that the availability of soluble sugars as products from the cellulose-degradation process is one of the cardinal ways for controlling the expression of cellulosomal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Dynamic phenotypic heterogeneity during cellulose degradation in the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> population.</title><p>The figure represents a schematic model of the findings revealed in our study.

High sugar availability results in a basal level of cellulosome expression with no change in phenotypic heterogeneity of the population (<bold>B</bold>), where the high-density phenotype serves as a cellulosomal reservoir for future sugar-limiting conditions. In contrast, low sugar availability triggers the expression of the cellulosomal machinery (<bold>C</bold>), resulting in a major change in phenotypic heterogeneity of the population, where the high-density phenotype ratio increases and provides the present and future populations with high levels of sugar production from the cellulose substrate. This in turn increases the available sugar concentrations, arresting cellulosome expression and production resulting in an increase in the ratio of the low-density phenotype without the production of the high-cost enzymatic machinery, whereby the high-density phenotype returns to low ratios in the population (bet-hedging strategy).

In addition, our structure-based approach served to generate physiological and ecological hypotheses.</p><p>Our study revealed that cellulosome complexes are arranged as a highly dense interconnected layer of protein around the bacterial cell at a distance of ~64 nm from the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Intriguingly, we could directly observe the cellulosomal machineries during their interaction with the plant-fiber polymers as they envelop them with their numerous enzymes and modulate the crystalline organization of the cellulosic substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). We also determined the structure of the dominant cellulosomal enzyme, namely the Cel48S cellobiohydrolase. Our data confirmed a previously published X-ray structure of this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) and added new information regarding the amino acids that link the enzyme to its dockerin and on the interaction of this enzyme with cellulose. In addition, our data suggested a flexible organization of the enzymes within the cellulosome layer while encompassing the cellulose substrate, presumably offering an advantage for its degradation. Such conformational adaptability of the cellulosome on the cellulose surface was also recently observed by atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eibinger et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our structural approach led to the detection and visualization of two major subpopulations in the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> culture under the same experimental conditions: one with cellulosomes covering the bacterial cells in very high density and another in which cellulosomes are nearly absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that the ratio between these two phenotypes is dynamic and connected to the population growth stage and sugar availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). After exposure to new environmental conditions lacking soluble sugars, the expression level of the cellulosomal machinery increased in the majority of the cells in the population, after which it was repressed in most cells of the population. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the expression of the cellulosome machinery is triggered upon exposure to low levels of soluble degradation products (e.g., cellobiose) and then inhibited by increasing sugar availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). These findings add an additional dimension to the regulation of expression of the cellulosome machinery, which has been reported previously to be mediated by sensing of extracellular polysaccharides via alternative sigma factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nataf et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, it is interesting to note that the basal expression level of the cellulosome machinery at time 54 hr is 20% of its highest expression levels at time 15 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This corresponds to the proportion of the high-density subpopulation in the overall population (20%) at times 0 and 54 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), thus suggesting that the basal RNA levels stem from the expression of the cellulosome machinery in the high-density cell subpopulations.</p><p>The distribution of cellulosome density on the cell walls exhibited an all-or-none phenotype, where cells were either highly decorated with cellulosomes or almost devoid of cell-surface cellulosomes, without observable distribution of intermediate phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), thus suggesting that cellulosome shedding occurs in an abrupt manner, similar to protein secretion, and not a gradual process during growth. Taking our overall findings into account, it is tempting to speculate that a division-of-labor strategy takes place in the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> population. In this scenario, the high-density subpopulation expresses the cellulosome machinery comprising enormous amounts of proteins and consequent metabolic costs, thus limiting the resources that this subpopulation can invest in growth, while at the same time the low-density subpopulation does not pay these costs and can invest them in propagation. Hence, the low-density subpopulation balances the essential but costly high-energy process of expressing the cellulosomes by the high-density subpopulation.</p><p>Finally, our findings are consistent with a bet-hedging strategy in the <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> population, mediated by phenotypic heterogeneity, whereby the presence of diverse phenotypes adapted to different environments would spread the risk of varying environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Villa Martín et al., 2019</xref>). Such a strategy would be particularly effective for organisms under fluctuating environmental conditions, where a proportion of individuals in the population pay an energetic/fitness cost by ‘preparing’ for changing environmental conditions. Similarly, in our case, although the soluble sugar levels are not limiting at stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the high-density cell subpopulation, albeit at lower ratios, still expresses the costly cellulosomal machinery and would therefore provide the first line of defense for a future nutrient-poor and hostile environment containing only cellulose polymers.</p><p>The approach, whereby structural biology under near-physiological conditions was employed to understand microbial ecology, provides a pioneering view, at the micro- and nanoscales, into the unique organization of the cellulosome machinery on the bacterial cell surface, the way cellulosomes interact with their cellulosic substrate and how they are distributed and regulated across the bacterial population during the growth process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression of the Cel48S enzyme and scaffoldin protein</title><p>The plasmid for Cel48S expression was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vazana et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Steven Smith as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mirjam Czjzek (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the cryo-EM structure of Cel48S allows the template-matching procedure, employed subsequently in the manuscript, it in itself does not represent particularly novel data. As such, this section and associated figures should be shifted to supplemental material. In doing so, the flow and focus of the manuscript will remain entirely on the novel electron tomography data and follow-up studies.</p><p>2) The additional comments/suggested edits by the reviewers will also make for a more clear and comprehensive manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Considerations for strengthening the manuscript:</p><p>1. As written, the section describing the cryo-EM structure of Cel48S, somewhat disrupts the flow of the manuscript by being situated in the &quot;Cellulosome surround the bacteria as an extensive layer of complexes at constant distance from the cell wall&quot; section and &quot;Cellulosome interactions with its substrate&quot;. Further, while the cryo-EM structure reveals a 10-amino acid residue section of the linker connecting the catalytic module to the dockerin module that had not previously been observed, this finding and the structure of the catalytic module, which has previously been determined by X-ray crystallography, does not have the novelty/impact of the other data. Consideration could be given to including this data as supplemental with reference at an appropriate place (e.g., line 214 in Cellulosome interactions with its substrate section).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In my opinion, this work is timely and of great interest to the field of microbial recycling of cellulosic biomass. In my opinion, the only weakness of the manuscript lies in the fact that some of the methods descriptions are particularly short and lack some crucial informative details, making it sometimes complicated to distinguish and understand in-situ experimental set-ups from data obtained from recombinant in-vitro set-ups, and how they correlate; as an example, it does not become clear why a cryo-EM 3D structure of Cel48S was necessary for this study, and why in some (in situ) figures this seems to be the only enzyme present.</p><p>Specific comments to the authors:</p><p>1. Introduction page2-3: the statement line 78-80, that structural insights into the fiber-degrading process at the nanoscale level remain unknown, is only partially true. A recent study, also entitled the &quot;cellulosome in action&quot;, is depicting first insights using AFM. This work by M. Eibinger et al., ACS Cent Sci. 2020 May 27; 6(5): 739-746. doi: 10.1021/acscentsci.0c00050, should be mentioned and cited here somewhere.</p><p>2. Page 5 lines 158-159: &quot;We therefore studied the structure of recombinantly expressed full-length Cel48S by cryo-EM.&quot;</p><p>I imagine that this cryo-EM structure determination was necessary to be able to perform the template-matching procedure, described later in the manuscript. At least in the material and methods description, this should be mentioned (if my assumption is correct). Otherwise, the low(er) resolution cryo-EM structure is not of great interest in the way it is discussed here. From supplemental Figure S3 it becomes clear that only 7% of the single-particle images were used for structural refinement; it would be interesting to know if the other particles were omitted only because of lack of resolution/quality or if the low percentage of identical images is due to inherent flexibility of the enzymes, or part of the enzyme (i.e specific loops or sub-domains?)? Are the other images just different and lower resolution &quot;views/orientations&quot;, or do they contain any additional information that could be of interest (as compared to a more rigid crystal structure, at a higher resolution but tightly packed within the crystal lattice)?</p><p>3. The title of the Figure legend for Figure 2 is misleading: &quot;Structure of Cel48S and location of cellulosomal enzymes around the C. thermocellum cell&quot;.</p><p>While I do see the cryo-EM structure of Cel48S depicted in panels A to D, I do not see any illustration of the location of the enzymes around the C. thermocellum cell in this figure!</p><p>4. Page 7 line 206: &quot;The cellulose was identified within the dense cellulosome layer,…&quot;</p><p>How were the cellulose fibers identified? Is it 'only' visual inspection? Do the cryo-ET images allow determining density values that can be correlated to different types of molecules/objects/molecular structures?</p><p>5.

It is a bit intriguing that the selected portion showing presumably Cel48S enzymes in contact with cellulose micro-fibrils of the in situ study matches extremely well with the more directed in vitro image of Cel48S (only) containing mini-cellulosomes in interaction with microfibrils. Indeed, one would expect to have globular enzymes of variable size in the in-situ image, since the &quot;natural cellulosome&quot; does contain other enzymes than Cel48S, although proven to be a major component. Also, where is the rest of the cellulosomal proteins located in this view? Why nothing resembling a scaffoldin can be seen in close vicinity? Are the parts to that extent flexible (through the linkers) that the rest of the machinery comes to lie so distantly that they are not caught in this close-up view?</p><p>7. In the same idea, it would be interesting to describe, and for the reader to know, if the template matching of Cel48S works in all places? Or do globular regions that cannot be matched with Cel48S occur? Page 17, in the methods description line 596, the authors state that 63 Cel48S enzymes can be assigned in a sub-volume shown in Figure 3C. Thus, are there regions (and how many) that can not be assigned to Cel48S?</p><p>Also the sentence: &quot;The final number of assigned 63 Cel48S for the subvolume (Figure 3C)&quot; needs to be reformulated or corrected; as it stands it is not clear.</p><p>8. Figure 3F. From the text, it is not clear what &quot;treatment&quot; has been done to the data to &quot;extract&quot; the altered microcellulose fibrils, shown in these rendered illustrations.

Why not present the figure with a cellulosomal particle in orange, at least for one of these extractions (as it appears in one of the videos)? It would render the figure much clearer.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76523.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the cryo-EM structure of Cel48S allows the template-matching procedure, employed subsequently in the manuscript, it in itself does not represent particularly novel data.

We studied pure MCC as an initial step, and we thus learned its characteristic density and appearance. The density differences and appearance between the MCC and the globular enzymatic densities and the flexible scaffoldins between the globular enzymes are very clear.

At the resolution of the intact bacterial tomogram, it is challenging to distinguish between the Cel48S and other similar size cellulosome enzymes. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the template matching procedure also identified some of the other globular cellulosome enzymes, around the MCC. However, the most abundant enzyme in the cellulosome is the Cel48S. Additionally, the binding of pure Cel48S to MCC mimics well the in situ binding properties of the cellulosome enzymes, presumably due to the high binding affinity of the enzymes to their substrate. It is also important to mention that proteins that are substantially smaller or larger than Cel48S, as well as of different shapes, e.g. elongated structure of scaffoldins, were not matched in this procedure. For example, the physical characteristics of the globular cellulolytic enzymes are of relatively high contrast compared to the flexible rod-like appearance of scaffoldins. This is the primary reason that we detected the globular density of the enzymes rather than the scaffoldins.</p><p>In the rendering views we labeled manually the MCC while the globular densities were detected automatically, however, also manual segmentations are shown (Figure 2—figure supplement 4, B and C). In some cases, elongated protein densities are seen between globular enzymes within the cellulosome layer which may resemble scaffoldins, however, they are challenging to track due to their flexibility and limited contrast. In addition, no high resolution structures of these proteins are available for comparison using template matching.</p><p>To summarize, we are confident that the globular structures detected correspond to the cellulosome enzymes and that Cel48S is the most abundant enzyme of the cellulosomes (Raman et al., 2011; Morag et al., 1991; Zverlov et al., 2005; Yoav et al., 2017). We also find the high resemblance between the in vitro and in situ structures overwhelming. However, in this resolution of the individual tomogram, we cannot distinguish the Cel48S from the other large globular enzymes of the cellulosome. Therefore it is likely that most of the density we found are of Cel48S enzyme while residual other cellulosomal enzymes may have detected as well.
