cells is well established. In contrast, the contribution of individual Orai isoforms to SOCE and their downstream signaling functions in B cells are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate changes in the expression of Orai isoforms in response to B cell activation. We show that both Orai3 and Orai1 mediate native CRAC channels in B cells. The combined loss of Orai1 and Orai3, but not Orai3 alone, impairs SOCE, proliferation and survival, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation, mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis, and the metabolic reprogramming of primary B cells in response to antigenic stimulation. Nevertheless, the combined deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 in B cells did not compromise humoral immunity to influenza A virus infection in mice, suggesting that other in vivo co-stimulatory signals can overcome the requirement of BCR-mediated CRAC channel function in B cells. Our results shed important new light on the physiological roles of Orai1 and Orai3 proteins in SOCE and the effector functions of B lymphocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Orai1</kwd><kwd>Orai3</kwd><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>CRAC channels</kwd><kwd>SOCE</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-HL150778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trebak</surname><given-names>Mohamed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI162971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rahman</surname><given-names>Ziaur SM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI097302 and R01-AI130143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feske</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30-AI164803-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Anthony Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene knockout in cell lines and mice reveal that store-operated calcium entry is synergistically mediated by Orai1 and Orai3 channel proteins in B cells and is important for signaling to the nucleus and metabolic activity in response to antigenic stimulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is an essential regulator of immune cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trebak and Kinet, 2019</xref>). Crosslinking of immunoreceptors like the T cell receptor (TCR) or B cell receptor (BCR) triggers a robust elevation in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations through the release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and a concomitant influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baba and Kurosaki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King and Freedman, 2009</xref>). In lymphocytes, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry across the plasma membrane (PM) is predominately achieved through CRAC channels, which constitute the ubiquitous SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trebak and Kinet, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trebak and Putney, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaeth et al., 2020</xref>). Stimulation of immunoreceptors coupled to phospholipase C isoforms results in the production of the secondary messenger inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), which triggers the release of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the activation of ER-resident IP<sub>3</sub> receptors. A reduction in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations is sensed by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and its homolog STIM2, resulting in a conformational change and clustering in ER-PM junctions where STIM molecules interact with and activate PM hexameric Orai channels (Orai1-3) to mediate SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lunz et al., 2019</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through CRAC channels regulates immune cell function through a host of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive transcription factors including the NFAT, nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB), c-Myc, and mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trebak and Kinet, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaeth and Feske, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaeth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vaeth et al., 2017a</xref>). The coordination of these master transcriptional regulators is indispensable for innate and adaptive immune cell effector function including entry into the cell cycle, clonal expansion, cytokine secretion, differentiation, and antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shaw and Feske, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trebak and Kinet, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaeth et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Orai1 has long been established as a central component of the <italic>native</italic> CRAC channel in all cell types studied. Although all three Orai isoforms are ubiquitously expressed across tissue types and can form functional CRAC channels when ectopically expressed, only recently have Orai2 and Orai3 emerged as regulators of <italic>native</italic> CRAC channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emrich et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsvilovskyy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaeth et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoast et al., 2020a</xref>). Patients with inherited loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in <italic>Orai1</italic> (e.g. R91W mutation) develop a CRAC channelopathy with symptoms including combined immunodeficiency, ectodermal dysplasia, muscular hypotonia, and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCarl et al., 2009</xref>). While these patients display relatively normal frequencies of most immune cell populations, they are highly susceptible to reoccurring viral, bacterial, and fungal infections due to defects in T cell expansion, cytokine secretion, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaeth et al., 2020</xref>). There are currently no reported patient mutations in <italic>Orai2</italic> or <italic>Orai3</italic> genes and the role these channels play within the immune system had largely been unclear. Interestingly, recent studies utilizing global Orai2 knockout mice have demonstrated that loss of Orai2 leads to enhanced SOCE and corresponding CRAC currents in bone marrow-derived macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, enamel cells, and mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eckstein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsvilovskyy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaeth et al., 2017b</xref>), suggesting that Orai2 is a negative regulator of CRAC channel activity. Combined knockout in mice of both Orai1 and Orai2 in T cells led to a near ablation of SOCE and impaired humoral immunity, while ectopic expression of pore-dead mutants of Orai1 (E106Q) or Orai2 (E80Q) into individual <italic>Orai1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Orai2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells blocked native SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaeth et al., 2017b</xref>). Similarly, the generation of HEK293 cell lines lacking each Orai isoform individually and in combination resulted in altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation profiles, CRAC currents, and NFAT isoform activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emrich et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emrich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoast et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoast et al., 2020b</xref>). These data provide evidence that Orai2 and Orai3 exert negative regulatory effects on native CRAC channels possibly by forming heteromeric CRAC channels with Orai1.</p><p>In contrast to T cells, much less is known regarding the role of SOCE in B lymphocytes. Early landmark work investigating B cell-specific STIM knockout mice established that STIM1 mediates the vast majority of SOCE in B cells, while only the combined deletion of both STIM1 and STIM2 resulted in substantial impairments in B cell survival, proliferation, and NFAT-dependent IL-10 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>). Unexpectedly, mice with STIM1/STIM2-deficient B cells show normal humoral immune responses to immunization with both T cell-dependent and independent antigens. These and other studies suggest that the severe immunodeficiency observed in CRAC channelopathy patients is due to impaired T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vaeth et al., 2016</xref>). Investigation of <italic>Orai1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on the mixed Institute for Cancer Research (ICR) background and <italic>Orai1<sup>R93W</sup></italic> knock-in mice (the equivalent of human R91W mutation) demonstrated that SOCE is significantly attenuated in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gwack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCarl et al., 2010</xref>). However, SOCE in B cells is only partially reduced with the loss of Orai1, suggesting that Orai2 and/or Orai3 mediate the remaining SOCE in B cell populations. A recent study showed that the deletion of Orai3 in mice does not affect B cell function and humoral immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting other Orai homologs compensate for the loss of Orai3. Thus, the contribution of each Orai isoform to native CRAC channel function and downstream signaling in B cells has remained obscure.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the contributions of Orai isoforms to SOCE and its downstream signaling in B cells through multiple CRISPR/Cas9 knockout B cell lines and novel B cell-specific <italic>Orai</italic> knockout mice. Our findings demonstrate that the expression of each Orai isoform is dynamically regulated in response to B cell activation and that the magnitude of SOCE is unique among effector B cell populations. We show that the deletion of Orai1 alone does not alter BCR-evoked cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, proliferation, and development. Unexpectedly, we show that Orai3 is involved in regulating B cell SOCE and downstream signaling functions. Deletion of both Orai1 and Orai3 strongly inhibits SOCE and hampers mitochondrial metabolism in B cells. Transcriptome and metabolomic analysis uncovered key signaling pathways that are regulated by SOCE and the phosphatase calcineurin for the efficient transition of B cells from a quiescent to a metabolically active state. Surprisingly, humoral immunity to influenza A virus infection of mice with B cell-specific deletion of both Orai1 and Orai3 was unaltered, suggesting that alternative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent signaling pathways activated in vivo through co-stimulatory receptors can overcome the loss of CRAC channel activity in B cells. Our data elucidate the role of SOCE in B cell functions and show that CRAC channel function in B lymphocytes is mediated by both Orai1 and Orai3. This knowledge is important for the potential targeting of CRAC channels in specific lymphocyte subsets in immune and inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Orai channel isoforms are dynamically regulated in response to B cell activation</title><p>Throughout their lifespan, B lymphocytes must undergo dramatic periods of metabolic adaptation whereby naÃ¯ve, metabolically quiescent cells prepare to clonally expand and differentiate into effector populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akkaya and Pierce, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boothby and Rickert, 2017</xref>). Induction of these diverse metabolic programs is driven by downstream BCR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in combination with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent costimulatory signals including CD40 activation and/or stimulation with various toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akkaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baba and Kurosaki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, using Seahorse assays we first evaluated how activation of wild-type mouse primary splenic B cells (isolated as described in methods) regulates oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) as indicators of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). NaÃ¯ve primary B cells from mouse spleens were isolated by negative selection and stimulated for 24 hr under five different conditions as follows: (1) control unstimulated cells (Unstim), (2) stimulation with anti-IgM antibodies (IgM) to activate the BCR, (3) stimulation with anti-CD40 (CD40), (4) stimulation with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and (5) co-stimulation with anti-IgM and anti-CD40. B cell stimulation for 24 hr led to a robust increase in basal OCR, except for B cells stimulated with anti-CD40 alone where the increase in basal OCR was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows that B cells stimulated with either anti-IgM, anti-IgM +anti-CD40, or LPS become highly energetic and upregulate both OXPHOS and glycolytic pathways. However, B cells stimulated with anti-CD40 alone remain metabolically quiescent like control non-stimulated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used the protonophore trifluoromethoxy carbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP) to dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential and calculate the maximal respiratory capacity of B cells.

To gain insights into the molecular composition of CRAC channels in B cells, we first developed an in vitro system utilizing the mouse A20 B lymphoblast cell line to generate single and double Orai1 and Orai3 knockout cell lines with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Two guide RNA (gRNA) sequences were utilized to cut at the beginning and end of the coding region of mouse <italic>Orai1</italic> and <italic>Orai3</italic> (<italic>mOrai1</italic> and <italic>mOrai3</italic>), effectively excising the entirety of the genomic DNA for each <italic>Orai</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We generated multiple A20 clones that were lacking Orai1 and Orai3 individually and in combination and these knockout clones were validated through genomic DNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) and the absence of <italic>Orai1</italic> or <italic>Orai3</italic> transcripts by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâD</xref>). We measured SOCE in A20 cells after passive store depletion with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA). A20 cells lacking Orai1 demonstrated a large reduction in maximal SOCE by ~62%, while in cells lacking Orai3 SOCE was reduced by ~28% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Importantly, the combined deletion of both Orai1 and Orai3 caused a near abrogation of SOCE by ~91% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Furthermore, measurements of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations induced by anti-IgG stimulation demonstrated that the oscillation frequency was substantially reduced with combined Orai1/Orai3 knockout, while only slightly reduced with the loss of either Orai1 or Orai3 individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2GâK</xref>). These data suggest that both Orai3 and Orai1 were involved in optimal CRAC channel function in A20 B lymphoblasts. These data are consistent with the function of Orai channels in other cell types.

The lack of effect of 2-APB is likely due to the residual SOCE mediated by the remaining Orai3 isoform, which is resistant to inhibition by 2-APB. Furthermore, SOCE in Orai3 knockout B cells was inhibited at a significantly faster rate by 2-APB compared to wild-type B cells and was not further inhibited by Gd<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>). The small amount of SOCE remaining in Orai1/Orai3 double knockout cells was reduced to baseline following the addition of 2-APB. This remaining SOCE in Orai1/Orai3 double knockout B cells prompted us to measure SOCE in B cells isolated from global Orai2 knockout mice (<italic>Orai2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>). B cells from <italic>Orai2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed complete loss of <italic>Orai2</italic> mRNA with no apparent compensation in <italic>Orai1</italic> or <italic>Orai3</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). SOCE stimulated by thapsigargin in B cells from <italic>Orai2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was enhanced by comparison to B cells from wild-type littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>), suggesting that, as was shown in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaeth et al., 2017b</xref>), Orai2 is also a negative regulator of SOCE in B cells. Thus, these experiments indicate that the remaining SOCE in B cells from Orai3/Orai1 double knockout mice is most likely mediated by Orai2.</p><p>Given the modulation of Orai channel isoforms in response to B cell activation, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging recordings, similar to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, on primary B cells that were first activated for 48 hr with anti-IgM +anti-CD40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). While similar trends were observed in experiments with naÃ¯ve primary B cells, several exceptions were notable. SOCE in Orai3 knockout B cells was reduced compared to control cells, like data in A20 Orai knockout cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref> ). Differences in inhibition by 50 ÂµM 2-APB also became less pronounced between control and Orai3 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Orai3 contributes to SOCE in activated B cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SOCE is an essential regulator of NFAT activation in B cells</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through CRAC channels is critical for the activation of multiple NFAT isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trebak and Kinet, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaeth and Feske, 2018</xref>).

After B cell stimulation, proteins were harvested and processed for Western blotting using a specific NFAT1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DâG</xref>). In unstimulated samples, NFAT1 appears as a single band corresponding to its highly phosphorylated, non-activated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>). Stimulation of naÃ¯ve B cells with thapsigargin, which completely empties ER stores and maximally activates SOCE, led to a complete shift of the phosphorylated single band into lower molecular weight bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>, <italic>left</italic>) and this shift in NFAT1 molecular weight was inhibited by 43.6% in Orai1-deficient B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Given the dynamic expression of each Orai isoform following B cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1GâI</xref>), we also evaluated NFAT1 activation in B cells stimulated for 48 hr with anti-IgM +anti-CD40. While thapsigargin stimulation also led to a complete shift in NFAT1 molecular weight in activated control B cells, this shift was reduced by 78% in activated B cells from <italic>Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed NFAT2 isoform dephosphorylation in naÃ¯ve B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, when naÃ¯ve B cells were stimulated with anti-IgM (instead of thapsigargin), we observed similar trends of NFAT1 and NFAT2 dephosphorylation, although this dephosphorylation was not as robust as with thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, this anti-IgM mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT1 and NFAT2 was inhibited in B cells from <italic>Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Our findings that B cells from <italic>Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice have maintained BCR-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations with defects in NFAT activation is in agreement with previous studies in HEK293 cells showing that NFAT activation depends mostly on native Orai1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoast et al., 2020b</xref>). In these studies, intact Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in Orai1 knockout cells were mediated by Orai2/3, yet NFAT nuclear translocation was largely reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoast et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><p>We also evaluated NFAT1 activation in response to thapsigargin in both naÃ¯ve B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) and activated B cells (48 hr with anti-IgM +anti-CD40; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) isolated from either <italic>Orai3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> or <italic>Orai1/Orai3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice. Loss of Orai3 alone from naÃ¯ve B cells had no effect on NFAT1 activation, while naÃ¯ve B cells isolated from double Orai1/Orai3 knockout cells showed reductions in NFAT1 activation comparable to B cell isolated from single Orai1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, this impairment of NFAT1 activation was further exacerbated in activated B cells isolated from Orai1 knockout and Orai1/Orai3 double knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Collectively, these data reveal that Orai1 plays a more prominent role in the activation of NFAT isoforms in activated B cells compared to naÃ¯ve cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The combined deletion of Orai3 and Orai1 inhibits B cell proliferation</title><p>BCR-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that are sustained through SOCE are critical for the activation of gene programs that regulate proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, suboptimal proliferation and survival of B cells in response to BCR stimulation can largely be rescued through the addition of secondary co-stimulatory signals (e.g. CD40 or TLR stimulation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). To understand how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals downstream of Orai isoforms regulate B cell expansion, primary B cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and cell divisions tracked in response to multiple conditions of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). BCR stimulation with anti-IgM alone resulted in multiple rounds of cell division in most wild-type cells (87.7%) with 28.6% of viable cells at 72 hr post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, <italic>black</italic>). B cell viability at 72 hr was dramatically increased to 67.4% when cells were co-stimulated with anti-IgM +anti-CD40, with an increase in the number of cells undergoing several cycles of cell division. Following anti-IgM stimulation Orai1-deficient B cells showed a similar percentage of proliferating cells (83.1%) as controls, with a moderate reduction in cell viability to 20.9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, <italic>red</italic>). While anti-IgM mediated proliferation of Orai3-deficient B cells was comparable to controls (90.3%), their viability was higher, at 34.8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, <italic>blue</italic>). The combined deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 resulted in a substantial reduction in the percentage of both viable (10%) and proliferating (60.8%) cells in response to anti-IgM stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, <italic>teal</italic>). These defects in survival and proliferation of Orai1/Orai3-deficient B cells were partially rescued when cells were co-stimulated with anti-IgM +anti-CD40, albeit to a lesser extent than control and single Orai knockout B cells. Similar percentages of viability and proliferation were observed in all experimental groups when B cells were stimulated with either anti-CD40 or LPS, suggesting that activation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway is able to compensate for the loss of Orai1/Orai3. We also analyzed the proliferation and survival of B cells isolated from Orai2<sup>-/-</sup> mice and their wildtype littermates exposed to the same stimuli. We found only marginal or no effects of Orai2 knockout on B cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Furthermore, we performed RNA sequencing on B cells isolated from control Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> and <italic>Orai3</italic>/<italic>Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice after stimulation with anti-IgM for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>) and differential expression analysis was performed with edgeR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>).

Together, these findings reveal that only loss of both Orai1 and Orai3 affects B cell survival and proliferation in response to anti-IgM stimulation while single knockout of either Orai1 or Orai3 had marginal effects.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Orai1 and Orai3 regulate B cell proliferation and survival.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Measurement of B cell proliferation by tracking cabroxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution.

One of the earliest signaling events upon crosslinking of the BCR is a biphasic increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baba and Kurosaki, 2016</xref>). Early landmark studies established that multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent transcription factors display unique activation requirements by relying on either ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (e.g. JNK, NF-ÎºB) or sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals driven by SOCE (NFAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolmetsch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Healy et al., 1998</xref>). While the SOCE-calcineurin-NFAT pathway is well established in the context of B cell effector function, recent reports have shed light on the mechanisms by which SOCE also regulates NF-ÎºB activation and its downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2018</xref>). These two BCR-activated signaling pathways are sustained by Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through CRAC channels and synergize with one another to activate a series of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated checkpoints that determine B cell survival, entry into the cell cycle, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akkaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike recent findings that have established Orai1 and Orai2 as the major Orai isoforms mediating SOCE in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaeth et al., 2017b</xref>), the relative contributions of Orai isoforms to the native CRAC channel in B cells remained, until now, unclear.</p><p>Our results herein establish that B cell activation through BCR stimulation alone or co-stimulation with secondary signals like CD40 or TLR ligands significantly enhanced metabolic activity. Concurrently, these stimulation conditions drive dynamic changes in the expression of each Orai isoform. Interestingly, we observe that robust B cell activation with BCR and CD40 co-stimulation results in upregulation of both <italic>Orai1</italic> and <italic>Orai3</italic>, and downregulation of <italic>Orai2</italic>. However, we do not see any apparent increase in SOCE in activated B cells versus naive B cells, suggesting that Orai1 and Orai3 upregulation in activated B cells helps maintain the magnitude of SOCE, commensurate with the enhanced volume of activated B cells. While Orai1 has previously been shown to contribute to the majority of SOCE in B cells under conditions of maximal ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gwack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCarl et al., 2010</xref>), we show using B-cell specific Orai1 knockout mice that Orai1 is dispensable for maintaining cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in response to BCR crosslinking. In agreement with our previous results in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoast et al., 2020b</xref>), we also show that Orai1 is an essential regulator of NFAT1 and NFAT2 isoforms in B cells and that its role becomes more prominent for NFAT induction in activated B cells compared to naÃ¯ve unstimulated B cells. By generating CRISPR/Cas9 B cell lines and B-cell specific knockout mice lacking Orai1 or Orai3 individually and in combination, we found that both Orai1 and Orai3 contribute to the native CRAC channels in B cells. However, the oligomeric state of native CRAC channels in B cells and whether Orai1 and Orai3 form homomeric or heteromeric assemblies or both in primary B cells remains an open question.</p><p>The combined loss of Orai1 and Orai3, but not either isoform alone, led to a significant reduction in both B cell proliferation and survival. The original study by Gwack et al showed a partial inhibition of proliferation in B cells from <italic>Orai1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. While we observe only a marginal inhibition of proliferation in B cells from <italic>Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice and a moderate reduction in the viability of these cells. The reason for the difference between our results on B cell proliferation and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gwack et al., 2008</xref> is unknown. However, one potential explanation could be that in B cells from <italic>Orai1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gwack et al., 2008</xref> Orai1 is deleted from early B cell development in mice on a mixed ICR background (note that <italic>Orai1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on the C57BL/6 background show perinatal lethality) whereas in our <italic>Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice, Orai1 is deleted later in B cell development in mice that are on a pure C57Bl/6 background. Another potential explanation could be the complete deletion of the Orai1 gene in the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gwack et al., 2008</xref> vs the 97% reduction in mRNA expression we observe in B cells from <italic>Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice.</p><p>We show that SOCE is important for the metabolic reprogramming of B cells by regulating mitochondrial metabolism and the flux of polar metabolites in response to B cell activation. This shift in metabolic profiles in response to B cell activation could be neutralized by inhibition of either calcineurin or CRAC channels with FK506 or GSK-7975A, respectively, suggesting that this metabolic flux is driven through SOCE and NFAT-dependent mechanisms. Our data demonstrate that both Orai1 and Orai3 contribute to CRAC channel activity and to shaping cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in B cells. While our data has provided evidence for the contribution of Orai3 to CRAC channels in naÃ¯ve B cells, this contribution was only apparent within the context of double Orai1 and Orai3 knockout. Our data with B cell-specific Orai3 knockout is consistent with a recent study reporting a lack of SOCE inhibition in B cells, T cells, and macrophages from Orai3 global knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Our data and the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2022</xref>, showed that Orai3 is highly expressed in B cells compared to other immune cells like T cells. Nevertheless, Orai3 knockout, on its own, has no measurable contribution to SOCE in naÃ¯ve B cells while moderately reducing SOCE in activated B cells. This reduced SOCE in activated B cells from Orai3 knockout mice is consistent with the reduced basal respiration of B cells stimulated with anti-IgM for 24 hr. This could also explain why the double knockout of Orai1 and Orai3, which inhibits SOCE more dramatically, has a larger effect on mitochondrial respiration and metabolomic reprogramming of B cells. Alternatively, it is possible that Orai3 couples to alternative cytosolic signaling pathways that synergize with SOCE-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Orai3 could mediate its effects on mitochondrial respiration through the store-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pathway activated by arachidonic acid or its metabolite, leukotrieneC<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Earlier studies investigating human effector T cells demonstrated that Orai3 becomes upregulated in response to oxidative stress, which may act as a potential mechanism to maintain a threshold of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and T cell function in various inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bogeski et al., 2010</xref>). In support of this model, new findings have demonstrated that Orai3 expression is increased in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis and that silencing of Orai3 reduces tissue inflammation in a human synovium adoptive transfer model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, these effects were proposed to be through the store-independent function of Orai3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). However, a recent study showed that Orai3 deficient mice have no altered susceptibility in a model of collagen-induced arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), challenging a role for Orai3, on its own, in the immune system.</p><p>The situation in T cells is different as the combined loss of Orai1 and Orai2 in murine T cells led to a near complete ablation of SOCE and substantially impaired T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaeth et al., 2017b</xref>). Whether Orai3 contributes to the small, residual amount of SOCE in Orai1/Orai2-deficient T cells and/or mediates store-independent signaling functions in murine T and B cells is unknown. Furthermore, differences in Orai channel contributions are apparent between mice and humans, as SOCE and CRAC currents are completely inhibited in T cells from patients with LoF mutations in <italic>Orai1</italic>, while SOCE is only partially inhibited in Orai1-deficient murine T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCarl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vig et al., 2008</xref>). Curiously, B cells from <italic>Orai1</italic> LoF mutation patients still retain residual SOCE, suggesting that another Orai isoform may contribute to SOCE in human B cells than in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feske et al., 2001</xref>), in agreement with our data herein on mouse B cells. Thus, the composition of native CRAC channels among lymphocytes appears cell-type and context-specific.</p><p>While SOCE is substantially reduced in Orai1/Orai3-deficient B cells, defects in their ability to proliferate and survive in response to antigenic stimulation are not as severe as the phenotype observed in STIM1/STIM2-deficient B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>). Our data establish additivity between Orai1 and Orai3 channels in controlling B cell survival and proliferation, but we cannot exclude a potential role for Orai2 in the regulation of SOCE in B cells. Quite the opposite, we show that Orai2 is functional in B cells by documenting that B cells from Orai2<sup>-/-</sup> mice have enhanced SOCE. This suggests that Orai2 acts as a negative regulator of SOCE in B cells as was shown for T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaeth et al., 2017b</xref>), mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsvilovskyy et al., 2018</xref>), and HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoast et al., 2020b</xref>), and that the remaining SOCE activity in B cells from Orai1/Orai3 double knockout mice is likely mediated by Orai2. This is consistent with our results showing that the SOCE inhibitor GSK-7975A inhibits the upregulation of polar metabolites by B cells, in response to anti-IgM +anti-CD40 stimulation, to a greater extent than Orai1/Orai3 double knockout. Therefore, the development of Orai triple knockout mice and additional Orai knockout pairs is needed to further clarify this issue. Similarly, how SOCE and the composition of the native CRAC channel vary among different B cell subsets and during pathological conditions is completely unknown. Indeed, earlier studies have demonstrated that effector populations like germinal center B cells display unique metabolic and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khalil et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). Our data also suggest that the expression of each Orai isoform is dynamic in response to B cell activation, similar to the case of naÃ¯ve vs effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaeth et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Considering the clear effects of B cell-specific deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 on SOCE, NFAT activation, metabolic reprogramming, survival, and proliferation, it was surprising that humoral immunity to influenza A virus (IAV) infection was unaffected in <italic>Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Orai3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice. This raises the question regarding the role of Orai1, Orai3, and SOCE in general for B cell function and humoral immunity in vivo. Our results are, however, consistent with those from B cell-specific deletion of <italic>Stim1</italic> and <italic>Stim2</italic> genes, which was shown to result in abolished SOCE causing impaired expression of two key anti-apoptotic genes and blunted activation of the mTORC1 and c-Myc metabolic signaling pathways, resulting in decreased B cell survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2020</xref>). While this study did not investigate the effects of <italic>Stim1</italic>/<italic>Stim2</italic> deletion on B cell function in vivo, Baba and colleagues had reported normal B cell development as well as T-dependent and T-independent antibody responses following immunization of mice with B cell-specific deletion of <italic>Stim1</italic> and <italic>Stim2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>). This was surprising, because <italic>Stim1</italic>/<italic>Stim2</italic> deletion almost completely abolished thapsigargin and anti-IgM induced SOCE, and strongly impaired B cell survival and proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>). A potential explanation for the normal humoral immune responses in <italic>Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Orai3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> and <italic>Stim1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Stim2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice is provided by the fact that, in contrast to anti-IgM stimulation, stimulation of <italic>Stim1/Stim2</italic>-deficient B cells <italic>via</italic> CD40 or TLR4 results in normal B cell survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>). When combined with anti-IgM stimulation, CD40 was able to rescue the proliferation defect of <italic>Stim1/Stim2</italic>-deficient B cells. A similar rescue of defective B cell proliferation by CD40 and TLR9 agonists in <italic>Stim1/Stim2</italic>-deficient B cells was reported by Berry at al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2020</xref>). Our data with <italic>Orai1/Orai3</italic>-deficient B cells show only a partial rescue of B cell proliferation by anti-IgM and anti-CD40 co-stimulation compared to anti-IgM alone. We did, however, observe normal B cell survival and proliferation in <italic>Orai1/Orai3</italic>-deficient B cells stimulated with the TLR4 agonist LPS. Collectively, these data demonstrate that co-stimulatory pathways such as CD40, TLR4, and TLR9 can bypass the requirement for BCR-induced SOCE to induce B cell activation. IAV is a dsRNA virus that is detected by TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014</xref>). TLR7 is widely expressed in B cells and antibody responses to IAV were shown to depend on TLR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geeraedts et al., 2008</xref>). Although we did not investigate if TLR7 stimulation with synthetic agonists such as imiquimod can rescue the proliferation and survival defects of <italic>Orai1/Orai3</italic>-deficient B cells in vitro, we speculate that it would, given the fact that TLR7 and TLR4, whose activation by LPS rescues the function of <italic>Stim1/Stim2</italic> and <italic>Orai1/Orai3</italic>-deficient B cells, signal through the same Myd88-IRAK4-TRAF6 pathway to activate NF-ÎºB and other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duan et al., 2022</xref>). Activation of TLR7 and potentially other costimulatory pathways, in <italic>Orai1/Orai3</italic>-deficient B cells is, therefore, a likely explanation for their normal humoral immune response to IAV in vivo. Although Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SOCE are clearly important for B cell function, B cells have developed other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent means to ensure their proper activation. Future studies with <italic>Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Orai3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice might reveal indispensable in vivo contributions of SOCE to B cell populations such as memory B cells or to immune disease in other in vivo models such as the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. Taken together, our results uncover additive functions of Orai3 and Orai1 in B cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling that regulates NFAT activation, metabolism, survival, and proliferation of B cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experiments were carried out in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and use Committee (IACUC) guidelines of the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.

Peak height intensities were extracted based on the established accurate mass and retention time for each metabolite as adapted from the Whitehead Institute and verified with authentic standards and/or high-resolution MS/MS manually curated against the NIST14MS/MS and METLIN spectral libraries. The theoretical m/z of the metabolite molecular ion was used with aÂ±10 ppm mass tolerance window, and aÂ±0.2 min peak apex retention time tolerance within the expected elution window (1â2 min). To account for sample-to-sample variance in the estimated cell counts, a sum-normalization step was carried out on a per-column (sample) basis. Detected metabolite intensities in a given sample were summed, and a percentage intensity was calculated for each metabolite (custom Rscript available from NYU Metabolomics Laboratory at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/scientific-cores-shared-resources/metabolomics-laboratory">https://med.nyu.edu/research/scientific-cores-shared-resources/metabolomics-laboratory</ext-link>, contact the Laboratory Director Dr. Drew Jones at: drew.jones@nyulangone.org). The median mass accuracy vs the theoretical m/z for the library was â0.7 ppm (n=90 detected metabolites). Median retention time range (time between earliest and latest eluting sample for a given metabolite) was 0.23 min (30 min LCMS method). A signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3 X was used compared to blank controls throughout the sequence to report detection, with a floor of 10,000 (arbitrary units). Labeled amino acid internal standards in each sample were used to assess instrument performance (median CV=5%).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Influenza A virus (IAV) infection</title><p><italic>Orai1/Orai3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Mb1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> and <italic>Orai1/Orai3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (control) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and infected intranasally (i.n.) with 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of the laboratory strain A/HK/x31 (x31-IAV) of the influenza A virus subtype H3N2.

Cells were treated with ACK buffer for 3 min and then washed and spun at 800 g for 5 min, resuspended in RPMI medium plus 2% fetal bovine serum, and stained with antibodies as described below. Cells isolated from medLNs and bone marrow were counted with trypan blue, washed, and prepared for flow cytometry analysis in PBS containing 2% FBS and 2 mM EDTA.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Orai3 and Orai1 are essential for CRAC channel function and metabolic reprogramming in B cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yousang Gwack (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>While all three reviewers expressed interest in the work including its conceptual framework, they identified major weaknesses and essential revisions that will be needed to support the main conclusions. In particular, the reviewers raised strong concerns regarding the effects of the Orai1 KO in native B cells and about the data in Figure 3, showing only a 25% reduction in Orai1 protein at the cell surface. Additional concerns dealing with the rather limited range of B cell functions examined reduced enthusiasm for the study. These gaps will likely require more time than <italic>eLife</italic> policy allows for inviting revisions (~two months). Thus, we are sorry to say that we cannot consider this manuscript for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> at this time. However, given the enthusiasm of the reviewers, we would be willing to consider a revised manuscript that addresses these concerns as a new submission. To assist you with the revision, we list below the most significant concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Verify the true extent of cell surface Orai1 expression in Orai1 KO B cells: The data in Figure 3A, B clearly show that expression in the MB1-Cre cells is ~75% of the wildtype controls implying that most Orai1 protein is in fact still retained at the cell surface. This makes it very difficult to draw any realistic conclusions about the role of Orai1, and by extension, Orai3 using the Orai1/Orai3 DKOs. The Orai1 antibody should be validated, and if it is not specific, a better one should be used with appropriate validation.</p><p>2) Related to the above point, the strong residual NFAT activation in Orai1 KO cells (surprising!), and lack of effect on B cell proliferation (which contradicts Gwack et al., 2008) seems consistent with the persistence of functional Orai1 protein at the cell surface.</p><p>3) The paper seems to imply that CRAC channels in B cells are heteromultimers of Orai1/Orai3 proteins. Without electrophysiological analysis, this claim realistically cannot be made and the study needs to demonstrate this point more definitively than simply looking at increases or decreases in cellular calcium concentrations.</p><p>4) The difference in phenotypes between Orai1 and Orai1/3 DKO B cells needs to be presented side by side to allow direct comparison. This should be done for Ca oscillations, NFAT activation and kinetics, proliferation, OCR, and respiration. See reviewer 2's comments on this matter. Experiments pertaining to Orai1 KO B cells in Figures 3 and 4 should also include those from Orai1/3 DKO B cells.</p><p>5) The functional significance of the study in its current form is very limited. Additional functional analysis to include cytokine production or antibody production is needed to increase the significance of the study.</p><p>6) B cell development. Check whether B cell development is affected in Orai1/3 Mb1cre KO mice. As noted by reviewer 2, Orai3 KO alone is unlikely to affect B cell development, however, does co-deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 affect B cell development or mature B cell populations in the spleen and peritoneum (Figure 4)?</p><p>7) What is the reason for reduced respiration in the Orai1/3 KO B cells which seems more than that observed in Orai1 KO cells? Use RNA-seq to examine this question.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, Emrich and coworkers examine the consequences of ablating Orai3 and Orai1 on store-operated calcium entry and B cell functions. It is known that SOCE is important for T cell function including T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine synthesis. But less is known about Orai channel contributions to B cell function. Using conditional deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 in B cells, the authors examine several functional endpoints including B cell proliferation, development, and metabolism. These endpoints are diminished by Orai1 deletion. Deletion of Orai3 evokes no phenotype for most endpoints. The results indicating a lack of developmental effects on B cells with Orai1 deletion are not surprising and replicate previous work on these topics both in B cells and in T cells (relevant papers from Feske lab). Orai1 deletion also prevents NFAT activation, a well-known consequence of Orai1 inhibition in many cells. However, in several cases, the double Orai1/Orai3 knockout shows phenotypes that are slightly larger than those seen in Orai1-alone deficient B cells, suggesting that Orai3 plays a modest role in residual calcium entry and cellular functions.</p><p>While the experiments are carefully conducted, I think the paper exaggerates the role of Orai3 in B cell function. Many statements such as &quot;Orai3 and Orai1 coordinate for efficient B cell proliferation&quot; are not meaningful and vague and overstate the role of Orai3. In fact, Orai1 or Orai3 deletion has no effect on B cell proliferation. The lack of effect of Orai1 deletion is somewhat surprising and contradicts earlier findings (Gwack et al., 2008) indicating that Orai1 is critical for B cell proliferation and this contradiction is not explained. The double Orai3/Orai1 KO evokes a modest reduction of B cell proliferation but it is unclear whether this is a specific effect or downstream of more general suppression of metabolism since it is well known that rapidly proliferating cells require a high level of metabolism and glycolysis which is suppressed in the double KO. Perhaps the most interesting part of the paper is that the double KO shows a greater suppression of oxygen consumption and maximal respiration than Orai1 KO cells alone. But no effect is seen with Orai3 KO ablation and none on basal respiration even though deletion of Orai1 alone evokes the strongest effects. Thus, statements indicating that Orai1/Orai3 channels are crucial for metabolic reprogramming do not easily follow from the data shown, which seem to indicate very minor contributions of Orai3 for these endpoints.</p><p>Overall, the role of Orai3 is greatly over-emphasized and is not supported by the results. One could easily conclude based on the results that Orai3 is largely dispensable/redundant for the B cell responses that were studied here. But it is also worth noting that only a small subset of physiologically relevant B cell responses was assessed and notably cytokine and antibody production were not studied at all. These issues reduce the significance of the study.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1) What is the effect of deleting Orai3 on NFAT1 activation? A lack of effect on cell proliferation in vitro is not surprising and is reminiscent of the lack of effects on proliferation in T cells with non-function Orai1 channels (McCarl, Feske et al., JI 2010).</p><p>2) Are Orai channels in a complex with Orai1 and Orai3 subunits in the same channel or are they expressed separately to form distinct channels in B cells? 2-APB appears to inhibit the residual SOCE in Orai3 deficient cells but not in Orai1 deficient cells. What are the implications of this result? The 2-APB experiment is uninterpreted in terms of the molecular composition of the SOCE channels.</p><p>3) In order to really assess the contributions of Orai3 to B cell physiological responses, it is important to directly compare the outcomes side-by-side for the different endpoints. Thus, the metrics for NFAT activation, proliferation, OCR, respiration, etc. should be directly compared as in Figure 2.</p><p>4) Figure 6: the fact that Orai1 deletion in primary B cells causes a substantial decrease in NFAT1 activation but has no effects on Ca oscillations (Figure 2/3) implies that the Ca oscillations have no direct relevance for NFAT activation in B cells. This result seems to contradict previous literature on this issue and should be discussed. Is NFAT1 activation more dependent on the plateau Ca responses instead of oscillations?</p><p>5) There is a large discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels in Figure 3. What is the true efficiency of deletion?</p><p>6) Two key functions of B cells are antibody production and secretion of cytokines that fosters T cell activation. It is hard to assess the importance of Orai channels for B cell physiology without at least some measurement of these functions. As such, the narrow focus on the study on B cell proliferation and metabolism falls short of truly understanding the role of SOCE in B cell physiology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript examines the roles of Orai channels, the predominant ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in T cells, in the development and activation of B cells. This manuscript evaluates the detailed role of the members of the Orai family, Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3 channels, in ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, proliferation, and metabolism in B cells. The authors find a positive contribution of Orai1 and Orai3 in B cell activation and metabolic functions using knockout mouse studies. This study has significant novelty and impact.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript has novelty in terms of examining the role of the Orai channels in B lymphocytes, which is currently understudied. While the role of Orai1 in B cell activation and proliferation has been described before, that of Orai3 is not studied. The major weakness of the current work is that the authors need to emphasize experiments showing comparative studies between Orai1 KO, Orai3 KO, and Orai1/3 DKO B cells. Ideally, these results must be compared to Orai1/2 DKO B cells. To strengthen their conclusions, I have the following recommendations:</p><p>1. To emphasize the role of Orai3 in B cells, the authors should check whether B cell development is affected in Orai1/3 Mb1cre KO mice. Orai3 KO alone is unlikely to affect B cell development, however, does co-deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 affect B cell development or mature B cell populations in the spleen and peritoneum (Figure 4)?</p><p>2. The difference in phenotypes between Orai1 and Orai1/3 DKO B cells (which is the novelty of this paper) needs to be presented side by side. Experiments pertaining to Orai1 KO B cells in Figures 3 and 4 should also include those from Orai1/3 DKO B cells. For example, does the loss of both Orai1 and Orai3 affect ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in DKO primary B cells (Figure 4), similar to their observation with cell line in Figure 3? The NFAT immunoblots from Figure 6 supplement should move to the main Figure 6. And it will be useful to compare NFAT translocation kinetics shown in Figure 6A among Orai1 KO and Orai1/3 DKO B cells.</p><p>3. What is the physiological output of reduced proliferation in Orai1/3 DKO B cells seen in Figure 7? As shown in the STIM1/2 DKO B cell paper, the authors can check IL-10 production by all 4 genotypes by ELISA to get a quantitative comparison between Orai1 and Orai1/3 DKO cells. The authors should also show a heat map of the B cell cytokine profile (after IgM stimulation) from the RNA-seq results (Figure 7D and E).</p><p>4. In Figure 8, are the mitochondria numbers affected in Orai1/3 DKO (Figure 8D)? What is the cause of reduced respiration (more reduction than that observed in Orai1 KO cells) in the Orai1/3 KO B cells? Using RNA-seq data can the authors uncover the mechanisms linking loss of mitochondrial metabolism to reduced SOCE via Orai1/3?</p><p>5. Ideally, the metabolomic analysis in Figure 9 should be compared between Orai1 KO and Orai1/3 DKO B cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Orai channels mediate calcium influx which is essential for immune cell activation. While the role of Orai1 and Orai2 are well established in T lymphocytes, the particular Orai isoforms that function in B cells are not well established. This study uses CRISPR-mediated gene deletion in the A20 B-cell line and primary B cells in mice to examine the functional roles of Orai1, 2, and 3. The authors show evidence that Orai1 and Orai3 are critical components of store-operated Ca channels in B cells and help drive downstream events in B cell activation. New findings include:</p><p>Orai1 and Orai3 are upregulated and Orai2 is downregulated during B cell activation by different stimuli in vitro, including anti-IgM, anti-IgM + anti-CD40, and LPS. The significance of this result is undetermined, as the impact of Orai regulation on B cell responses and Ca signal generation was not studied.</p><p>Based on the effects of CRISPR-mediated deletion, Orai1 and Orai3 both contribute to the magnitude of store-operated Ca entry evoked by full ER Ca depletion in A20 B cells and primary B cells. The combination of Orai1 and Orai3 was critical for the generation of sustained Ca oscillations after BCR stimulation, while deletion of one or the other channel had little effect. However, surface staining of the Orai1 knockout B cells with polyclonal anti-Orai1 antibodies indicated that despite complete suppression of mRNA, surface protein levels were ~75% of wild-type cells. The persistence of Orai1 protein weakens many of the conclusions about the functions of Orai1 based on the knockout cells, e.g. that Orai1 is dispensable for B cell differentiation in vivo, proliferation, and survival after stimulation in vitro, and has only a modest effect on NFAT activation in vitro.</p><p>The double knockout of Orai1 and Orai3 has greater effects on proliferation and survival than Orai1 knockout alone, and greatly inhibits metabolic reprogramming of B cells after in vitro stimulation. However, due to the persistence of Orai1 protein the magnitude of these effects may underestimate the true contribution of Orai1.</p><p>1. Orai1 and Orai3 are shown to be upregulated, while Orai2 is downregulated after stimulation of B cells in vitro (Figure 1), and the effects are dependent on the type of stimulating agent. These same stimulation conditions are used later in experiments on NFAT activation, proliferation and survival, and metabolic reprogramming. However, an essential link between upregulation and functional effects is how are the Ca signals affected? SOCE (with TG) and oscillations (with anti-IgG) should be measured.</p><p>2. A serious problem that affects many of the conclusions of the paper is that CRISPR-mediated deletion of Orai1 in mouse B cells causes only a ~25% decrease in Orai1 protein as detected by the polyclonal antibody. The characteristics of this antibody are not described, and there are questions about its specificity. Has it been validated against cells known to lack Orai1? Was it directly labeled or was a secondary Ab used for FACS? Surface labeling should also be assessed in the A20 Orai1 KO lines.</p><p>Assuming the antibody is specific, the persistence of 75% of the surface Orai1 undermines or changes the interpretations of many of the experiments in the paper:</p><p>a) Cannot say that Orai1 is dispensable for ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (line 206-7), B cell development (Figure 4), B cell proliferation and survival (Figure 7), or increased mitochondrial mass in activated B cells (Figure 8).</p><p>b) The enhancement of SOCE in Orai2 KO cells does not actually indicate that residual SOCE in Orai1/Orai3 DKO is due to Orai2 (Figure 5; lines 251-2). An alternative explanation is that the residual SOCE is due to Orai1, and the very low SOCE seen is from Orai2 suppressing the already reduced function of Orai1.</p><p>c) Cannot conclude that Orai3 is an &quot;essential&quot; component of the native SOCE pathway in B cells if Orai1 was not totally eliminated in the Orai1 KO (and therefore had a minimal effect) (line 413).</p><p>It is also worth noting that because Orai1 is the only isoform that supports NFAT activation, the persistence of NFAT translocation in the Orai1 KO cells is another sign that Orai1 protein is still present and functional at significant levels (Figure 6). Moreover, the persistence of residual Orai1 may explain why the phenotype of the Orai1/Orai3 DKO is not as severe as the STIM1/STIM2 DKO studied by other groups (line 446-8).</p><p>3. At several points in the paper, the authors imply that the CRAC channel in B cells is a heteromultimer of Orai1 and Orai3 (e.g., lines 259-60). Orai3 contributes to SOCE, but no arguments are made to rule out the alternative that Orai1 and Orai3 make separate channels. Pharmacology, kinetic profiling (CDI), or permeation properties of CRAC currents in whole-cell recordings may be an approach to distinguish between these possibilities. Otherwise, it remains an open question.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Orai3 and Orai1 are essential for CRAC channel function and metabolic reprogramming in B cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kenton Swartz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining key issues that need to be addressed in the reviewers' comments. The essential points are:</p><p>1) The patch-clamp data are not credible and the currents do not show the classic inward rectification that is the hallmark of CRAC. Given that no other features are shown, these data should be removed as they are not critical for the study.</p><p>2) There continue to be claims indicating that Orai3 and Orai1 form heteromeric channels. There is no evidence in the study to support this conclusion and the results can be fully explained considering that Orai1 and Orai3 form functional but separate channels.

These appear to be left over from the previous version and were not revised. Since the SOCE measurements clearly show that Orai3 is not critical or essential for CRAC channel activity nor &quot;essential&quot; for function including proliferation the language should be changed to &quot;involved&quot; in or something analogous.</p><p>4) Discuss why the Orai3 cKO cells have a respiration defect as SOCE measurements do not show any change in SOCE (Figure 5).</p><p>5) Kudos to the authors for evaluating several in vivo metrics of B cells lacking both Orai1 and Orai3 for B cell cytokine production, IgG antibodies, receptors, and overall immunity for infection (Figure 11). The lack of any effects is extremely surprising. This raises a key concern regarding the in vivo significance of Orai1 and Orai3 for B cell function. In particular, what do all the in vitro data mean if knocking out Orai1 and Orai3 has no effect on B cell development or function? This should be tackled in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This revised manuscript by Emrich et al. has addressed most of the concerns brought up in the previous round of reviews. The authors have done a nice job and appropriately revised the text and discussion, but a couple of key points remain. Please see the detailed comments below.</p><p>â The new patch-clamp data in Figure 6 are confusing; the currents do not show the classic inward rectification of CRAC currents, and the ramps shown in A-C in fact seem to have the wrong curvature. Since these data do not support the idea of heteromeric Orai1/Orai3 channels and are of unclear origin, I suggest removing these data as they are not needed to support the main conclusions.</p><p>â Supplementary Figure 10: An interesting result here is that upregulation of most polar metabolites co-stimulated with anti-IgM + anti-CD40 is similar to that of control cells stimulated with IgM alone and much larger than the levels seen in WT cells exposed to the GSK compound. This difference means that the effects of the GSK compound are not equivalent to that of the compound. This should be discussed in light of the fact that the DKO eliminates SOCE almost entirely.</p><p>â On page 6, the heading &quot;Both Orai3 and Orai1 are essential components of SOCE in B cells&quot;. The word essential here is incorrect as the data shows that removing Orai3 has no effects on SOCE (Figure 5B, C, and Figure 6E). Please remove the word &quot;essential&quot; in this heading.</p><p>Similarly, in the abstract, the sentence &quot;We show that Orai3 and Orai1 are essential components of native CRAC channels in B cells â¦&quot; should be modified to remove the word essential for the reason above.</p><p>â Finally, the title remains unchanged from the previous version. The title should be amended since the data clearly shows that Orai3 is not essential for CRAC channel function. Please revise.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Comments on authors' rebuttal:</p><p>1. The effects of Orai protein up- or down-regulation in response to stimulation in vitro need to be related to their effects on NFAT activation, proliferation and survival, and metabolic reprogramming. The authors compare SOCE in naÃ¯ve vs. stimulated cells after full store depletion (TG), but a comparison of Ca oscillations evoked by IgM stimulation is the relevant one and should be done since these are presumably the kind of Ca signals that are involved in regulating downstream behavior under more physiological conditions.</p><p>2. The updated data on Orai1 expression in the Orai1fl/fl Mb1cre/+ cells makes more sense than the original dataset. It is still not totally clear why there is only a 70% reduction in Orai1 staining. The argument that the antibody for Orai1 crossreacts with Orai2 and Orai3 is not documented here, but the fact that qPCR data show an almost complete absence of Orai1 mRNA is sufficient here to conclude that Orai1 protein is effectively suppressed.</p><p>3. The new patch clamp data are problematic (see comment #2 below) and cannot be used to support the idea that CRAC channels are heteromers of Orai1 and Orai3 as the authors state. One cannot have it both ways â to conclude that there are heteromers, but concede that the evidence does not prove this.</p><p>Comments on the revised manuscript:</p><p>1. A major conclusion of the paper is that Orai3 and Orai1 are &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;crucial&quot; components of native CRAC channels in B cells. This is based on findings that deletion of either protein alone partially reduces SOCE, while the double KO almost completely eliminates it. The authors argue at several points in the paper that the CRAC channel may be a heteromultimer of Orai1 and Orai3, but the data fall short of demonstrating the molecular composition of CRAC channels. In regard to Figure 5 (and Figure S2), &quot;The slower rate of SOCE inhibition by 2-APB in wildtype B cells compared to Orai1 knockout B cells suggests that the native CRAC channel in B cells is a heteromer of Orai1 and Orai3.&quot; I disagree â the data could just as well be explained by separate populations of channels containing Orai1 or Orai3. In that case, 2-APB would inhibit Orai1 but enhance Ca influx through Orai3 (Yamashita et al., JBC 2011); thus, knocking out Orai3 would be expected to increase the inhibitory effect of 2-APB, as seen in Figure 5B. Likewise, the fact that double KO is required to inhibit oscillations could be explained simply by oscillations not being sensitive to a partial loss of SOCE, and only cease when SOCE is largely eliminated. The subunit composition of the channel could be complex, with multiple populations of homomers and heteromers, and unfortunately, these experiments do not answer this question.</p><p>2. The patch-clamp recordings of whole-cell CRAC current are not convincing. The I/V plots are not inwardly rectifying as would be expected from normal CRAC currents, and there is no mention of correction for leak current. This throws into question the conclusion that Orai3 is &quot;a moderate negative regulator of CRAC channel activity,&quot; especially as the KO had no effect on SOCE of naÃ¯ve cells, and actually decreased SOCE in pre-activated cells or A20 B cells. A careful analysis of current characteristics in the various wild-type and knockout B cells might provide evidence for heteromultimers, but these data do not.</p><p>3. The data from the Orai1 KO cells do not support the conclusion that NFAT activation depends specifically on native Orai1. Figure S3A shows that in the Orai1 KO cells, IgM and TG still dephosphorylate NFAT, just not as much as in control â this is to be expected, as SOCE is partially reduced by O1 KO. If Orai1 were the only isoform that supports NFAT activation, IgM or TG would not dephosphorylate NFAT in the KO cells.</p><p>4. The authors state that Orai1 and Orai3 are critical for primary B cell proliferation and survival (Figure 8). This conclusion needs to be toned down, as KO of either protein alone had little or no effect, and even the double KO had only a partial effect on proliferation. At any rate, the relevance of measuring viability effects after 72 hrs in vitro seems questionable, given that these conditions differ significantly from the environment of the cells in vivo (where there are no discernable functional effects of the DKO).</p><p>5. It is surprising (and disappointing!) that the deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 in B cells did not affect humoral immunity to influenza A infection in mice. In my view, this result seriously undermines the significance of the paper. If Orai channels are not required for B cell development or function in vivo, it is not clear how the in vitro results of the many different assays in this paper relate to the humoral immune response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84708.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

This makes it very difficult to draw any realistic conclusions about the role of Orai1, and by extension, Orai3 using the Orai1/Orai3 DKOs. The Orai1 antibody should be validated, and if it is not specific, a better one should be used with appropriate validation.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely apologize for mistakenly including the data in Figure 3A, B, which resulted in an unfortunate misunderstanding. Data in Figure 3A, B were preliminary and based on earlier experiments conducted without Fc block, resulting in non-specific binding of the anti-Orai1 antibody (via its Fc region) to B cells (via Fc receptors expressed on B cells). In this revision, we now show data from experiments that were performed with an Fc block. These data show that the surface expression of Orai1 in B cells from Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mb1<sup>cre/+</sup> mice is reduced by ~ 70%, as determined by flow cytometry with an updated intracellular staining protocol. The vast majority of the residual signal of ~ 30% above FMO (fluorescence minus one, i.e. the anti-Orai1 antibody signal) is likely due to non-specific binding of the Orai1 antibody by its variable region (not its Fc part) to other Orai homologues (Orai2, Orai3), which partially share the peptide epitope recognized by the anti-Orai1 antibody. We also would like to kindly point out other lines of evidence indicating that Orai1 is indeed deleted in B cells of Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mb1<sup>cre/+</sup> mice: (a) Our qPCR data show almost complete absence of Orai1 mRNA in their B cells. (b) Our SOCE data show strongly reduced SOCE in their B cells. (c) Cre-mediated deletion of Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup> alleles was shown to be very efficient in other cell types including T cells (Kaufmann/Feske 2016, PMID 26673135) and neuronal progenitor cells (Somasundaram/Prakriya, PMID 24990931).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the above point, the strong residual NFAT activation in Orai1 KO cells (surprising!), and lack of effect on B cell proliferation (which contradicts Gwack et al., 2008) seems consistent with the persistence of functional Orai1 protein at the cell surface.</p></disp-quote><p>The original study by Gwack et al. first reported on global Orai1<sup>-/-</sup> mice generated through targeted Orai1 gene deletion. B cells isolated from these Orai1<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a robust (~70-75%) decrease in SOCE (see Figure 2C and Figure 4A) that agrees with data reported in our manuscript with B cells from Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mb1<sup>cre/+</sup> mice. Taking this and our response to the above comment into consideration, we conclude that while Orai1 expression in our B cells is not zero as is the case for data by Gwack et al., it is dramatically reduced in B cells from Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mb1<sup>cre/+</sup> mice. Although the NFAT activation is only partially inhibited in naive Orai1 KO B cells (Figure 7D, E), it correlates well the incomplete suppression of SOCE. Further, when one considers activated B cells (Figure 7F, G), NFAT dephosphorylation is dramatically inhibited. Gwack et al. showed a partial inhibition of proliferation in B cells from Orai1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. While we see a small inhibition of proliferation in Orai1 KO B cells, we see more reduction in viability of these cells. Based on our Orai1 antibody staining, SOCE measurements and qPCR data (the latter showing ~97% decrease of <italic>Orai1</italic> mRNA in B cells from Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mb1<sup>cre/+</sup> mice), we can only speculate that in the B cells from Orai1<sup>-/-</sup> mice in Gwack et al., Orai1 is knocked out from early B cell development in mice that are on mixed ICR background (otherwise mice would die) whereas in our Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mb1<sup>cre/+</sup> mice, Orai1 is deleted later in B cell development in mice that are on a pure C57Bl/6 background. Another potential explanation could be the complete deletion of Orai1 gene in the studies of Gwack et al. vs the 97% reduction in mRNA expression we observe in our B cells from Orai1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mb1<sup>cre/+</sup> mice. Nevertheless, our results on B cell proliferation and NFAT dephosphorylation fully agree with B cell proliferation data from B cell specific STIM1/2 double KO mice (Matsumoto et al. 2011: PMID:Â 21530328Â and Berry et al. 2020, PMID:Â 32563861).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The paper seems to imply that CRAC channels in B cells are heteromultimers of Orai1/Orai3 proteins.

This was not our intention. Our statements were intentionally vague regarding his issue, something that reviewers noticed. As suggested, we have now included whole cell patch clamp measurements from primary B cells acutely isolated from mice (Figure 6) showing that Orai1 KO and Orai3 KO have additive effects on CRAC currents with Orai3 KO causing a small but significant enhancement of CRAC currents. While these data (along with the faster rate of SOCE inhibition by 2-APB in Orai3 KO B cells; Figure 5B, D) provide some evidence that Orai1 and Orai3 potentially heteromultimerize, they do not rule out the presence of homohexamers of Orai1 and Orai3.

The only time where only Orai1 data (ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and B cell development) is shown is in Figures3-4 as pointed out by the reviewer. These experiments were performed much earlier when we were still breeding mice to generate double Orai1/3 B cell knockout.

As suggested, we now include these data in the manuscript (Figure 9âfigure supplement 1) that show that only Orai1/3 KO (and not Orai1 KO) B cells have defects in OXPHOS genes and MYC targets genes. These data indicate that Orai3 function complements that of Orai1 and could be explained by the patch clamp data where deletions of Orai1 and Orai3 have additive effects on CRAC currents. Alternatively, it is also possible that Orai3 might regulate ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent gene programs supporting OXPHOS. Future studies are needed to shed light on this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this study, Emrich and coworkers examine the consequences of ablating Orai3 and Orai1 on store-operated calcium entry and B cell functions. It is known that SOCE is important for T cell function including T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine synthesis. But less is known about Orai channel contributions to B cell function. Using conditional deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 in B cells, the authors examine several functional endpoints including B cell proliferation, development, and metabolism. These endpoints are diminished by Orai1 deletion. Deletion of Orai3 evokes no phenotype for most endpoints. The results indicating a lack of developmental effects on B cells with Orai1 deletion are not surprising and replicate previous work on these topics both in B cells and in T cells (relevant papers from Feske lab). Orai1 deletion also prevents NFAT activation, a well-known consequence of Orai1 inhibition in many cells. However, in several cases, the double Orai1/Orai3 knockout shows phenotypes that are slightly larger than those seen in Orai1-alone deficient B cells, suggesting that Orai3 plays a modest role in residual calcium entry and cellular functions.</p><p>While the experiments are carefully conducted, I think the paper exaggerates the role of Orai3 in B cell function. Many statements such as &quot;Orai3 and Orai1 coordinate for efficient B cell proliferation&quot; are not meaningful and vague and overstate the role of Orai3. In fact, Orai1 or Orai3 deletion has no effect on B cell proliferation. The lack of effect of Orai1 deletion is somewhat surprising and contradicts earlier findings (Gwack et al., 2008) indicating that Orai1 is critical for B cell proliferation and this contradiction is not explained. The double Orai3/Orai1 KO evokes a modest reduction of B cell proliferation but it is unclear whether this is a specific effect or downstream of more general suppression of metabolism since it is well known that rapidly proliferating cells require a high level of metabolism and glycolysis which is suppressed in the double KO. Perhaps the most interesting part of the paper is that the double KO shows a greater suppression of oxygen consumption and maximal respiration than Orai1 KO cells alone. But no effect is seen with Orai3 KO ablation and none on basal respiration even though deletion of Orai1 alone evokes the strongest effects. Thus, statements indicating that Orai1/Orai3 channels are crucial for metabolic reprogramming do not easily follow from the data shown, which seem to indicate very minor contributions of Orai3 for these endpoints.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for their critical reading of our manuscript. In this revision, we have added several new experiments, including RNA-seq data showing the OXPHOS genes are only altered in Orai1/3 KO B cells, and not in Orai1 KO B cells. We have also altered our interpretations of the data to reflect the evidence presented, by removing vague or exaggerated statements. We have also discussed our results on B cell proliferation considering the findings by Gwack et al. 2008 (please see response to essential comment # 2 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the role of Orai3 is greatly over-emphasized and is not supported by the results. One could easily conclude based on the results that Orai3 is largely dispensable/redundant for the B cell responses that were studied here. But it is also worth noting that only a small subset of physiologically relevant B cell responses was assessed and notably cytokine and antibody production were not studied at all. These issues reduce the significance of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that for the parameters analyzed herein, Orai3 is largely dispensable. Orai3 contribution, to OXPHOS in particular, becomes apparent only within the context of double Orai1/Orai3 knockout.

A lack of effect on cell proliferation in vitro is not surprising and is reminiscent of the lack of effects on proliferation in T cells with non-function Orai1 channels (McCarl, Feske et al., JI 2010).</p></disp-quote><p>Data in Figure 7âfigure supplement 1 shows that deletion of Orai3 alone has no effect on NFAT1 dephosphorylation, which is expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are Orai channels in a complex with Orai1 and Orai3 subunits in the same channel or are they expressed separately to form distinct channels in B cells? 2-APB appears to inhibit the residual SOCE in Orai3 deficient cells but not in Orai1 deficient cells. What are the implications of this result? The 2-APB experiment is uninterpreted in terms of the molecular composition of the SOCE channels.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. This is a very important question that is hard to answer within the context of native channel expression. Unlike the case where a molecular complex ceases to function when one of its subunits are absent, each Orai isoform is capable of mediating CRAC currents either in a heterocomplex or on its own. The 2-APB data showing faster rate of SOCE inhibition by 2-APB in Orai3 KO B cells compared to wildtype B cells (Figure 5B, D) suggest that Orai3 and Orai1 form a heterocomplex. We now present whole cell recordings of CRAC currents (Figure 6), which also suggest Orai1/3 heteromultimerization. However, these data do not exclude that at least a portion of Orai1 and Orai3 proteins are functional as homohexamers. We have discussed these possibilities in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In order to really assess the contributions of Orai3 to B cell physiological responses, it is important to directly compare the outcomes side-by-side for the different endpoints. Thus, the metrics for NFAT activation, proliferation, OCR, respiration, etc. should be directly compared as in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential comments #4 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6: the fact that Orai1 deletion in primary B cells causes a substantial decrease in NFAT1 activation but has no effects on Ca oscillations (Figure 2/3) implies that the Ca oscillations have no direct relevance for NFAT activation in B cells. This result seems to contradict previous literature on this issue and should be discussed. Is NFAT1 activation more dependent on the plateau Ca responses instead of oscillations?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We have recently shown using combinations of Orai and STIM CRISPR KO in HEK293 cells that regardless of the nature of the ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (plateau vs Oscillatory) NFAT activation depends on the ca<sup>2+</sup> signal generated by native Orai1 (Yoast et al. 2020; PMID: 32415068). Specifically, ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were intact in Orai1 KO cells (oscillations in Orai1 KO cells were mediated by Orai2/3) but NFAT nuclear translocation was abrogated. We now discuss this issue in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is a large discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels in Figure 3.

It is hard to assess the importance of Orai channels for B cell physiology without at least some measurement of these functions. As such, the narrow focus on the study on B cell proliferation and metabolism falls short of truly understanding the role of SOCE in B cell physiology.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we now include in vivo data in Figure 11 and we provide a discussion of the meaning of these in vivo results considering the defects in B cell NFAT activation and metabolism in Orai1/3 KO B cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript examines the roles of Orai channels, the predominant ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in T cells, in the development and activation of B cells.

To emphasize the role of Orai3 in B cells, the authors should check whether B cell development is affected in Orai1/3 Mb1cre KO mice. Orai3 KO alone is unlikely to affect B cell development, however, does co-deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 affect B cell development or mature B cell populations in the spleen and peritoneum (Figure 4)?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential comment #6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The difference in phenotypes between Orai1 and Orai1/3 DKO B cells (which is the novelty of this paper) needs to be presented side by side. Experiments pertaining to Orai1 KO B cells in Figures 3 and 4 should also include those from Orai1/3 DKO B cells. For example, does the loss of both Orai1 and Orai3 affect ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in DKO primary B cells (Figure 4), similar to their observation with cell line in Figure 3? The NFAT immunoblots from Figure 6 supplement should move to the main Figure 6. And it will be useful to compare NFAT translocation kinetics shown in Figure 6A among Orai1 KO and Orai1/3 DKO B cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential comment #4. We have side by side comparisons each time this was possible. Sadly, we are unable to perform two experiments with Orai1/3 double KO B cells requested by the reviewer, (i) B cell development and (ii) ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, due to the current unavailability of live Orai1/3 KO mice (it would take us months to bring up those colonies). We show that NFAT nuclear translocation in Orai1/3 DKO B cells is equivalent to that in Orai1 KO B cells based on Westerns of NFAT dephosphorylation (Figure S3). Although we cannot test the NFAT translocation kinetics in Orai1/3 DKO B cells by ImageStream for the same reason listed above, we do not expect this to differ from that in Orai1 KO B cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

While the role of Orai1 and Orai2 are well established in T lymphocytes, the particular Orai isoforms that function in B cells are not well established. This study uses CRISPR-mediated gene deletion in the A20 B-cell line and primary B cells in mice to examine the functional roles of Orai1, 2, and 3. The authors show evidence that Orai1 and Orai3 are critical components of store-operated Ca channels in B cells and help drive downstream events in B cell activation. New findings include:</p><p>Orai1 and Orai3 are upregulated and Orai2 is downregulated during B cell activation by different stimuli in vitro, including anti-IgM, anti-IgM + anti-CD40, and LPS. The significance of this result is undetermined, as the impact of Orai regulation on B cell responses and Ca signal generation was not studied.</p><p>Based on the effects of CRISPR-mediated deletion, Orai1 and Orai3 both contribute to the magnitude of store-operated Ca entry evoked by full ER Ca depletion in A20 B cells and primary B cells. The combination of Orai1 and Orai3 was critical for the generation of sustained Ca oscillations after BCR stimulation, while deletion of one or the other channel had little effect. However, surface staining of the Orai1 knockout B cells with polyclonal anti-Orai1 antibodies indicated that despite complete suppression of mRNA, surface protein levels were ~75% of wild-type cells. The persistence of Orai1 protein weakens many of the conclusions about the functions of Orai1 based on the knockout cells, e.g. that Orai1 is dispensable for B cell differentiation in vivo, proliferation, and survival after stimulation in vitro, and has only a modest effect on NFAT activation in vitro.</p><p>The double knockout of Orai1 and Orai3 has greater effects on proliferation and survival than Orai1 knockout alone, and greatly inhibits metabolic reprogramming of B cells after in vitro stimulation. However, due to the persistence of Orai1 protein the magnitude of these effects may underestimate the true contribution of Orai1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the accurate representation of our findings. Please see our response to essential comment 1. Regarding two specific critiques of Reviewer 3, we would like to respectfully point out that â<italic>CRISPR-mediated deletion of Orai1 in mouse B cellsâ</italic> is not correct, but that Orai1 was deleted by conditional gene targeting. The papers by (Kaufmann/Feske 2016, PMID 26673135) and (Somasundaram/Prakriya, PMID 24990931) have shown deletion of Orai1 in T cells and neuronal progenitor cells in these mice. Regarding the comment â<italic>The characteristics of this antibody are not described, and there are questions about its specificityâ,</italic> we have specified in the Methods (under flow cytometry section) the origin of the anti-Orai1 antibody (Gwack 2008, PMID 18591248 and McCarl 2009, PMID 20004786).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Orai1 and Orai3 are shown to be upregulated, while Orai2 is downregulated after stimulation of B cells in vitro (Figure 1), and the effects are dependent on the type of stimulating agent. These same stimulation conditions are used later in experiments on NFAT activation, proliferation and survival, and metabolic reprogramming. However, an essential link between upregulation and functional effects is how are the Ca signals affected? SOCE (with TG) and oscillations (with anti-IgG) should be measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have explored the link between Orai1 and Orai3 transcript upregulation and SOCE, but only in the condition of 48hr stimulation with anti-IgM+anti-CD40. Please compare Figure 5B, C to Figure 5âfigure supplement 1. We do not see any apparent increase in SOCE in activated B cells. However, since activated B cells become lymphoblasts with a bigger volume, we propose that the upregulation of Orais is likely meant to maintain SOCE, commensurate with the enhanced volume of activated B cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A serious problem that affects many of the conclusions of the paper is that CRISPR-mediated deletion of Orai1 in mouse B cells causes only a ~25% decrease in Orai1 protein as detected by the polyclonal antibody. The characteristics of this antibody are not described, and there are questions about its specificity. Has it been validated against cells known to lack Orai1? Was it directly labeled or was a secondary Ab used for FACS? Surface labeling should also be assessed in the A20 Orai1 KO lines.</p><p>Assuming the antibody is specific, the persistence of 75% of the surface Orai1 undermines or changes the interpretations of many of the experiments in the paper:</p><p>a) Cannot say that Orai1 is dispensable for ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (line 206-7), B cell development (Figure 4), B cell proliferation and survival (Figure 7), or increased mitochondrial mass in activated B cells (Figure 8).</p><p>b) The enhancement of SOCE in Orai2 KO cells does not actually indicate that residual SOCE in Orai1/Orai3 DKO is due to Orai2 (Figure 5; lines 251-2). An alternative explanation is that the residual SOCE is due to Orai1, and the very low SOCE seen is from Orai2 suppressing the already reduced function of Orai1.</p><p>c) Cannot conclude that Orai3 is an &quot;essential&quot; component of the native SOCE pathway in B cells if Orai1 was not totally eliminated in the Orai1 KO (and therefore had a minimal effect) (line 413).</p><p>It is also worth noting that because Orai1 is the only isoform that supports NFAT activation, the persistence of NFAT translocation in the Orai1 KO cells is another sign that Orai1 protein is still present and functional at significant levels (Figure 6). Moreover, the persistence of residual Orai1 may explain why the phenotype of the Orai1/Orai3 DKO is not as severe as the STIM1/STIM2 DKO studied by other groups (line 446-8).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential comment 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. At several points in the paper, the authors imply that the CRAC channel in B cells is a heteromultimer of Orai1 and Orai3 (e.g., lines 259-60). Orai3 contributes to SOCE, but no arguments are made to rule out the alternative that Orai1 and Orai3 make separate channels. Pharmacology, kinetic profiling (CDI), or permeation properties of CRAC currents in whole-cell recordings may be an approach to distinguish between these possibilities. Otherwise, it remains an open question.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the oligomeric state of native CRAC channels in B cells (or any other cell type for that matter) remains an open question, and we have clearly stated this in the manuscript. While our attempts to study CDI have been unsuccessful due the small nature of these native currents, we provide whole-cell CRAC measurements in primary B cells from different Orai KO mice as requested by the reviewer. Based on the increased CRAC current size in B cells from Orai3 KO mice, we propose that Orai1 and Orai3 likely heteromultimerize. However, we concede that this does not rule out the existence of homohexameric channels and that these recordings do not represent in themselves proof of heteromultimerization. More studies beyond the scope of this manuscript are needed to resolve the CRAC channel composition in native cells.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining key issues that need to be addressed in the reviewers' comments.

These data have been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There continue to be claims indicating that Orai3 and Orai1 form heteromeric channels. There is no evidence in the study to support this conclusion and the results can be fully explained considering that Orai1 and Orai3 form functional but separate channels. Since the conclusions don't depend on this finding, these claims should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you! We have revised the manuscript so there are no claims in the conclusions as to the composition of CRAC channels in B cells. We apologize, our statements were not meant as conclusions but as speculation on the different possibilities. This is obviously a complex question that is not easy to address. The native CRAC channel in a single B cell is likely dynamic and complex with both homomers and different heteromeric assemblies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewers had a problem with language that make claims about Orai3 being essential (or &quot;critical&quot;) for CRAC channel function, or other things such as proliferation (in the Title, Abstract, Discussion, and Results headers). These appear to be left over from the previous version and were not revised. Since the SOCE measurements clearly show that Orai3 is not critical or essential for CRAC channel activity nor &quot;essential&quot; for function including proliferation the language should be changed to &quot;involved&quot; in or something analogous.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been revised accordingly. We changed the title, abstract and text to reflect this. In the Abstract we specified that Orai3 alone is not essential: âThe combined loss of Orai1 and Orai3, but not Orai3 alone, impairs SOCE, proliferation and survivalâ¦.â In the results subheadings and throughout the text, we emphasize that only the combined deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 has an effect on different cellular parameters. Statements such as âOrai3 is essential for SOCEâ were replaced by âOrai3 is involved in SOCEâ or âOrai3 and Orai1 mediate SOCEâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Discuss why the Orai3 cKO cells have a respiration defect as SOCE measurements do not show any change in SOCE (Figure 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss this issue in the manuscriptâs discussion. Please note that although Orai3 KO alone has no measurable effect on SOCE in naÃ¯ve B cells, the data with activated B cells show a partial contribution of Orai3 to B cell SOCE (Figure. 5âfigure supplement 1). These data are consistent with the bioenergetics data, which are from B cells activated for 24hrs with anti-IgM (naÃ¯ve B cell are metabolically quiescent).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Kudos to the authors for evaluating several in vivo metrics of B cells lacking both Orai1 and Orai3 for B cell cytokine production, IgG antibodies, receptors, and overall immunity for infection (Figure 11). The lack of any effects is extremely surprising. This raises a key concern regarding the in vivo significance of Orai1 and Orai3 for B cell function. In particular, what do all the in vitro data mean if knocking out Orai1 and Orai3 has no effect on B cell development or function? This should be tackled in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the lack of any effects of B cell double knockout of Orai1 and Orai3 on humoral immunity to Influenza A infection is extremely surprising. However, these are the results we obtained and no matter how disappointing, they reflect reality. We believe that scientific reality should never be referred to as concerning or disappointing. Otherwise, we set our trainees on the path of âmagical realismâ, where âexcitingâ results âmust be obtainedâ if they wish their papers accepted for publication. At the very least, our results offer a contrast with the function of SOCE in T cells, offer further evidence that the immune defects of CRAC channelopathies in humans are mostly T cell driven and emphasize the evolutionary hierarchy of SOCE between lymphocyte subsets, which is important to know from an academic standpoint and might be useful for future targeting of CRAC in a T cell-driven vs a B cell driven disease.

Yes, it has not escaped our attention that the I/V relationships of these currents are indeed not typical. Therefore, we did not include these recordings in the first version (R0) of the manuscript. Although we think these recordings contain a contribution from CRAC currents, the currents are very small and most likely contaminated. In any case, we agree that these recordings should be removed from the manuscript as they do not offer more clarity or insight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Supplementary Figure 10: An interesting result here is that upregulation of most polar metabolites co-stimulated with anti-IgM + anti-CD40 is similar to that of control cells stimulated with IgM alone and much larger than the levels seen in WT cells exposed to the GSK compound. This difference means that the effects of the GSK compound are not equivalent to that of the compound. This should be discussed in light of the fact that the DKO eliminates SOCE almost entirely.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this observation. We have added an explanation to the discussion. We recently characterized GSK-7975A for its equal inhibitory effect on CRAC currents mediated by each Orai isoform (Orai isoforms were individually co-expressed with STIM1 in Orai1/2/3 triple KO HEK cells), compared to differential effects on Orai isoforms with other common SOCE inhibitors like Synta66 (PMID:Â 32896813). While the more pronounced inhibition of the upregulation of metabolites by GSK-7975A in B cells compared to the inhibition observed in Orai1/Orai3 double KO B cells could be an off-target effect of the drug, a more likely explanation is that Orai2 contributes to this difference by mediating the residual ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in Orai1/Orai3 double KO B cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â On page 6, the heading &quot;Both Orai3 and Orai1 are essential components of SOCE in B cells&quot;.

The effects of Orai protein up- or down-regulation in response to stimulation in vitro need to be related to their effects on NFAT activation, proliferation and survival, and metabolic reprogramming. The authors compare SOCE in naÃ¯ve vs. stimulated cells after full store depletion (TG), but a comparison of Ca oscillations evoked by IgM stimulation is the relevant one and should be done since these are presumably the kind of Ca signals that are involved in regulating downstream behavior under more physiological conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with reviewer 3 assessment. Our view on oscillations has evolved based on models where each STIM and Orai isoforms were deleted individually and in combination. The real correlation is between the magnitude of SOCE and NFAT nuclear translocation and not between ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and NFAT translocation (please see our response to the second comment 3 below). We found this to be the case for HEK 293 cells (PMID: 32415068 and PMID:Â 33657364), B cells (the current study) and T cells (work currently in progress).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The updated data on Orai1 expression in the Orai1fl/fl Mb1cre/+ cells makes more sense than the original dataset. It is still not totally clear why there is only a 70% reduction in Orai1 staining. The argument that the antibody for Orai1 crossreacts with Orai2 and Orai3 is not documented here, but the fact that qPCR data show an almost complete absence of Orai1 mRNA is sufficient here to conclude that Orai1 protein is effectively suppressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

A major conclusion of the paper is that Orai3 and Orai1 are &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;crucial&quot; components of native CRAC channels in B cells. This is based on findings that deletion of either protein alone partially reduces SOCE, while the double KO almost completely eliminates it. The authors argue at several points in the paper that the CRAC channel may be a heteromultimer of Orai1 and Orai3, but the data fall short of demonstrating the molecular composition of CRAC channels. In regard to Figure 5 (and Figure S2), &quot;The slower rate of SOCE inhibition by 2-APB in wildtype B cells compared to Orai1 knockout B cells suggests that the native CRAC channel in B cells is a heteromer of Orai1 and Orai3.&quot; I disagree â the data could just as well be explained by separate populations of channels containing Orai1 or Orai3. In that case, 2-APB would inhibit Orai1 but enhance Ca influx through Orai3 (Yamashita et al., JBC 2011); thus, knocking out Orai3 would be expected to increase the inhibitory effect of 2-APB, as seen in Figure 5B. Likewise, the fact that double KO is required to inhibit oscillations could be explained simply by oscillations not being sensitive to a partial loss of SOCE, and only cease when SOCE is largely eliminated. The subunit composition of the channel could be complex, with multiple populations of homomers and heteromers, and unfortunately, these experiments do not answer this question.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential comments #1, 2 and 3. We cleansed the paper from the words âessentialâ and âcrucialâ and from any reference to the oligomeric state. The patch clamp data was removed from the manuscript as requested. In the first round of review (R0), we were asked to interpret the 2-APB data, which we did in the R1 version. Yes, we agree that based on the known potentiation of overexpressed Orai3 by 2-APB, the data are compatible with both homomeric and heteromeric scenarios. We would kindly caution the reviewer against extrapolating the 2-APB potentiation of overexpressed Orai3 to physiological settings. Although we do not understand it yet, we have extensive experience in many primary cell types lacking combinations of Orai isoforms (through CRISPR/Cas9 KO) where potentiation by 2-APB is not always apparent with native levels of Orai3 expression, the case of B cells herein included. In our defense, our interpretation of the 2-APB data seemed reasonable since the remaining ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in Orai1 KO cells is not potentiated by 2-APB. Regardless, we deleted those statements because we donât think the 2-APB data, or the patch clamp data, even testing 2-APB on currents (we tried) can offer definitive answers to this complex question. We agree it is better to remove any reference to the oligomeric state of these channels, which we did.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The patch-clamp recordings of whole-cell CRAC current are not convincing. The I/V plots are not inwardly rectifying as would be expected from normal CRAC currents, and there is no mention of correction for leak current. This throws into question the conclusion that Orai3 is &quot;a moderate negative regulator of CRAC channel activity,&quot; especially as the KO had no effect on SOCE of naÃ¯ve cells, and actually decreased SOCE in pre-activated cells or A20 B cells. A careful analysis of current characteristics in the various wild-type and knockout B cells might provide evidence for heteromultimers, but these data do not.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential comments #1 and 2. All these statements were deleted. While we agree with the reviewer statement that âA careful analysis of current characteristics in the various wild-type and knockout B cells might provide evidence for heteromultimersâ, reliable CRAC current recordings from primary B cells (as opposed to T cells) is not an easy task to achieve at least in our hands, as documented by our own shortcomings with those recordings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The data from the Orai1 KO cells do not support the conclusion that NFAT activation depends specifically on native Orai1. Figure S3A shows that in the Orai1 KO cells, IgM and TG still dephosphorylate NFAT, just not as much as in control â this is to be expected, as SOCE is partially reduced by O1 KO. If Orai1 were the only isoform that supports NFAT activation, IgM or TG would not dephosphorylate NFAT in the KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize. We should have been more careful in wording these statements. A look at our study in HEK293 cells (PMID<bold>:</bold> 32415068) shows that while Orai1 is the major contributor to NFAT nuclear translocation, Orai1 KO, Orai1/2 double KO and Orai1/3 double KO cells show some level of NFAT induction when compared to lack of NFAT nuclear translocation in Orai1/2/3 triple KO cells, suggesting that Orai2 and Orai3 can alone or together support moderate levels of NFAT induction. What is striking though is that the oscillations in Orai1 KO cells are indistinguishable from those of wildtype cells while NFAT induction and SOCE (in response to thapsigargin) are significantly inhibited in HEK293 (above reference) and in B cells (Figure 6 and Figure 6âSupplement 1 of the current study). In the current study, and as pointed out by reviewer 3, NFAT dephosphorylation is partially inhibited in naÃ¯ve Orai1 KO B cells (more so in activated B cells), suggesting that Orai3 and/or Orai2 can mediate the remaining NFAT dephosphorylation. We have changed the statements in the manuscript to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors state that Orai1 and Orai3 are critical for primary B cell proliferation and survival (Figure 8). This conclusion needs to be toned down, as KO of either protein alone had little or no effect, and even the double KO had only a partial effect on proliferation. At any rate, the relevance of measuring viability effects after 72 hrs in vitro seems questionable, given that these conditions differ significantly from the environment of the cells in vivo (where there are no discernable functional effects of the DKO).</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned down these statements and specifically stated that the effect on proliferation is observed only with the combined deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 and can be partially rescued with ani-CD40 co-stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is surprising (and disappointing!) that the deletion of Orai1 and Orai3 in B cells did not affect humoral immunity to influenza A infection in mice. In my view, this result seriously undermines the significance of the paper. If Orai channels are not required for B cell development or function in vivo, it is not clear how the in vitro results of the many different assays in this paper relate to the humoral immune response.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this result is surprising, but we prefer a disappointing truth over an exciting artifact or falsehood as we much prefer, at the behest of reviewers, to admit our ignorance than publish our fantasies. Perhaps our manuscript deserves to be rejected because we did not obtain an âexcitingâ result, perhaps not. Perhaps the in vivo function of SOCE in B cells could be revealed with another in vivo model such as an autoimmunity model, perhaps not. We are truly at loss as to why we do not see any effects in the double Orai1/Orai3 knockout. In this revision, we offer a discussion of the discrepancy between the results in vivo and those in vitro and some ideas on what might explain this discrepancy.</p></body></sub-article></article>
