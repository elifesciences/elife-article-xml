The additional sentence should read “An aliquot of SLO stock was reduced by 10 mM TCEP (Pierce) for 20 minutes at 37 oC.” and is to be inserted between “A new aliquot was thawed prior to each experiment and used within 5 hr.” and “The SLO stock solution was further diluted to working concentration in DPBS supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2.”. The sentence was present in previous edition of the draft, but was left out due to mistake in editing.
