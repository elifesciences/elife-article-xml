However, the mechanism by which host deals with gut dysbiosis to maintain fitness remains largely unknown. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which is its bacterial diet, proliferates in its intestinal lumen during aging. Here, we demonstrate that progressive intestinal proliferation of <italic>E. coli</italic> activates the transcription factor DAF-16, which is required for maintenance of longevity and organismal fitness in worms with age. DAF-16 up-regulates two lysozymes <italic>lys-7</italic> and <italic>lys-8</italic>, thus limiting the bacterial accumulation in the gut of worms during aging. During dysbiosis, the levels of indole produced by <italic>E. coli</italic> are increased in worms. Indole is involved in the activation of DAF-16 by TRPA-1 in neurons of worms. Our finding demonstrates that indole functions as a microbial signal of gut dysbiosis to promote fitness of the host.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>indole</kwd><kwd>DAF-16</kwd><kwd>TRPA-1</kwd><kwd>gut dysbiosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFD1400700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yi-Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012659</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U1802233</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Cheng-Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Yunnan Characteristic Plant Extraction Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YKZY006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Cheng-Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012659</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31900420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yi-Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012659</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32260021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yi-Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Yunnan Province of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202001BC070004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Cheng-Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, neuronic TRPA-1 senses bacterial accumulation by detecting indole production to up-regulate lysozyme genes via FOXO/DAF-16 in the intestine, thereby delaying microbial dysbiosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The microbiota in the gut has a substantial impact on host nutrition, metabolism, immune function, development, behavior, and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bana and Cabreiro, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and Foster, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Brey, 2013</xref>). Microbial community disequilibria, so-called dysbiosis, have been implicated in a broad range of human diseases, such as obesity, insulin resistance, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), aging, and increased pathogen susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Honda and Littman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, understanding of the mechanisms that modulate host–microbe interactions will provide important insights into treatment of these diseases by intervening the microbial communities.</p><p>The genetically tractable model organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has contributed greatly to understand the role of host–microbiota interactions in host physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabreiro and Gems, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In the bacterivore nematode, the microbiota in the gut can be easily manipulated, making it an excellent model for studying how the microbiota affects host physiology in the context of disease and aging at a single species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabreiro and Gems, 2013</xref>). For instance, the neurotransmitter tyramine produced by intestinal Providencia bacteria can direct sensory behavioral decisions by modulate multiple monoaminergic pathways in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O’Donnell et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>C. elegans</italic>-based studies have revealed a variety of signaling cascades involved in the innate immune responses to microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Irazoqui et al., 2010b</xref>), including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/PMK-1, ERK MAPK/MPK-1, the heat shock transcription factor (HSF-1), the transforming growth factor (TGF)β/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zugasti and Ewbank, 2009</xref>), and the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garsin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh and Aballay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zou et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells, activation of FOXOs up-regulates a set of antimicrobial peptides, such as drosomycin and defensins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2010</xref>), implicating that the role for FOXOs in innate immunity is conserved across species. Furthermore, disruption of these innate immune-related pathways, such as the p38 MAPK pathway and the TGF-β/BMP signaling cascade, turns beneficial bacteria commensal to pathogenic in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montalvo-Katz et al., 2013</xref>). These results indicate that the integrity of immune system is also essential for host defense against non-pathogenic bacteria.</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (strain OP50) is conventionally used as a bacterial food for culturing <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In general, most of <italic>E. coli</italic> is efficiently disrupted by a muscular grinder in the pharynx of the worm. However, very few intact bacteria may escape from this defense system, and enter in the lumen of the worm intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta and Singh, 2017</xref>). The intestinal lumen of worms is frequently distended during aging, which accompanied by bacterial proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garigan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGee et al., 2011</xref>). Blockage of bacterial proliferation by treatment of UV, antibiotics, and heat extends lifespan of worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Arras et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garigan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>), implicating that progressive intestinal proliferation of <italic>E. coli</italic> probably contributes to worm aging and death. Thus, age-related dysbiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides a model to study how host responses to altered gut microbiota to maintain fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ezcurra, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence has indicated that genetic inactivation of <italic>daf-16</italic> accelerates tissue deterioration and shortens lifespan of wild-type (WT) worms grown on <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garigan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Portal-Celhay and Blaser, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Portal-Celhay et al., 2012</xref>). The observation that DAF-16 is activated during bacterial accumulation in older worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>) prompt us to investigate the role of DAF-16 in dysbiosis in the gut of worms. We found that activation of DAF-16 was required for maintenance of longevity and organismal fitness in worms, at least in part, by up-regulating two lysozyme genes (<italic>lys-7</italic> and <italic>lys-8</italic>), thus limiting bacterial accumulation in the gut of worms during aging. Meanwhile, we identified that indole produced by <italic>E. coli</italic> was involved in the activation of DAF-16 by TRPA-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activation of DAF-16 is required for normal lifespan and organismal fitness in worms</title><p>To study the role of DAF-16 in age-related dysbiosis, all the experiments started from the young adult stage, which was considered day 0 (0 day) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with a recent observation that DAF-16 is activated in worms with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>), we found that DAF-16::GFP was mainly located in the cytoplasm of the intestine in worms expressing <italic>daf-16p::daf-16::gfp</italic> fed live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). The nuclear translocation of DAF-16 in the intestine was increased in worms fed live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on days 4 and 7, but not in age-matched WT worms fed heat-killed (HK) <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). To further confirm these results, we tested the expression of two DAF-16 target genes <italic>dod-3</italic> and <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> via the transcriptional reporter strains of <italic>dod-3p::gfp</italic> and <italic>hsp-16.2p::nCherry</italic>. As expected, the expression of either <italic>dod-3p::gfp</italic> or <italic>hsp-16.2p::nCherry</italic> was significantly up-regulated in worms fed live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on day 4, but not in age-matched worms fed HK <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Likewise, DAF-16 was also retained in the cytoplasm of the intestine in worms fed ampicillin-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on days 4 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, starvation induced the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 in the intestine of worms on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, either HK or antibiotic-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 as a food source does not induce a starvation state in worms. Taken together, these results indicate that the activation of DAF-16 is mainly attributed to the presence of live <italic>E. coli</italic>, but not by age itself, in worms.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activation of DAF-16 by bacterial accumulation is involved in longevity and organismal fitness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The nuclear translocation of DAF-16::GFP in the intestine was increased in worms fed live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, but not in those fed heat-killed (HK) <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50.

In contrast, the rates of pharyngeal pumping and body bending were comparable in WT worms and <italic>daf-16(mu86)</italic> mutants grown on HK <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on day 7. Furthermore, we used food dye FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 to evaluate the integrity of intestinal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). The body-cavity leakage in <italic>daf-16(mu86)</italic> mutants on days 7 and 10 were higher than those in age-matched WT worms fed live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, but not HK <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the activation of DAF-16 by bacterial accumulation is required for normal lifespan and the maintenance of organismal fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Indole produced from <italic>E. coli</italic> activates DAF-16</title><p>As DAF-16 is activated by bacterial accumulation, we hypothesized that this activation is probably due to bacterially produced compounds. To test this idea, culture supernatants from <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 were collected, and isolated by high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), silica gel G column and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. A candidate compound was detected by activity-guided isolation, and further identified as indole with mass spectrometry and NMR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The observation that indole secreted by <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 could activate DAF-16 was further confirmed by analyzing commercial HPLC grade indole. Supplementation with indole (50–200 μM) not only significantly induced the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but also up-regulated the expression of either <italic>dod-3p::gfp</italic> or <italic>hsp-16.2p::nCherry</italic> in young adult worms after 24 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Next, we found that the levels of indole were 30.9, 71.9, and 105.9 nmol/g dry weight, respectively, in worms fed live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on days 1, 4, and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The elevated indole levels in worms were accompanied by an increase in colony-forming units (CFU) of live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 in the intestine of worms with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that accumulation of live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 in the intestine is probably responsible for increased indole in worms. These data also raised a possibility that exogenous indole produced by <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on the nematode growth media (NGM) plates could increase the levels of indole in worms with age. However, we found that the levels of indole were 28.2, 31.6, and 36.1 nmol/g dry weight, respectively, in worms fed HK <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on days 1, 4, and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), indicating that indole was not accumulated in worms fed HK <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 even for 7 days. Thus, the increase in the levels of indole in worms results from intestinal accumulation of live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, rather than exogenous indole produced by <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on the NGM plates. The observation that DAF-16 was retained in the cytoplasm of the intestine in worms fed live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>) also indicated that exogenous indole produced by <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on the NGM plates is not enough to activate DAF-16.

As a well-known regulator of longevity and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garsin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zou et al., 2013</xref>), DAF-16 is activated in aged <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>). This transcription factor is involved in both maintaining normal lifespan and limiting proliferation of <italic>E. coli</italic> in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garigan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Portal-Celhay and Blaser, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Portal-Celhay et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, our data demonstrate that activation of DAF-16 requires contact with live bacterial cells in the gut of worms as dead <italic>E. coli</italic> fails to activate DAF-16. Thus, the accumulation of <italic>E. coli</italic> during aging, but not aging itself, results in the activation of DAF-16. Furthermore, DAF-16 mutation does not influence the lifespan in worms fed dead <italic>E. coli</italic>. Taken together, these findings clearly demonstrate that DAF-16 acts to maintain homeostasis by inhibiting bacterial proliferation in worms with age.</p><p>Indole is produced from tryptophan by tryptophanase in a large number of bacterial species. As a well-known signaling molecule, indole is involved in regulation of a variety of physiological processes in bacteria, such as cell division, biofilm formation, virulence, spore formation, and antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zarkan et al., 2020</xref>). Although animals cannot synthesize indole, they can sense and modify this metabolite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Indole and its derivatives can influence insect behaviors and human diseases, such as intestinal inflammation and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, indole may function as an interspecies and interkingdom signaling molecule to influence the microbe–host interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bansal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, enteric delivery of indole (1 mM) increases the intestinal motility by inducing 5-hydroxytryptamine secretion in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). Supplementation with 0.2 mM indole enhances the resistance of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to infection with <italic>C. albicans</italic> by reducing fungal colonization in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, treatment of HCT-8 intestinal epithelial cells with 1 mM indole inhibits tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) mediated activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and up-regulation of the inflammatory factor IL-8, thus improving intestinal epithelial barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bansal et al., 2010</xref>). Our data show that indole limits the bacterial proliferation in the gut of worms by driving intestinal defense gene expression via DAF-16. These findings suggest that the bacteria-derived metabolite may serve as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that is recognized by metazoans. Although indole at a higher concentration (5 mM) is capable of inhibiting cell division in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chimerel et al., 2012</xref>), exogenous indole has little effect on the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strain up to 3 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chant and Summers, 2007</xref>). In general, extracellular indole concentrations detected in stationary phase LB cultures are typically 0.5–1 mM depending on the specific <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zarkan et al., 2020</xref>). Our data show that indole is sufficient to inhibit the accumulation of <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 at the concentration range from 0.05 to 0.2 mM. Thus, these results suggest that direct causal involvement of cell cycle arrest in <italic>E. coli</italic> by indole is unlikely.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that the cold-sensitive TRP channel TRPA-1 in neurons is involved in indole-mediated nuclear translocation of DAF-16 in the intestine, which is required for lifespan extension in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ye et al., 2021</xref> have shown that both indole and indole-3-carboxaldehyde (IAld) are TRPA-1 agonists in vertebrates. <italic>trpa-1</italic> is widely expressed in a variety of sensory neurons in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kindt et al., 2007</xref>). Low temperature also activates TRPA-1, which in turn acts to promote longevity via the PKC-2–SGK-1–DAF-16 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>). It should be noted that unlike indole, activation of TPRA-1 by low temperature promotes the transcription activity, but not the nuclear translocation, of DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, our data show that knockdown of <italic>sgk-1</italic> dose not influence the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 induced by indole. Finally, indole extends lifespan via TRPA-1 only in nervous system, whereas low temperature extends lifespan via TRPA-1 both in the intestine and neurons. Thus, indole-mediated lifespan extension is essentially different from low temperature-mediated lifespan extension, although TRPA-1 and DAF-16 are involved in both processes. One possibility is that only neurons with activated TRPA-1 may release a neurotransmitter, which in turn triggers a signaling pathway to extend the lifespan of worms via activating DAF-16 in a non-cell autonomous manner, while the intestinal activated TRPA-1 is unable to release the neurotransmitter. Indeed, TRPA-1 induces the releasing of calcitonin gene-related peptide in perivascular sensory nerves, which in turn binds corresponding G-protein-coupled receptor, and causes membrane hyperpolarization and arterial dilation on smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Talavera et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, Ye et al. have shown that both indole and indole-3-carboxaldehyde (IAld) are TRPA-1 agonists in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). As an agonist of TRPA-1, podocarpic acid can activate SKN-1 via TRPA-1 in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaudhuri et al., 2016</xref>). However, podocarpic acid fails to trigger DAF-16 translocation. Unlike podocarpic acid, indole cannot activate SKN-1 in worms. Although both indole and podocarpic acid are non-electrophilic agonists of TAPR-1, the structures of podocarpic acid and indole are totally different. These results suggest that TRPA-1 activation by podocarpic acid, low temperature, and indole occurs largely through distinct mechanisms.</p><p>In this study, our data demonstrate that DAF-16 inhibits bacterial proliferation by up-regulating expression of two lysozyme genes, <italic>lys-7</italic> and <italic>lys-8</italic>. As a group of digestive enzymes with antimicrobial properties, lysozymes play an important role in the innate immunity in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Rourke et al., 2006</xref>). As a target gene of DAF-16, <italic>lys-7</italic> has been proven to play an important role in resistance against a variety of pathogens, such as <italic>Microbacterium nematophilum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Rourke et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nandakumar and Tan, 2008</xref>), the pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> LF82 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simonsen et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boehnisch et al., 2011</xref>), and <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marsh et al., 2011</xref>). A previous study has demonstrated that a mutation in <italic>lys-7</italic> significantly reduces the lifespan, but does not influence the accumulation of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 in the intestine of 2-day-old worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Portal-Celhay et al., 2012</xref>). In the current study, the <italic>lys-7</italic> mutants exhibit reduced the lifespan and elevated bacterial loads in the intestine of worms on days 4 and 7. This discrepancy may be due to the worms at different ages. Actually, our data also show that the <italic>lys-7;lys-8</italic> double mutants exhibit a comparable accumulation of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 in worms on day 1. Although <italic>lys-8</italic> mutation dose not influence either the lifespan or bacterial loads, it enhances the effect of <italic>lys-7</italic>. These results suggest that <italic>lys-8</italic> acts in synergy with <italic>lys-7</italic> to limit bacterial accumulation in the gut of worms.</p><p>It has been well established that bacterial dysbiosis is significantly associated with IBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manichanh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sommer and Bäckhed, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, reduced levels of indole and its derivative indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) are observed in serum of mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and patients with IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexeev et al., 2018</xref>). Oral administration of IPA significantly ameliorates disease symptoms and promotes intestinal homeostasis by up-regulating colonic epithelial IL-10R1 in the chemically induced murine colitis model. Thus, characterization of the role for indole and its derivatives in host–microbiota interactions within the mucosa may provide new therapeutic avenues for inflammatory intestinal diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nematode strains</title><p><italic>daf-16(mu86)</italic>, <italic>lys-7(ok1384)</italic>, <italic>lys-8(ok3504)</italic>, LD1<italic>[skn-1b/c::gfp+rol-6(su1006)],</italic> the nematode strain for neuronal-specific RNAi, TU3401 (<italic>sid-1(pk3321); uIs69 [pCFJ90 (myo-2p:: mCherry)+unc-119p::sid-1]</italic>), TJ356 (<italic>zIs356 [daf-16p::daf-16a/b::GFP+rol-6 (su1006)]</italic>), and SAL105 (<italic>denEx2 [lys-7::GFP+pha-1(+)]</italic>) were kindly provided by the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.umn.edu/CGC">http://www.cbs.umn.edu/CGC</ext-link>), funded by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440).

How might it affect DAF-16?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In all, this is a very convincing paper that beautifully delineates the microbiome/host cross-talk in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. I have a few thoughts that, if addressed, would further strengthen the paper.</p><p>How was indole identified to be the relevant molecule? How was &quot;activity-guided isolation&quot; done? I see in the methods that fraction 26 was identified – it would be nice to provide the data in the paper that lead to this important finding in the paper.</p><p>Dysbiosis for the purpose of this paper is defined as the aberrant growth of normal bacteria. I wonder about the daf-16 response to pathogenic bacteria. Do pathogens produce more (or less) indole? Is indole a &quot;marker&quot; for the presence of live bacteria in the gut, or would it be a specific response to certain bacterial strains?</p><p>The text refers to &quot;endogenous indole&quot;: this meant indole produced by bacteria in the gut? If so, it would help to word this more specifically.</p><p>Survival statistics: I was unable to access the source data – would it be possible to specify the survival experiments in the legends or in the methods? How many survival assays were done per experiment and how many animals were used?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below I detail the main issues:</p><p>1. It looks like the authors are aware of the complications of using heat-killed bacteria as a control (given the added controls in supplementary figures). Indeed, adult worms don't do well on heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> and were suggested to be starved, either energetically, or for certain essential nutrients. All experiments would have been easier to interpret if paraformaldehyde-killed bacteria were used as controls (see Beydoun et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the authors did include controls with antibiotic-killed bacteria, and with starvation per se, to demonstrate that starvation is not involved, and that baseline established for comparisons is similar in worms raised on bacteria killed not by heat (method describing how ampicillin was employed to kill bacteria should be included, as well as a note on whether bacteria were dead or only metabolically inactive). The additional control experiments, currently presented in Figure 1- supp. 1 and 2, should be incorporated into the main Figure 1.</p><p>2. Throughout the paper, the authors used SEMs to describe the variance in their data. SDs are more appropriate for this.</p><p>3. The authors seem to suggest that the sensing of indole is inside the gut, released by accumulating bacteria. This leaves the question of how such sensing occurs unanswered. As far as I know, there is no knowledge about neuronal sensing of gut conditions. This should be addressed. The authors demonstrate tight correlation between gut bacteria CFUs and indole levels (Figure 2- supp. 3), but given the ability of supplemented external indole (more info is required about how this is carried out) to increase internal indole concentrations, I don't see why should such correlation exist – there are two sources for gut indole levels – colonizing bacteria and external bacteria, so excess environmental availability should drown any correlation.</p><p>Perhaps modulating bacterial accumulation (as in grinder defective tnt-3 mutants), could help clarify that.</p><p>4. The importance of TRPA-1 for indole-induced activation of DAF-16 is central to the paper. To provide stronger support, the authors may want to replicate the phenotypes, shown in Figure 4 with trpa-1 RNAi, also in trpa-1 null mutants.</p><p>Also, are the effects of TRPA-1 and DAF-16 KO/KD additive or not? This is important to establish the axis suggested here.</p><p>5. Lack of SKN-1 nuclear localization does not strike me as the most conclusive evidence for lack of p38 activation by indole. For one, p38 also activates ATF-7. The authors should also run qRT-PCR for p38 targets, for example T24B8.5, or use available GFP reporter strains for such targets.</p><p>6. The authors should also examine the outcome of activating TRPA-1 with its previously described agonist podacarpic acid (which they mention). Does it activate DAF-16 nuclear localization? Seems to be simple enough.</p><p>For discussion: do the authors consider indole as TRPA-1 agonist? Is TRPA-1 a ligand-activated channel? Have homologs been shown in other organisms to have more than one agonist, with different outcomes? How similar are the structures of podacarpic acid and indole?</p><p>7. Given the many targets of DAF-16, and the redundant nature of innate immune protection, how do the authors explain the ability of lys-7 and lys-8 to account for the full contribution of DAF-16 to lifespan and OP50 control?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85362.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How was indole identified as a biologically relevant molecule?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concerns of the reviewing editor. Activity-guided isolation was</p><p>performed as follows: The crude extract of <italic>E. coli</italic> supernatant metabolites was divided into 45 fractions according to polarity using Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA) coupled with automated fraction collector. After freeze-drying each fraction, 1 mg of metabolites were dissolved in DMSO for DAF-16 nuclear localization assay in worms (Please see new Supplementary Table S2). The 26th fraction with DAF-16 nuclear translocation-inducing activity was then separated on silica gel column (200-300 mesh) with a continuous gradient of decreasing polarity (100%, 70%, 50%, 30%, petroleum ether/acetone) to yield four fractions (26a-d). Only the fraction of 26b could induce DAF-16 nuclear translocation. Then the fraction was further separated using a Sephadex LH-20 column to yield 32 fractions. The 26b-11th fraction with DAF-16 nuclear translocation-inducing activity contained a single compound identified by thin layer chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The compound exhibited a quasimolecular ion peak at m/z 181.0782 [M+H]+ in the positive APCI-MS, and was assigned to a molecular formula of C8H7N. A comparison of these 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra with the data reported in the literature revealed that the compound was indole (Yagudaev, 1986). The detailed information was provided in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What is the role of daf-2 in the context of their work?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concerns of the reviewing editor. It has been shown that DAF-2</p><p>initiates a kinase cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of DAF-16. By contrast, a reduction in the DAF-2 signaling leads to the dephosphorylation of DAF-16, allowing its nuclear translocation. We found that the mRNA levels of daf-2 were significantly increased in worms on days 4 and 7 in the presence of either live or dead <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, compared with those in worms on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). The nuclear translocation of DAF-16 in the intestine was increased in worms fed live <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on days 4 and 7, but not in age-matched WT worms fed heat-killed (HK) <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 or ampicillin-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (Figure 1A-1C). In addition, supplementation with indole significantly induced the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 (Figure 2B), but did not alter the mRNA levels of daf-2 in young adult worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). To conclude, the activation of DAF-16 is independent of DAF-2 during C. elegans aging.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>DAF-16 nuclear translocation is independent of DAF-2.</title><p>(A) The mRNA levels of <italic>daf-2</italic> were gradually increased in worms with age. **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; ns, not significant.

Does it signal to or interact with TRPA1?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewing editor for raising this important issue. The transporter of</p><p>indole has not been identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In Arabidopsis, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter G family 37(ABCG37) has been reported to transport a range of indole derivatives (Ruzicka et al., 2010). However, all fifteen C. elegans ABC transporters share less than 30% sequence identity with ABCG37, making it difficult to determine which one is the transporter for indole and indole derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Recently, Ye et al. have demonstrated that indole and indole-3-carboxaldehyde (IAld) are agonists of TRPA1, which is conserved in vertebrates (Ye et al., 2021). Thus, it is mostly likely that indole acts as an agonist of TRPA-1 in C. elegans by directly binding to TRPA-1.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ABCG37 and 15 <italic>C. elegans</italic> ABC transporters.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85362-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is indole taken up by the intact gut or only after leakage occurs? How might it affect DAF-16?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concerns of the reviewing editor. Although the transporter of indole in <italic>C. elegans</italic> remains to be characterized, we exclude a possible mechanism by which an increase in the indole levels in worms is associated with gut leakage. We found that supplementation with indole significantly increased the indole levels in young adult worms on day 1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B), and induced the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 in worms (Figure 2B). The intestine barrier is intact in 1-day-old worms (Figure 1I). Thus, the indole is taken up by the intact gut.</p><p>We speculate that the activation of TRPA-1 by indole in neurons could induce a pathway that may release a neurotransmitter, thereby leading to the activation of DAF-16 in the intestine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In all, this is a very convincing paper that beautifully delineates the microbiome/host cross-talk in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

The 26th fraction with DAF-16 nuclear translocation-inducing activity was then separated on silica gel column (200-300 mesh) with a continuous gradient of decreasing polarity (100%, 70%, 50%, 30%, petroleum ether/acetone) to yield four fractions (26a-d). Only the fraction of 26b could induce DAF-16 nuclear translocation. Then the fraction was further separated using a Sephadex LH-20 column to yield 32 fractions. The 26b-11th fraction with DAF-16 nuclear translocation-inducing activity contained a single compound identified by thin layer chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The compound exhibited a quasimolecular ion peak at m/z 181.0782 [M+H]+ in the positive APCI-MS, and was assigned to a molecular formula of C8H7N. A comparison of these 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra with the data reported in the literature revealed that the compound was indole (Yagudaev, 1986). The detailed information was provided in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Dysbiosis for the purpose of this paper is defined as the aberrant growth of normal bacteria.

It looks like the authors are aware of the complications of using heat-killed bacteria as a control (given the added controls in supplementary figures). Indeed, adult worms don't do well on heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> and were suggested to be starved, either energetically, or for certain essential nutrients. All experiments would have been easier to interpret if paraformaldehyde-killed bacteria were used as controls (see Beydoun et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the authors did include controls with antibiotic-killed bacteria, and with starvation per se, to demonstrate that starvation is not involved, and that baseline established for comparisons is similar in worms raised on bacteria killed not by heat (method describing how ampicillin was employed to kill bacteria should be included, as well as a note on whether bacteria were dead or only metabolically inactive). The additional control experiments, currently presented in Figure 1- supp. 1 and 2, should be incorporated into the main Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, the details of ampicillin was employed to</p><p>kill bacteria were provided in the section of Methods. Meanwhile, we incorporated the previous Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and 2 into Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Throughout the paper, the authors used SEMs to describe the variance in their data. SDs are more appropriate for this.</p></disp-quote><p>Amended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors seem to suggest that the sensing of indole is inside the gut, released by accumulating bacteria. This leaves the question of how such sensing occurs unanswered. As far as I know, there is no knowledge about neuronal sensing of gut conditions. This should be addressed. The authors demonstrate tight correlation between gut bacteria CFUs and indole levels (Figure 2- supp. 3), but given the ability of supplemented external indole (more info is required about how this is carried out) to increase internal indole concentrations, I don't see why should such correlation exist – there are two sources for gut indole levels – colonizing bacteria and external bacteria, so excess environmental availability should drown any correlation.</p><p>Perhaps modulating bacterial accumulation (as in grinder defective tnt-3 mutants), could help clarify that.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concerns of the reviewer. Reviewer #3 also pointed out this problem. In this study, our data showed that the levels of indole were 30.9, 71.9, and 105.9 nmol/g dry weight in worms fed live E. coli OP50 on days 1, 4, and 7, respectively (Figure 2C). This increase in the levels of indole in worms was accompanied by an increase in CFU of live E. coli OP50 in the intestine of worms with age (Figure 2C). In addition, we determined the levels of indole in worms fed HK E. coli OP50, and found that the levels of indole were 28.2, 31.6, and 36.1 nmol/g dry weight in worms fed HK E. coli OP50 on days 1, 4, and 7, respectively (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A). It should be noted that the levels of indole in worms fed dead E. coli OP50 on day 1 were comparable of those in worms fed live E. coli OP50 on day 1 (30.9 vs 28.2 nmol/g dry weight). However, the levels of indole were not increased in worms fed HK E. coli OP50 on days 4 and 7. Furthermore, the observation that DAF-16 was retained in the cytoplasm of the intestine in worms fed live E. coli OP50 on day 1 (Figure 1A and 1B) also indicates that indole produced by <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 on the NGM plates is not enough to induce DAF-16 nuclear translocation. By contrast, supplementation with indole (50-200 μM) significantly increased the indole levels in worms on day 1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B), which could induce the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 in worms (Figure 2B). Thus, the increase in the levels of indole in worms with age results from intestinal accumulation of live E. coli OP50, rather than indole produced by E. coli OP50 on the NGM plates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The importance of TRPA-1 for indole-induced activation of DAF-16 is central to the paper. To provide stronger support, the authors may want to replicate the phenotypes, shown in Figure 4 with trpa-1 RNAi, also in trpa-1 null mutants.</p><p>Also, are the effects of TRPA-1 and DAF-16 KO/KD additive or not? This is important to establish the axis suggested here.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concerns of the reviewer and have performed the suggested experiments.

Lack of SKN-1 nuclear localization does not strike me as the most conclusive evidence for lack of p38 activation by indole. For one, p38 also activates ATF-7.

The authors should also examine the outcome of activating TRPA-1 with its previously described agonist podacarpic acid (which they mention). Does it activate DAF-16 nuclear localization? Seems to be simple enough.</p><p>For discussion: do the authors consider indole as TRPA-1 agonist? Is TRPA-1 a ligand-activated channel? Have homologs been shown in other organisms to have more than one agonist, with different outcomes? How similar are the structures of podacarpic acid and indole?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concerns of the reviewer and have performed the suggested</p><p>experiments. It has been shown that podocarpic acid can activate SKN-1 via TRPA-1 (Chaudhuri et al., 2016). We found that supplementation with 0.02 mM podocarpic acid failed to induce the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 in worms on day 1 (new Figure 4-figure supplement 3C). Xiao et al. have demonstrated that TRPA-1 activated by low temperatures mediates calcium influx, which in turn stimulates the PKC-2-SGK-1 signaling to promote the transcription activity of DAF-16 (Xiao et al., 2013). This suggests that TRPA-1 activation by podocarpic acid, low temperature and indole occurs largely through distinct mechanisms.</p><p>Recently, Ye et al. have shown that both indole and indole-3-carboxaldehyde (IAld) are TRPA1 agonists in vertebrates (Ye et al., 2021). The agonists of mammalian TRPA1 include both non-electrophilic and electrophilic agonists, such as icilin, carvacrol, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), isoflurane, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), acrolein, umbellulone, and etodolac (Nishida, Kuwahara, Kozai, Sakaguchi, and Mori, 2015). Activated TRPA1 have different effects in mammals. For example, TRPA1 induces the releasing of calcitonin gene-related peptide in perivascular sensory nerves, which in turn binds corresponding G protein-coupled receptor, and causes membrane hyperpolarization and arterial dilation on smooth muscle cells (Talavera et al., 2020). Additionally, the activation of TRPA1 by indole and IAld induces the secretion of the neurotransmitter serotonin in zebrafish (Ye et al., 2021).</p><p>Both Indole and podocarpic acid are non-electrophilic agonists of TAPR-1, the structures of podocarpic acid and indole are totally different. Podocarpic acid is an abietane diterpenoid lacking the isopropyl substituent with an aromatic C-ring and a hydroxy group at the 12-position (W.Campbell, 1942). Indole is an electron-rich aromatic system containing enamine embedded C2-C3 π bond and strong nucleophilic C3 carbon (Zhang et al., 2021).</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we added sentences “Recently, Ye et al. have shown that both indole and indole-3-carboxaldehyde (IAld) are TRPA1 agonists in vertebrates (Ye et al., 2021). As the agonist of TRPA-1, podocarpic acid can activate SKN-1 via TRPA-1 in worms (Chaudhuri et al., 2016). However, podocarpic acid fails to trigger DAF-16 translocation. Unlike podocarpic acid, indole cannot activate SKN-1 in worms. Although both Indole and podocarpic acid are non-electrophilic agonists of TAPR-1, the structures of podocarpic acid and indole are totally different. These results suggest that TRPA-1 activation by podocarpic acid, low temperature, and indole occurs largely through distinct mechanisms.” in the section of Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
