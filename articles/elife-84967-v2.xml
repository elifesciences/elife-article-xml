however, in the humid rainforests of Jianfengling in Hainan, South China, we show that some flying squirrels cache elliptical or oblate nuts by hanging them securely in vegetation. These small flying squirrels were identified as <italic>Hylopetes phayrei electilis</italic> (G. M. Allen, 1925) and <italic>Hylopetes alboniger</italic> (Hodgson, 1870), in video clips captured of their behavior around focal nuts. Squirrels chewed grooves encircling ellipsoid nuts or distributed on the bottoms of oblate nuts, and then used these grooves to fix nuts tightly between small twigs 0.1–0.6 cm in diameter that were connected at angles of 25–40°. The grooves carved on the nuts (concave structure) connected with Y-shaped twigs (convex structure) and thus firmly affixed the nuts to the plant in a way similar to a mortise-tenon joint used in architecture and carpentry. Cache sites were on small plants located 10–25 m away from the closest potentially nut-producing tree, a behavior that likely reduces the discovery and consumption of the nuts by other animals. The adaptive squirrel behavior that shapes and fits nuts between twigs seems to be directed at providing more secure storage that increases food supply during dry periods in a humid tropical rainforest. In addition to providing such benefits for the squirrels, we suggest that this behavior also impacts the distribution of tree species in the forest.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The rainy forests of South China are home to <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic> trees whose smooth, elliptical nuts are favoured by many animal species. While doing fieldwork in the Jianfengling nature reserve in the southern province of Hainan, China, researchers came across an unusual sight: many of these nuts had been wedged into the Y-shaped forks between diverging twigs. A closer inspection revealed that a carefully crafted groove on the surface of the nuts helped them to stay wedged and secured between the branches. Which creature was responsible for such a feat?</p><p>To investigate, Xu et al. set up motion-triggered, infra-red cameras near some of the hoarding sites. They discovered that the culprits were <italic>Hylopetes phayrei electilis</italic> and <italic>Hylopetes alboniger</italic>, two small species of flying squirrel that tend to store <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic> nuts to prepare for the dry, cool season.</p><p>The footage showed that the squirrels first chewed the nuts before inserting them tightly between the branches. In fact, this process appeared to require much care – and, potentially, cognitive involvement – with the squirrels testing and adjusting their grooves many times until a perfect fit was achieved. Caching sites were usually found 10 to 25 meters away from the nearest <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic> tree, which probably helps to protect the hoards from other animals on the hunt for nuts.</p><p>Squirrels from temperate regions typically prepare for winter by hiding food in the ground, between logs or inside hollow trees; in humid, tropical forests, however, such caching sites may promote mould, decomposition or germination. In these conditions, securely hanging nuts between branches may prove to be a more suitable strategy. By choosing caching sites that are away from the mother tree, squirrels may also inadvertently help <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic> to expand their range, with forgotten nuts becoming dislodged and sprouting in new locations across the reserve. Overall, these findings shed new light on animal adaptation and cognition, as well as on the forces that help to shape forest ecology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>animal behavior</kwd><kwd>environmental adaption</kwd><kwd>mortise-tenon structure</kwd><kwd>nut cache</kwd><kwd>squirrel</kwd><kwd>tropical rainforest</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Basic Work Project from Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019FY101607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two flying squirrel species chewed grooves into <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic> nuts, and used them to pressure-fit nuts tightly in crotches formed by small twigs on understory plants, in a way similar to a mortise-tenon joint used in architecture and carpentry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Storing food to buffer against periods of low resource supply is a common species-specific behavior used by squirrels and other rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson and Krebs, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Steele et al., 2006</xref>). Nuts, in particular, are harvested from trees and cached in various places. For example, many temperate-zone squirrels hoard nuts under leaf litter, in holes in trees or logs or in the ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hadj-chikh et al., 1996</xref>). In subtropical zones, however, some species store nuts or mushrooms by hanging them on tree branches, a behavior thought to minimize fungal infection in humid environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lichti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>) or decrease the risk of loss through decomposition or germination under warmer temperatures in the cache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sechley et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The present work was prompted by our inadvertent discovery of <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic> nuts with strange surface grooves, and that were suspended in Y-shaped crotches of twigs on understory plants on Hainan Island, South China. <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic> trees are dominant fagaceous trees in these tropical forests; however, their fruits are elliptical or oblate single nuts with smooth surfaces, features that make them difficult to hang on vegetation. Firmly suspending such nuts in the vegetation presents an ecological challenge to squirrels in such environments. We asked whether some of the nine squirrel species identified from Hainan forests used special behaviors to prepare these nuts and fix them securely on vegetation.</p><p>In this paper, we show that the Indochinese Flying Squirrel, <italic>Hylopetes phayrei electilis</italic> (G. M. Allen, 1925), and the Particolored Flying Squirrel, <italic>H. alboniger</italic> (Hodgson, 1870), which co-occur in Hainan Island, cache these nuts individually between the twigs of small plants. Both of these small-bodied flying squirrels are widespread in the tropical forests in Southeast Asia, from Myanmar, south to northwestern Vietnam, and east into southern China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duckworth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duckworth et al., 2016</xref>). In China, <italic>H. phayrei electilis</italic> can be found in the mountainous areas of Hainan, Fujian, Guangxi, and Guizhou Provinces. <italic>H. alboniger</italic> is mainly found in the provinces of Hainan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi and, more rarely, in Zhejiang.</p><p>Although these squirrels are reasonably common, there is little published information about their habits, and there are no studies from Hainan Province in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, nut storage behavior hasn’t been reported from elsewhere in the ranges of either of these two squirrels. Thus, the preparation of nuts to connect them firmly to twigs is a new finding, although other squirrel species are known to handle nuts prior to suspending them to improve the success rate of storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fox, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Steele and Yi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we document in some detail the squirrel behaviors associated with this phenomenon in Hainan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We used images from infrared cameras to determine that the nocturnal flying squirrels, <italic>H. phayrei electilis</italic> and <italic>H. alboniger,</italic> two of the nine species of squirrels known from tropical forests of Hainan (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), stored <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic> nuts by suspending them on vegetation in the Jianfengling forest (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). The videos further showed that the squirrels chewed grooves in the surfaces of the nuts before fixing between the twigs, and that they sometimes altered the previously carved grooves by further chewing, apparently to adjust the fit and suspend the nut more firmly (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Videos 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">9</xref>). In footage from 32 field infrared cameras, we captured 48 film sequences that included chewing (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Videos 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">7</xref>), fixing (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>, partial evidence) and removing nuts (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>), or visiting a storage site (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>).

These grooves on oblate nuts varied considerably in pattern from symmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–i</xref>) to scattered.

Squirrels used the twigs as a convex ‘tenon’ to fit into the convex ‘mortise’ provided by the grooves on the nuts. Thus, carved nuts were inlayed between plant twigs (0.10–0.60 cm in diameter) intersecting at specific angles (25–40°) on various understory plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Thus, seed dispersal by these squirrels may decrease competition between seedlings and parent trees. This should increase seedling survival rates and could, in turn, truly decrease the negative density dependence of conspecific trees (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Detto et al., 2019</xref>). Unfortunately, we presently do not have sufficient data to estimate what proportion of the disappearance that we observed is the result of use by squirrels, although our video footage establishes that they do remove some nuts (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). Nonetheless, some proportion of nuts likely falls from storage sites and germinates nearby, as is common for seeds and nuts cached by squirrels, especially in hardwood forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Steele and Yi, 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>After long (e.g. &gt;ca. 365 days) storage, nuts become not fresh.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dried nuts, (<bold>B</bold>) Germinated, or (<bold>C–E</bold>) Destroyed by insects.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84967-fig11-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Only 63.6% of nuts that we discovered on understory plants were fresh at the time of the survey. Under natural conditions, these nuts on the ground would likely germinate in ca. two to three months after they had fallen to the ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhou, 2001</xref>). These stored nuts did not germinate during our 3.5 month investigation interval, which means that nuts can persist in these storage sites for longer periods than do nuts on the ground. Over the 44 days between the first and second surveys, 19.7% of the stored nuts had disappeared, and 15.0% of the nuts discovered during the second survey were new. Over the 61 days between the second and third surveys, 43.7% of the stored nuts had disappeared, and 20.6% of the nuts discovered were new. Thus, the numbers and composition of stored nuts in this forest are dynamic variables.</p><p>In general, the number of nuts being stored decreased gradually from January to May after the fruiting season, i.e., it decreased gradually through the dry season toward the rainy season. The high precipitation and humidity of the Jianfengling forest environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) likely favors the storage of nuts above the ground by reducing fungal infection or germination and may influence the timing of removal of stored nuts. In more temperate forests with lower annual precipitation nuts can be safely stored under dry leaf litter or in the ground without special processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hadj-chikh et al., 1996</xref>). Hence, the suspended storage that we observed appears to be an effective adaptation for safe storage, mainly during drier seasons to improve the food supply for the squirrels during the colder months at Jianfengling. However, field comparative data about the fates of seeds stored on or above are needed to properly evaluate this hypothesis.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that individuals of the flying squirrel species <italic>H. phayrei electilis</italic> and <italic>H. alboniger</italic> collect and cache nuts from or beneath two species of <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic> trees in the Jianfengling forest. Nuts were carried 10–25 m away from parental fruiting trees and processed for storage by chewing grooves into their surfaces before they were suspended on shrubs or small trees (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Videos 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">7</xref>). The pattern and depth of these grooves varied with the shape of nuts from these two <italic>Cyclobalanopsis</italic> trees so that they could be effectively fixed in the crotches of two twigs. Squirrels appear to check the strength of fixation, and sometimes iteratively modify the grooves to improve the attachment (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>) before a nut is finally removed from a storage site (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, individuals of these two squirrels store nuts of different shapes and sizes securely on a variety of plant twigs at some distance from the plants that produced the nuts. The behavior of these two squirrel species has evolved to prepare nuts for such storage by chewing surficial grooves on nuts to enable a ‘mortise-tenon’ connection between nuts and understory plant twigs. The significant efforts that we observed of squirrels testing and adjusting the fixation of nuts suggest that they employ active cognitive processes in storing these nuts.</p><p>Taken together, our observations suggest that effective food storage behavior is a significant aspect of the adaptation of these two flying squirrel species to life in the humid tropical rainforest. Nut caching behavior helps to secure food for the coolest month in these rainforests. We have not yet compared the fates of suspended nuts with those of the same species buried in the ground or leaf litter, but predict that suspended storage will be far superior. The caching behavior may further affect the dispersal of nuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang and Zhang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Xiao et al., 2004</xref>) in a way that alters the spatial and temporal distribution of the local plant community in the long run. Thus, this behavior could have a significant impact on the larger forest community. Although the importance of large DBH trees has been emphasized for the maintenance of forest ecosystem productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lutz et al., 2018</xref>); however, from a broader perspective that includes the understanding of squirrel caching behavior, small understory plants may help sustain the diversity and complexity of forest structure. The possibility that such plant-animal interactions affect tree populations and distributions deserves more attention in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goheen and Swihart, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rong et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Study site</title><p>This study was conducted in the Jianfengling region of the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park in Hainan Province, China (108°46'–109°45'E).

Thus, we conducted a systematic field investigation from January to May 2022 to discover the animals involved and to study their nut caching behavior in more detail.</p><p>We first made a systematic search of ca. 5.5 ha of forest for grooved nuts suspended in vegetation to seek relationships between this phenomenon and various plant types. We used plastic tags to mark all plants discovered bearing grooved nuts. The species identity, diameter at breast height (DBH), geographical position, and elevation of plants found with suspended grooved nuts were recorded. We also measured the diameter and angles of the two twigs where the nuts were fixed. Identities of trees with DBH ≥20 cm within a ca. 20 m radius of each stored nut were recorded. Finally, we measured the distance between the storage site and the nearest tree where the nuts could have been produced. Additionally, we recorded the species, weight, diameter, and height of each plant for all suspended nuts discovered. Number, depth, and position of the surface grooves were also noted for each nut. Because precise measurement was impossible, the depth of the carved grooves was measured as a categorical variable classified in the following three groups: shallow (ca. 0–0.15 mm), medium (ca. 0.15–0.30 mm), and deep (ca. 0.30–0.45 mm). We also recorded whether each nut was fresh, eaten by insects, or infected by fungi; fresh nuts are green but become wrinkled and black with age. All nuts were photographed at the time of discovery.</p><p>The first search for cached nuts was carried out on January 15, 2022. We re-surveyed the site 44 days later on February 28, using the same protocols described above, to learn whether the nuts recorded previously were still where we initially found them, and to find any new nuts that had been stored in the area. A third similar survey was made 61 days later on April 30.</p><p>Because we initially knew neither the identity of the animals that stored the nuts nor how nuts were stored and retrieved, we set up 32 motion-activated infrared cameras (22 WildINSights 20MP 1080 P HD Trail Cameras and 10 WildINSights 5MP 960 P HD Trail Color Cameras) around the stored nuts to monitor animal activities that might be related to nut storage or consumption. These cameras were positioned to view both typical nuts that we found and their surroundings. In general, the distance between a camera and a focal nut was 0.5–1 m.

When revising the article, please pay attention to the detailed comments raised in the three reports, which are appended below, but ensure you address the following three major concerns:</p><p>1) Since no squirrels were actually observed creating the grooves, the whole article needs to be refocused on the recovered artefacts and observed behaviours (caching etc.). This will require a new title and substantial text revision. It should be made clear throughout that the authors have no data at present to show that flying squirrels actually made those grooves (although we would welcome any new data to support this claim, such as incisor matching mentioned by Reviewer #2). Ideally, this would be added to a section titled &quot;Limitations of the study&quot;.</p><p>2) Related to the point above, all speculation about the evolution of this behaviour in flying squirrels and the potential underlying cognitive mechanisms should be removed from the article, since the data are simply too preliminary at present to address these points.</p><p>3) If possible, the authors should consider a more robust analysis of nut retention in the trees, with and without grooves, or a comparison of how nuts fare on the ground versus in the trees, to support their arguments (see also comments by Reviewer #3).</p><p>There is also scope for polishing the presentation, and we recommend a thorough language check.</p><p>Finally, please note that <italic>eLife</italic> has adopted the STRANGE framework, to help improve reporting standards and reproducibility in animal behaviour research.

At the moment this sentence is confusing because it seems like you are stating this is potentially tool use? It would be good to be more clear what you mean here and perhaps to also clearly state that this isn't tool use, but again to focus on or better explain what aspects of clever cognition this behaviour is evidence of.</p><p>line 168: why animal cranial zootomy?

Could you include in the text for example a clear explanation of why twig angles 25-40 degrees are most frequent for this behaviour?</p><p>Figure 4 caption: I think maybe missing some words between lines 403 and 404 or else not clear</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A bit more development of the evidence for cache loss through decomposition ('hoard rot' as it is sometimes referred) or germination and the environmental correlates of that would be helpful earlier on for the reader to understand the observations you present.</p><p>Overall the paper would benefit from some copy editing for clarity, as some sentences are a bit difficult to follow in their current form.</p><p>I have two concerns about attributing the caching to the squirrels that could be resolved by the following:</p><p>1. Direct observation of the squirrels performing this behavior.</p><p>2. Incisor matching – do the grooves carved out of the nuts match the width of the typical width of the two incisors of these species?</p><p>3. Consideration of the following: why would an arboreal species, such as a flying squirrel, cache nuts only on the lower branches of these plants, rather than higher up? That these behaviors only appear to be at eye-level to humans does make me question why squirrels would limit themselves to this height as well.</p><p>Line specific suggestions:</p><p>Line 25 – the use of 'evolutionary challenge' – I would argue it is more an ecological challenge.</p><p>Line 29 – specify what nation/region Hainan Island is in.</p><p>Line 33 – the mortise and tenon joint has a long history outside China as well; it may be more recognizable to readers to briefly articulate what the joint is used for/what it looks like rather than specify a nationality.</p><p>Line 52 – not clear what species of nuts are being discussed here, so the comment that they are in clusters doesn't immediately register. Clustering is perhaps a more species-specific phenomenon (most of the nuts I am familiar with in a temperate zone do not cluster), so this requires more explanation here.</p><p>Line 56 – again, not sure this is necessarily an evolutionary challenge but an ecological one.</p><p>Line 58 – Write out examples here. The Hunt et al. paper doesn't seem applicable here as it focuses on learning in locomotion, rather than cognitive food handling decisions. I would also avoid the use of the term 'smart' in discussing animal cognition; it is to me more of an anthropomorphic term and isn't necessary to describe the behaviour observed here, but I acknowledge this may be more of a personal preference.</p><p>Line 54 – 'most' nuts – would like to see some data to back this up, or at least examples of species that are commonly harvested by squirrels and therefore relevant here.</p><p>Line 59 – is there evidence that squirrels use tools elsewhere?</p><p>Line 68 – I would modify this – the behavior hasn't been reported elsewhere (have you checked databases of nature observations to be sure?)</p><p>Line 69 – Perhaps not to facilitate the physical lodging of a nut into a crevice, but other species of squirrels do indeed handle nuts prior to caching which improves the success rate of storage (see for example Fox 1982, Steele et al. 2001, Xiao et al. 2010).</p><p>Supplementary Figure 1 would be helpful to have in the main text.</p><p>Figure 1 – I think providing a visual comparison to the type of joint you are likening these carvings to would be helpful here, because these nut carvings appear quite different than what I would have expected given what my understanding of the mortise-tenon joint is.</p><p>Line 132 – what is the criterion for &quot;fresh&quot;? – OK, I see now in the methods further down.</p><p>Line 133 – how were nuts marked in the first survey to enable these conclusions?</p><p>Paragraph at Line 163 – this is very speculative; which given that this is more of a natural history observation, is fine, but it could be much more developed in order to put this study into context and to demonstrate its value. Evolution of learned behaviors that enhance survival and reproduction is a rich topic in animal behavior, and evolution of food caching behaviors in particular has received significant attention. Feeding innovations and their relation to behavioral evolution are important (as you note, tool use in corvids and parrots are excellent examples), and perhaps describing these observations against that background with citations to the literature would help make sense of this story.</p><p>Line 170 – This is late in the paper to introduce the fact that there are nine species in this region – this should be moved up.</p><p>Line 173 – have they evolved this behavior? Or is it learned or innovated? Evolution is a bold claim in the absence of familial data including fitness metrics and given how tightly clustered in time and space these observations are.</p><p>Line 180 – this is also a 'just-so' fallacy; you observed the persistence of these nuts over a very short time and did not present controls of what happens to these same species of nuts should they be stored on the ground or in the leaf litter. My experience in the tropical rain forest leads me to believe that this behavior is highly likely to have that effect of cache protection, but just because it makes logical sense does not make it data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors described and documented a nut-storing behaviour of two species of flying squirrels that is not previously mentioned in the literature. The authors found that the two species of flying squirrels made grooves in nuts so that they can be fixed between twigs of different species of plants and shrubs. The authors conclude that the squirrels of these populations are evolved or learn to do so, as well as placed such behaviour in tool-use context and claim that they are 'smart'.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed reading the manuscript, and knowing more about squirrels' behaviour. I also find the work is important, because there isn't proper documents stating this nut grooving behaviour in squirrels. This will spark an interest of understanding the causes and consequences of this nut grooving behaviour, which advances different fields such as animal behaviour and cognition, behaviour ecology, evolution and ecology.</p><p>Despite the strengths of the study, I do have several suggestions to improve the manuscript:</p><p>1) One of the goals of the study is to show that these squirrels are smart. Now I am not saying that they are not, but we need proper evidence, systematic investigations, and analyses to establish this claim. For now, these claims are not entirely supported by analyses or proper measurements; the definition of 'smart' and relating nut grooving behaviours to tool use is not complete. For example, no evidence indicating this behaviour involves complex cognition or cognitive process – smart, or it is related to fast learning performance – smart. All we know is the squirrels did it, but how they acquire such skills and whether it involves in complex or advance cognition is another story. With this in mind, many wordings appear to lead readers think that this is established, which is not the case.</p><p>2) Analyses – the current analyses basically is 0. Can't the authors pay a little more efforts in analyses, say using (M)ANOVA and post hoc tests to examine whether the number of as well as the depth of grooves differ in nuts that store on ground and (live and dead) trees? Or depending on the shape of a nut too? More importantly, out of how much footage did the authors capture the flying squirrels did the nut grooving behaviours? what other animal species interacted with those nuts? These are the central aims of the manuscript but are not done properly.</p><p>3) The current presentation of the manuscript is largely oriented to plants, and less about animal behaviour (definitely not involved in animal cognition). This appears to be a bit contradictory to what the authors would like to present or what they found interesting; that the grooving behaviour of seeds in flying squirrels is novel. Suggest thinking about how to reorganise this information and focus on animal behaviour</p><p>4) Figures – please present proportion or percentage on y axis, place the actual value on top of each bar in the bar graph; this will make information more presentable as well as increase the transparency of data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article entitled &quot;Flying squirrels use a mortise-tenon structure to fix nuts on understory twigs&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Christian Rutz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor (Ammie Kalan).</p><p>The article has been much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) We appreciated the addition of the new videos to demonstrate the squirrels' active interaction with the nuts, but could you please address Reviewer #3's alternative explanation directly in the text and provide any further clarification regarding the carving or cracking behaviour?</p><p>2) Similarly, please modify the text to be explicit about which parts of the behaviour you have direct video evidence for and which actions are inferred and, therefore, still require further supporting evidence. This will improve transparency and help readers evaluate your findings.</p><p>3) Please address the remaining comments from the reviewers below.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Thank you very much for inviting me to review this paper again. I also thank the authors for making a great effort to revise the paper, and most of my previous suggestions/concerns have been taken into the revision. The revised paper is still interesting as it documents the grooved nut in between twigs that may be made by this species of squirrel (a behaviour that is not fully understood).</p><p>In the past version of the manuscript, one of the main weaknesses of the paper was the absence of evidence showing squirrels made grooves and fixing them in between the twigs. In this version, the authors submitted three new videos (videos 6-8), and they are useful for seeing this species of squirrel handling a nut. However, videos 6 and 7 are showing a squirrel rolling a nut and attempting to 'carve' them and Video 8 is a squirrel finding a nut and attempting to take it out between the twigs. The terminology 'carving' is debatable, as to some squirrel experts, this appears to be 'cracking' the nut shell instead of 'carving'. None of these videos really shows direct evidence as in a squirrel grooving a nut and fixing it in between the twigs. If the authors insist that the squirrels do so (which from line 92 appears to be the case), we would need videos that show a squirrel making these grooves and fitting the nut in between twigs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84967.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers found this work interesting and novel, but agreed that the claims need to be significantly tempered given the data at hand.

Consideration of the following: why would an arboreal species, such as a flying squirrel, cache nuts only on the lower branches of these plants, rather than higher up?

The Hunt et al. paper doesn't seem applicable here as it focuses on learning in locomotion, rather than cognitive food handling decisions.

Evolution of learned behaviors that enhance survival and reproduction is a rich topic in animal behavior, and evolution of food caching behaviors in particular has received significant attention. Feeding innovations and their relation to behavioral evolution are important (as you note, tool use in corvids and parrots are excellent examples), and perhaps describing these observations against that background with citations to the literature would help make sense of this story.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the whole paragraph for the speculative contents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 170 – This is late in the paper to introduce the fact that there are nine species in this region – this should be moved up.</p></disp-quote><p>Moved up as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 173 – have they evolved this behavior?

The authors found that the two species of flying squirrels made grooves in nuts so that they can be fixed between twigs of different species of plants and shrubs. The authors conclude that the squirrels of these populations are evolved or learn to do so, as well as placed such behaviour in tool-use context and claim that they are 'smart'.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed reading the manuscript, and knowing more about squirrels' behaviour. I also find the work is important, because there isn't proper documents stating this nut grooving behaviour in squirrels. This will spark an interest of understanding the causes and consequences of this nut grooving behaviour, which advances different fields such as animal behaviour and cognition, behaviour ecology, evolution and ecology.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite the strengths of the study, I do have several suggestions to improve the manuscript:</p><p>1) One of the goals of the study is to show that these squirrels are smart. Now I am not saying that they are not, but we need proper evidence, systematic investigations, and analyses to establish this claim. For now, these claims are not entirely supported by analyses or proper measurements; the definition of 'smart' and relating nut grooving behaviours to tool use is not complete. For example, no evidence indicating this behaviour involves complex cognition or cognitive process – smart, or it is related to fast learning performance – smart. All we know is the squirrels did it, but how they acquire such skills and whether it involves in complex or advance cognition is another story. With this in mind, many wordings appear to lead readers think that this is established, which is not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, you are right. Our surprise and enthusiasm about discovering that these squirrels do this have likely pushed us to assume too much. Thus, we have revised the text and title to focus on the behaviors of grooving and storing nuts, and to downplay conclusions relating to cognitive or cognitive process. Once we have more evidence to show how squirrels develop such skills, and whether the behaviour involves complex or advance cognition, or fast learning performance, we will write another story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Analyses – the current analyses basically is 0. Can't the authors pay a little more efforts in analyses, say using (M)ANOVA and post hoc tests to examine whether the number of as well as the depth of grooves differ in nuts that store on ground and (live and dead) trees? Or depending on the shape of a nut too? More importantly, out of how much footage did the authors capture the flying squirrels did the nut grooving behaviours? what other animal species interacted with those nuts? These are the central aims of the manuscript but are not done properly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added detailed descriptions about how histograms and t-tests were applied.</p><p>A total of 47 footage clips capture flying squirrels, as is now mentioned in the first paragraph of results and discussion.</p><p>Interestingly, other larger-bodied squirrels passed by some plants with a stored nut, but they did not touch the nuts. Some mice were observed trying to take stored nuts, as is now mentioned in the text. L152.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The current presentation of the manuscript is largely oriented to plants, and less about animal behaviour (definitely not involved in animal cognition). This appears to be a bit contradictory to what the authors would like to present or what they found interesting; that the grooving behaviour of seeds in flying squirrels is novel. Suggest thinking about how to reorganise this information and focus on animal behaviour</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased the text to amplify the new finding of the grooving behaviors, which has been previously unrecognized in squirrels. We have revised the text to focus on the special behavior and how it changes nuts themselves, but also describe the vegetation sites associated with the suspended nuts that we discovered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figures – please present proportion or percentage on y axis, place the actual value on top of each bar in the bar graph; this will make information more presentable as well as increase the transparency of data.</p></disp-quote><p>All figures are revised as suggested.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The article has been much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) We appreciated the addition of the new videos to demonstrate the squirrels' active interaction with the nuts, but could you please address Reviewer #3's alternative explanation directly in the text and provide any further clarification regarding the carving or cracking behaviour?</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added one new Video 9 that provides direct evidence and example of the process used by squirrels for fixing nuts. The video documents the behaviour of a squirrel that was holding a nut in its mouth and engaged in the process.</p><p>I think that the word ‘cracking’ does not appropriately express what was done by squirrels. We feel that use of the word ‘cracked’ would be misleading as the grooves are strictly surficial. This seems to be important as we point out below (Lines 128-130) “Nonetheless, none of the chewed grooves that we observed damaged the endosperm of the nut, and thus the squirrels seemed to minimize the potential impacts of fungi during storage.” The grooves, in our opinions are in fact “carved” carefully into the surface without breaking through to the inside of the nut. Thus, we have followed our antecedent expression of “chewing” in lines 85-88, taking the opportunity to establish that we infer that the chewing leads to “carved” surficial grooves. Clearly, when one refers to “cracking” nuts, say during the holiday season, it means to break the outside casing of the nut in order to get to the inside of the nut. Thus, we fear the use of “cracking” could be easily misleading. In an attempt to avoid any confusion, we have replaced “carving” with “chewing” until our word use had been clearly defined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, please modify the text to be explicit about which parts of the behaviour you have direct video evidence for and which actions are inferred and, therefore, still require further supporting evidence. This will improve transparency and help readers evaluate your findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We added vdeo number after each action to refer the readers to direct video evidence for our claims in Line 88-90. These actions include chewing to carve grooves (Video 6-7), as well as fixing (Video 9) and removing nuts (Video 2, 3, 5) and visiting a storage site (Video 1, 4, 8). The sentence was also revised to clearly state that the videos provide direct evidence to support aspects of nut storage behaviour employed by these two squirrel species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Thank you very much for inviting me to review this paper again. I also thank the authors for making a great effort to revise the paper, and most of my previous suggestions/concerns have been taken into the revision. The revised paper is still interesting as it documents the grooved nut in between twigs that may be made by this species of squirrel (a behaviour that is not fully understood).</p><p>In the past version of the manuscript, one of the main weaknesses of the paper was the absence of evidence showing squirrels made grooves and fixing them in between the twigs. In this version, the authors submitted three new videos (videos 6-8), and they are useful for seeing this species of squirrel handling a nut. However, videos 6 and 7 are showing a squirrel rolling a nut and attempting to 'carve' them and Video 8 is a squirrel finding a nut and attempting to take it out between the twigs. The terminology 'carving' is debatable, as to some squirrel experts, this appears to be 'cracking' the nut shell instead of 'carving'. None of these videos really shows direct evidence as in a squirrel grooving a nut and fixing it in between the twigs. If the authors insist that the squirrels do so (which from line 92 appears to be the case), we would need videos that show a squirrel making these grooves and fitting the nut in between twigs.</p></disp-quote><p>As above, we’ve added a new Video 9 that provides direct evidence of the process that squirrels use to fix the nuts.</p><p>After carefully considering the differences between these two words, “carving” has been mostly replaced by “chewing” throughout the paper. See above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
