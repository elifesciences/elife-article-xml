Here, we demonstrate the critical role of osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels in anabolic function of bone in response to mechanical loading. Two transgenic mouse models, R76W and Δ130–136, expressing dominant-negative Cx43 mutants in osteocytes were adopted. Mechanical loading of tibial bone increased cortical bone mass and mechanical properties in wild-type and gap junction-impaired R76W mice through increased PGE<sub>2</sub>, endosteal osteoblast activity, and decreased sclerostin. These anabolic responses were impeded in gap junction/hemichannel-impaired Δ130–136 mice and accompanied by increased endosteal osteoclast activity. Specific inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels by Cx43(M1) antibody suppressed PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion and impeded loading-induced endosteal osteoblast activity, bone formation and anabolic gene expression. PGE<sub>2</sub> administration rescued the osteogenic response to mechanical loading impeded by impaired hemichannels. Together, osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels could be a potential new therapeutic target for treating bone loss and osteoporosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>connexins</kwd><kwd>osteocyte</kwd><kwd>mechanical loading</kwd><kwd>hemichannel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR072020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AQ-1507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Connexin 43 hemichannel activation associated with prostaglandin release in osteocytes plays an important role in anabolic function of mechanical loading on bone tissue and hemichannels could be a potential new therapeutic target for treating bone loss and osteoporosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone as a mechanosensitive tissue is adaptive to mechanical stimuli, which are essential for bone homeostasis, formation, and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonewald, 2011</xref>). Reduced mechanical stimulation leads to bone loss and elevated risk of fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lang et al., 2004</xref>), while enhanced mechanical stimulation, such as physical exercise, has positive, anabolic impacts on bone tissue, even following a prolonged cessation of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erlandson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Warden et al., 2007</xref>). The osteocytes embedded in the bone mineral matrix comprise over 90–95% of all bone cells and are thought to be a major mechanoreceptor in the adult skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonewald, 2011</xref>). Osteocytes detect the mechanical loading-induced alterations of the bone matrix microenvironment and translate them into biological responses to regulate osteoblast and osteoclast activity on the bone surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonewald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stenson et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Connexin (Cx)-forming gap junctions and hemichannels permit small molecules (≤ 1 kDa) to pass through the cellular membrane, such as prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loiselle et al., 2013</xref>). Among Cx family members, Cx43 is the predominant Cx subtype expressed in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Civitelli, 2008</xref>). Cx43 gap junctions allow cell-cell communication between osteocytes or between osteocytes and other bone cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishihara et al., 2008</xref>), and mechanical stimuli increase communication between two adjacent cells through gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alford et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2001b</xref>). However, osteocytic Cx43 gap junctions are only active at the tips of osteocyte dendritic processes and remain open even without mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cusato et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, Cx43 hemichannels, which mediate the communication between the intracellular and the extracellular microenvironment, are highly responsive to mechanical stimulation in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang and Cherian, 2003</xref>). Our previous studies have shown that in vitro mechanical stimulation, through fluid flow shear stress (FFSS), increases cell surface expression of Cx43 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang and Cherian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siller-Jackson et al., 2008</xref>), and opens Cx43 hemichannels, leading to the release of anabolic factor, PGE<sub>2</sub> in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siller-Jackson et al., 2008</xref>). Activation of integrins and PI3K-Akt signaling by FFSS plays an essential role in activating Cx43 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batra et al., 2014</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> released by Cx43 hemichannels acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner to promote gap junction communication through transcriptional regulation of Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xia et al., 2010</xref>) and blocks glucocorticoid-induced osteocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kitase et al., 2010</xref>). The opening of Cx43 hemichannels by FFSS also triggers the release of ATP by a protein kinase C-mediated pathway in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Genetos et al., 2007</xref>). Extracellular PGE<sub>2</sub> accumulation caused by continuous FFSS exerts a negative feedback, leading to hemichannel closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riquelme et al., 2015</xref>). However, the biological role of osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels in the anabolic function of mechanical loading has remained largely elusive.</p><p>Several bone cell-type-specific Cx43 conditional knockout (cKO) mouse models have been reported. Deletion of Cx43 from osteoblasts and osteocytes driven by the 2.3 kb <italic>Col1α1</italic> promoter (<italic>Col1α1-Cre; Gja1</italic><sup>–/flx</sup>) attenuated tibial endosteal response to non-physiological mechanical loading, induced by four-point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grimston et al., 2006</xref>) or three-point tibial bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimston et al., 2008</xref>). However, deletion of Cx43 in osteochondroprogenitors driven by the <italic>Twist2</italic> promoter (<italic>Twist2-cre; Gja1<sup>–/flx</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimston et al., 2012</xref>) or in osteoblasts/osteocytes driven by the <italic>Bglap2</italic> promoter (<italic>Bglap2-Cre; Gja1<sup>flx/flx</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) showed an enhanced tibial periosteal response to tibial axial compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimston et al., 2012</xref>) or tibial cantilever bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, deletion of Cx43 in osteocytes driven by an 8 kb dentin matrix protein 1 (<italic>Dmp1</italic>) promoter (<italic>Dmp1-Cre; Gja1<sup>flx/flx</sup></italic>) showed enhanced β-catenin levels and correspondingly increased periosteal response to ulna compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bivi et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, endosteal bone formation decreased more in <italic>Twist2-Cre; Gja1<sup>–/flx</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimston et al., 2012</xref>), but did not change in <italic>Dmp1-Cre; Gja1<sup>flx/flx</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bivi et al., 2013</xref>) during mechanical loading. Together, these findings suggest that Cx43 plays a distinct role in the adaptive response to bone loading. However, since Cx43 forms both gap junctions and hemichannels, it has remained largely elusive whether the responses in knockout models could be attributed to either or both types of Cx43-forming channels. Here, we dissect the distinctive roles of Cx43 gap junctions and hemichannels using two transgenic mouse models that overexpress dominant-negative Cx43 mutants primarily in osteocytes with the 10 kb <italic>Dmp1</italic> promoter. The R76W transgenic mouse inhibits gap junctions with enhanced hemichannel function, whereas Δ130–136 inhibits both gap junctions and hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). To further delineate the role of osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels under mechanical loading in vivo, a monoclonal Cx43(M1) antibody that specifically blocks Cx43 hemichannels was developed. In this study, we unveil a novel physiological role of Cx43 hemichannels in osteocytes and their release of PGE<sub>2</sub> in mediating anabolic function of the bone in response to mechanical loading.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impairment of Cx43 hemichannels attenuate anabolic responses of tibial bone to mechanical loading</title><p>In this study, we used two transgenic mouse models to distinguish the roles of osteocytic Cx43-gap junction channels and hemichannels in osteocytes in bone response to mechanical loading. We injected EB dye into mouse tail veins to determine the activity of Cx43 hemichannels in WT and transgenic mice in response to axial tibial loading. Bone tissue sections around the tibial midshaft region showed that tibial loading increased EB dye uptake in the osteocytes of WT and R76W mice, but not in the osteocytes of Δ130–136 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>).</p><p>We subjected WT and transgenic mice with similar body weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>) to a 2-week cyclic tibial loading regime. μCT analyses of tibial metaphyseal trabecular bone showed that loading increased bone volume fractions (BV/TV) in WT and R76W mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast, compared to contralateral, unloaded controls, tibial loading of Δ130–136 mice exhibited a significant reduction of trabecular number (Tb.N) and bone mineral density (BMD), as well as increased trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) during mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b, c and e</xref>). However, compared to contralateral, unloaded tibias, trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) was increased in loaded tibias of WT and two transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). There was no change of structural model index (SMI), indicating that loading did not affect the shape of trabecular bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).

However, loading had minimal effect on PGE<sub>2</sub> levels in Δ130–136 mice.

However, the increase of COX-2 in loaded tibias was not observed in Δ130–136 mice.

We recently developed a specific mouse monoclonal blocking antibody Cx43(M1) to investigate the roles of mouse hemichannels in vivo. Similar to Cx43(E2), Cx43(M1) had a strong reactivity with Cx43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Gap junction channels and hemichannels were assayed using dye coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and dye uptake assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>), respectively. Both Cx43(E2) and Cx43(M1) had minimal effects on gap junction channels as indicated by comparable levels of dye transfer with red-orange AM dye in MLO-Y4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

The extent of inhibition is comparable between Cx43(E2) and Cx43(M1) antibodies. To ensure antibody delivery to osteocytes, we labeled tibial bone sections with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Strong antibody signals were primarily detected in osteocytes in cortical bone for Cx43(M1)-injected mice, but not in IgG-injected ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

Moreover, administration of PGE<sub>2</sub>, a factor released by Cx43 hemichannels in response to mechanical stimulation, rescued the impeded anabolic effects on cortical bone by tibial loading because of impaired hemichannels.</p><p>We determined bone structural and biomechanical properties, new bone formation, and metabolism using an established bone mechanical loading model, axial tibial compression, in WT and two transgenic mouse models expressing Cx43 dominant negative mutants R76W and Δ130–136 in osteocytes. We observed that unlike WT and R76W mice, Δ130–136 mice, with inhibited osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels, attenuated anabolic bone responses to mechanical loading in both trabecular and cortical bones. In cortical bones of WT and R76W mice, the bone formation in both periosteal and endosteal surface were increased by tibial loading and this increase is correlated with the increase of bone area fractions and cortical thickness. In Δ 130–136 mice, only bone formation on the periosteal surface increased, but not on the endosteal surface. In addition, we observed the increased osteoclast number in endosteal surface. The net effect in Δ 130–136 is a decreased bone area fraction, cortical thickness and an enlarged bone marrow area. Due to impaired osteocytic gap junction channels and hemichannels in Δ130–136 mice, but only impaired gap junction channels in R76W mice, we postulated that osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels, not gap junctions in osteocytes, are likely to play a predominant role in anabolic bone response to mechanical loading.</p><p>The role of Cx43 hemichannels was further validated by the Cx43(M1) antibody, a potent monoclonal antibody that effectively inhibits osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels both in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, treatment with Cx43(M1) only twice in a span of 2 weeks significantly attenuated anabolic effects to mechanical loading, with greater effects in cortical bones. Interestingly, Cx43(M1) treatment not only attenuated, but even reversed anabolic effects in cortical bone, similar to Δ130–136 mice. A similar impediment of the rate of bone formation and mineral apposition to tibial loading was observed on the endosteal surface with Cx43(M1) treatment. Previous studies have shown that cortical bone modeling/remodeling is more pronounced at the endosteal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birkhold et al., 2017</xref>), and mature bones respond to mechanical loading through changes on endosteal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass et al., 2002</xref>). Similar findings were also noted in Cx43 cKO mouse models; mice lacking Cx43 in osteoblasts and osteocytes showed an attenuated increase in endosteal bone formation during four-point or three-point tibial bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grimston et al., 2006</xref>). Mice lacking Cx43 in osteochondroprogenitors showed a greater extent of decrease in endosteal formation during tibial compression loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimston et al., 2012</xref>). In our study, notably, endosteal MAR and BFR/BS were not responsive to tibial loading in Δ130–136 mice and the Cx43(M1) group, suggesting not only increased osteoblastic activity, but also that increased osteoblast number was impeded by the impairment of Cx43 hemichannels. Moreover, histomorphometric analysis further confirmed a lack of response in osteoblast number and marker genes in Δ130–136 mice and Cx43(M1)-treated mice. The difference between Cx43 cKO and our transgenic models and Cx43(M1) treatment could be caused by aberrant, compensatory effect of other pathways as a result of Cx43 deletion. Thus, our results suggest that axial compression loading promotes osteoblast recruitment and differentiation on the endosteal surface, an anabolic effect likely mediated by mechanosensitive Cx43 hemichannels.</p><p>Interestingly, contrary to our hypothesis, axial load increased periosteal bone formation and total tissue area on the tibial midshaft in Δ130–136 mice. This observation was also reported in cKO mouse models with Cx43 deletion in osteoblasts and osteocytes under tibial axial compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimston et al., 2012</xref>) and tibial cantilever bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, deletion of Cx43 in osteocytes also showed an enhanced periosteal response to ulnar compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bivi et al., 2013</xref>). The enhanced periosteal bone formation was further observed when hemichannels were inhibited by Cx43(M1). These results posit the role of Cx43 hemichannels in periosteal bone formation during mechanical loading. Our previous study showed that Δ130–136 mice have more periosteal bone apposition than WT and R76W mice, suggesting that periosteal osteoblasts in Δ130–136 mice are more active and sensitive than WT and R76W mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels exert differential roles in controlling osteogenic osteoblastic activities on periosteal and bone resorping osteoclastic activity on endosteal surfaces, respectively. The consequence of the disruption of coordinated activities by hemichannel inhibition results in an enlarged bone marrow cavity. This is likely an adaptive response due to compromised cortical bones resulting from impaired hemichannels and consequently lower extracellular PGE<sub>2</sub>. From a mechanical point of view, increased bone marrow area and cortical bone size allow the bone to respond to high stress levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharir et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the role of osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels in regulating the osteogenic response on endosteal surfaces is distinct from its role on periosteal surfaces.</p><p>Besides cortical bone, the anabolic response of trabecular bone to tibial loading in Δ130–136 mice was also attenuated or even reversed, as observed in trabecular number, separation and bone density. However, the compromised response of trabecular bone to mechanical loading was less evident in Cx43(M1) treated mice, except for trabecular number and trabecular separation. One possible explanation is that the accessibility and binding of the antibody to osteocytes in trabecular bone may not be as efficient as in cortical bone. Indeed, we could clearly detect Cx43(M1) on the surface of osteocytes in cortical bone. However, the binding in trabecular bone is much weaker than that in cortical bone. Since Haversian canals containing blood vessels provide supply to the osteocytes in cortical, but not in trabecular bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dahl and Thompson, 2011</xref>), it is plausible that the delivery of Cx43(M1) to the bone is mediated primarily by the Haversian canal system.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that in vitro Cx43 hemichannel opening induced by FFSS mediates the release of PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherian et al., 2005</xref>), a critical factor for anabolic function of bone in response to mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jee et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thorsen et al., 1996</xref>). On the contrary, PGE<sub>2</sub> release by FFSS is inhibited by a potent hemichannel-blocking rabbit polyclonal antibody Cx43(E2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siller-Jackson et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, we have shown that the inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels does not affect intracellular PGE<sub>2</sub> level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siller-Jackson et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting the reduced PGE<sub>2</sub> biosynthesis by COX-2 since COX-2 is the enzyme subtype responding to mechanical loading. Here, we found that PGE<sub>2</sub> levels and osteocytic COX-2 expression were increased by tibial loading in WT and R76W mice, but such an increase was not detected in Δ130–136 mice. The use of hemichannel-blocking monoclonal Cx43(M1) antibody further confirmed the role of the hemichannels in the release of PGE<sub>2</sub> in bone in situ. In accordance with our observation, the reduced release of PGE<sub>2</sub> was reported in calvarial cells isolated from Cx43 cKO mice driven by the 2.3 kb <italic>Col1α1</italic> promoter promoter after mechanical stretching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grimston et al., 2006</xref>). The increase in <italic>Cox-2</italic> gene expression in Cx43 cKO mice driven by the 8 kb <italic>Dmp1</italic> promoter is attenuated after axial tibial compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimston et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to the regulation of PGE<sub>2</sub> release and COX-2 expression by Cx43 hemichannels, we and others have shown that PGE<sub>2</sub> can increase Cx43 expression and gap junction communication in cultured osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Civitelli et al., 1998</xref>) and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2001a</xref>), but has no effect in oral-derived human osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, increasing Cx43 expression enhances PGE<sub>2</sub>-dependent β-catenin signaling activation in osteoblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>). Cx43 overexpression in rabbit and human synovial fibroblast cell lines increased PTGS2 gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, increased extracellular PGE<sub>2</sub> could serve as a feedback inhibitor that activates MAPK, phosphorylates Cx43 and closes Cx43 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riquelme et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We showed that inhibited release of PGE<sub>2</sub> in Δ130–136 mice and in the Cx43 (M1) group was accompanied by an attenuated endosteal bone response to mechanical loading. Moreover, PGE<sub>2</sub> injection rescued the anabolic responses of cortical bone to mechanical loading impeded by Cx43(M1), including the ratio of bone area to tissue area, cortical thickness, and bone marrow area. However, the rescue of attenuated responses in cortical bone by PGE<sub>2</sub> was not shown in trabecular bone. A recent paper has also shown more beneficial osteogenic responses of combined treatment of PTH(1-34) and mechanical loading to cortical bone than trabecular bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roberts et al., 2020</xref>). One of the possibilities could be related to the higher strain levels experienced by cortical bone compared to trabecular bone.</p><p>PGE<sub>2</sub> is a skeletal anabolic factor, and its synthesis and release are highly responsive to mechanical stimulation in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang and Cherian, 2003</xref>). Using the microdialysis technique, a rapid and significant increase of PGE<sub>2</sub> levels in the proximal tibial metaphysis was observed in response to dynamic mechanical loading in healthy women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thorsen et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, intermittent PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment increases endosteal bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jee et al., 1985</xref>) and bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian et al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, inhibition of PGE<sub>2</sub> by a COX-2 inhibitor blocks endosteal tibial bone formation induced by mechanical loading in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forwood, 1996</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that PGE<sub>2</sub> is indeed involved in the anabolic action of hemichannels in response to mechanical loading. Interestingly, PGE<sub>2</sub> administration did not provide an additional increase in the cortical bone of mice in loaded vehicle control group. It is likely that extracellular PGE<sub>2</sub> released by osteocytes by normal exercise (mechanical loading) is sufficient to promote bone formation and additional extracellular PGE<sub>2</sub> would not further increase cortical bone mass.</p><p>Increased PGE<sub>2</sub> by mechanical stimuli is reported to bind to EP4 receptor and reduce SOST expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galea et al., 2011</xref>). SOST, a Wnt signaling antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semënov et al., 2005</xref>), is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in bone. SOST, secreted primarily by osteocytes, acts upon osteoblasts in a paracrine manner to inhibit bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poole et al., 2005</xref>) through its binding to the Wnt co-receptor Lrp5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2005</xref>) and suppressing β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sawakami et al., 2006</xref>). SOST gene and protein expression is suppressed by mechanical loading, and is accompanied by increased bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moustafa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robling et al., 2008</xref>). We observed suppressed SOST expression in WT and R76W mice by tibial loading; however, the suppressive effect of SOST disappeared in ∆130–136 mice and the Cx43(M1)-treated mice. Correspondingly, the increased β-catenin expression and osteoblast activity observed in WT and R76W mice was abated in ∆130–136 and the Cx43(M1) mice. These results indicate that PGE<sub>2</sub> released by Cx43 hemichannels in osteocytes is a likely factor that participates in the bone anabolic response to mechanical stimuli. We previously showed that PGE<sub>2</sub> released from osteocytes via Cx43 hemichannels exerts autocrine effects via the EP2/4 receptor during mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xia et al., 2010</xref>). This study indicates that the increased β-catenin in osteoblasts by tibial loading is attenuated in ∆130–136 and the Cx43(M1)-treated mice. These results establish a close functional relationship between Cx43 hemichannel-released PGE<sub>2</sub> and decreased SOST, and thereby increased β-catenin expression in osteoblasts, ultimately leading to enhanced osteoblast activity and endosteal bone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h</xref>).</p><p>There are possible limitations in this study. First, analysis of cortical bone changes at additional proximal or distal sites may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of Cx43 hemichannels in anabolic responses to mechanical loading, although a previous study has reported that cortical bone located at 25%, 37%, and 50% of the tibia’s length had similar responses to tibial loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Second, the monoclonal Cx43(M1) antibody blocks hemichannels not only in osteocytes, but also, possibly other cells, such as osteoblasts. However, in our study, Cx43(M1) was primarily detected in osteocytes, not in osteoblasts or other bone cells.</p><p>In summary, this study, for the first time, unveils the crucial role of osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels in mediating the anabolic function of mechanical loading on endosteal bone surfaces and trabecular bone. Cx43 hemichannels activated by mechanical stimulation release PGE<sub>2</sub> from osteocytes, which suppresses SOST expression in osteocytes, and enhances osteoblast activity and bone formation on endosteal surfaces. These results suggest that osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels could be established as a de novo new therapeutic target, and activation of these channels may potentially aid in treating bone loss, in particular, in the elder population with the lost sensitivity to anabolic responses to mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lanyon and Skerry, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse models</title><p>Two transgenic models expressing dominant-negative mutants of Cx43 in osteocytes, R76W and Δ130–136, were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).

The upper padded cup containing the knee was connected to the loading device (7528–10, Masterflex L/S, Vernon Hills, IL, USA), and the lower cup held the heel. The left tibia was held in place by a 0.5 N continuous static preload, loaded for 600 cycles (5 min) at 2 Hz frequency, with a sinusoidal waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Compressive load was performed 5 days/week for 2 weeks to determine bone structural and anabolic response, or 5 consecutive days to assess PGE<sub>2</sub> level. Based on the load-strain relationship, peak force was selected to generate peak periosteal strains of 1200 με at the cortical midshaft for WT, R76W, and ∆130–136 mice, respectively. This strain level has been previously shown to elicit an anabolic response at this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Melville et al., 2015</xref>). The right tibia was used as a contralateral, non-loaded control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>M1 antibody generation and treatment</title><p>A monoclonal Cx43(M1) antibody targeting the second extracellular loop domains of Cx43 was originally generated by Abmart (Tulsa, OK, USA) and described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, mice were immunized with a Cx43 extracellular domain peptide, and after functional characterization of the hybridoma clones, genes that encode the antibody heavy and light chain variable region were cloned from the mouse hybridoma cell line HC1 by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), using a combination of a group of cloning PCR primers. The heavy and light chain constructs were co-transfected into human embryonic kidney freestyle 293 (HEK293F) cells, supernatants were harvested, and antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using protein A resin.</p><p>The day before tibial loading, randomly allocated WT mice based on the body weight were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with 25 mg/kg Cx43(M1) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4). A second dose was administered the day before the start of loading in the 2nd week. The dosage of antibody was based on our data with Cx43(M1) antibody (<bold>Figure S5</bold>) and a previous study using an anti-sclerostin (SOST) antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spatz et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell lines</title><p>The osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cell line was originally obtained from Dr. Lynda Bonewald at Indiana University. We maintain this cell line strictly with proper culture condition, collagen coating and cell density (70–80% confluence for cell passage). We routinely conduct quality control of this cell line including testing for mycoplasma contamination and examining cell morphology with dendritic processes and maker protein expression, low amount of alkaline phosphates and high amount of osteocalcin, Cx43 and CD44. We are ensured to use the cell with these characteristics for all the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vitro dye uptake and Gap junction coupling assays</title><p>MLO-Y4 cells were cultured in a-modified essential medium (a-MEM) with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2.5% calf serum (CS) in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C. MLO-Y4 cells were grown at a low initial cell density on glass slides coated with type I collagen (rat tail collagen type I, Corning, Bedford, MA, USA, 0.15 mg/ml) to ensure that most of the cells were not physically in contact. The cells were preincubated with Cx43(E2) or Cx43(M1) (2 μg/ml) for 30 min and then subjected to FFSS at four dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> for 15 min in the presence of 25 mM ethidium bromide (EtBr) in the recording media (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>-free a-MEM medium buffered with 10 mM HEPES). These cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min. The intensity of EtBr fluorescence in cells was measured and quantified by NIH Image J software (NIH, USA). Primary osteocytes were microinjected using an Eppendorf micromanipulator InjectManNI two and Femtojet (Eppendorf) at 37 °C with 10 mM Oregon green 488 BAPTA-AM (Mr: 1751 Da) as a cell tracker probe, and calcein red-orange AM (Mr: 789 Da) as a probe for detecting gap junction coupling. Images were captured using an inverted microscope equipped with a Lambda DG4 device (Sutter Instrument Co, Novato, CA, USA), a mercury arc lamp illumination, and a Nikon Eclipse microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) using a rhodamine filter. Loaded cells (dye donor) were ‘parachuted’ over acceptor cells. The cells (acceptors and donors) were pre-incubated for 20 min with Cx43 antibodies before the parachuting assay. Donor cells were then incubated with acceptor cells for 90 min, the time duration sufficient to detect dye transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo dye uptake assay</title><p>We developed an approach to assess hemichannel activity in osteocytes in the bone in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riquelme et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, 20 mg/ml Evans blue (EB) dye dissolved in sterile saline solution (previously used to study hemichannel activity in muscle cells in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cea et al., 2013</xref>) was injected into the mouse tail vein. For the vehicle or Cx43(M1) treated group, mice were IP injected with mouse IgG or Cx43 (M1) (25 mg/kg) 4 hr before dye injection. After the dye injection, mice were kept in cages for 20 min, and the left tibias were then loaded for 10 min. Mice were sacrificed and perfused with PBS and 4% PFA 40 min after tibial loading. Tibias were isolated and fixed in 4% PFA for 2 days, decalcified in 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 3 weeks, and then 12-μm-thick frozen sections were prepared. The cell nuclei were stained with 4’,6-diami-dino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were captured using an optical microscope (BZ-X710, KEYENCE, Itasca, IL, USA) and EB fluorescence intensity in osteocytes was quantified by NIH Image J software (NIH, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>PGE<sub>2</sub> measurement and treatment</title><p>The level of PGE<sub>2</sub> in the tibia bone was determined according to the manufacturer’s protocol (PGE<sub>2</sub> ELISA kit, #514010, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Briefly, 4 hr after the final round of five-day tibial loading, bone marrow-flushed tibias were isolated free of soft tissues, and bone shafts were prepared by removing proximal and distal ends of the bone. Bone tissue was homogenized in liquid nitrogen with a frozen mortar and pestle. The concentration of PGE<sub>2</sub> was normalized by total protein concentration using a BCA assay (#23225, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).</p><p>PGE<sub>2</sub> powder (#2296, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) was dissolved in 10% ethanol and stock prepared at the concentration of 0.15 mg/ml. During the two-week cyclic tibial loading (5 days/week), wild-type mice randomly allocated based on the body weight were injected with 1 mg/kg/day of PGE<sub>2</sub> solution or 6.7 μl/kg/day 10% ethanol (vehicle) at a fixed time everyday.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Micro-computed tomography</title><p>Tibias were dissected and frozen in saline-soaked gauze at –20 °C until scanning. Samples in PBS were imaged using a high-resolution micro-computed tomography (μCT) scanner (1172, SkyScan, Brüker microCT, Kontich, Belgium) with the following settings: 59 Kvp, 167 µA beam intensity, 0.5 mm aluminum filter, 800ms exposure, 1024 × 1024 pixel matrix, and a 10 µm isotropic voxel dimension. The background noise was removed from the images by eliminating disconnected objects smaller than four pixels in size. Two bone volumes of interest (VOI) were selected in the metaphyseal and midshaft regions. The analyses were conducted excluding the fibula. In the proximal tibial metaphysis, the trabecular bone VOI was positioned 0.44 mm distal to the proximal growth plate and extended 0.65 mm in the distal direction, excluding the primary spongiosa. Grayscale values of 80–256 were set as the threshold for trabecular bone. For the cortical region, a 0.3 mm distance was centered at 50% tibial length (proximal to distal). Automated contouring was used to select the cortex. A threshold of 106–256 was applied to all of the cortical slices for analysis. The structural morphometric properties of cortical and trabecular regions were analyzed using the CT Analyser software (CTAn 1.18.8.0, Bruker Skyscan).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mechanical testing</title><p>Three-point bending tests were performed after μCT scanning. The tibia was thawed to room temperature before testing. Any remaining muscles and the fibula were carefully removed. The tibia was subjected to a three-point bending test along the medial-lateral direction in a micromechanical testing system (Mach-1 V500CST, Biomomentum, Laval, Canada). The span distance for the three-point bending test was 8 mm, and the loading pin was placed at the midpoint of the span. The test was performed in a displacement control mode at a constant rate of 0.01 mm/s, and the data was collected at a 200 Hz sampling rate for all measurements. The accurate cross-sectional areas were determined from μCT and used to calculate mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jepsen et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry, and dynamic bone histomorphometry</title><p>Tibias were collected and fixed in 4% PFA for 2 days and decalcified using 10% EDTA (pH 7.5) for 21 days. These tibial samples were embedded in paraffin, and 5-mm-thick sections were collected and mounted onto glass slides. For static bone histomorphometry, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and toluidine blue staining was used to determine the osteoclast activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and osteoblast numbers, respectively. For immunohistochemistry, paraffin sections were rehydrated and antigen site was retrived with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 60 °C for 2 hr (for sclerostin or β-catenin) or trypsin buffer (pH 7.8) at 37 °C for 30 min (for COX-2), and then probed with an anti-sclerostin (AF1589, 1:400, R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), anti-COX-2 (12375–1-AP, 1:200, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA) or an anti-β-catenin antibody (ab16051, 1:200, Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA) overnight at 4 °C. The sections were probed with a biotin-labeled secondary antibody and ABC Reagent (VECTASTAIN, Burlingame, CA, USA). Staining was visualized with DAB Chromogen (SK-4100, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Hematoxylin was used as a counterstain. Images were captured using an optical microscope (BZ-X710, KEYENCE). Osteoclast surface (Oc.S), osteoclast number (N.Oc), osteoblast number (N.Ob), and bone surface (BS) on the tibial midshaft cortical bone along the endosteal surface were counted and positive cells quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, USA).</p><p>Mice were IP injected with calcein (C0875, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 20 mg/kg of body weight 1 day before tibial loading, and followed by alizarin red injection (A5533, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 30 mg/kg of body weight 3 days before euthanization. Tibias were dissected, fixed in 70% ethanol, and then embedded in methylmethacrylate for 10-μm-thick longitudinal plastic sections. Two-color fluorescent images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (BZ-X710, KEYENCE). Single label was defined as any bone surface with green, red, or yellow (no separation between green and red). The distance between green and red fluorescence signals was measured along the bone surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimston et al., 2012</xref>). The following parameters were quantified at tibial midshaft using NIH ImageJ software (NIH, USA): total perimeter (BS); single label perimeter (sLS); double label perimeter (dLS), and double-label area (dL.Ar). The following values were then calculated: mineralizing surface [MS/BS = (sLS/2+ dLS)/BS], mineral apposition rate [MAR = dL.Ar/dLS/12], and bone formation rate (BFR/BS = MAR × MS/BS).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA extraction and RT-qPCR</title><p>The long tibial bone was isolated free of soft tissues, and bone marrow was removed by flushing with RNase-free PBS after two weeks tibial loading.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that the current manuscript will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we would be open to considering a new manuscript that addresses all of the review concerns, but without any guarantee on the outcome of the review process.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>Overall, the study was found to be limited in novelty and impact. The use of Evans Blue dye entry to measure hemichannel activity in osteocytes may not be appropriate because of the observed membrane tears in osteocytes caused by mechanical loads.

The Augusta, GA very nicely (and it has since been repeated) that osteocyte membrane disruptions occur with much milder loading (e.g., treadmill running) and allow in EB dye. These membrane tears have nothing to do with channel or hemichannel activity. So it is very hard to understand why the D130-136 mice would be spared from membrane tears that should allow copious amounts of EB into the cells. Do certain mutations in connexin prevent membrane tears?</p><p>If the R76W mutation enhances hemichannel function, and the conclusions of the paper are correct that the hemichannels are controlling the response to loading, then why were the R76W mutants not more responsive than WT to mechanical loading?</p><p>Figure 3: How is it justified to say that the D130-D136 mice had increased bone formation response to loading on the periosteum when the relative change between loaded and nonloaded look to be about the same in all three genotypes?

The authors conclude that hemichannels but not GJIC facilitate the effects of mechanical loading on bone via the secretion of PGE2 through the hemichannels.</p><p>While provocative, the data fall short of being convincing of the interpretation.</p><p>A major concern is the statistical approaches used to evaluate data. The conclusions obligate that each group of animals (WT, R76W and ∆130-136 mice with or without loading) be compared to each other to determine differences in their ability to mount a response of bone to a mechanical load. The correct statistical test is a two way ANOVA when there are multiple variables (genotype and load). However, multiple t-tests are used to support major conclusions. Since primary data was supplied by the authors in the supplement, we checked this using statistical software. Many of the statistical analyses do not hold up when run through the appropriate statistical test. Thus, the primary findings reported are not supported.</p><p>Two additional significant weaknesses affect the potential quality and impact of this study.</p><p>1. No convincing evidence is presented that the phenotype was rescued by PGE2. In Figure 8 and the corresponding supplement, vehicle treated and PGE2 treated unloaded controls are not shown and are critical to the appropriate interpretation of the experiment. Meaningful bone parameters including bone area and cortical thickness are not affected by the PGE2. Trabecular bone was completely unaffected by PGE2 or even the M1 antibody. Also, a one-way ANOVA is the incorrect measure with which to assess these changes. There are many variables in these mice: treatment with or without M1 antibody, loading or unloading (although not included) and treatment with or without PGE2. These are not accounted for with the statistical models used to assess the data.</p><p>2. No convincing evidence that PGE2 secretion through connexin 43 hemichannels is shown. Instead, Figure 4C shows that a protein (COX2) responsible for producing PGE2 is reduced in the cells that produce PGE2 in the D130-136 mice. Several papers have shown that connexin 43 regulates ptgs2 and could affect PGE2 abundance independent of the ability to pass through connexin 43 hemichannels and others show that PGE2 also regulates connexin 43 abundance and gap junctional communication.</p><p>As mentioned above, most of the statistical tests used to analyze the data are incorrectly performed throughout the manuscript. This prevents any meaningful conclusions from large portions of the study.</p><p>The novelty and impact of these studies is limited. As indicated by the authors, the concept that connexin 43 hemichannels are involved in PGE2 release by osteocytes was reported {greater than or equal to}15 years ago (Cherian et al., 2005; Jiang and Cherian, 2003) and has become accepted in the bone literature: &quot;Connexin (Cx)-forming gap junctions and hemichannels permit small molecules ({less than or equal to}1 kDa) to pass through the cellular membrane, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and ATP (Loiselle et al., 2012).&quot; These same transgenic mouse models have been reported for unloading (Zhao et al., Front Physiol, 2020), estrogen deficiency (Ma et al., Bone Res 2019), fracture healing (Chen et al., J Cell Physiol 2019), breast cancer metastasis (Zhou et al., Oncogene 2016), and muscle-bone crosstalk via PGE2 ( Li et al., Cells 2021), and in normal bone acquisition (Xu et al., J Bone Miner res 2015). Adding loading is important to the bone field but may not be of broad interest. The authors should justify/clarify what aspect of this study will be broadly impactful or what knowledge gap is filled.</p><p>Controls demonstrating that the R76W protein is expressed are required. Evidence that these mice exhibit a loss of gap junctions in vivo is needed. This control is important, since there is no distinguishable phenotype between R76W and wild type mice despite a loss of connexin 43 GJIC and gain of hemichannel activity. In a similar GJIC deficient mutant with a gain of hemichannel activity there is a severe bone phenotype (Watkins et al., Mol Biol Cell 2011; Dobrowolski Hum Mol Genet 2008). This is in stark contrast to the R76W mutant used here.</p><p>Controls showing that the long term treatment with M1 antibodies blocks hemichannels but not gap junctions in vivo is required. It is expected that two weeks of antibody treatment, which binds to the extracellular domains of connexin 43, would likely result in steric hindrance to the docking of connexin hemichannels to form gap junctions. The phenotype of these chronically treated mice beings to resemble connexin 43 gene deletion (Figure 6H increased periosteal bone formation rate) – a key feature of loss of GJIC (D130-136 mice or bone connexin 43 knockout mice). Increased endosteal osteoclast activity was also found in the Cx43(M1) group (Figure 7K, N, O) also consistent with complete Cx43 (gap junction and hemichannel) loss of function.</p><p>Figure 4 F, I, J, K and Figure 7D, G, J should be shown with values for loaded and unloaded gene expression rather than a ratio. Then a two-way ANOVA (loading and genotype) should be used to assess the effects. It is statistically unsound as shown.</p><p>Figure 1 FS2 is too dark to assess. Please supply a higher contrast image.</p><p>Figure 5—figure supplement 1A quantification and statistical analysis are required.</p><p>In the section titled: &quot;PGE2 rescues impeded osteogenic responses to mechanical loading by impaired Cx43 hemichannels.&quot; It is concluded that &quot;Together, these results demonstrate that administration of PGE2 significantly rescues impeded anabolic responses of cortical bone to mechanical loading as a result of Cx43 hemichannel inhibition.&quot; This is not supported by the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74365.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Indeed hemichannels as mechanosensitive channels with PGE<sub>2</sub> release in osteocytes have been well studied in osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells including our previously published papers. However, the study reported in this paper, for the first time, demonstrated the in vivo role of Cx43 hemichannels in osteocytes and PGE<sub>2</sub> release in mediating anabolic function in the bone. The outcomes of this study will help establish hemichannels as a potential new drug target for treating bone loss and osteoporosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of Evans Blue dye entry to measure hemichannel activity in osteocytes may not be appropriate because of the observed membrane tears in osteocytes caused by mechanical loads.</p></disp-quote><p>Hemichannels are selective channels that only allow molecular weight less than 1 kDa molecules to pass through, while membrane tear has no size limit for passing molecules. Therefore, two types of fluorescence dyes are typically used to study Cx hemichannels, one is less than 1 kDa and the other is around 10 kDa to distinguish hemichannels from other forms of dye uptake like membrane tear. The uptake detected by 10 kDa is very low. In addition to transgenic mouse model with impaired hemichannels, we also used a specific Cx43 hemichannel blocking monoclonal antibody M1 and it can significantly block uptake of small sized dye molecule. Other previous studies including us also demonstrate the inhibition of hemichannel opening induced by mechanical loading with other inhibitors including chemicals and Cx mimic peptides both in vitro and in vivo. However, currently there is no any specific inhibitor that can inhibit dye uptake associated with membrane tears.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the very small effect size seen in many of the skeletal parameters measured in response to mechanical loading coupled with the in correct statistical analyses used raises concerns regarding the validity of the conclusions drawn.</p></disp-quote><p>Unlike gene knockout mouse models, anabolic effects by mechanical loading for two weeks, a standard protocol, normally does not cause very dramatic bone responses, but does show the consistent anabolic responses. The bone anabolic responses shown in our study is consistent with other published studies (Bass et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2011).</p><p>In the revision, we have reviewed all of our statistical analysis with a biostatistician expert. We have removed one-way ANOVA and used student T-test for paired comparisons. The main comparison in this paper is for unloaded and loaded group within the same genotypes and M1 or PGE2 for control and treated groups. The conclusion from these analyses is supported by corrected statistical analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I'm not sure why the authors are not seeing Evans Blue dye entry into the osteocytes of loaded bone from D130-136 transgenic mice.

Hemichannels have been investigated for years and they are selective channels that allow molecular weight less than 1 kDa to pass through. In addition to specific hemichannel-blocking antibodies, and other hemichannel blockers, such as chemicals, such as carboxlone and connexin extracellular mimetic peptides showed the inhibition of smaller dye (i.e. EB, EtBr, Lucifer yellow) uptake, but not bigger dyes (i.e. rhodamine dextran ~10 kDa) both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>It is true that R76W mutation has enhanced hemichannel function and some anabolic bone responses as compared to WT are indeed enhanced in R76W mice including bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness and BMD, although not as dramatic as expected. It is possible that certain threshold of hemichannel activity is required for the anabolic function in response to mechanical loading and excess hemichannel activity can be attenuated by a feedback inhibition mechanism. Our earlier study showed that prolonged activity of osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels increases extracellular PGE2 level and excess extracellular PGE2 acting in an autocrine manner activates EP2/4 receptors, leading to MAPK activation. MAPK directly phosphorylates Cx43 and closes hemichannels (Riquelme et al., 2015). This mechanism could similarly regulate the activity of R76W, resulting in comparable anabolic responses to mechanical loading as WT. We have included the above in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: How is it justified to say that the D130-D136 mice had increased bone formation response to loading on the periosteum when the relative change between loaded and nonloaded look to be about the same in all three genotypes?

In D130-136 mice, only bone formation on the periosteal surface increased, but not on the endosteal surface. In addition, we observed the increased osteoclast number in endosteal surface. The net effect in D130-136 is a decreased bone area fraction and cortical thickness. The data presented in this study include the higher or lower control leg formation measurements.

Therefore, paired student T-test is an appropriate statistical approach. We agree that one-way ANOVA is improper to compare multiple variables and comparison with multiple variable (genotype and load) would provide irrelevant information regarding the treatment responses.

As the reviewer pointed out, the rescue by PGE2 in cortical bone was not shown in trabecular bone. We are not certain for the difference between cortical and trabecular bones. A recent paper has also shown more beneficial osteogenic responses of combined treatment of PTH(1-34) and mechanical loading to cortical bone than trabecular bone (Roberts et al., 2020). As discussed in this paper, one of the possibilities could be related to the higher strain levels experienced by cortical bone compared to trabecular bone. We have included the above in the Discussion. We have reanalyzed the data and comparison. The major comparison should be paired student-T test by comparing vehicle and M1 treated within each group, Control and PGE2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. No convincing evidence that PGE2 secretion through connexin 43 hemichannels is shown. Instead, Figure 4C shows that a protein (COX2) responsible for producing PGE2 is reduced in the cells that produce PGE2 in the D130-136 mice. Several papers have shown that connexin 43 regulates ptgs2 and could affect PGE2 abundance independent of the ability to pass through connexin 43 hemichannels and others show that PGE2 also regulates connexin 43 abundance and gap junctional communication.</p></disp-quote><p>Our earlier study has showed that Cx43 hemichannels in osteocytes serve as a direct portal for the release of PGE2 (Cherian et al., 2005). In this study, we showed that increased PGE2 in tibia bone by mechanical loading was totally attenuated in D130-136 mice (Figure 4A) and M1 treated mice (Figure 7A). Moreover, we have previous reported that the inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels does not affect intracellular PGE2 level (Siller-Jackson et al., 2008), suggesting the reduced PGE2 biosynthesis by COX2 since COX2 is the enzyme subtype responding to mechanical loading. Indeed, in this study, we showed the attenuated upregulation of COX2 expression and reduction of PGE2 level in D130-136 mice as well as in M1 treated mice. We did not find any previous papers raised by the reviewer regarding “connexin 43 regulates ptgs2 and could affect PGE2 abundance independent of the ability to pass through connexin 43 hemichannels”. We and others have shown that PGE2 can increase Cx43 expression and gap junction communication in cultured osteoblasts (Civitelli et al., 1998) and osteocytes (Cheng et al., 2001), but has no effect in oral-derived human osteoblasts (Adamo et al., 2001). Additionally, increasing Cx43 expression enhances PGE2-dependent β-catenin signaling activation in osteoblast cells (Gupta et al., 2019). Cx43 overexpression in rabbit and human synovial fibroblast cell lines increased PTGS2 gene expression (Gupta et al., 2014). Moreover, increased extracellular PGE2 could serve as a feedback inhibitor that activates MAPK, phosphorylates Cx43 and closes Cx43 hemichannels (Riquelme et al., 2015). The outcomes of this study will help establish hemichannels as a potential de novo drug target for treating bone loss and osteoporosis.

It would be ideal if we could determine gap junctions in situ, but so far, it is not technically feasible albeit the research of gap junction channels for 5 decades. The reviewer raised a good point regarding R76W mice vs reported G138R mice. Cx43 G138R is a dominant negative mutant, which impairs gap junctions with leaky hemichannels as reported in the referred references. In contrast to G138R mutant that exhibits leaky hemichannels without any stimulation, hemichannels formed by R76W is not open without mechanical loading (Xu et al., 2015). Therefore, unlike G138R mutant, compared with WT, R76W does not cause any major bone phenotypes. Under mechanical loading in vivo, further increase of hemichannel opening in R76W has stronger anabolic effects on the bone including bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness and BMD.

Therefore, it is unlikely this antibody will affect docking of gap junction channels given the short life of Cx43. We agreed that some phenotypes are similar between D130-136 and Cx43 cKO mice, which suggest that the importance of Cx43-forming channels.
