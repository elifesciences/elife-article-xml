exclusively a result of tumor metastasis, and lungs are one of the main metastatic sites. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are prominent players in the microenvironment of breast cancer. However, their role in the metastatic niche is largely unknown. In this study, we profiled the transcriptional co-evolution of lung fibroblasts isolated from transgenic mice at defined stage-specific time points of metastases formation. Employing multiple knowledge-based platforms of data analysis provided powerful insights on functional and temporal regulation of the transcriptome of fibroblasts. We demonstrate that fibroblasts in lung metastases are transcriptionally dynamic and plastic, and reveal stage-specific gene signatures that imply functional tasks, including extracellular matrix remodeling, stress response, and shaping the inflammatory microenvironment. Furthermore, we identified <italic>Myc</italic> as a central regulator of fibroblast rewiring and found that stromal upregulation of <italic>Myc</italic> transcriptional networks is associated with disease progression in human breast cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>microenvironment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>637069 MetCAF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shani</surname><given-names>Ophir</given-names></name><name><surname>Raz</surname><given-names>Yael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1060/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shani</surname><given-names>Ophir</given-names></name><name><surname>Raz</surname><given-names>Yael</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name><name><surname>Erez</surname><given-names>Neta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Emerson Collective</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shani</surname><given-names>Ophir</given-names></name><name><surname>Monteran</surname><given-names>Lea</given-names></name><name><surname>Erez</surname><given-names>Neta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003975</institution-id><institution>Israel Cancer Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shani</surname><given-names>Ophir</given-names></name><name><surname>Erez</surname><given-names>Neta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001698</institution-id><institution>Israel Cancer Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shani</surname><given-names>Ophir</given-names></name><name><surname>Raz</surname><given-names>Yael</given-names></name><name><surname>Monteran</surname><given-names>Lea</given-names></name><name><surname>Erez</surname><given-names>Neta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001006</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Megides</surname><given-names>Or</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsarfaty</surname><given-names>Ilan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metastases-associated fibroblasts show stage-dependent transcriptional plasticity and their rewiring is regulated by <italic>Myc</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in women, and mortality is almost exclusively a result of tumor metastasis. Advanced metastatic cancers are mostly incurable, and available therapies generally prolong life to a limited extent. It is increasingly appreciated that in addition to tumor cell-intrinsic survival and growth programs, the microenvironment is crucial in supporting metastases formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erez and Coussens, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Obenauf and Massagué, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quail and Joyce, 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, while years of research have revealed the central role of the microenvironment in supporting tumor growth and response to therapy at the primary tumor site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quail and Joyce, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanahan and Coussens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albini et al., 2018</xref>), the role of the metastatic microenvironment and the molecular crosstalk between stromal cells, including fibroblasts and immune cells at the metastatic niche, are poorly characterized.</p><p>Preparation of secondary sites to facilitate subsequent tumor cell colonization has been described for multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peinado et al., 2017</xref>). Secreted factors and extracellular vesicles from tumor and stromal cells were reported to instigate a permissive pre-metastatic niche by influencing the recruitment and activation of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peinado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coffelt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Quail et al., 2017</xref>), and by modifying the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Malanchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oskarsson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oskarsson and Massagué, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nielsen et al., 2016</xref>). Each metastatic microenvironment exerts specific functions that support or oppose colonization by disseminated tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peinado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, understanding distinct organ-specific mechanisms that enable metastatic growth is of crucial importance.</p><p>Lungs are one of the most common sites of breast cancer metastasis. Various immune cell populations were shown to be functionally important in facilitating breast cancer pulmonary metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coffelt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrengues et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeNardo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fridlender et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jablonska et al., 2017</xref>). However, very little is known about the role of fibroblasts during the complex process of metastases formation.</p><p>Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a heterogeneous population of fibroblastic cells found in the microenvironment of solid tumors. In some cancer types, including breast carcinomas, CAFs are the most prominent stromal cell type, and their abundance correlates with worse prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). We previously demonstrated a novel role for CAFs in mediating tumor-promoting inflammation in mouse and human carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erez et al., 2010</xref>). We further characterized the origin, heterogeneity and function of CAFs in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sharon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, we found profound changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in fibroblasts isolated from metastases-bearing lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raz et al., 2018</xref>). However, comprehensive profiling of metastasis-associated fibroblasts in spontaneous metastasis was not previously done. Based on the central role of CAFs in supporting tumor growth at the primary tumor site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalluri, 2016</xref>), we hypothesized that transcriptional reprogramming of lung fibroblasts is an important factor in the formation of a hospitable metastatic niche that supports breast cancer metastasis.</p><p>In this study, we set out to characterize the dynamic co-evolution of fibroblasts during pulmonary metastasis. To achieve this goal, we utilized novel transgenic mice that enable visualization, tracking, and unbiased isolation of fibroblasts from spontaneous lung metastases. Here, we demonstrate the profiling and analysis of the dynamic evolution of fibroblast transcriptome at distinct disease stages, including early and late metastatic disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fibroblasts are activated and transcriptionally reprogrammed in the lung metastatic niche</title><p>We previously demonstrated that fibroblasts at the primary tumor microenvironment are reprogrammed to obtain a pro-inflammatory and tumor-promoting phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sharon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>).

To enable visualization, tracking, and isolation of fibroblasts, we established a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer with fibroblast-specific reporter genes: transgenic mice that express the fluorescent reporter YFP under the collagen-1α promoter (<italic>Col1a1-</italic>YFP) were crossed with MMTV-PyMT mice to create PyMT<italic>;Col1a1-</italic>YFP transgenic mice, in which all fibroblasts are fluorescently labeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raz et al., 2018</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of normal lungs as compared with lungs of tumor-bearing mice revealed significantly increased numbers of fibroblasts in macrometastatic lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Thus, fibroblasts are both activated and increase in numbers in the metastatic microenvironment of breast cancer lung metastasis.</p><p>To analyze the transcriptional reprograming of activated fibroblasts at the lung metastatic niche, we performed unbiased profiling by RNA-seq of fibroblasts isolated from lungs of PyMT<italic>;Col1a1-</italic>YFP transgenic mice at distinct metastatic stages compared with fibroblasts isolated from normal lungs of <italic>Col1a1-</italic>YFP mice. To explore the temporal changes in functional gene networks, we profiled fibroblasts (EpCAM<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>YFP<sup>+</sup> cells) isolated from normal lungs, and from lungs with micro- or macrometastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Micrometastases were defined by the presence of tumor cells in lungs, where no lesions were detectible macroscopically or by CT imaging.</p><p>Initial data analysis indicated that fibroblasts isolated from lungs with macrometastases (macrometastasis-associated fibroblasts [MAFs]) were strikingly different from Normal lung fibroblast (NLF) as well as from fibroblasts isolated from lungs with micrometastases (micrometastasis-associated fibroblasts [MIFs]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, since fibroblasts were isolated from entire lungs, rather than from specific metastatic lesions, the MIF fraction contained a mixture of normal, non-metastasis-associated fibroblasts as well as metastasis-associated fibroblasts. As a result, initial data analysis did not reveal significant differences between NLF and MIF. Thus, metastasis-associated fibroblasts are not only functionally activated but also transcriptionally reprogrammed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Transcriptome profiling of metastasis-associated fibroblasts reveals dynamic stage-specific changes in gene expression</title><p>In light of these initial results, we next analyzed the genes that are differentially expressed between MAF and NLF.

Indeed, hierarchical clustering based on these differentially expressed genes confirmed that the MIF group clustered separately from both NLF and MAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Incubation of isolated primary lung fibroblasts with CM from Met-1, a PyMT-derived breast carcinoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borowsky et al., 2005</xref>), or from 4T1 cells, a model of triple-negative breast cancer, indicated that tumor-derived factors activated multiple CAF-associated functions including enhanced motility in wound healing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1[1–4]</xref>) and increased contraction of collagen gel matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1[5–7]</xref>). Thus, NLFs are reprogrammed by signaling from breast cancer cells, resulting in acquisition of tumor-promoting properties. To test whether activation of Myc in lung fibroblasts contributes to their acquisition of CAF characteristics, we performed wound healing assays and collagen contraction assays with tumor-activated lung fibroblasts that were transfected with siMyc or with siCtrl.

Since we showed that <italic>MYC</italic> is a central regulator of fibroblast rewiring during metastatic progression in mice, we asked whether <italic>MYC</italic> is similarly upregulated in the stromal compartment of human breast cancer. Importantly, analysis revealed that <italic>MYC</italic> is upregulated in breast cancer stroma in correlation with disease progression, as reflected by pathological grade: expression of <italic>MYC</italic> was significantly elevated in the stroma of grade 3 tumors compared with stroma isolated from more differentiated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>NFKB1</italic> and <italic>STAT3</italic> did not exhibit this grade-dependent trend of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>).

We utilized a unique model of transgenic mice that enabled unbiased isolation of fibroblasts from spontaneous lung metastasis and performed comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome of fibroblasts isolated from normal lungs, and lungs with micro- or macrometastases. By employing multiple platforms of data analysis, we integrated ontology analyses with data on protein interactions and functional pathways from knowledge-based databases to identify the relevant and stage-specific gene signatures that imply functional tasks of metastasis-associated fibroblasts.</p><p>Importantly, we performed the analysis on fibroblasts isolated directly from fresh tissues, with no additional culture step that may affect gene expression. Our findings indicated that ECM remodeling programs were instigated early in micrometastases and persisted to be functional throughout metastatic progression, while other signaling pathways were activated in a stage-specific manner. Activation of the cellular stress response was associated with micrometastases, and inflammatory signaling was instigated in fibroblasts isolated from advanced metastases, suggesting that fibroblasts are transcriptionally dynamic and plastic, and that they adapt their function to the evolving microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary scheme.</title><p>The co-evolution of lung fibroblasts at the metastatic microenvironment is driven by stage-specific transcriptional plasticity that activates growth-promoting tasks including stress response, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and instigation of inflammatory signaling.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60745-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Initial analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed distinct gene signatures associated with advanced metastatic disease. By performing step-by-step analysis, a unique gene signature was revealed for early metastatic disease as well. Moreover, utilizing a combination of analyses platforms, we unraveled multiple pathways operative in fibroblasts in different metastatic stages, relying not only on altered gene expression but also on functional role and interaction of genes.</p><p>Interestingly, this multilayered analysis indicated that fibroblasts isolated from micrometastases instigated the expression of genes related to cellular response to stress, including the transcriptional regulator <italic>Hsf1. Hsf1</italic> was previously shown to be upregulated in CAFs in breast and lung cancers and to drive a stromal tumor-promoting transcriptional program that correlated with worse prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scherz-Shouval et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Hsf1</italic> was recently implicated in mediating the transition from chronic inflammation to colon cancer by mediating ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levi-Galibov et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings expand these observations to the metastatic microenvironment and show that activation of <italic>Hsf1</italic> transcriptional regulation in fibroblasts occurs during the early stages of metastasis and thus may play a role in instigating tumor-promoting functions in metastasis-associated fibroblasts.</p><p>In addition to stress response, our findings indicated that ECM remodeling is a central task of metastasis-associated fibroblasts throughout the metastatic cascade. Indeed, ECM components and remodeling were demonstrated to facilitate breast cancer metastasis to lungs, and pancreatic cancer metastasis to liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Malanchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oskarsson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nielsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yuzhalin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander and Cukierman, 2020</xref>).

CAFs are known to play a central role in mediating tumor-promoting inflammation at the primary tumor site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Servais and Erez, 2013</xref>).

Our analyses revealed several central regulators that are operative in metastasis-associated fibroblasts, including the well-known modulators of CAF activity <italic>Nfkb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erez et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>Stat3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, the most prominent regulator in the metastasis-associated fibroblasts network was the TF <italic>Myc</italic>. While the importance of <italic>Myc</italic> in promoting cell transformation and tumorigenesis is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Poole and van Riggelen, 2017</xref>), its role in the tumor stroma is largely uncharacterized. <italic>Myc</italic> expression in tumor cells was recently shown to be regulated by microenvironmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020</xref>) and to drive an inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kortlever et al., 2017</xref>).

Indeed, inhibition of <italic>Myc</italic> attenuated tumor-promoting functions of fibroblasts and overexpression of <italic>Myc</italic> was sufficient to induce these functions, confirming that <italic>Myc</italic> functionally contributes to fibroblast acquisition of tumor-promoting traits. Importantly, validation of these findings in human breast cancer patients revealed that stromal expression of <italic>Myc</italic> and its downstream genes is correlated with disease progression in breast cancer patients. Stromal gene expression was previously found to be associated with bad prognosis in colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calon et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings implicate activation of <italic>Myc</italic> and stromal gene expression in breast cancer patient survival. Taken together, these findings indicate that in addition to its known role in driving carcinogenesis in tumor cells, <italic>Myc</italic> functions in stromal rewiring in the tumor microenvironment in both primary tumors and metastases of breast cancer.</p><p>In summary, we show that integration of multiple analytical platforms of gene expression, connectivity, and function provided a powerful insight on functional and temporal regulation of the dynamic transcriptome of fibroblasts in lung metastasis. We uncovered central molecular pathways that drive the activation of growth-promoting tasks in fibroblasts via known regulators of CAF tumor-promoting activities including <italic>Myc</italic>, a novel regulator of fibroblast metastases-promoting properties.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Wilbert Zwart as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mara Sherman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.

The transcriptional profiles of fibroblasts and CAFs in the lung metastatic niche will be an important resource for the field, as this analysis has not been performed in the context of spontaneous lung metastases from breast tumors in immune-competent hosts. The work is significant in providing insights into transcriptional alterations in fibroblasts during metastatic seeding, but also in defining a role for stromal MYC in establishment of the lung metastatic niche, which is novel and unexpected. The topic is of interest and approach is promising, but the work is under-developed in its current stage and needs revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Key results from transcriptional profiling experiments should be validated by immunohistochemistry to show expression changes in fibroblasts within metastatic lesions. This is especially important for the MIF group given the confounding impact of normal fibroblasts-transcriptional profiling results may represent an average of normal fibroblasts and activated CAFs in the micrometastatic lesions, or may represent a field effect such that fibroblasts in the ostensibly normal lung tissue are partially activated. This is important to distinguish to better characterize alterations to the fibroblast compartment early in metastatic progression.</p><p>2. Immunohistochemistry for MYC should be repeated with a fibroblast co-stain in the human lung metastasis tissues.</p><p>3. The first four figures are essentially analysis of the RNAseq on the fibroblasts. However, independent validation of the RNAseq analysis in another cohort of mice is lacking. The authors should prepare additional RNA and analyze the levels of key genes identified the RNAseq by qRT-PCR. This is particularly critical for the micro-met fibroblasts as the PCA suggested no consistent change in transcriptome between normal and micro-met fibroblasts. Currently, the only validation that I could find for a change in micro-met fibroblasts is for Hsp90aa1 in Figure 5 and the change in Hspe1 shown in Figure 3c is not validated in Figure 5.</p><p>4. Related to the above point, what is really lacking is in situ staining for either exemplar proteins using antibodies or mRNA using RNAscope or similar in situ technology. This is important as there is heterogeneity in CAFs and the changes may only be occurring in a subset of fibroblasts within the metastases. I realize that the Col1a1-YFP strategy partially restricts the fibroblasts that they isolate, but there is still considerable scope for heterogeneity within this population of metastasis associated fibroblasts.</p><p>5. The plots in Figure 3b and Figure 3c do not seem consistent. For example, Figure 3b suggests that stress response genes are unchanged in macro-met fibroblasts, but they clearly seem to be changed in Figure 3c.</p><p>6. How do the authors determine what is a fibroblast in Figure 1a? And how do they select the regions for quantification? I don't disagree with the conclusions, but do they exclude the αSMA+ peri-vascular cells from the analysis of normal tissue? How do they account for the PDPN expression in alveolar type I cells in the normal lung? This shouldn't be compared to PDPN expression in fibroblasts.</p><p>7. Figure 6e should be removed as it is bulk analysis of tumor tissue and will be dominated by cancer cells.</p><p>8. It is great that the authors have access to some human lung met. tissue. The authors should perform multiplexed IHC to confirm that the myc staining is really in fibroblasts and not another elongated cell type. It would also help to clarify the issue of heterogeneity as many of the elongated cells don't express detectable myc.</p><p>9.

While both Thbs1 and HSP90AA1 were also expressed by other cells in addition to fibroblasts, staining validated the RNA-seq results and confirmed that both Thbs1 and HSP90AA1 are mainly upregulated in CAFs at the micrometastatic stage. Expectedly, not all YFP+ fibroblasts were Thbs1<sup>+</sup> or HSP90AA1<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that MIFs are heterogeneous and contain multiple functional subpopulations. Representative images of staining were added to the revised version in Figure 3—figure supplement 2. Moreover, in response to a similar comment below (comments #3,4), we also validated the expression of selected candidates from the RNAseq by qRT-PCR of normal fibroblasts, MIF and MAF, as detailed in our response to comment #3 below. The results are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript. We thank the reviewers for these suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

While there is indeed a trend of upregulation in the expression of stressrelated genes in the macro stage compared to normal fibroblasts (Figure 3C, middle row), this increase was not significantly enriched in MAFs in the pathway analysis. Further confirming this, comparing the stress response gene signature in MIF vs. MAF fibroblasts (Figure 3C, bottom line), it is evident that this gene signature is downregulated in the macro stage as compared with the micro stage. We apologize that this was not sufficiently clear. We clarified this point in the revised manuscript (page 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Regarding the quantification of PDPN: it is indeed known that PDPN is expressed also in alveolar type I cells. However, since excluding these areas was not technically feasible, we assumed that the expression in lung parenchymal cells was unchanged between the stages, and therefore the changes we may identify will be fibroblast related. Indeed, as clearly seen in the images and quantification, the changes in PDPN were not significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

However, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our collaborators at the Sheba Medical Center were not able to perform additional staining for us in a timely manner. Moreover, performing MxIF requires extensive calibrations, consuming a large number of tissue sections, which is not possible with the rare tissue samples of human lung metastases that we were able to obtain. We would like to emphasize that our observations of MYC+ positive stromal cells was assessed by an expert pathologist, Prof. Iris Barshack, who is also a co-author on our manuscript. However, the reviewers are right in pointing out that it is possible that not all the fibroblastic cells in the human tissue sections that expressed Myc are fibroblasts, and therefore we revised our phrasing in the manuscript. The sentence describing the results now reads: “We found that MYC was expressed in a subset of lung metastasis-associated stromal cells (Figure 6E), suggesting that stromal upregulation of MYC plays a functional role in human lung metastasis”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. How are the gel contraction and wound assays controlled for potential effects of myc depletion on fibroblast proliferation?</p></disp-quote><p>We controlled for potential effects of Myc depletion on cell proliferation by performing both XTT assay and Ki67 staining. In both methods, the results indicated that the effect on CAF-like functions that we found following knockdown of Myc were not due to changes in their proliferation. These results were added to the revised manuscript (Figure 5—figure supplement 8,9) and clearly stated. We thank the reviewers for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Multiple independent siRNA against myc should be employed.</p></disp-quote><p>The siRNA that we used was not a single siRNA, but rather a mix of <italic>different</italic> siRNAs targeting sequences. The Accell SMARTpool that we used contains a mixture of four siRNAs targeting one gene and provides extended duration of gene knockdown with only minimal effects on cell viability and the innate immune response. This is stated in the methods section.</p><p>To address the concern regarding the specificity of the Myc targeting siRNA, and to rule out the risk of an off-target effect, we deconvoluted the SMARTpool of siRNA sequences and repeated the experiments with independent siRNAs to Myc, as requested.</p><p>Primary lung fibroblasts were transduced with three independent Myc-targeting siRNAs or with control siRNA. Analysis of the results confirmed knockdown of Myc expression in fibroblasts with all three independent siRNAs. Analysis of the CAF-like functions collagen contraction and wound closure revealed that all three independent siRNA significantly inhibited fibroblast wound closure and partially inhibited collagen contraction. These results were added as a supplement to Figure 5 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that we also performed overexpression of Myc and showed that it was sufficient to enhance CAF-like functions, further supporting out observations from the knockdown experiments.</p><p>Therefore, we can now confirm that the results shown in the manuscript are specific to Myc.</p><p>Our findings reveal a novel central role for Myc in the rewiring of metastases-associated fibroblasts and emphasize the importance of understanding the early changes that underlie metastasis. Overall, the findings presented in this manuscript elucidate for the first time the dynamic co-evolution and the transcriptional rewiring of stromal cells during the multi-stage process of breast cancer metastasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Is myc gain of function sufficient to drive a fibroblast into a CAF-like state? If so, is it a more ECM remodeling, inflammatory, or stressed state?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this interesting question, we performed additional experiments and transduced normal lung fibroblasts to overexpress Myc in vitro. Analysis of CAF-like functions revealed that scratch wound closure, which was attenuated when Myc expression was knocked down, is significantly enhanced by overexpression of Myc, in a proliferation-independent manner. These results are now included in revised Figure 5I,J and Figure 5—figure supplement 10. However, collagen contraction was not enhanced by overexpression of Myc, although it was attenuated by its knockdown. Notably, Myc overexpression induced upregulation of its target genes BCAT1 and ODC1, that were also upregulated in the RNA-seq results. In addition, we found that multiple proinflammatory genes were upregulated by Myc overexpression (including CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL2 and IL-6). While these genes are not direct targets of Myc, they are known NF-κB target genes. Myc itself is a target of NF-κB (Grumont R, et al. Immunity 2004, PMID: 15345217, La Rosa FA et al., Mol Cell Biol. 1994, PMID: 8289784), and the two transcription factors also share target genes (Han H et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 2018, PMID: 29087512). These results are shown in revised Figure 5K. Thus, overexpression of Myc was sufficient to activate CAF-like functions including wound closure and expression of its target genes, as well as pro-inflammatory signaling in fibroblasts. We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The localization of Hsf1, Stat3, and NFkB in the lung with micro-mets and macro-mets would also worth looking at. Are these transcriptional factors localized in the same fibroblasts or different fibroblasts?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we performed multiplex immunofluorescent staining (MxIF) for YFP, and the transcription factors (TF) Myc, Stat3, NFkB1 and HSF1 in tissue sections of micro- and macrometastases. The staining revealed that while some of the fibroblasts co-expressed several TF (new Figure 4E, solid boxes), other CAF subpopulations expressed only Myc (dashed boxes). These results are shown in new Figure 4E.</p></body></sub-article></article>
