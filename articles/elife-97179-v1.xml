typically presents with increased luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility. As such, it is suspected that the arcuate kisspeptin (ARN<sup>KISS</sup>) neurons that represent the GnRH pulse generator are dysfunctional in PCOS. We used here in vivo GCaMP fiber photometry and other approaches to examine the behavior of the GnRH pulse generator in two mouse models of PCOS. We began with the peripubertal androgen (PPA) mouse model of PCOS but found that it had a reduction in the frequency of ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron synchronization events (SEs) that drive LH pulses. Examining the prenatal androgen (PNA) model of PCOS, we observed highly variable patterns of pulse generator activity with no significant differences detected in ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron SEs, pulsatile LH secretion, or serum testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone concentrations. However, a machine learning approach identified that the ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons of acyclic PNA mice continued to exhibit cyclical patterns of activity similar to that of normal mice. The frequency of ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron SEs was significantly increased in algorithm-identified ‘diestrous stage’ PNA mice compared to controls. In addition, ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons exhibited reduced feedback suppression to progesterone in PNA mice and their gonadotrophs were also less sensitive to GnRH. These observations demonstrate the importance of understanding GnRH pulse generator activity in mouse models of PCOS. The existence of cyclical GnRH pulse generator activity in the acyclic PNA mouse indicates the presence of a complex phenotype with deficits at multiple levels of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GnRH</kwd><kwd>kisspeptin</kwd><kwd>PCOS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/212242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007155</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR N013433-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Ziyue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Many women with PCOS have an elevated body mass index but up to 30% of patients do not, resulting in PCOS being further classified into obese and lean subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nestler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Toosy et al., 2018</xref>). Although androgen excess, oligo-menorrhea/anovulation, and the existence of polycystic-like ovarian morphology are the key diagnostic indicators for PCOS, a common secondary feature is increased luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waldstreicher et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group, 2004</xref>). Basal and pulsatile LH secretion can be up to threefold higher in both lean and obese PCOS women and are considered to be a significant contributor to their subfertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morales et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Dam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phylactou et al., 2021</xref>). A presumed increase in the frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion in PCOS women results in an increased LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wildt et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalkin et al., 1989</xref>). This is thought to drive excess ovarian androgen production that, in turn, impairs estrogen and progesterone feedback regulation of GnRH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pastor et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chhabra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It has become clear that the arcuate nucleus kisspeptin (ARN<sup>KISS</sup>) neurons represent the mammalian GnRH pulse generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herbison, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodman et al., 2022</xref>).

Recent studies indicate that the synchronized activity amongst ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons required for pulsatile hormone secretion is generated by local glutamatergic transmission that is subsequently modulated by neurokinin B and dynorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morris and Herbison, 2023</xref>). While the ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons are the primary site of estrogen negative feedback suppressing pulsatile GnRH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McQuillan et al., 2022</xref>), the mechanism of progesterone feedback remains unclear but could also involve the ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2011</xref>). As such, it is thought that dysfunction within the ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron pulse generator may be responsible for the elevated LH pulse frequency observed in PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walters et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coutinho and Kauffman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez Paris and Bertoldo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruddenklau and Campbell, 2019</xref>).</p><p>We have developed GCaMP fiber photometry methodologies that allow the activity of the ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron pulse generator to be monitored at high temporal resolution in freely behaving mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vas et al., 2024</xref>).

A prior ELISA assessment also reported that estradiol and progesterone levels were unchanged in PNA animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Another area of considerable inconsistency among studies involves the effects of PNA treatment on both mRNA and protein expression of kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin in the ARN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osuka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gibson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moore et al., 2021</xref>). We re-investigated this question by quantifying the immunoreactive levels of these three proteins and observed an increase in only kisspeptin expression and only in rostral ARN of PNA animals. While there are important roles for these neuropeptides in modulating ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron synchronizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morris and Herbison, 2023</xref>) and their subsequent activation of GnRH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), these generally inconsistent findings indicate that any PNA-induced changes in the expression of the neuropeptides are subtle. Indeed, the principal determinant of kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin expression in ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons is estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>) and we demonstrate here that circulating estradiol levels are not altered in PNA mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pulse generator activity and pulsatile LH in the PNA mouse model</title><p>One of the key features of the PNA mouse model is thought to be that of increased pulsatile LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stener-Victorin et al., 2020</xref>). However, this has only been reported in a single study with PNA mice exhibiting an approximately 40% increase in LH pulse frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2015</xref>). A recent paper undertaking the same tail-tip pulse bleeding approach found that LH pulse frequency was not significantly altered in PNA mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2022</xref>). Our present observations may explain these discrepancies. As the pulse generator continues to cycle in the acyclic PNA mouse, it is essentially impossible to define the ‘pulse generator stage’ of a PNA mouse at the time of bleeding and consequently wide variations in LH pulse frequency would be expected. We find here that LH pulse frequency recorded from such random ‘pulse generator’ cycling PNA mice is not significantly different to that of controls. Nevertheless, with the benefit of being able to measure ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity directly, it has been possible to show that ‘diestrous-stage’ PNA mice do have an increased rate of pulse generator frequency compared with controls. This may account for the overall increase in mean LH levels detected in the present study. As such, the PNA mouse model may to some degree replicate the increased pulse frequency seen in many women with PCOS.</p><p>The most striking feature of pulse generator activity in PNA mice is its ability to retain cyclical patterns of activity within a reproductively acyclic mouse. The pulse generator of PNA mice exhibits clear transitions from periods of ‘estrous-like’ Cluster_0 activity through to mpSE-dominated Cluster_3/4 phase and onto regular ‘diestrous-like’ Cluster_1 and _2 patterns. Although the patterns of activity were not always identical, the overall percentage of time PNA mice spend in each pattern was not found to be significantly different to controls. We also note that the dynamics of individual ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron SEs remain unchanged under all conditions in PNA mice, suggesting that the fundamental synchronization mechanism and numbers of contributing neurons is not altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2023</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that PNA treatment does not alter ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron firing activity in adult acute brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gibson et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that the acyclic reproductive phenotype of PNA mice does not result from an absence of cyclical activity in the pulse generator. Although pulse generation in the mouse does not depend on action potential generation by GnRH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herbison, 2021</xref>), it is noteworthy that a significant impact of PNA treatment on the activity of the GnRH neuron can be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jaime and Moenter, 2022</xref>). The degree to which cyclical GnRH pulse generator activity in PNA mice reflects women with PCOS is unknown. However, a very wide range of LH pulse frequency is found in anovulatory women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting the intriguing possibility that the GnRH pulse generator activity may also continue to cycle in women with PCOS.</p><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>Gonadal steroid feedback in PNA mice</title><p>Pulse generator activity was found to be identical in ovariectomized PNA and control mice. This indicates that, despite androgen receptors being expressed by ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons in the perinatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watanabe et al., 2023</xref>), excess DHT exposure at this time does not engender any fundamental differences in their synchronization behavior in the absence of gonads as adults. This suggests that the subtle increase in pulse generator frequency detected here in ‘diestrous-like’ PNA mice arises from the effects of circulating gonadal steroids. As gonadal steroid levels are normal in PNA mice, it is likely that perinatal DHT exposure programs long-term changes in gonadal steroid receptor-dependent effectors in adult PNA mice. Direct estrogen feedback is critical in maintaining the suppressed activity of the pulse generator throughout the estrous cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McQuillan et al., 2022</xref>), but ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron ESR1 expression was not found to be altered in PNA mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moore et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Reduced progesterone negative feedback is widely considered to be a major factor underlying enhanced LH pulsatility in women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pastor et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chhabra et al., 2005</xref>) and the ability of progesterone to suppress LH secretion is reduced in OVX PNA mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas progesterone exerts a robust and prolonged suppression of ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron SEs in normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>) and control mice, we find this to be much less effective in PNA females. Precisely how perinatal DHT treatment desensitizes ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons to progesterone is unknown and could occur directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moore et al., 2021</xref>). Reported effects of PNA on progesterone receptors in the ARN are inconsistent with studies finding either reduced or unchanged expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gibson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moore et al., 2021</xref>). For example, one recent study found a 30% reduction in progesterone receptor mRNA expression by ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron in PNA mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moore et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although we observed that the PNA mouse has reduced progesterone feedback at the level of the pulse generator, as is suspected for women with PCOS, it is unclear how this might pattern ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity. Control and PNA mice exhibit similar proportions of time with halted or slow pulse generator activity (Cluster_0). This pattern of activity is thought to occur in response to increased progesterone level following the LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vas et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, it is somewhat perplexing to find clear Cluster_0 activity in PNA mice that have reduced sensitivity to progesterone negative feedback. This might suggest that other mechanisms can become responsible for luteal phase slowing of pulse generator activity in PNA mice. Equally, is unclear how reduced progesterone feedback could be responsible for elevated ‘diestrous-like’ patterns of ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron activity, although roles for progesterone outside the luteal phase have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leipheimer et al., 1984</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the estrogen-activated LH surge mechanism is normal in PNA mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore et al., 2013</xref>) and, despite proestrous smears never being observed in PNA mice, copra lutea can be found indicating that LH surges and ovulation can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2022</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility that the GnRH surge generator may also be operational in PNA mice but masked by abnormal downstream signalling. In that regard, we note that pituitary gonadotroph sensitivity to GnRH is blunted in PNA mice as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silva et al., 2019</xref>). As pulse generator activity is the same in ovariectomized PNA and control mice, reduced gonadotroph sensitivity might explain the reduced rise in LH following ovariectomy in PNA mice observed in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, we note that the PNA mouse clearly does not model women with PCOS that show a much-elevated LH response to GnRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batrinos, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morales et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patel et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we report here that the GnRH pulse generator operates at a lower frequency in PPA mice, but at a higher frequency in PNA mice when ‘diestrous-like’ pulse generator activity was analyzed. However, we note that many features of PNA mice such as their pulse generator free-running behavior in the ovariectomized state and gonadal steroid hormone concentrations are normal. Remarkably, we find evidence that the pulse generator continues to exhibit estrous cycle-like patterns of activity within an acyclic PNA mouse model. Thus, the anovulatory phenotype of PNA mice likely arises in a complex manner from deficits at many levels of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis. The degree to which the PNA mouse model reflects women with PCOS remains an important, albeit very difficult, question to address.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Female 129S6Sv/Ev C57BL/6 <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yeo et al., 2016</xref>) were crossed with the Ai162 (TIT2L-GC6s-ICL-tTA2)-D Cre-dependent GCaMP6s males (JAX stock #031562; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>) to generate <italic>Kiss1</italic>-Cre/+,<italic>Ai126D</italic> mice as previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2023</xref>).

Following optic fiber implantation, mice were monitored through recovery for 5 days and received post-operative analgesics (meloxicam, 5 mg/kg; orally) for up to 2 days.

Blue (465–490 nm) and violet (405 nm) LED lights were sinusoidally modulated at frequencies of 531 and 211 Hz, respectively. Both lights were focused onto a single fiber optic connected to the mouse. The light intensity at the tip of the fiber was 30–80 micro watts. Emitted fluorescence signal from the brain was collected via the same fiber, passed through a 500–550 nm emission filter, before being focused onto a fluorescence detector (Doric, QC, Canada). The emissions were collected at 10 Hz and the two GCaMP6 emissions were recovered by demodulating the 465–490 nm signals (calcium-dependent) and 405 nm (calcium independent) signals.</p><p>Fluorescence signals were sampled using either a scheduled mode (5/15 s on/off) or a continuous mode of light emission with custom software (Tussock Innovation). Twenty-four-hour recordings were made from PNA, PPA, and their respective control female mice in the diestrous stage starting 4 hr after lights-on. Four-day recordings were started on proestrus for control mice and on any diestrous or metestrous stage for PNA mice. Continuous data acquisition mode was used to provide high temporal resolution comparisons of SEs. Signals from each SE were normalized to its peak (intact: –120 to +120 s; OVX: –120 to +200 s from the peak time).

This is an important message to make known, but when established dogmas are being challenged, the experiments behind them need to be robust. In this case, underpowered experiments and one or two other issues greatly limit the overall robustness of the study.</p><p>General critiques</p><p>(1) My main concern is that many/most of the experiments were limited to 4-5 mice per group (PPA experiments 1 and 2, PNA experiments 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9). This seems very underpowered for trying to disprove established dogmas (sometimes falling back on &quot;non-significant trends&quot; - lines 105 and 239).</p></disp-quote><p>For the key characterization of GnRH pulse generator activity and LH pulsatility in intact PNA mice (Fig.3, 4, 6), we used 6-8 animals in each experiment which we believe to be sufficient.</p><p>It is pertinent to explore the “established dogma”. While there is every expectation that the PNA model should have increased LH pulsatility, in fact there is only a single study (Moore, Prescott et al. 2015) that has shown this. The two other reports that have examined this issue find no change in LH pulse frequency (McCarthy, Dischino et al. 2021 and ours). Hence, we would suggest that expectations rather than evidence presently maintains the PNA “dogma”. For the PPA model, there is in fact not a single paper reporting increased LH pulse frequency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Page 133-142: it is concerning that the PNA mice didn't have elevated testosterone levels, and this clearly isn't the fault of the assay as this was re-tested in the laboratory of Prof Handelsman, an expert in the field, using LCMS. The point (clearly made in lines 315-336 of the Discussion) that elevated testosterone in PNA mice has been shown in some but not other publications is an important concern to describe for the field. However, the fact remains that it IS elevated in numerous studies, and in the current study it is not so, yet the authors go on to present GnRH pulse generator data as characteristic of the PNA model. Perhaps a demonstration of elevated testosterone levels (by LCMS?) should become a standard model validation prerequisite for publishing any PNA model data.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide a Table below showing the huge inconsistencies in testosterone levels reported in the PNA mouse model. If anything, these inconsistencies might be explained by age, although again this is very variable between studies. Much the same as the “dogma” related to LH pulsatility in the PNA model, we would question whether there is any robust increase in testosterone levels in this model. There is no question that women with PCOS have elevated testosterone but whether the PNA mouse is a good model for this is debatable. We have noted this caution and the need for further LC-MS studies in the Discussion.</p><table-wrap id="sa3table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Testosterone levels</th><th valign="bottom">Age of mice</th><th valign="bottom">Measurement</th><th valign="bottom">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Increased in PNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4-6 months</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sullivan and Moenter 2004</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">8 months</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Radioimmunoassay (Millipore, cat# SRI13K)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Roland,<break/>Nunemaker et al. 2010</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">60-80 days (&quot;∼2-3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">months&quot;</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ELISA (Demeditec Diagnostics, GmnH)^(**)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Moore, Prescott et<break/>al. 2015</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">2 &amp; 3 months</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ELISA (YANYU,<break/>Shanghai, China)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lei, Ding et al. 2017</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">50-60 days (1.7-2<break/>months)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ELISA (LDN)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Silva, Prescott et<break/>al. 2018</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">No difference</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5 months</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Radioimmunoassay (Millipore, cat# SRI13K)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Roland,<break/>Nunemaker et al. 2010</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">2-4 months</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Radioimmunoassay (catalog no.

The significance of the LH pulse frequency results is not stated (looks like about p=0.01).

Specifically, the authors selected k=5 for k-means clustering without providing an explicit rationale or evidence of exploratory data analysis (EDA) to support this choice. They refer to their previous publication (Vas, Wall et al. 2024), which does not provide any EDA regarding the choice of a number of clusters nor their robustness. The arbitrary selection of &quot;k&quot; without justification can undermine confidence in the clustering results since clustering results heavily depend on &quot;k&quot;. The authors also choose to use Euclidean distance as the &quot;numerical measure&quot; setting in the RapidMiner Studio's software without justification given the chosen features used for clustering and their properties. The lack of exploratory analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters, &quot;k&quot;, to be considered means that the authors might have missed identifying the true structure of the data. Common cluster robustness methods, like the elbow method or silhouette analysis, are crucial for justifying the number of clusters. An inappropriate choice could lead to incorrect conclusions about the synchronisation patterns of ARN kisspeptin neurons and their implications for the study's hypotheses. Including EDA and other validation techniques (e.g., silhouette scores, elbow method) would have strengthened the manuscript by providing empirical support for the chosen algorithm and settings.</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to clarify that we did not start this exercise with an unknown or uncharacterised data set and that the objective of the clustering was not to provide any initial pattern to the data. Rather, our aim was to develop an approach that would automatically detect the onset and existence of the key features of pulse generator cyclicity that were apparent by eye e.g. the estrous stage slowing and the presence of multi-peak SEs in metestrous. As such, our optimization was driven by the data as well as observation while retaining the unsupervised nature of k-means clustering. We started by assessed 10 variables describing all possible features of the recordings and through a process of elimination found that just 5 were sufficient to describe the key stages of the cycle. While we appreciate that the use of multiple different algorithms would progressively increase the robustness of the machine learning approach, it is evident that the current k-means approach with k=5 is already very effective at reporting the estrous cyclicity of the pulse generator in normal mice (Vas et al., Endo 2024). Having validated this approach, we have now used it here to compare the cyclical patterns of activity of PNA- and vehicle-treated mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The data and methods presented in this study could be valuable for the research community studying reproductive endocrinology and neuroendocrine disorders provided the authors address my comments above regarding the application of ML methods. The insights gained from this work could potentially inform clinical research aiming to develop better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PCOS.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Zhou and colleagues elegantly used pre-clinical mouse models to understand the nature of abnormally high GnRH/LH pulse secretion in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a major endocrine disorder affecting female fertility worldwide. This work brings a fundamental question of how altered gonadotropin secretion takes place upstream within the GnRH pulse generator core, which is defined by arcuate nucleus kisspeptin neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use state-of-the-art in vivo calcium imaging with fiber photometry and important physiological manipulations and measurements to dissect the possible neuronal mechanisms underlying such neuroendocrine derangements in PCOS. The additional use of unsupervised k-means clustering analysis for the evaluation of calcium synchronous events greatly enhances the quality of their evidence. The authors nicely propose that neuroendocrine dysfunction in PCOS might involve different setpoints through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and beyond kisspeptin neurons, which importantly pushes our field forward toward future investigations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the authors provide important evidence, additional efforts are required to improve the quality of the manuscript and back up their claims. For instance, animal experiments failed to detect high testosterone levels in PNA female mice, a well-established PCOS mouse model. Considering that androgen excess is a hallmark of PCOS, this highly influences the subsequent evaluation of calcium synchronous events in arcuate kisspeptin neurons and the implications for neuroendocrine derangements.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Reviewer 1. It will be important to establish a robust PCOS mouse model in the future that has elevated pulse generator activity in the presence of elevated testosterone concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors also may need to provide LH data from another mouse model used in their work, the peripubertal androgen (PPA) model. Their claims seem to fall short without the pairing evidence of calcium synchronous events in arcuate kisspeptin neurons and LH pulse secretion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have demonstrated that ARN-KISS neuron SEs are perfectly correlated with pulsatile LH secretion in intact and gonadectomized male and female mice on many occasions. Given that the pulse generator frequency slows by 50% in PPA mice, it is very hard to imagine how this could result in an elevated LH pulse frequency. While we were undertaking these studies the first paper (to our knowledge) looking at pulsatile LH secretion in the PPA model was published; no change was found.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another aspect that requires reviewing, is further exploration of their calcium synchronous events data and the increase of animal numbers in some of their experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The reviewer believes that this work will greatly contribute to the field and, to provide better manuscript quality, there might be only a few minor and major revisions to be included in the future version.</p><p>Minor:</p><p>(1) Line 17: I would change the sentence to &quot;One in ten women in their reproductive age suffer from PCOS&quot; to adapt to more accurate prevalence studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the sentence as recommended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 18 and 19: Although the evidence indeed points to a high LH pulse secretion in PCOS, I would change it to &quot;with increased LH secretion&quot; as most studies show mean values and not LH pulse release data.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that most human studies show a mean increase in LH, when assessed with sufficient temporal resolution, this results from elevated LH pulse frequency. As such, and to keep the manuscript focussed on the pulse generator, we would like the retain the present wording.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 47: Please correct &quot;polycystic ovaries&quot; to polycystic-like ovarian morphology to adapt to the current AEPCOS guidelines.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the sentence as recommended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 231: Authors stated that &quot;These PNA mice exhibited a cyclical pattern of activity similar to that of control mice&quot; (Figure 5C and D). Please, include the statistical tests here for this claim. Although they say there aren't differences, the colored fields do not reflect this and seem quite different. Could the authors re-evaluate these claims or provide better examples in the figure?</p></disp-quote><p>We used Sidak’s multiple comparisons tests for this analysis (as stated in Results). The key data for assessing overall cyclical activity in PNA and control mice is Fig 5B which suggest very little difference. We accept that the individual traces of activity (Fig.5D) do not look identical to controls and, indeed, they are representative of the data set. The key point is they remain cyclical in an acyclic mouse. We have made sure that this is clear in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Subheadings 6 and &amp; of the result section: It sounds confusing to read the foremost claims of the absence of SE differences and next have a clear SE frequency difference in Figures 6 C and D. The reviewer suggests that authors could reorganize the text and figures to make their rationale flow better for future readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered this point carefully but find that re-organization creates its own problems with having to use the machine learning algorithm before describing it. It will always be problematic to incorporate this type of data-reanalysis in an original paper but think this present sequence is the best that can be achieved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Discussion: If PNA female mice did not have elevated testosterone levels, how can the authors compare their results to the current literature? Could this be the case for lacking a more robust ARNKISS neuronal activity output in their experiments? The reviewer recommends a better discussion concerning these aspects.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to Reviewer #1 comment (2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Discussion: the authors claim that diestrous PNA mice exhibited highly variable patterns of ARNKISS neuron activity. Would these differences be due to different circulating sex steroid levels or intrinsic properties? Would the inclusion of future in vitro calcium imaging (brain slices) studies contribute to their research question and conclusions? The reviewer recommends a better discussion concerning these aspects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to clarify that the highly variable patterns of activity in “diestrous” PNA mice come from the fact that we are actually randomly recording from ARN-KISS neurons at metestrus, diestrus, proestrus and estrus. The pulse generator is cycling but we only have the acyclic “diestrous” smear to go by. This also makes brain slice studies difficult as we would never know the actual cycle stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major:</p><p>(1) Results section: The reviewer strongly recommends that the LH pulse secretion data for the PPA group be included in the manuscript. If the SEs represent the central mechanism of pulse generation, would the LH pulse frequency match those events? If not, could a mismatch be explained by androgen-mediated negative feedback at the pituitary level? What is the pituitary LH response to exogenous GnRH (i.p. injection) in the PPA group?</p></disp-quote><p>Our initial observation showed the frequency of ARNKISS neuron SEs was halved in PPA mice compared to controls. Additionally, one study reported pulsatile LH secretion to be unchanged in this animal model (Coyle, Prescott et al. 2022). Both pieces of evidence clearly indicate that the PPA mouse does not provide an appropriate PCOS model of elevated pulse generator activity. Therefore, we do not see the value of pursuing further experiments in this animal model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Although the evaluation of relative frequency and normalized amplitude indicate the dynamic over time, the authors should include the average amplitudes and frequencies of events within the recording session. For instance, looking at Figures 1 A and B and Figures 3 A and B, a reader can observe differences in the amplitude due to different scaling axes. Perhaps, using a Python toolbox such as GuPPy or any preferred analysis pipeline might help authors include these parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>The amplitude of recorded SEs for each mouse depends primarily on the fiber position. As such, it has only ever been possible to assess SE amplitude changes within the same mouse. It is not possible to assess differences in SE amplitude between mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 144-156: (Immunoreactivity results): Authors should proceed with caution when describing these results and clearly state that results show a software-based measurement of immunoreactive signal intensity. In addition, the small sample size of the PNA group (N = 4) compared to controls (N = 6-7) seems to mask possible differences. Could the authors increase the N of the PNA group and re-evaluate these results?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified that the immunoreactive signal intensity is based on software-based measurement. The N number for PNA mice in these studies varies from 4 to 6 depending on brain section availability for the different immunohistochemistry runs. The scatter of data is such that any new data points would need to be at the extreme of the distributions to likely have any impact on statistical significance. As a minor part of the paper, we did not feel that the use of further mice was warranted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Considering the great variability of PNA's number of SE/hr, the review suggests increasing the N in this group, thus, authors can re-evaluate their findings and draw better analysis/ conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have n=6 for the PNA group in the study. As noted above, the variability in SE/hr in Figure 3 comes from assessing the pulse generator at random times within the estrous cycle. Once we separate “diestrous-like” stage for the PNA animals, the variability is decreased as shown in Figure 6.</p></body></sub-article></article>
