We report that lumbar dI2 spinal interneurons in chicks receive synaptic input from afferents and premotor neurons. These interneurons innervate contralateral premotor networks in the lumbar and brachial spinal cord, and their ascending projections innervate the cerebellum. These findings suggest that dI2 neurons function as interneurons in local lumbar circuits, are involved in lumbo-brachial coupling, and that part of them deliver peripheral and intraspinal feedback to the cerebellum. Silencing of dI2 neurons leads to destabilized stepping in posthatching day 8 hatchlings, with occasional collapses, variable step profiles, and a wide-base walking gait, suggesting that dI2 neurons may contribute to the stabilization of the bipedal gait.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>interneurons</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>spinocerebellar tract</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1400/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klar</surname><given-names>Avihu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006221</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017/172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klar</surname><given-names>Avihu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Avraham and Ida Baruch Endowment Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klar</surname><given-names>Avihu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spinal dI2 interneurons relay peripheral and intraspinal feedback to premotor networks in the spinal cord and the cerebellum to ensure the stability of bipedal stepping.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The spinal cord integrates and relays the somatosensory inputs required for further execution of complex motor behaviors. Interneurons (INs) that differentiate at the ventral progenitor domain, V3-V0, are involved in the control of rhythmic motor activity, alternating between the left and right limbs, as well as between the flexor and extensor muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osseward and Pfaff, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>). Some of the dorsally born INs, dI1, dI3, and dI6, migrate ventrally and are also assembled within circuitries that control motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yuengert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2012</xref>), while other dorsal progenitor neurons, dI4 and dI5, give rise to INs that mediate somatosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>dI2 neurons originate in the dorsal spinal cord. The progenitor pdI2 cells, topographically positioned between the adjacent dorsally located dI1 and ventrally located dI3 neurons, express Ngn1, Ngn2, Olig3, and Pax3 transcription factors (TFs). Early postmitotic dI2 neurons undergo ventral migration and are defined by the combinatorial expression of Foxd3<sup>+</sup>/Lhx1<sup>+</sup>/Pou4f1<sup>+</sup> TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Francius et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, none of these TFs is specific to dI2 neurons; rather, their combinatorial expression defines dI2. The lack of dI2-specific cell fate markers and the dynamic expression of the above TFs in other INs causes ambiguity regarding the molecular profile and outcome of late postmitotic dI2 neurons. Using intersectional genetics, we have shown previously that dI2 neurons are commissurally projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avraham et al., 2009</xref>). The lack of dI2-specific TFs impeded their genetic targeting. Hence, little is known about the wiring and physiological function of dI2 neurons.</p><p>The maintenance of stability and the coordination, precision, and timing of movements are regulated and modulated by the cerebellum. Anatomical and electrophysiological studies of cats and rodents revealed two major pathways ascending from neurons in the lumbar spinal cord to the cerebellum: the dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSCT) and ventral spinocerebellar tract (VSCT). DSCT neurons are considered to relay mainly proprioceptive information, while VSCT neurons are thought to relay internal spinal network information to the cerebellum along with proprioceptive data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jankowska and Hammar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spanne and Jörntell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stecina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). While subpopulations of DSCT neurons are genetically accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hantman and Jessell, 2010</xref>), the genetic inaccessibility of VSCT neurons hinders efforts to reveal their actual contribution to the regulatory functions of the cerebellum in locomotion and other motor behaviors.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the possible functions of dI2 neurons in chick motor behavior. Employing intersectional genetics in the chick spinal cord, we targeted dI2 neurons and found evidence implicating them in the control of stability during locomotion. There are several advantages to performing these studies in chicks. The patterning of neurons within the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jessell, 2000</xref>) and the spinocerebellar tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uehara et al., 2012</xref>) is conserved between mammals and birds. In addition, chicks use bipedal locomotion (evolved in humans and birds) that can be examined soon after hatching. To decode the circuitry and function of spinal INs, we developed a unique circuit-deciphering toolbox that enables neuron-specific targeting and tracing of circuits in the chick embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hadas et al., 2014</xref>), and we utilized kinematic analysis of overground bipedal stepping by the hatched chicks following silencing of dI2 neurons.</p><p>Our studies revealed that lumbar dl2 neurons receive synaptic inputs from inhibitory and excitatory premotor neurons (pre-MNs) and relay output to the cerebellar granular layer, pre-MNs in the contralateral spinal cord and the contralateral dI2 cells. In a kinematic analysis of overground stepping by posthatching day (P) 8 hatchlings after inhibition of dI2 neuronal activity by expression of the tetanus toxin light chain gene, the genetically manipulated hatchlings showed an unstable gait, demonstrating that dI2 neurons play a role in shaping and stabilizing the bipedal gait.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To define potential VSCT neurons within spinal INs, we defined the following criteria: (1) soma location in accordance with precerebellar neurons at the lumbar level, which were previously revealed by retrograde labeling experiments of the chick cerebellar lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uehara et al., 2012</xref>), (2) commissural neurons, (3) excitatory neurons, and (4) non-pre-MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osseward and Pfaff, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>). Based on these criteria, dI1c and dI2 neurons are likely candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bermingham et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yuengert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is further supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sakai et al., 2012</xref>, who demonstrated that in the embryonic day (E) 12 chick, the dI1 and dI2 axons project to the hindbrain and toward the cerebellum. In the current study, we focused on deciphering the circuitry and function of dI2 neurons and their possible association with VSCT.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>dI2 INs are mainly excitatory neurons with commissural axonal projections</title><p>To label dI2 neurons, axons, and terminals in the chick spinal cord, we used intersection between enhancers of two TFs expressed by dI2 – Ngn1 and Foxd3 – via the expression of two recombinases (Cre and FLPo) and double conditional reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We have shown previously that the combination of these enhancers reliably labels dI2 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avraham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hadas et al., 2014</xref>). The recombinases and the double conditional reporter plasmids were delivered via spatially restricted electroporation to the lumbar spinal cord at HH18. At E5, early postmitotic dI2 neurons migrate ventrally from the dorsolateral to the midlateral spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As they migrate ventrally, at E6, dI2 neurons assume a midlateral position along the dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Subsequently, dI2 neurons migrate medially, and at E17, comparable to postnatal day 4 (P4) of mice, most of them (70.7 and 71.5% at the sciatic and the crural levels, respectively) occupy lamina VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). At all rostrocaudal levels and embryonic stages, dI2 axons cross the floor plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). After crossing, dI2 axons extend rostrally for a few segments in the ventral funiculus (VF) and subsequently turn into the lateral funiculus (LF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avraham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).

To assess the diversity of dI2 neurons in the chick, the expression of dI2 TFs in dI2::GFP cells was analyzed at E5 before and during ventral migration, at E6 and E14. The early postmitotic dI2::GFP cells at E5 were a homogenous population defined by Foxd3<sup>+</sup>/Lhx1<sup>+</sup>/Pou4f1<sup>+</sup>/Pax2<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B, E</xref>). dI2 neurons that underwent ventral migration at E5, as well as at E6 and E14, express variable combinations of Lhx1, Pou4f1, and FoxP1/2/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). At E14, approximately 50% of dI2::GFP cells did not express any of the tested TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), suggesting that the early expression of TFs is required for cell fate acquisition, axon guidance, and target recognition, while their expression is not required after the establishment of the circuitry, as shown for other spinal INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bikoff et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, approximately 12% of ventrally migrating dI2 neurons (from E5 to E14) expressed Pax2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>). Pax2 is associated with a GABAergic inhibitory phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that a subpopulation of dI2 are inhibitory neurons. The distribution of excitatory and inhibitory dI2 neurons is also apparent at E17. In situ hybridization on cross-sections of the E17 dI2::GFP-labeled lumbar spinal cord using the vGlut2 probe revealed that 73% were vGlut2<sup>+</sup>, while the VIAAT probe, which labels GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory neurons, measured 27% VIAAT<sup>+</sup> dI2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>; N = 308 neurons from two embryos). Similar percentages of Gad2- and Slc6a5-dI2-expressing cells were also found in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delile et al., 2019</xref>). At E13–17 at the caudal lumbar level and at the level of the sciatic plexus, most dI2 neurons are located in the medial aspect of lamina VII. Approximately 91% of dI2 neurons are small-diameter neurons located in the lateral dorsal aspect of lamina VII, and 9% are large-diameter neurons. At the lumbar sciatic plexus level, large-diameter dI2 neurons are located mostly at the ventral aspect of lamina VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and at the level of the crural plexus in the ventral and dorsal aspect of lamina VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The location of the lumbar dI2 neurons, mainly lamina VII, is also apparent in posthatching chicks (P8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref> and D).

The division of large- and small-diameter lumbar dI2 neurons was not reflected in the expression of the tested TFs or in a specific neurotransmitter phenotype; the inhibitory/excitatory ratios were 0.297 ± 0.13 and 0.343 ± 0.02, for large- and small-diameter dI2 neurons, respectively. Hence, dI2 neurons consist of several subpopulations, as has been shown in other spinal INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bikoff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delile et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sweeney et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Subpopulation of dI2 neurons project to the cerebellum</title><p>To study the supraspinal targets of dI2 neurons, axonal and synaptic reporters were expressed in lumbar dI2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

A similar comparison of the combined ranges of angular excursions of the TMP joint during the normalized swing revealed that the average angle of the control group (49.34 ± 16.03) was significantly lower than the average of the TeTX-treated chicks (77 ± 22.15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Since the increased range of changes could be due to the effects of the substantial increase in body collapses during stepping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we excluded steps featuring whole-body collapses and reanalyzed the data. The data summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> show that the significant difference between controls and the <italic>TeTX</italic>-treated chicks in the range of the knee height and the TMP angle excursions was maintained.

The lack of genetic access to VSCT neurons hampers efforts to elucidate their role in locomotion. Using a genetic toolbox to dissect the circuitry and manipulate neuronal activity in the chick spinal cord, we studied spinal INs with VSCT characteristics. The main finding in our study is that dI2 neurons in the chick lumbar spinal cord are commissural neurons that innervate pre-MNs at the contralateral lumbar and brachial spinal levels and granule neurons in the ipsilateral cerebellum. Hence, a subpopulation of dI2 neurons form part of the avian VSCT. Targeted silencing of dI2 neurons leads to impaired stepping in P8 hatchlings. We described the spatial distribution of subpopulations of dI2 neurons, deciphered their connectomes, mapped the trajectory of their projections to the cerebellum, and suggested possible mechanisms for the gait perturbation resulting from their genetic silencing, as discussed below.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The connectome of dI2 neurons</title><p>Using the intersection between genetic drivers and spatially restricted delivery of reporters to define lumbar and brachial neurons, we identified several targets of dI2 lumbar neurons. Lumbar dI2 neurons innervate contralateral lumbar dI2 neurons as well as commissural and noncommissural lumbar pre-MNs. This connectivity may influence the bilateral spinal output circuitry at the lumbar cord (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bras et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jankowska and Hammar, 2013</xref>). Moreover, the ascending axons of lumbar dI2 neurons give off gray matter collaterals innervating contralateral dI2 neurons and commissural and noncommissural pre-MNs throughout the brachial spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Therefore, lumbar dI2 neurons may also contribute to the inter-enlargement coupling described between the segments of the spinal cord that move the legs and the wings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Valenzuela et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruder et al., 2016</xref> for forelimb to hindlimb coupling connectivity in mice).</p><p>We demonstrated that lumbar dI2 cells receive sensory innervation, premotor inhibitory and excitatory innervation, and innervation from contralateral lumbar dI2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Thus, lumbar dI2 neurons can provide the cerebellum and the contralateral pre-MNs with proprioceptive information, copies of motor commands delivered from the ipsilateral pre-MNs, and integrated information from contralateral dI2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>).</p><p>Our wiring-decoding studies are based on the availability of enhancer elements that direct expression in specific spinal INs. The lack of enhancer elements for known pre-MNs, such as V2, precluded their analysis. Future experiments using identified regulatory elements that direct expression in two other pre-MN populations, the dI3 and V0 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avraham et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gard et al., 2017</xref>), will reveal the extent of premotor information relayed by dI2 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>dI2 subpopulations</title><p>Our study reveals two anatomically distinct subpopulations of dI2 neurons: precerebellar projection dI2 cells, which also innervate spinal targets along the entire extent of the spinal cord, and propriospinal dI2 cells, which innervate targets within the lumbar level. The laminar and medial/lateral positions of the two dI2 populations are similar, and we did not find subtype-specific expression of the known dI2 TFs. Contrary to our findings, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Osseward et al., 2021</xref>) has shown that tract and propriospinal INs in the mouse spinal cord differ in the localization of their somata along the mediolateral axis and their transcription of TFs. Tract neurons reside in the lateral spinal cord and express group-N TFs, while propriospinal neurons settle at the medial spinal cord and express group-Z TFs. Several reasons may explain the discrepancy between our results and those of Osseward et al. The analysis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Osseward et al., 2021</xref>) was applied to numerous cardinal populations of neurons but excluded dI2 neurons. Hence, dI2 may represent an exception. In addition, our study revealed that precerebellar dI2 neurons share two wiring patterns: tract and propriospinal neurons. Applying single-cell RNA sequencing to dI2 neurons will reveal whether short- and long-range targeting in dI2 neurons are characterized by distinct transcriptomes or by a shared N + Z transcriptome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Physiological role of dI2 neurons</title><p>The unclear genetic origin of physiologically equivalent lumbar VSCT neurons has prevented a better understanding of their role in hindlimb locomotion. Our wiring and neuronal-silencing studies implicated dI2 as a significant contributor to the regularity and stability of locomotion in P8 hatchlings. The kinematic analysis of TeTX-treated hatchlings revealed imbalanced locomotion with occasional collapses, increased stride variability, a wide-base gait, and variable limb movements during stepping.</p><p>The mechanisms accounting for impaired stepping following dI2 neuron silencing are still unknown. One of the possible mechanisms is that silencing dI2 neurons perturbs the delivery of peripheral and intrinsic feedback to the cerebellum, leading to unreliable updating of the motor output produced by the locomotor networks, thereby impairing bipedal stepping. Another possible mechanism is based on the similarity of the gait instabilities of TeTX-treated hatchlings to ataxic motor disorders. Mammalian VSCT neurons receive descending input from reticulospinal, rubrospinal, and vestibulospinal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bras et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jankowska and Hammar, 2013</xref>). Neurons from the lateral vestibular nucleus have been reported to innervate extensor motoneurons at the lumbar level, as well as INs residing at medial lamina VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murray et al., 2018</xref>), the location where dI2 neurons were found to reside in our study. Thus, the vestibulospinal tract may convey input directly to the ipsilateral motor neurons and indirectly to contralateral motor neurons through dI2 neurons that innervate contralateral pre-MNs.</p><p>The local spinal connections between dI2 neurons and the contralateral pre-MNs and contralateral dI2 neurons may serve an important component of coordinated limb movements. dI2 synapses were found on both ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting pre-MNs, both within their segmental level and at the brachial level, which regulates the movement of the wings. Thus, dI2 neurons may affect the motor output of the contralateral and ipsilateral sides of the cord by contacting commissural pre-MNs. Specific targeting of dI2 subpopulations – the precerebellar versus the propriospinal dI2 cells – is necessary to determine the relative contribution of dI2 subpopulations to the impaired stepping phenotype. However, there is no available genetic technique for differentially targeting the two subpopulations. In addition, the fact that the precerebellar dI2 neurons also innervate the lumbar spinal cord precludes the use of retrogradely target-derived neuronal activity modifiers.</p><p>In summary, our mapping studies of dI2 neurons and their connectomes, followed by characterization of the effects of their silencing on bipedal stepping, offer new insights into the function of dI2 neurons in vertebrates. We suggest that lumbar dI2 neurons not only relay sensory and intrinsic spinal network information to the cerebellum but also act as active mediators of motor functions at the lumbar segments and at the wing-controlling brachial segments of the spinal cord. Further circuit-deciphering studies of the constituents of subpopulations of dI2 cells, their targets, and their descending inputs are required to extend our understanding of the function of dI2 subpopulations in motor control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Embryos were removed at E13, and the spinal cord and cerebellum were isolated. The tissue was cleared using the iDISCO technique as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renier et al., 2014</xref>). The mCherry-expressing neurons were stained by application of an anti-RFP antibody followed by Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated donkey secondary antibody. Each staining step included 3 days of incubation with the antibody and subsequent washing for 2 days. Then, the cleared tissue was divided into three segments: a lumbar spinal segment, a brachial spinal segment, and a segment including the brainstem and cerebellum. Each sample was placed in a quartz imaging chamber (LaVision BioTec) and scanned by a LaVision Ultramicroscope II light-sheet microscope operated by ImspectorPro software (LaVision BioTec). An Andor Neo sCMOS camera was used for 16-bit image acquisition. The imaging was performed at 2× magnification with a 0.5–1 µm step size and a green excitation filter (peak – 525 nm/width − 50 nm). Then, for 3D reconstruction and analysis of the samples, the resulting image z-stacks were converted to IMS format using Imaris File Converter (version 9.5). Because of the sample size, several z-stacks were required for full acquisition of each sample; they were stitched together into one z-stack by Imaris Stitcher. Then, the files were uploaded to Imaris (9.6 version) for advanced visualization and analysis. dI2 axons were tracked using the filament tracer feature in semiautomatic mode. After tracking, Imaris was used to generate videos and snapshots describing different features of the analyzed samples. Finally, text, arrows, and other symbols were added using Adobe AfterEffects software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Synaptic marker validation</title><p>Validation of SV2-GFP reporter specificity was performed by using Imaris software. High-resolution confocal images of spinal cord sections, with clear SV2-GFP reporter expression and synaptotagmin (syn) immunolabeling, were used to quantify the degree of overlap of GFP<sup>+</sup> terminals and syn<sup>+</sup>-labeled boutons. Both signals were three-dimensionally reconstructed, and we used the automatic quantification abilities of Imaris, further validated by additional manual counting, to quantify the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> presynaptic terminals containing at least one syn<sup>+</sup> bouton. In addition, the volume of GFP<sup>+</sup> presynaptic terminals was documented to explore a possible dependence between terminal volume and syn<sup>+</sup> bouton containment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>AP staining</title><p>The treated embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde–PBS for 24 hr at 4°C and washed twice with PBS for 30 min at 4°C. The fixed embryos were incubated at 65°C in PBS for 8–16 hr to inactivate endogenous AP activity. The treated embryos were washed with 100 mM Tris–Cl (pH 9.5) containing 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and the residual placental alkaline phosphatase activity was visualized by incubating the embryos with NBT/BCIP (Roche) in the same buffer at 4°C for 24 hr. After extensively washing the embryos with PBS–5 mM EDTA, the spinal cord was imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>PRV infection and CTB retrograde labeling</title><p>From the attenuated PRV Bartha strain, we used two isogenic recombinants that express enhanced GFP (PRV152) and monomeric red fluorescent protein (PRV614). The viruses were harvested from Vero cell cultures at titers of 4 × 10<sup>8</sup>, 7 × 10<sup>8</sup>, and 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU/mL). Viral stocks were stored at −80°C. Injections of 3 μL of PRV152 or PRV614 were made into the thigh, pectoralis, or distal wing musculature of E13 or E14 chick embryos using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton; Reno, NV, USA) equipped with a 33-gauge needle. The embryos were incubated for 36–40 hr and sacrificed for analysis. For spinocerebellar projecting neuron labeling, we used a replication-defective HSV (TK<sup>-</sup>) that contains a lacZ reporter. The virus was injected into the cerebellum of E12–15 embryos in ovo, and the embryos were incubated for another 40–48 hr. Alternatively, CTB conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher) was injected into the cerebellum of E12–15 embryos together with the virus for visualization of both precerebellular neurons and the upstream neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Force test</title><p>Muscle strength was evaluated using the measurement of the slope at which the chicks fell from a mesh surface as it was gradually tilted up from the horizontal. This test was repeated for each chick at least three times, and the average falling angle was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of left-right phase</title><p>Stride duration was measured as the time from right toe-off/foot-off to the next right toe-off (as a complete stride cycle for the right leg), and the ‘half-cycle’ duration was measured as the time from right toe-off to the time of left toe-off. The following formula was used to calculate the phase: ((LeftToeOff_1 - RightToeOff_1)/(RightToeOff_2 – RightToeOff_1))*360.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Behavioral tests and analysis</title><p>The embryos were bilaterally electroporated and then allowed to develop and hatch in a properly humidified and heated incubator. Afterwards, within 32 hr after hatching, the hatchling chicks were imprinted on the trainer. The P8 chicks were filmed in slow motion (240 fps) while freely walking (side and top views). The following parameters were scored: (1) weight; (2) foot grip strength; and (3) kinematic parameters during overground locomotion: (a) swing velocity, (b) swing and stance duration, (c) phase of footfalls, (d) heights of the knee and TMP joints, (e) angles of the TMP and ankle joints, (f) stride width (distance between feet during the double stance phase), and (g) landing angle.</p><p>Using semiautomated MATLAB-based tracking software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hedrick, 2008</xref>), several points of interest were encoded. The leg joints as well as the eye and the tail were tracked. The position of these reference points was used for computational analysis using in-house MATLAB code for calculating different basic locomotion parameters (e.g., stick diagrams, velocity, joint trajectory, angles, range, and elevation), step patterns, and degrees of similarity. The landing angle was calculated as the angle between the imaginary line connecting the knee and the TMP joints and the ground, at the end of the swing phase. Dunnett’s test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunnett, 1955</xref>) was used to perform multiple comparisons of group means following one-way ANOVA. Circular statistics were used for analyses of angular data utilizing Oriana (KCS, version 4).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>none</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments involved with animals were conducted in accordance with the designated Experiments in Animals Ethic Committee policies and under its approval.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Weight, force, and number of electroporated cells.</title><p>See statistical tests in Supplementary Statistical analysis tables.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-62001-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-62001-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and the supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Haya Falk for PRV purification; Alona Katzir, Cole Bendor, Mevaseret Avital, Sapir Shevah, Eitan Yisraeli, Ruth Segal, Fedaa Bazan, and Eden Kimchi for technical assistance; Nadav Yayon for assistance with the light sheet microscopy; and Michael O’Donovan for comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David SK Magnuson (Reviewer #1); Julien Bouvier (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in eLife but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in eLife, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The three reviewers and I have carefully read your manuscript and we all have found a great interest in your results.

A genetic toolbox is used taking advantage of the electroporation technique applied to the embryos. The findings include a fairly convincing connectome for dl2 neurons and a functional phenotype that is, unfortunately, rather unsatisfying. The investigators conclude that dl2 interneurons regulate &quot;stability&quot; of bipedal stepping in the chick, which is fine, but the analysis misses an opportunity to more fully explore what the instability involves and thus to perhaps shed more light on the likely roles of this neuron population. The concerns/issues 3 and 4 below focus on this issue and the need for additional careful analysis of the behavior that will allow the phenotype to be more precisely described or ascribed to some aspect of stepping that might guide future studies in other models. For example, can the link between partial collapse and over-extensions be made more solid and thus argue that reduced extensor gain might be what results in the instability? What other analysis could be performed using the existing data/video to better describe the behavioral phenotype?</p><p>Concerns/issues:</p><p>1. The connectome part of the work appears solid and supports the concept that a sub population of the population are likely VSCT neurons, that the non VSCT neurons receive the bulk of the afferent input and that these neurons project to contralateral dl2 neurons (some which may be VSCT) and other premotor neurons. Anatomically, the only concern is that no distinctions were made between the lumbar and brachial populations, and if differences in these populations exist, it would be important and interesting to describe them.</p><p>2. Figure 2 Characterization of dl2/VSCT neurons as being primarily large dl2 neurons is quite convincing, and the observation that the dl2 neurons account for 10% of the VSCT axons is also of interest and quite compelling. A question arises, however, about the source, rostrocaudally, of the VSCT neurons and tract. Is the 10% for the total or for a specific level or levels? Can more be said/quantified about differences in these populations at different spinal levels?</p><p>3. Whole-body collapses and subsequent over-extensions are important and speak to changes in reflex arc and motor output. The statement &quot;usually followed by&quot; over-extension should be followed-up. Can this be further quantified? Are the two events linked or distinct, and did over-extensions happen in the absence of collapses?</p><p>4. These issues mesh with the lower knee height and angle of the TMP joint, even when collapses are excluded. It appears as though the control system to maintain muscle shortening (force output of extensors) is altered. I agree that stability is compromised, but could we go further to state that the compromise is due to extensor gain control?<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This work addresses the possibility that developmentally-characterized di2 neurons contribute to the ventral spinocerebellar tract and regulate stepping in the chick. The work is sound considering that most information we have on spinal subtypes are for ventrally-born and local circuit interneurons (i.e. motor related), but less is known about the dorsally-born types and about long-range projecting neurons that link the spinal cord with higher integrative centers. Here, using a combination of cell-type specific manipulations, circuit tracing tools and kinematic analysis of gaits in the chick authors propose that spinal di2 interneurons contain multiple subgroups including a population that sends projection to the cerebellum. Silencing di2 neurons overal leads to impaired stepping.</p><p>Overall, the strategy is sound and there is potential novelty that make this paper a suitable candidate for <italic>eLife</italic> provided the weaknesses in the scientific demonstration listed below can be first addressed, experimentally and/or by additional analysis. Equally importantly also, the work suffers from a SEVERE lack of clarity (writing, figures, results). Both must be addressed for this paper to be considered further.</p><p>I start with the scientific weaknesses:</p><p>1. Synaptic connections rely mostly on the anatomical overlap between di2 cells and the synaptic field of their putative pre-synaptic partners. While this is indeed suggestive, it is not enough to ascertain actual synaptic connections, and even less so in a comparative manner between the different groups. Furthermore, some tracers (e.g PRVmCherry) do not seem to be under a synapse-specific promoter, so labelled elements might just as well be passing fibers. Clearer evidence of actual connections should be provided, functionally if possible or at the very least by showing clearer putative boutons onto neuronal somata/dendrites, quantifying them and quantifying differences between input cell types. Current figures (2F / 3B', C', D' / 4C, D', E', F') are not sufficiently convincing since we see only one cell and can barely detect boutons visually on some of them (not to mention that pseudo-colors keep changing, see other comment below). In addition, please consider using the term &quot;putative&quot; or &quot;presumed&quot; synapses, contacts and connections throughout the study.</p><p>2. The loss of function and gait analysis is stronger and convincingly presented. However, unless I missed it, the strategy silences all di2 neurons but cannot discriminate the contributions of the pre-cerebellar ones. This poses problems for the interpretation of the data. Since this paper is about either subpopulations of di2, or the vSCT (see other comment about general scope of the work), it would be more robust if more specific silencing was included. It is currently assumed that one likely mechanism for the disturbed gait owes to the function of di2 as precerebellar neurons (line 385, 389) but the phenotype could also, or even entirely, be due to their proprio-spinal connectivity. This is a major caveat.</p><p>On top of this, writing and data presentation MUST be substantially improved on multiple aspects:</p><p>3. Please have the manuscript deeply proofread. In addition to numerous English mistakes (missing &quot;the&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, plural and singulars, lots of unnecessary comas, etc…) examples of confused writing include (non-exhaustive list):</p><p>(a) Line 128: what does this phrase mean (&quot;TF expression is redundant&quot;…).</p><p>(b) Line 159: I don't understand here, the Di2 ascend to the cerebellum, cross the midline to the targeted di2?? To which Di2 do authors refer to here, it sounds like they are in the cerebellum, or that the ascending Di2 redescend to the spinal cord…</p><p>(c) The term targeted is in fact used alternatively and confusingly to refer to either &quot;manipulated&quot; cells, &quot;synaptically-targeted&quot; cells, there is also &quot;targeted overground locomotion&quot;,….</p><p>(d) Stage HH18 is sometimes referred to as E3. Please be consistent throughout.</p><p>(e) When describing inputs onto di2, add &quot;neurons&quot; (i.e. &quot;onto di2 neurons&quot;).</p><p>4. I would appreciate more background on di2 neurons in the introduction and why these have been investigated. Currently, most of this is given in the first paragraph of the results (lines 91-100 and also line 103). Also, it is stated first that &quot;the role of di2 neurons is elusive due to the lack of genetic targeting means&quot; (line 59). This contradicts the later statement that &quot;the progenitor pdi2 expresses [various transcription factors]&quot;, and that the &quot;post mitotic di2 are defined by…&quot; (line 103). Please clarify what is known and not known about di2 already in the introduction.</p><p>5. Related to the above, it is not sufficiently clear what is investigated here. The genetic identity of ventral spinocerebellar neurons? Or the diversity of di2 neurons? In the way the introduction is written, it gives the impression that it is the former, but then functional investigations are not specific enough (since they are targeted to the overall di2 population, see dedicated comment later). Authors should revise to make clearer what is the scope of the work.</p><p>6. Histology Figures should be made more convincing, self-explanatory, and to a higher standard.</p><p>(a) Anatomical landmarks MUST be paced on ALL figures, e.g: the midline and minimal nuclei of the cerebellum, the deep cerebellar nuclei should be indicated in Figure S4,… Also, please give the orientation axis on ALL figures (especially the ones illustrating large territories, like 2B, 4A).</p><p>(b) Add the CTB or HSV tracer on Figure 2A and check coherence: I believe for instance that HSP is wrongly stated instead of HSV in Figure 2D and PRV is wrongly stated instead of CTB in Figure 2F (and there might be other confusions throughout).</p><p>(c) It is extremely confusing that histology pseudo-colors are sometimes changed from one related figure to the other, for unclear reasons (e.g. 2B, 2B', 2C, also 2C and S4A…). Consistency will help the reader go through all panels and figures comparatively.</p><p>(d) Figures must be addressed in proper order. This also applies to supplemental figures. Otherwise, it gives the impression we have missed something.</p><p>(e) What is the rationale for plotting the overlap in area versus volume (Figure 2H, I)? If overlap with area shows a higher percentage than with volume, does it mean that the overlap is only limited to a given A/P plane? I'm really confused about this representation and its meaning.</p><p>7. Authors should avoid relying on subjective formulations like &quot;that reside at the lateral dorsal aspect of lamina VII&quot;. Instead, they MUST demonstrate the positioning of Di2 neurons into the different spinal laminae with some form of quantitative measurements. This is currently just an &quot;impression&quot; that large, precerebellar Di2 are more ventral, in lamina VII and possibly VIII but without the representation of lamina borders on figures, this information cannot be appreciated by the reader. It is all essential that these borders are depicted in Figures and neurons be quantitatively allocated to each laminae. In addition/alternatively, authors should report the average D/V position of the different subtypes and test for significant differences to make the case of different spatially-confined populations stronger.</p><p>8. FoxD3 expression on Supplemental Figure 2B is not convincing. It is also not reported in the statistics of Figure 1E. Do we have to assume that all di2 investigated here are FoxD3-positive? If so, one would need a better illustration and quantifications should be given. Otherwise, I would suggest to simply rely on literature and removing that Figure S1B which is not helping. On other panels of that supplemental Figure 2, please add arrow/arrowheads on all neurons that are or not co-labelled so we can appreciate co-labelling.</p><p>9. The demonstration that di2 are excitatory is essential. It is the title of a paragraph (line 102), thus I think that the corresponding data with the neurotransmitters (Vglut2, GAD) would deserve to be in the main Figures. Also, the chosen illustration only shows ONE double-labelled cell with Vglut2. Authors should be able to show a field of view that more convincingly conveys the message with more cells.<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study by Haimson et al., aims at examining the diversity of dI2 interneurons and their role in coordinating activity across difference region of the spinal cord and in reporting back activity to the brain. The results show that dI2 interneurons comprise different sub-classes based on their axonal projections, soma diameter and transmitter identity. They also show that some dI2 interneurons project rostrally from the lumbar spinal cord and make putative synaptic contacts with other dI2 interneurons in the brachial spinal cord on their way to the cerebellum. Finally, it is shown that some dI2 interneurons receive putative inputs from DRG neurons and may serve to transmit movement-related feedback. An indiscriminate silencing of dI2 interneurons results in instability of locomotion. Overall, this study reports some interesting observations by showing the heterogeneity of dI2 interneurons and their potential function. I have the following concerns:</p><p>1) 12% express Pax2 and are considered inhibitory. However, Gad is expressed in only 25% of dI2 interneurons while vGlut is expressed in 88%. These proportions suggest that there are dI2 neurons that co-express vGlut and Gad. Is this the case? Are there additional inhibitory dI2 neurons in addition to those expressing Pax2 which could explain the fact that Gad labels 25% of dI2 neurons. These points need some clarifications and discussion.</p><p>2) Of all dI2 interneurons, 91% are small diameter and 9% are large diameter neurons – large diameter neurons are mostly apparent in the lumbar spinal cord. The small and large diameter dI2 neurons cannot be differentiated by their expression of TFs, but can be distinguished by their transmitter identity? Is the proportion of small and large diameter neurons the same along the spinal cord?</p><p>3) Do all dI2 neurons receive putative synaptic contacts from DRG neurons? Unless I have missed it, it would be helpful to provide quantification of the number of small vs large diameter dI2 neurons with regard to the different putative synaptic contacts they receive from DRG neurons, dI2 and V1 interneurons.</p><p>4) Lines 218-220: It is stated that DRG putative contacts are mainly targeting dorsal dI2 neurons while ventral ones receive virtually no contacts. Since large diameter VSCT dI2 neurons are located ventrally, they do not seem to receive direct sensory information. However, the authors conclude that VSCT dI2 neurons receive sensory input (lines 227-228) and also in the Discussion. There seem to be a mismatch between the results and the conclusion drawn by the authors (lines 374-377). Unless I am missing something here, this is not consisting with the conclusions of this study. Please clarify.</p><p>5) The silencing experiments are interesting, however it is unclear which sub-class of dI2 neurons and at what level (lumbar vs brachial spinal cord or cerebellum) the observed behavioral perturbations take place. It is possible to selectively silence excitatory vs inhibitory or only VSCT neurons to provide some link between dI2 sub-classes and behavioral perturbations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62001.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The three reviewers and I have carefully read your manuscript and we all have found a great interest in your results.

Also the discussion on the main findings and their limitations should be revised in order to take into account reviewers' comments.</p><p>More specifically, the authors are asked to be more accurate/careful in describing</p><p>1) The motor phenotype,</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript we described that there was a higher variability in the knee joint trajectory and TMP angle during the swing phase, a significantly higher number of collapses, and a wider base stepping in the manipulated compared to the control chickens. The swing velocity and the inter-limb phase relation during stepping in the manipulated chickens were similar to those of the un-manipulated controls. In the revised version of the manuscript, we analyzed two additional aspects of the motor phenotypes: (1) we examined whether slipping over the walking surface contributed to the observed instability (e.g. Clark and Higham, 2011, Daley and Biewener, 2006). (2) according to the request of Reviewer 1, we reanalyzed the occurrence of collapses during stepping and their relation to over-extensions.</p><p>1) Slipping and instability: Analyses of the landing angles during stepping revealed no significant differences between the manipulated and control chickens. Moreover, the angles preceding a collapse were not smaller but rather slightly higher than those that did not precede a collapse. Collectively these findings suggest that the instability does not involve over ground slipping. These analyses are shown in the new figure 7—figure supplement 2 and described on p. 34 lines 396-407, in the methods section lines 671-673.</p><p>2) Collapse and over-extension: Our analyses revealed that 65% of the collapses were not preceded by or followed by overextensions. Only 22.5% of the collapses, were followed by an overextension, and there was a high variability between chickens. In 12.5% of the cases the collapses were preceded by an overextension. These new analyses are summarized on p. 30-33 lines 358-369.</p><p>Together, the new analyses strengthen our original inferences outlined in the discussion, that the motor phenotype can be attributed to perturbed spinal information supply to the cerebellum. Furthermore, interference with the descending regulation of spinal motor output, or a lack of proper direct input to intraspinal premotor neurons. The few overextensions observed after collapses, may reflect a post-collapse compensation of the extensor drive (p. 30 lines 368-369).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) the identity of which sub-population of neurons is considered to be responsible for the locomotor behavior (di2 neurons vs vSCT neurons),</p></disp-quote><p>Similar to other spinal cardinal populations of INs, dI2 neurons consistof several subpopulations. Among them, the VSCT dI2 and the propriospinal dI2. The division to these subclasses is based on the size of the neuron somata (larger versus small cell diameter), and the intra- and supra-spinal projection pattern. The lack of genetic means that enable targeting these dI2 sub-populations, hinders the analyses of their relative contribution to stable locomotion. An alternative experimental paradigm is to target specifically the VSCT dI2 by target-derived activation of neural-modulators. Namely, to activate neural modulator in dI2 neurons retrogradely from the cerebellum or from the contralateral lumbar spinal cord (injection of PRV-Cre into the cerebellum). In the original manuscript we demonstrated that dI2 axons send numerous collaterals along the entire extent of the spinal cord. The origin of these collaterals, either from the VSCT or the propriospinal dI2 neurons, could not be accurately resolved in the original manuscript. We suspected that the VSCT dI2 neurons also innervate the lumbar spinal cord, which may undermine the use of target-derived neural-modulators activation.</p><p>In order to resolve the connectivity of VSCT dI2 neurons, we employed lumbar-specific sparse labelling of dI2, and followed in a single-cell resolution, their entire lumbar to cerebellum trajectory patterns, utilizing light sheet microscopy. The new data are presented in the new figure 3, four supplementary videos, supplementary figure 3—figure supplement 1A (p. 15-16, lines 199-222). Our new data provides evidence that VSCT dI2 neurons send collaterals that innervate the contralateral targets along the entire path, from the lumbar spinal cord to the brainstem and the cerebellar nuclei.</p><p>This new analysis questions that validity of target-derived silencing of dI2 subpopulations, either via retrograde activation from the cerebellum or the contralateral lumbar spinal cord, since this approach will target both the propriospinal lumbar dI2 and the VSCT dI2 neurons. Future experiments, aimed to uncover the transcriptome of dI2, may provide genetic means to target dI2 subpopulations and subsequently to manipulate their neuronal activity. We discuss the relative potential contribution of these two subpopulations to stepping on pages 42-43 (lines 473-489).</p><p>In this regard, It should be noted that the physiological role of other spinal interneurons that control motor activity, like V1, V2, V3, V0, dI3 and dI1 (Yuengert et al., 2015, Gosgnach et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2008, Talpalar et al., 2013, Bui et al., 2013, Crone et al., 2008), was previously studied via genetic targeting using regulatory elements of transcription factors expressed early in their development, similar to our targeting and silencing approach. Hence, our wiring and behavioral studies fall within the scope of the experimental strategies in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) the anatomical data of the neurons of interest, possibly including their neurotransmitter phenotype,</p></disp-quote><p>The new light sheet microscopy analyses (figures 3, figure 3—figure supplement 1A and the four supplementary videos) provide insights into this question. To complement these, we also preformed new in situ mRNA localization using vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) RNA probes to detect both GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory interneurons. We also preformed new in situ hybridization experiments with a vGglut2 probe for detection of excitatory interneurons. The proportion of the excitatory/inhibitory dI2 neurons is 73%/27%. The new data are presented in figure 1G-I and in p.11 lines 150-153.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The quantification and characterization of the synaptic contacts and their potential functional role.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript we have used two criteria for detection of synaptic contacts to and from dI2: (1) The likelihood of connectivity was examined by spatial overlap of axonal terminals from the presumed presynaptic neurons and the somata of the post synaptic neurons. (2) Detection of synaptic boutons, labelled by a synaptic reporter, on the somatodendritic membrane of the post synaptic neurons. We also included an image showing an overlap between a synaptic reporter and a synaptic protein (former figure 3C, current figure 4C’).</p><p>In the revised manuscript we thoroughly tested the validity of the genetically-delivered synaptic reporter by quantifying the co-labelled staining of synaptic reporter with synaptotagmin. We used confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction using IMARIS software to score signal overlap. We tested the co-labelling of dI2::SV2-GFP and synaptotagmin in dI2 neurons synapses on contralateral pre-motoneurons. From 144 genetically labeled boutons, 121 (84%) were synaptotagmin<sup>+</sup>. The synaptotagmin<sup>-</sup> boutons were significantly smaller. We set a volume threshold, so that small volume SV2-GFP boutons were not considered as synapses throughout the study (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and p. 20 lines 244-249).</p><p>Thus, we are confident that our synaptic reporter staining coupled with the labelling of the somata of presumed target neurons, reliably represent anatomical synapses. We also would like to note that similar anatomical-synaptic analysis, are the convention in the field of spinal circuitry (Baek et al., 2019, Dougherty et al., 2013, Goetz et al., 2015, Ruder et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a well-put-together manuscript describing carefully performed circuitry dissection and functional analysis of dl2 neurons in the chick.

The statement &quot;usually followed by&quot; over-extension should be followed-up. Can this be further quantified? Are the two events linked or distinct, and did over-extensions happen in the absence of collapses?</p><p>4. These issues mesh with the lower knee height and angle of the TMP joint, even when collapses are excluded. It appears as though the control system to maintain muscle shortening (force output of extensors) is altered. I agree that stability is compromised, but could we go further to state that the compromise is due to extensor gain control?</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to the general comment #1 above. We omitted the term “usually followed” and modified the text accordingly (p. 30-33, lines 358-369).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This work addresses the possibility that developmentally-characterized di2 neurons contribute to the ventral spinocerebellar tract and regulate stepping in the chick. The work is sound considering that most information we have on spinal subtypes are for ventrally-born and local circuit interneurons (i.e. motor related), but less is known about the dorsally-born types and about long-range projecting neurons that link the spinal cord with higher integrative centers. Here, using a combination of cell-type specific manipulations, circuit tracing tools and kinematic analysis of gaits in the chick authors propose that spinal di2 interneurons contain multiple subgroups including a population that sends projection to the cerebellum. Silencing di2 neurons overal leads to impaired stepping.</p><p>Overall, the strategy is sound and there is potential novelty that make this paper a suitable candidate for eLife provided the weaknesses in the scientific demonstration listed below can be first addressed, experimentally and/or by additional analysis. Equally importantly also, the work suffers from a SEVERE lack of clarity (writing, figures, results). Both must be addressed for this paper to be considered further.</p><p>I start with the scientific weaknesses:</p><p>1. Synaptic connections rely mostly on the anatomical overlap between di2 cells and the synaptic field of their putative pre-synaptic partners. While this is indeed suggestive, it is not enough to ascertain actual synaptic connections, and even less so in a comparative manner between the different groups. Furthermore, some tracers (e.g PRVmCherry) do not seem to be under a synapse-specific promoter, so labelled elements might just as well be passing fibers. Clearer evidence of actual connections should be provided, functionally if possible or at the very least by showing clearer putative boutons onto neuronal somata/dendrites, quantifying them and quantifying differences between input cell types. Current figures (2F / 3B', C', D' / 4C, D', E', F') are not sufficiently convincing since we see only one cell and can barely detect boutons visually on some of them (not to mention that pseudo-colors keep changing, see other comment below). In addition, please consider using the term &quot;putative&quot; or &quot;presumed&quot; synapses, contacts and connections throughout the study.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to the general comment #4 above (the quantification and characterization of the synaptic contacts and their potential functional role).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that demonstrating functional connections is the gold standard for synaptic connectivity. However, we would like to note that the chick is not a common model organism for studying neuronal circuitry and post embryonic motor behavior in genetically manipulated embryos. Hence, many of the circuit-deciphering tools are not yet applicable to avian. The tools that we employed for decoding circuitry in the chick spinal cord, were mostly developed and implemented by us (Hadas et al., 2014). The main caveat is the non-germline targeting of specific neurons via electroporation. The efficiency of transgenesis via electroporation varies from 10-60%. Hence, the number of labelled putative synapses between two genetically-labeled neurons is markedly lower from the expected number in germline targeted mice. In addition, performance of in vitro recording from spinal cord neurons in chick, for demonstrating functional connectivity, is limited to early stages of embryonic development and are not applicable post E12 (O'Donovan et al., 1994). At this stage the network has not yet matured. Our efforts to modify the experimental conditions has not yet materialized.</p><p>As to the use of PRV-cherry to label contacts between pre-MNs and dI2, we agree with reviewer that this type of contacts is suggestive. We noted this in line 268-270. However, the use of 3D confocal imaging enables us to distinguish between a terminal and a passing-by axon. Importantly, in the following experiment we also use synaptic reporters expressed in two type of pre-MNs (dI1 and V1) to provide supportive evidence to the connection between pre-MNs and dI2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The loss of function and gait analysis is stronger and convincingly presented. However, unless I missed it, the strategy silences all di2 neurons but cannot discriminate the contributions of the pre-cerebellar ones. This poses problems for the interpretation of the data. Since this paper is about either subpopulations of di2, or the vSCT (see other comment about general scope of the work), it would be more robust if more specific silencing was included. It is currently assumed that one likely mechanism for the disturbed gait owes to the function of di2 as precerebellar neurons (line 385, 389) but the phenotype could also, or even entirely, be due to their proprio-spinal connectivity. This is a major caveat.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to the general comment #2 above (The identity of which sub-population of neurons is considered to be responsible for the locomotor behavior).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On top of this, writing and data presentation MUST be substantially improved on multiple aspects:</p><p>3. Please have the manuscript deeply proofread. In addition to numerous English mistakes (missing &quot;the&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, plural and singulars, lots of unnecessary comas, etc…) examples of confused writing include (non-exhaustive list):</p><p>(a) Line 128: what does this phrase mean (&quot;TF expression is redundant&quot;…)</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this to: “…their expression is not required after the establishment of the circuitry”. The manuscript was deeply edited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Line 159: I don't understand here, the Di2 ascend to the cerebellum, cross the midline to the targeted di2?? To which Di2 do authors refer to here, it sounds like they are in the cerebellum, or that the ascending Di2 redescend to the spinal cord…</p></disp-quote><p>This was a typo. The corrected sentence is “…and cross back to the other side of the cerebellum ipsilaterally to the targeted granular neurons”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) The term targeted is in fact used alternatively and confusingly to refer to either &quot;manipulated&quot; cells, &quot;synaptically-targeted&quot; cells, there is also &quot;targeted overground locomotion&quot;,….</p></disp-quote><p>The word targeted in the sentence: &quot;targeted overground locomotion&quot; is indeed redundant and was omitted. We reduced the use of “target” to indicate the putative post-synaptic neurons of dI2, throughout the manuscript. However, we didn’t eliminate it completely, since the use of “target” in conjunction to both genetic-targeting and synaptic-target is acceptable and very common in the field of spinal circuitry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) Stage HH18 is sometimes referred to as E3. Please be consistent throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>We use now the term HH18 throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(e) When describing inputs onto di2, add &quot;neurons&quot; (i.e. &quot;onto di2 neurons&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>The term ״neurons״ is now added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I would appreciate more background on di2 neurons in the introduction and why these have been investigated. Currently, most of this is given in the first paragraph of the results (lines 91-100 and also line 103). Also, it is stated first that &quot;the role of di2 neurons is elusive due to the lack of genetic targeting means&quot; (line 59). This contradicts the later statement that &quot;the progenitor pdi2 expresses [various transcription factors]&quot;, and that the &quot;post mitotic di2 are defined by…&quot; (line 103). Please clarify what is known and not known about di2 already in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>A new background paragraph was added to the introduction on p. 3, lines 59-70.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Related to the above, it is not sufficiently clear what is investigated here. The genetic identity of ventral spinocerebellar neurons? Or the diversity of di2 neurons? In the way the introduction is written, it gives the impression that it is the former, but then functional investigations are not specific enough (since they are targeted to the overall di2 population, see dedicated comment later). Authors should revise to make clearer what is the scope of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this issue. The focus of the study is indeed dI2. We modified the introduction section accordingly. As to dI2 subpopulations, see our response to comment #2 in the summary section of the <italic>eLife</italic> decision letter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Histology Figures should be made more convincing, self-explanatory, and to a higher standard.</p><p>(a) Anatomical landmarks MUST be paced on ALL figures, e.g: the midline and minimal nuclei of the cerebellum, the deep cerebellar nuclei should be indicated in Figure S4,… Also, please give the orientation axis on ALL figures (especially the ones illustrating large territories, like 2B, 4A).</p></disp-quote><p>We replaced the image of the central cerebellar nuclei in figure 2—figure supplement 1A (the previous S3A). A low magnification image is now included and the midline and the margins of the central cerebellar nuclei are indicated. We are not aware to the term “minimal nuclei of the cerebellum”.</p><p>We inserted coordinates to indicate the rostral-caudal ipsi-contra and medial-lateral axes. However, we did not indicate the ventral-dorsal axis in the cross-section images, since it is acceptable that ventral is down in these images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Add the CTB or HSV tracer on Figure 2A and check coherence: I believe for instance that HSP is wrongly stated instead of HSV in Figure 2D and PRV is wrongly stated instead of CTB in Figure 2F (and there might be other confusions throughout).</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2D HSP is indeed HSV. In Figure 2F we have used PRV-cherry. We calibrated the post-injection time that is required for the infection of lumbar level pre-cerebellar neurons. We also co-injected PRV-cherry+CTB to verify that just the pre-cerebellar (not the pre-pre-cerebellar) neurons are labelled.</p><p>We amended the text accordingly on p. 15 lines 187-189.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) It is extremely confusing that histology pseudo-colors are sometimes changed from one related figure to the other, for unclear reasons (e.g. 2B, 2B', 2C, also 2C and S4A…). Consistency will help the reader go through all panels and figures comparatively.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now adjusted the colors: dI2 neurons are cyan, pre-dI2 are magenta and post-dI2 neurons are yellow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) Figures must be addressed in proper order. This also applies to supplemental figures. Otherwise, it gives the impression we have missed something.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(e) What is the rationale for plotting the overlap in area versus volume (Figure 2H, I)? If overlap with area shows a higher percentage than with volume, does it mean that the overlap is only limited to a given A/P plane? I'm really confused about this representation and its meaning.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the added value in showing the overlapping histograms is marginal. Instead, we inserted a laminar distribution chart of each type of neuron and synapses, as suggested by the reviewer, in figures 1, 2, 4 and 5 and the corresponding supplemental figures. The overlap between the cell-to-cell and synapses-to-cells is also apparent in this presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Authors should avoid relying on subjective formulations like &quot;that reside at the lateral dorsal aspect of lamina VII&quot;. Instead, they MUST demonstrate the positioning of Di2 neurons into the different spinal laminae with some form of quantitative measurements. This is currently just an &quot;impression&quot; that large, precerebellar Di2 are more ventral, in lamina VII and possibly VIII but without the representation of lamina borders on figures, this information cannot be appreciated by the reader. It is all essential that these borders are depicted in Figures and neurons be quantitatively allocated to each laminae. In addition/alternatively, authors should report the average D/V position of the different subtypes and test for significant differences to make the case of different spatially-confined populations stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>The laminar distribution of all the neurons and synapses is now included. See figures 1,2,4 and 5 and the corresponding supp figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. FoxD3 expression on Supplemental Figure 2B is not convincing. It is also not reported in the statistics of Figure 1E. Do we have to assume that all di2 investigated here are FoxD3-positive? If so, one would need a better illustration and quantifications should be given. Otherwise, I would suggest to simply rely on literature and removing that Figure S1B which is not helping. On other panels of that supplemental Figure 2, please add arrow/arrowheads on all neurons that are or not co-labelled so we can appreciate co-labelling.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we now show only the expression of FoxD3 in the post-mitotic pre-migratory dI2, and we provide the proper citation for Foxd3 expression. We preformed new in situ experiment and modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2B. We added arrow/arrowheads on all neurons in figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1B is informative for the general audience. Thus, we think that it is important to include it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The demonstration that di2 are excitatory is essential. It is the title of a paragraph (line 102), thus I think that the corresponding data with the neurotransmitters (Vglut2, GAD) would deserve to be in the main Figures. Also, the chosen illustration only shows ONE double-labelled cell with Vglut2. Authors should be able to show a field of view that more convincingly conveys the message with more cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We preformed new in situ mRNA localization experiment, this time using the VIAAT probe for detecting the inhibitory dI2 neurons. The proportion of the excitatory/inhibitory dI2 is 73%/27% (see figure 1G-I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This study by Haimson et al., aims at examining the diversity of dI2 interneurons and their role in coordinating activity across difference region of the spinal cord and in reporting back activity to the brain. The results show that dI2 interneurons comprise different sub-classes based on their axonal projections, soma diameter and transmitter identity. They also show that some dI2 interneurons project rostrally from the lumbar spinal cord and make putative synaptic contacts with other dI2 interneurons in the brachial spinal cord on their way to the cerebellum. Finally, it is shown that some dI2 interneurons receive putative inputs from DRG neurons and may serve to transmit movement-related feedback. An indiscriminate silencing of dI2 interneurons results in instability of locomotion. Overall, this study reports some interesting observations by showing the heterogeneity of dI2 interneurons and their potential function. I have the following concerns:</p><p>1) 12% express Pax2 and are considered inhibitory. However, Gad is expressed in only 25% of dI2 interneurons while vGlut is expressed in 88%. These proportions suggest that there are dI2 neurons that co-express vGlut and Gad. Is this the case? Are there additional inhibitory dI2 neurons in addition to those expressing Pax2 which could explain the fact that Gad labels 25% of dI2 neurons. These points need some clarifications and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Pax2 labels GABAergic inhibitory neurons. In order the label all the inhibitory interneurons we have now employed VIAAT as a probe. See also our response to the general comment #3 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Of all dI2 interneurons, 91% are small diameter and 9% are large diameter neurons – large diameter neurons are mostly apparent in the lumbar spinal cord. The small and large diameter dI2 neurons cannot be differentiated by their expression of TFs, but can be distinguished by their transmitter identity? Is the proportion of small and large diameter neurons the same along the spinal cord?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed the number of inhibitory/excitatory neuron is the small and large diameter dI2 neurons. We found that the excitatory/inhibitory ratio in both subpopulation is similar. These new data are presented in Figure 1G-I and in line 150-153.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do all dI2 neurons receive putative synaptic contacts from DRG neurons? Unless I have missed it, it would be helpful to provide quantification of the number of small vs large diameter dI2 neurons with regard to the different putative synaptic contacts they receive from DRG neurons, dI2 and V1 interneurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed the synaptic inputs of DRG neurons to dI2 neurons. This quantification is now presented in figure 4—figure supplement 3E,F (p. 21, lines 261-267).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Lines 218-220: It is stated that DRG putative contacts are mainly targeting dorsal dI2 neurons while ventral ones receive virtually no contacts. Since large diameter VSCT dI2 neurons are located ventrally, they do not seem to receive direct sensory information. However, the authors conclude that VSCT dI2 neurons receive sensory input (lines 227-228) and also in the Discussion. There seem to be a mismatch between the results and the conclusion drawn by the authors (lines 374-377). Unless I am missing something here, this is not consisting with the conclusions of this study. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed the number of contacts between DRG axons and dorsal/ventral dI2 and large/small dI2 neurons. The number of contacts with the dorsal dI2 neurons is significantly higher than with the ventral dI2. However, the number of contacts with the small and large dI2 neurons is similar. The decrease of contacts in the ventral dI2 is mainly due to fewer contacts with the small ventral dI2. These new data are presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 3E,F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The silencing experiments are interesting, however it is unclear which sub-class of dI2 neurons and at what level (lumbar vs brachial spinal cord or cerebellum) the observed behavioral perturbations take place. It is possible to selectively silence excitatory vs inhibitory or only VSCT neurons to provide some link between dI2 sub-classes and behavioral perturbations.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to the general comment #2 above.</p><p>References</p><p>Baek, M., Menon, V., Jessell, T.
