We used a biophysical model to unmask mechanisms underlying the history-dependence of conduction. The model replicates activity in the unmyelinated axon of the crustacean stomatogastric pyloric dilator neuron. At the timescale of a single burst, conduction delay has a non-monotonic relationship with instantaneous frequency, which depends on the gating rates of the fast voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> current. At the slower timescale of minutes, the mean value and variability of conduction delay increase. These effects are because of hyperpolarization of the baseline membrane potential by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, balanced by an h-current, both of which affect the gating of the Na<sup>+</sup> current. We explore the mechanisms of history-dependence of conduction delay in axons and develop an empirical equation that accurately predicts this history-dependence, both in the model and in experimental measurements.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25382.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25382.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>H. americanus</italic></kwd><kwd>action potential conduction</kwd><kwd>temporal fidelity</kwd><kwd>temporal coding</kwd><kwd>sodium channel</kwd><kwd>activity dependent</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS083319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bucher</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name><name><surname>Nadim</surname><given-names>Farzan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH060505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nadim</surname><given-names>Farzan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS058825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bucher</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conduction velocity of action potentials in unmyelinated axons depends ultimately on the gating variables of the fast voltage-gated sodium current and can be predicted from the action potential peak and trough voltages.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent years have seen a growing appreciation of the role of axons in neural signaling. Rather than serving solely as faithful transmission lines of the neural code, axons shape neuron output through activity- and neuromodulator-dependent changes in propagation fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Debanne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alle and Geiger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kress and Mennerick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasaki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bucher, 2015</xref>). Repetitive activity alters axonal membrane excitability and conduction velocity, which can substantially change the temporal pattern of spikes during propagation from proximal initiation sites to distal presynaptic sites. Apart from the more extreme cases of spike failures or ectopic spike initiation, changes in conduction velocity across consecutive spikes result in varying conduction delays, and therefore in altered spike intervals. Temporal coding schemes, in which information is contained in spike intervals, latencies, or firing phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Panzeri et al., 2010</xref>), may be exquisitely sensitive to such changes.</p><p>Many of the activity-dependent effects on spike propagation are owed to the fact that membrane excitability in most axons is substantially more complex than often credited. In addition to the basic ionic mechanisms necessary for spike propagation, i.e., fast sodium and delayed rectifier potassium conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1952b</xref>), axons can have a large variety of voltage-gated ion channels and ion pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>). As the activation and gating of these currents can be associated with a wide range of time constants, conduction velocity can change depending on the history of activity at timescales far exceeding refractory effects occurring in the millisecond range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">George, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raymond, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weidner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ballo et al., 2012</xref>). However, the ionic mechanisms underlying history-dependence of spike propagation are not well understood, and the common approach to test excitability changes with simple paired conditioning and test pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bostock et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>) is insufficient to capture slow dynamics and transformation of complex temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weidner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ballo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Conduction velocity in unmyelinated axons depends on membrane and cytosol properties, and axon diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hodgkin, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Del Castillo and Moore, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Waxman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>). Total conductance change during the spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matsumoto and Tasaki, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tasaki and Matsumoto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tasaki, 2004</xref>), as well as sodium channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muratov, 2000</xref>), can be used to accurately predict conduction velocity of isolated spikes. It is unclear, however, how well those descriptions apply to complex excitability changes during highly repetitive activity. Additionally, theoretical investigations of the history-dependence of conduction delay have considered only minimal sets of ionic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller and Rinzel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kepler and Marder, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moradmand and Goldfinger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Faisal and Laughlin, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here we study the ionic mechanisms underlying history-dependence of conduction delay at different timescales, using a biophysical axon model with relatively complex excitability. The model was inspired by experimental findings from the pyloric dilator (PD) motor axon of the lobster <italic>Homarus americanus</italic> stomatogastric nervous system. This several-centimeters long axon shows large changes in conduction delay during repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballo and Bucher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ballo et al., 2012</xref>). Delays depend on spike intervals, but this dependence changes substantially over the course of several minutes of stimulation. Furthermore, axon excitability critically depends on modulation by dopamine, which drastically alters temporal fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ballo et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>).</p><p>Our model replicates this behavior well. We find that delay changes are mostly because of the effect of membrane potential changes on a subset of variables describing sodium channel gating. Other currents contribute via their effect on the membrane potential. Equations developed to predict conduction velocity of isolated spikes fail to capture activity-dependent changes. We therefore develop empirical equations that allow good predictions of delay changes from either sodium channel gating variables or voltage trajectories. The latter also perform well on experimental data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The history-dependence of conduction delay in the model axon is similar to experimental observations in the PD axon</title><p>To examine dependence of a discrete process on the history of prior activity it is common to use <italic>Poisson</italic> train stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krausz and Friesen, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stern et al., 2009</xref>), which by definition include a large range of inherent frequencies. <italic>Poisson</italic> trains have been used before in Hodgkin-Huxley model axons to characterize spike delay and velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">George, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moradmand and Goldfinger, 1995</xref>), but not commonly in model axons with more complex excitability.

Note that the FTS effect compares the conduction delay of each spike only to that of the previous one. The FTS effect, that is, the nonlinear and non-monotonic frequency-dependence, changes with the STS effect, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> in the changing frequency-dependence at different times of the stimulation. These effects are strongest during pharmacological block of <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic>, presumably because the axon hyperpolarizes more in the absence of inward rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ballo et al., 2012</xref>, see below). The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> were obtained under these conditions.

The model captured, qualitatively and quantitatively, both the STS and the FTS history-dependence of conduction delay observed in the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). To compare the experimental and model STS effect, we calculated the mean (D<sub>mean</sub>) and coefficient of variation (CV-D) of conduction delay in 20 s time bins.

Such stimulation protocols consist of a single conditioning pulse followed by a test pulse delivered at different intervals. The change in spike threshold, conduction velocity, or conduction delay between conditioning and test pulses can then be analyzed as a function of inter-stimulus interval (ISI). Typically, excitability changes as a function of ISI in a sequence of relative refractory, supernormal, and sometimes subnormal intervals, collectively referred to as the ‘recovery cycle’. Recovery cycle measurements gauge excitability changes occurring at a similar timescale as the FTS effect seen in <italic>Poisson</italic> stimulations. We predicted that employing paired-pulse stimulations to test conduction velocity changes is equivalent to analyzing the FTS effect on conduction delay at the beginning of the <italic>Poisson</italic> stimulation.</p><p>Instead of conditioning trains of different duration or frequency, we used simple paired-pulse stimulations and mimicked different excitability states of the axon by setting <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic> to different constant values.

For both levels of <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic>, test spikes showed reduced velocity at small ISIs compared to the conditioning spike (relative refractory period), and increased velocities at larger ISIs (supernormal period), before converging back to the velocity of the conditioning pulse at even larger ISIs. However, note that with different levels of <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic>, the peak conduction velocity of the test pulse corresponded to different ISIs and that the difference between the velocity of conditioning pulse and the peak velocity of the test pulse was larger with <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic><sub>,HI</sub>.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25382.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The fast timescale effect can be predicted by paired-pulse stimulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conduction velocity of conditioning (horizontal line) and test (filled circles) pulses plotted as a function of interspike interval (ISI).

We can therefore conclude that at the fast timescale, delay is primarily determined by the ISI, that is, the timing of the last preceding spike.

A number of theoretical studies have provided equations to describe conduction velocity of a single isolated spike.

However, it is of limited value for experimental work, because activation and inactivation variables cannot be measured during ongoing spiking. We therefore asked if there are good enough correlates of activation and inactivation variables to be found in the voltage trajectory of spikes that would allow the prediction of delay. Single spike measures like peak or trough voltages are poor predictors of delay in the PD axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ballo et al., 2012</xref>), but the dependence of delay on channel gating at both trough and peak shown here suggests that more than one measure has to be considered.

We therefore predicted that, while other conductances can influence the gating state of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> through their effect on membrane potential, the recovery cycle should be accurately predicted by our equation describing the dependence of delay on trough and peak voltages. To test this prediction, we used the estimated delays from our equation to predict the results of the paired-pulse stimulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (with <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic><sub>,HI</sub>).

We therefore used coefficients obtained by a 1 min <italic>Poisson</italic> stimulation protocol to predict the conduction velocities of the spikes in the paired-pulse stimulation. With these coefficients and the <italic>V<sub>T</sub></italic> and <italic>V<sub>P</sub></italic> values, the conduction velocities were accurately predicted for both levels of <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A4</xref>).</p><p>The extent to which either <italic>V<sub>T</sub></italic> or <italic>V<sub>P</sub></italic> can separately predict delays during <italic>Poisson</italic> stimulation was discussed above (for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B and C</xref>).

This relatively simple model has dominated the common perception of axonal spike propagation, even though ionic mechanisms in most axons are more complex, as multiple currents with very different properties can be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>).

It has been proposed for many axons that slow hyperpolarization and slowing of conduction is caused by this pump, which is activated by the massive Na<sup>+</sup> influx during repetitive spiking and causes a net deficit of positive charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Van Essen, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gordon et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bostock and Bergmans, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Robert and Jirounek, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vagg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kiernan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moldovan and Krarup, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scuri et al., 2007</xref>).

However, other slow outward currents have not been identified in the PD axon (Bucher, unpublished results).</p><p>We nevertheless considered a slowly activating outward current as an alternative mechanism because many axons express slow K<sup>+</sup> channels, e.g. K<sub>v</sub>7 channels that produce M-type currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dubois, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eng et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Devaux et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwarz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vervaeke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buniel et al., 2008</xref>). Such currents are thought to contribute to hyperpolarization and reduced excitability and may have cumulative effects during repetitive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stys and Waxman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwarz et al., 2006</xref>). An interesting difference between the pump current and currents due to ion channel conductances is that the pump current does not depend on a driving force. Equivalently, an ionic current would change the input conductance of the neuron, whereas the pump current does not. We found that even with a low activation threshold and slow kinetics, the slow voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> current cannot cause substantial activity-dependent hyperpolarization because an <italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic> relatively close to the resting membrane potential rendered the driving force in between spikes too small for substantial summation of current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The same would be true for Cl<sup>-</sup> conductances and <italic>E<sub>Cl</sub></italic>. Yet, this slow K<sup>+</sup> current reduced the peak voltage of action potentials and reproduced the effect of the pump current in increasing the mean delay D<sub>mean</sub>, but not the variability CV-D.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that we used an <italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic> value (−70 mV) in our axon model that is about 10 mV less negative than usually assumed for soma recordings of STG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Golowasch and Marder, 1992</xref>). A sufficiently slow voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> with <italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic> substantially lower than the resting potential could possibly reproduce the effect of the pump current in producing the STS effect. We chose the <italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic> value near the resting potential because spikes in PD axon recordings show an absence of fast after-hyperpolarization (undershoot), and we could only replicate this in the model with a less negative <italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic>. An alternative approach would have been to model <italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic> as a dynamic variable and allow it to transiently change to more depolarized values over the course of a single spike. This type of dynamic <italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic> was used in a model of the squid giant axon, which assumed a significant temporary extracellular K<sup>+</sup> accumulation, and was successful in rendering a more realistic voltage trajectory of repolarization and undershoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clay, 1998</xref>). As the PD axon does not actually express slow K<sup>+</sup> currents, we did not pursue this further. However, our results demonstrate that the increase of variability of delay was dependent on hyperpolarization, as a mere increase in conductance only increased the mean delay.</p><p>The dependence of the STS effect on hyperpolarization is further highlighted by the role of <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which is thought to play an important role in preventing spike failures in many axons because its inwardly rectifying properties can balance activity-dependent hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grafe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Soleng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kiernan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baginskas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tomlinson et al., 2010</xref>).

Our model provides a mechanistic explanation of our previous experimental observation that the balance of <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> and pump current plays a dynamic role in setting how sensitive conduction is to the history of activity. This represents a level of importance in controlling temporal fidelity that goes beyond just preventing spike failures.</p><p>Previous studies have also used a modeling approach to explore the role of slow accumulation of ionic currents and concentrations in axons.

It has long been known that, with increasing spike intervals even well beyond the refractory period, excitability and conduction velocity go through an oscillation of decreases and increases, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bullock, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raymond, 1979</xref>), collectively termed the recovery cycle. Such activity-dependent changes are often gauged with paired-pulse stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>), particularly for diagnostic purposes in the context of peripheral neuropathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bostock and Rothwell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bostock et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishnan et al., 2009</xref>). The dependence on spike interval changes dramatically when axons are stimulated with trains of conditioning pulses instead of simple paired pulses. In our model, prior activity can be mimicked by setting the pump current to different values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that FTS and STS effects are completely separated in their time dependence, meaning that delay depends on the last interval and the mean rate of prior activity, but not on the exact temporal pattern of the last few preceding spikes. This independence of exact prior pattern is further demonstrated by our finding that paired-pulse stimulation results predict delays from both <italic>Poisson</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) stimulations. A previous modeling study on primary afferent C-fibers has also demonstrated an activity-dependent alteration of recovery cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tigerholm et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The dependence of conduction delay on Na<sup>+</sup> channel gating variables and other currents</title><p>Our results show that the dynamics of conduction delay can be accurately predicted from two parameters describing the state of the Na<sup>+</sup> conductance at two time points, the opening rate of the activation gate at the onset of the spike, and the closing rate of the inactivation gate at the peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In comparison, two equations that accurately describe conduction delay of single spikes fail to capture the dynamics. The Matsumoto-Tasaki equation predicts conduction delay dependent on the change in total membrane conductance elicited by a spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matsumoto and Tasaki, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tasaki and Matsumoto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tasaki, 2004</xref>). The Muratov equation includes Na<sup>+</sup> channel gating variables, but only at the rest state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muratov, 2000</xref>). Both equations aim to predict absolute values of delay and include constant biophysical parameters such as diameter and membrane capacitance. In contrast, our empirical equation describes only how conduction delay changes as a function of activity. The magnitude of the delay changes and the absolute range of values are found by scaling the contribution of the two Na<sup>+</sup> gating rates with two constants and adding a third. These three constants have to be found empirically and may represent stand-ins for actual biophysical parameters.</p><p>Interestingly, the gating parameters at the trough potential before a spike and the peak voltage of the spike correlate linearly with these voltages, so that the voltages can be treated as stand-ins for the gating parameters in the empirical fit, which allows us to predict delay solely from voltage trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). This illustrates the important point that, while both our sensitivity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and the empirical prediction of delays seem to suggest that Na<sup>+</sup> channel gating is the key factor, the rates used to predict delay are voltage-dependent and are therefore sensitive to the effect other ionic mechanisms have on the membrane potential trajectory.</p><p>It should be noted that the small level of sensitivity to the various currents is because sensitivity analysis only examines small changes in the parameters of these currents which would not greatly alter the membrane potential. However, some of these currents, as shown for the pump current and <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic>, undergo large changes that have substantial effects on delay. Again, these mechanisms act at two different timescales. At the slow timescale, the balance of pump current and <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> determines the overall level of hyperpolarization and thus affects Na<sup>+</sup> channel gating through the steady-state voltage-dependencies of the opening and closing rates. It should be noted that changes in baseline membrane potential overall can have ambiguous effects on conduction velocity. For example, slow hyperpolarization is often associated with slowing of conduction but can also increase removal of Na<sup>+</sup> channel inactivation and therefore increase velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vervaeke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Col et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>At the fast timescale, K<sup>+</sup> currents play an important role in shaping the repolarization speed, after-potentials, and re-excitability, the extent of which critically depends on the gating time constants and temporal overlap with the Na<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Erisir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baranauskas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sengupta et al., 2010</xref>). K<sup>+</sup> currents with different gating time constants may differentially affect both Na<sup>+</sup> channel activation and its inactivation. Of note is the common presence of inactivating and low-threshold K<sup>+</sup> currents in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bucher, 2015</xref>), because their own activation and inactivation states will be critically dependent on slow timescale changes in baseline membrane potential and therefore change their effect on voltage trajectories and Na<sup>+</sup> channel gating. In the PD axon, relatively slow spike repolarization leads to summation even at moderate frequencies, and spike duration depends on <italic>I<sub>A</sub></italic> activation and inactivation, which vary substantially with the baseline membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballo and Bucher, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The relevance of the findings to other axons</title><p>The model presented here aimed to mimic, as faithfully as possible, the behavior of a well described unmyelinated invertebrate axon. However, it should be noted that the ionic mechanisms considered, like pump-mediated hyperpolarization, inward rectification through <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic>, and the presence of both transient and sustained K<sup>+</sup> currents, are found in many axons across different phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>). In contrast, diversity of axon properties within a single species or even a single part of the nervous system can be very large, which makes the notion of a ‘typical’ axon appear not useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bucher, 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, spikes in the overwhelming majority of axons are driven by fast transient Na<sup>+</sup> currents responsible for their regenerative nature. It is plausible as a general mechanism that the gating state of these channels at the onset and peak of the spike acts as a critical determinant of conduction velocity. Different complements of additional voltage-gated or electrogenic transporter currents across axon types may lead to very different dependence of conduction velocity on preceding activity. Yet, we expect that their influence on the Na<sup>+</sup> channel gating variables, or trough and peak voltages as their proxies, would still serve to determine conduction velocity in each case. Consequently, once the peak and trough voltages of the action potential have been measured, the empirical equation introduced in this study would serve to accurately predict the conduction velocity, independent of the combinations of ionic mechanisms involved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>The biophysical axon model</title><p>We constructed a conductance-based biophysical axon model to examine the role of different ionic currents in shaping the history-dependence of conduction delay.

Spikes propagated along the length of the 1 cm axon and were recorded at two sites (0.3 and 0.7 cm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The conduction delay was measured in NEURON using the time that the spike crossed the voltage threshold of −40 mV at the two recording sites. (Delays measured using action potential peak times produce practically identical results.) Delays produced along this 0.4 cm of axon were multiplied by a factor of 9.5 to mimic the conduction delays and velocities of the 4–5 cm biological axon shown in our results for comparison. Different conduction velocities of consecutive spikes lead to gradually changing intervals over distance. Because axonal excitability changes between spikes depend on interval, conduction delays during repetitive spiking do not scale linearly with distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kocsis et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bucher, 2015</xref>).

The last value was chosen to match mean spike frequency in burst stimulation protocols (see below). It should be noted that the <italic>Poisson</italic> stimulation method is useful in producing a variety of inter-stimulus intervals, but this can be also achieved with other stimulation paradigms that incorporate such a variety, for example through rate adaptation.</p><p>Second, we used a paired-pulse protocol to obtain ‘recovery cycle’ measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>). After a single conditioning stimulus, test stimuli were delivered at different intervals (between 10 ms and 10 s).

For the STS effect, these attributes were the mean conduction delay and its coefficient of variation, measured for the final 20 s interval of simulation. For the FTS effect, we used quadratic fits to determine the minimum delay and the frequency at which it occurred, and the curvature of the quadratic fit at this point. To measure sensitivity, each parameter in the (reference) model was decreased or increased by 5% and 10% of its original value while other parameters were kept unchanged. It should be noted that <italic>E<sub>Na</sub></italic> is a dynamic parameter, which is determined by the intracellular and extracellular concentration of Na<sup>+</sup>. Therefore, the scaling factors were applied to the Nernst equation for Na<sup>+</sup> in order to rescale <italic>E<sub>Na</sub></italic>.</p><p>The 5% and 10% changes in each direction produced four new models for each parameter. Each new model was subjected to the same <italic>Poisson</italic> stimulation as the original model and the attributes of the fast and slow timescale effects were measured. We then normalized these measures by their values in the reference model. The resulting four data points, together with the reference value (at the origin) were fit with a line. The sensitivity of an attribute to the parameter was defined as the slope of the linear fit. For example, a sensitivity value of 1 meant that a ± 5% and±10% change in the parameter resulted in a ± 5% or±10% change in the attribute.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Experimental

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Frances K Skinner (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jeremy Niven (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors examine action potential biophysics and use computational modelling to assess the history-dependence of conduction delay, as motivated by an unmyelinated invertebrate axon. The manuscript is well-written and well-organized with rationale, logic and motivation clearly presented. The reviewers felt that it should be of interest to neuroscientists from a variety of backgrounds, including those interested in the biophysics and those interested in neural coding and neuropathies. They use parameter screening and NEURON simulations to present findings that can explain the slow time scale via <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> and Na-K pump dynamics along with an empirical equation that can be obtained by a nonlinear combination of peak and threshold potentials.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the manuscript itself was clear, some concerns regarding resting and reversal potentials were raised as well as the need for better explanations in some places. Specifically:</p><p>1) The authors mention that they have fixed the reversal potential of K<sup>+</sup> in the axon model to -70 mV to prevent the occurrence of an after-hyperpolarisation. Have they checked whether this will affect any of their conclusions? We appreciate that they state that the after-hyperpolarisation is missing from axonal recordings of APs but this could be due to leaky recordings, or recordings being made in passive regions of an otherwise active axon (as occurs just prior to the output synapses in some arthropod neurons). It may be worth checking that the results are robust to a shift of the K<sup>+</sup> reversal potential to something more conventional for an arthropod neuron such as -80 or -85 mV.</p><p>2) Near the beginning of the Results section the authors spend some time discussing whether the slow effects they observe could be reproduced by a K<sup>+</sup> conductance rather than the Na+/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. I was a little concerned that this might appear to be a bit of a straw-man argument. The two will not be equivalent because of the time constants governing their dynamics, and because only in one case is the current accompanied by a conductance change. Surely, the choice of sufficiently long time constants would allow a voltage-gated conductance to replace the ATPase as long as the reversal potential was correct?</p><p>Could this be further examined as a novel mechanistic explanation to consider that the observation that the pump state is a more potent determinant of velocity than a similarly slow K conductance? Perhaps this could lead to an experimentally testable distinction of the two potential mechanisms. The present treatment in the manuscript is restricted to effects in line with the previous experimental work. This is not required for the present revision, but the authors may wish to consider this.</p><p>3) The origin of the resting and reversal potential/s in the model was a bit confusing. The K<sup>+</sup> reversal potential is set to -70 mV and the <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> reversal potential presumably represents a mixed conductance of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions, but what happens to change this mixed conductance (and the reversal potential) in the presence of dopamine? Is the leak set to -65 mV to match the observed resting potential and, if so, is there experimental evidence to support such a depolarising leak in these neurons?</p><p>4) The sensitivity analysis description could be expanded to be more clear since it is a bit confusing as it stands given the earlier results/statements. For example, STS is mediated by <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic>, but they then show that <italic>g<sub>h</sub></italic> has a strong effect, whereas the sensitivity analysis shows other parameters have important contributions. Similarly, FTS is not only affected by <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> but also by <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic> and much by EK and the sensitivity analysis shows only a comparatively weak effect of <italic>g<sub>h</sub></italic>. Instead of the conclusions reached in the text, it looks like it is either a complex problem with many covariates, or the simple determinant has not been correctly identified. Presumably this is because one is looking at parameter sensitivity and not sensitivity to <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> itself, as stated toward the end of the section, but would perhaps be more helpful if this is stated more up front along with an expanded description to avoid confusion.</p><p>5) The authors are encouraged to expand their empirical equation discussion to have a wider appeal, perhaps in terms of a strategy. That is, if new currents were added/considered in the system and the consideration of time scale, how would one proceed?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25382.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>While the manuscript itself was clear, some concerns regarding resting and reversal potentials were raised as well as the need for better explanations in some places.

It may be worth checking that the results are robust to a shift of the K<sup>+</sup> reversal potential to something more conventional for an arthropod neuron such as -80 or -85 mV.</italic> </p><p>Intracellular recordings of the PD axons (and other axons in the same nerve) were performed in an active and propagating region, centimeters from the terminals (Ballo and Bucher, 2009; Ballo et al., 2012). None of these recordings show after-hyperpolarizations unless depolarized to -60 mV or above. We are currently recording the K reversal potential in axons and our data is consistent with the model and predicts that EK is significantly more depolarized in axons compared to the somata. This has been previously reported for the squid giant axon by John Clay (1998) in J. Neurphys, as quoted from the Abstract:</p><p>“accumulation/depeletion [sic] of K<sup>+</sup> in the space between the axon and the glial cells surrounding the axon, which is significant even during a single action potential and which can account for the 15-20 mV difference between the potassium equilibrium potential EK and the maximum afterhyperpolarization of the action potential.”</p><p>We discuss Clay’s point (subsection “The dependence of conduction delay on slow activity-dependent hyperpolarization”, fourth paragraph). Nonetheless, as the reviewer suggests, we repeated the simulations of our main result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) with EK=-80 mV (and corresponding adjustments to the INa activation and inactivation parameters) and found that although there are slight quantitative changes, the qualitative results remain valid.</p><p><italic>2) Near the beginning of the Results section the authors spend some time discussing whether the slow effects they observe could be reproduced by a K<sup>+</sup> conductance rather than the Na+/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. I was a little concerned that this might appear to be a bit of a straw-man argument. The two will not be equivalent because of the time constants governing their dynamics, and because only in one case is the current accompanied by a conductance change. Surely, the choice of sufficiently long time constants would allow a voltage-gated conductance to replace the ATPase as long as the reversal potential was correct?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that a slow ionic current changes the input conductance whereas a pump current shouldn’t. Our main argument here was that the driving force for the voltage-gated current is very small in between spikes, and we assumed that this would be true even if <italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic> was 10 or 15 mV more hyperpolarized. However, as the reviewer suggests, if the slow K<sup>+</sup> current has a reversal potential that is much lower than the resting potential, it is in fact possible to change both the peak and trough voltages of the action potentials and, in a manner, have this current to replace the pump current for the purpose of changing AP delays. This point is by no means central to our argument so we modified the Discussion accordingly and added the point that the reviewer suggests. (subsection “A slow K<sup>+</sup> current fails to produce the STS effect”, last paragraph and subsection “The dependence of conduction delay on slow activity-dependent hyperpolarization”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>Could this be further examined as a novel mechanistic explanation to consider that the observation that the pump state is a more potent determinant of velocity than a similarly slow K conductance? Perhaps this could lead to an experimentally testable distinction of the two potential mechanisms. The present treatment in the manuscript is restricted to effects in line with the previous experimental work. This is not required for the present revision, but the authors may wish to consider this.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct that such a comparison in the model could potentially produce an experimental design in support of the pump current determining the STS effect. It is indeed an interesting point that a pump current and a conductance do different things to spike conduction. The pump current only affects the membrane potential, while a conductance, even one with no appreciable effect on the membrane potential, may affect conduction because it adds to the total input conductance and reduces the effect other currents have on the membrane potential.</p><p>We believe, however, that this message is not central to our current point and that a more substantial comparison is required to rule out the role of a very slow K<sup>+</sup> current in shaping conduction delays. We therefore toned down our argument in ruling out the role of such a current, as stated in the previous point.</p><p><italic>3) The origin of the resting and reversal potential/s in the model was a bit confusing. The K<sup>+</sup> reversal potential is set to -70 mV and the I<sub>h</sub> reversal potential presumably represents a mixed conductance of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions, but what happens to change this mixed conductance (and the reversal potential) in the presence of dopamine? Is the leak set to -65 mV to match the observed resting potential and, if so, is there experimental evidence to support such a depolarising leak in these neurons?</italic> </p><p>While <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic> is a mixed conductance, usually based on channels with a higher permeability to K<sup>+</sup>, the difference in driving forces in the voltage-range it is activated in makes it essentially just a Na<sup>+</sup> current. Either way, dopamine may have a small (and unexplained) effect on the reversal potential of this current in the PD axon (Ballo et al. 2010), but the main effect is a conductance increase and shift in activation curve that results in a 2-3 fold increase in conductance in the voltage range of the baseline membrane potential. As the contribution of K<sup>+</sup> to this current is minimal, it should not be very sensitive to the exact value of <italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic>. The leak is set to the resting membrane potential, and -65 mV is not depolarized for <italic>E<sub>leak</sub></italic> in lobster neurons and is consistent with the recordings of the PD axon (Ballo &amp; Bucher 2009).</p><p><italic>4) The sensitivity analysis description could be expanded to be more clear since it is a bit confusing as it stands given the earlier results/statements. For example, STS is mediated by I<sub>pump</sub>, but they then show that g<sub>h</sub> has a strong effect, whereas the sensitivity analysis shows other parameters have important contributions. Similarly, FTS is not only affected by I<sub>h</sub> but also by I<sub>pump</sub> and much by EK and the sensitivity analysis shows only a comparatively weak effect of g<sub>h</sub>. Instead of the conclusions reached in the text, it looks like it is either a complex problem with many covariates, or the simple determinant has not been correctly identified. Presumably this is because one is looking at parameter sensitivity and not sensitivity to I<sub>h</sub> itself, as stated toward the end of the section, but would perhaps be more helpful if this is stated more up front along with an expanded description to avoid confusion.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct about the contributions of <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic>. We tried to clarify the apparent conflict between the influence of these currents and the weak effect of <italic>g<sub>h</sub></italic> in the sensitivity analysis in the following sections of the Results and Discussion:</p><p>“Note that a small sensitivity value does not imply that the model attribute is not dependent on the parameter, but rather that small changes in the parameter do not affect that attribute strongly or monotonically. The large effect of <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic> on conduction delay and history-dependence seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> was because of several-fold changes in pump activation over several minutes. In contrast, the comparatively small ( ± 5% and ± 10%) changes of <italic>I<sub>pump</sub></italic> used here had little effect on sensitivity values (not shown).”</p><p>“It should be noted that the small level of sensitivity to the various currents is because sensitivity analysis only examines small changes in the parameters of these currents which would not greatly alter the membrane potential. However, some of these currents, as shown for the pump current and <italic>I<sub>h</sub></italic>, undergo large changes that have substantial effects on delay.”</p><p><italic>5) The authors are encouraged to expand their empirical equation discussion to have a wider appeal, perhaps in terms of a strategy. That is, if new currents were added/considered in the system and the consideration of time scale, how would one proceed?</italic> </p><p>We expanded the discussion of this equation (subsection “The relevance of the findings to other axons”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
