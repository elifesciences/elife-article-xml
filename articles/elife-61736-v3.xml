Recent studies have uncovered that paternal excessive weight induced by an unbalanced diet affects the metabolic health of offspring. These reports mainly employed single-generation male exposure. However, the consequences of multigenerational unbalanced diet feeding on the metabolic health of progeny remain largely unknown. Here, we show that maintaining paternal Western diet feeding for five consecutive generations in mice induces an enhancement in fat mass and related metabolic diseases over generations. Strikingly, chow-diet-fed progenies from these multigenerational Western-diet-fed males develop a ‘healthy’ overweight phenotype characterized by normal glucose metabolism and without fatty liver that persists for four subsequent generations. Mechanistically, sperm RNA microinjection experiments into zygotes suggest that sperm RNAs are sufficient for establishment but not for long-term maintenance of epigenetic inheritance of metabolic pathologies. Progressive and permanent metabolic deregulation induced by successive paternal Western-diet-fed generations may contribute to the worldwide epidemic of metabolic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>inheritance</kwd><kwd>sperm</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NR-12-ADAPT-0022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raad</surname><given-names>Georges</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds Francais pour l'Alimentation et la Sante</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15D52</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Derieppe</surname><given-names>Marie-Alix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCA-IDEX</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serra</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Predisposition to obesity-associated diseases is dependent on the ancestors' diet.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nongenetic inheritance of newly acquired phenotypes is a relatively new concept in biology whereby changes induced by specific environmental cues in parents (mothers and/or fathers) can be transmitted to the next generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fullston et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grandjean et al., 2016</xref>). This process is evolutionarily conserved and has been described from worms to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gapp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Portha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Remy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skinner et al., 2015</xref>). The fact that environmental cues have the potential to modify the molecular hereditary information carried by the spermatozoa demonstrates that the environmentally induced epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Majzoub, 2017</xref>) are not erased through the epigenetic reprogramming process, causing them to be inherited by the next generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soubry, 2018</xref>). Although the role of epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Castro Barbosa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ge et al., 2014</xref>) and chromatin modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Öst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terashima et al., 2015</xref>) cannot be excluded in this process, independent experimental data strongly evoke the central role of sperm RNA as a vector of paternal intergenerational epigenetic inheritance of, at least, environmentally induced metabolic pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grandjean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike genetic inheritance, environmentally induced epigenetic alterations are reversible, enabling the loss of previously acquired characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cropley et al., 2016</xref>). Although environmental changes might persist over several generations, most reports have been based on the maintenance of paternal environmental cues for just one generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huypens et al., 2016</xref>). This is particularly true for certain lifestyle habits, such as eating high-fat or high-sugar junk food, also called a Western diet (WD). Thus, although people around the world may face multigenerational unbalanced nutrition, there have been limited studies on its effects on the metabolic health of the progeny.</p><p>Herein, we studied the impact of the paternal maintenance of an unhealthy WD for multiple generations on the metabolic phenotype of both the progenitors and their respective chow-diet-fed (CD-fed) offspring.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Feeding successive paternal generations with a WD exacerbates the overweight phenotype and accelerates the development of obesity-associated pathologies</title><p>To test experimentally whether the maintenance of an unhealthy diet through the paternal germline influences the metabolic phenotype of the resulting individuals, C57BL6/J male mice were fed a WD for five consecutive generations (from WD1 to WD5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). According to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Massiera et al., 2010</xref>), multigenerational WD feeding exacerbates the increased body weight mass induced by this diet. Despite marked heterogeneity in the WD4 and WD5 populations, we found that the WD4 and WD5 males weighted significantly more than the WD1 and WD3 ones (p&lt;0.05 and &lt;0.01, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Interestingly, growing heterogeneity of the body weight mass between the males of the first and the latter generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) was observed in the four independent families, indicating that the phenotypic heterogeneity previously observed in diet-induced obesity mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burcelin et al., 2002</xref>) increases progressively over the generations. This increase in total body weight with paternal multigenerational WD feeding was associated with an increase in perigonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Indeed, WD5 gWAT weighted significantly more than the WD1 gWAT (p&lt;0.05) and the gWAT volume measured by computed tomography increased 2.3-fold and 3.4-fold in WD1 and WD5 mice, respectively, compared to that of control mice (CD-fed mice) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The increase in gWAT mass was positively correlated with total body weight (perigonadal fat mass versus total body weight; Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.78, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). It was also associated with the hypertrophy of white adipocytes, with a median surface cell area of white adipocytes increasing from 1500 to 4000 μm<sup>2</sup> from the first (WD1) to the fifth generation (WD5) and with a decreased calculated number of adipocytes in WD5 compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Furthermore, our RNA-seq comparison between the gWAT of WD1 and WD5 males revealed that multigenerational WD feeding has a strong impact on the gWAT gene expression profile. In fact, we observed an increase in differentially expressed genes (DEGs), from 325 in WD1 (with 93 upregulated and 232 downregulated genes) to 1199 (757 upregulated and 442 downregulated) in WD5, compared to the respective CD-fed mice. Interestingly, while the majority of DEGs in WD1 (66%) were also deregulated in WD5, a minority of DEGs in WD5 (only 8% for the upregulated genes and 35% for the downregulated genes) were deregulated in WD1 (p-value&lt;0.01). Importantly, all common genes were deregulated in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Interestingly, querying the WD1 and WD5 DEGs against the molecular signature database collection of curated gene pathway annotations revealed a specific WD5 enrichment in gene sets associated with CHEN_METABOLIC_SYNDROM_NETWORK (genes forming the macrophage-enriched metabolic network claimed to have a causal relationship with metabolic syndrome traits) and with genes potentially regulated by the methylation of lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 27 (H3K27) of histone H3 and by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liberzon, 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Five consecutive paternal generations of Western diet (WD) feeding exacerbate the WD-induced overweight phenotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Study design for the maintenance of WD feeding for five consecutive generations through the paternal lineage.

At 3 weeks old, they were fed a WD, and at 4 months, at least one WD-fed male per family was crossed with CD-fed females. This second generation of males was called WD2.

To check this hypothesis, several metabolic risk parameters related to these pathologies were analyzed in WD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In comparison with CD-fed mice, circulating plasma levels of leptin, C-reactive protein (CRP), one marker of inflammation, and total cholesterol were significantly higher in the WD3 (p&lt;0.01), WD4 (p&lt;0.05), and WD5 (p&lt;0.01) groups but not in the WD1 (p=0.07) or WD2 (p=0.4) groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The alterations in these metabolic parameters in WD-fed males were found to be positively correlated with the increase in gWAT mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F–H</xref>). At the molecular level, the increase in serum leptin in WD-fed males was positively correlated with an increase in leptin mRNA levels in the gWAT of the respective male mice (total serum leptin and <italic>leptin</italic> mRNA, Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.89, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>), suggesting an accumulation of epigenetic modifications at the leptin promoter. These results are in line with recent studies showing that leptin upregulation occurs via epigenetic malprogramming in white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lecoutre et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masuyama et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we found a significantly impaired response in the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) in all WD-fed mouse groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which was not associated, except for in WD2-fed males, with an impaired insulin response, as shown by the intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ITT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, unlike the other metabolic parameters, we did not notice any significant exacerbation of insulin sensitivity in successive generations. Moreover, the response to an intraperitoneal GTT (measured through the area under the curve [AUC]-GTT calculation) was not correlated with the gWAT mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J</xref>).

To determine whether sperm small RNAs are also involved in the long-term maintenance of epigenetic inheritance (transgenerational epigenetic inheritance), we systematically profiled the expression of sncRNAs of three independent CD, WD1, and WD5 sperm samples by deep sequencing using a recently developed sncRNA annotation pipeline optimized for rRNA- and tRNA-derived sRNAs, rsRNA, and tsRNA, respectively (<italic>SPORTS1.0</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). We found a sperm RNA signature that is specifically induced in the first generation of WD-diet males characterized by an increase in the proportion of rsRNA. This is consistent with previous reports showing the sensitivity of rsRNA to dietary exposure such as a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nätt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Strikingly, this sncRNA signature observed in the first generation of WD-fed male fed a WD tends to disappear in the fifth generation of WD-fed male, which exhibit a sncRNAs signature very similar to that of CD sncRNAs. On the one hand, while ~64% of the sncRNAs were annotated to rsRNAs in WD1, only ~40% of them were annotated to rsRNAs in CD and WD5 sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting a global modification of the sncRNA population upon WD exposure. On the other hand, a closer look at the sncRNAs differentially expressed in WDs (WD1 and WD5) and CD showed that the rsRNAs are not the only population to be sensitive to dietary exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports in mice. Indeed, searching for small RNA DEGs (adjusted p value&lt;0.05) between WD (WD1 or WD5) and CD sperm, we identified 479 and 66 DEGs in WD1 and WD5, respectively, compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">2</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of WD5 DEGs (47 out of 66) were already deregulated in WD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Among these common sncRNAs, we identified tsRNA and microRNAs known to be involved in short-term epigenetic inheritance of metabolic dysfunction (intergenerational inheritance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grandjean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">2</xref>).

Taken together, these data strongly suggest that sperm RNAs can unequivocally induce intergenerational phenotype but may induce some transgenerational features, although the effect is weaker than the effect induced by whole sperm. This is in line with previous study using a psychological-stress-induced model showing that sperm RNA injection can also induce phenotype in both F1 and F2 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gapp et al., 2014</xref>). Last, in contrast to natural mating of WD5, the sperm-RNA-induced overweight phenotype was not inherited for more than two generations. Together, these results indicate that sperm RNAs are not sufficient for the long-term epigenetic inheritance of metabolic dysfunctions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Growing evidence suggests that an unbalanced diet of the father negatively affects its metabolic health and that of its progenies. Of particular interest, little attention has been focused on the effect of paternal successive generations of unbalanced diet exposure on metabolic health, which may have public health and economic impacts. To this end, we fed male mice for five successive generations on a high-fat, high-sugar diet (WD) to compare the metabolic parameters across multiple generations of WD males and assess the persistence of the WD-induced metabolic alterations in their subsequent balanced CD-fed progenies.</p><p>In summary, our findings reveal that maintaining a WD for several generations promotes a progressive accumulation of epigenetic alterations in somatic and germ cells throughout generations. Two lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, ancestral exposure influences the magnitude of the overweight phenotype. Indeed, a male whose father, grandfather, great grandfather, great-great-grandfather, and great-great-great grandfather, up to five generations of exposure, have been fed a WD exhibits the most severe overweight phenotype associated with serious metabolic alterations. Second, the father’s ancestral history (whether his ancestors were fed an unbalanced diet) affected the pattern of inheritance of this metabolic pathology. Second, the father’s ancestral history (whether or not the ancestors were fed an unbalanced diet) affected the pattern of inheritance of metabolic pathologies.</p><p>The main limitation of our study is the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in the males of the WD4 and WD5 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and in the CD-fed WD5 progenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which might lead to biased conclusions. Indeed, although the statistical tests we used here should rule out this weakness, we cannot rule out the possibility of the presence of subpopulations. Metabolic heterogeneity induced by an unbalanced diet has already been reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burcelin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumas et al., 2017</xref>), and the strong heterogeneity observed in our model may indicate an adaptative process whereby different subpopulations could emerge in response to the maintenance of an unbalanced diet.</p><p>Although it is well described that the development of type 2 diabetes is positively associated with body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Golay and Ybarra, 2005</xref>), we did not observe a strong correlation between fat mass and glucose and insulin sensitivities in males obtained after multigenerational WD feeding. However, we identified one obese-associated pathology that increased in severity with successive generations of a WD, namely, hepatic steatosis, indicating that exposure sensitivity is heightened by multiple generations of exposure, at least for this diet-associated pathology. Thus, the family food environment, parental dietary behaviors, and family obesity might be an additional clue to explain the increasing incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, multiple generations of WD exposure impact not only the sensitivity to a WD but also the hereditary makeup, also called background. Indeed, when the father has no WD-fed ancestor, the fatness of its progenies tends to disappear after WD removal. However, in the case of fathers with several WD-fed ancestors, the progenies will remain stably overweight for more than four generations. Intriguingly, although the male progenies of the third and fourth generations of WD5 males were overweight, they did not develop metabolic alterations, such as glucose/insulin sensitivity alterations and fatty liver diseases. Together, these data strongly suggest that the combination of ancestral and individual diet exposure was both necessary and sufficient to elicit the most severe metabolic effects in mice. Thus, it looks like the five-generational WD-fed males have evolved to develop a protective mechanism in glucose and liver fat metabolism that can be inherited by the offspring.</p><p>Overall, our findings are in agreement with those of recent studies of multigenerational exposure performed in several animal models. For instance, in guppies, a wide range of plastic responses under different light conditions were observed, which were dependent on multigenerational exposure to different light environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kranz et al., 2018</xref>). In mites, zinc element sensitivity increased by continuous multigenerational exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jegede et al., 2019</xref>). In mice, male sensitivity to environmental estrogens was enhanced by successive generations of exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horan et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, rats undernourished for 50 generations showed multiple metabolic alterations that were not reversed in their respective F1 and F2 CD-fed progenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardikar et al., 2015</xref>). Together, the present and previously published studies indicate that the exacerbation of stress-induced phenotypes upon multigeneration exposure as well as the stabilization of newly induced phenotypes is an evolutionarily conserved process. The underlying mechanism of this process is intriguing and worth to be explored in the future using this model since it might have not only social-medical implications, but also evolutionary perspectives.</p><p>Single-generation exposure to unhealthy diet strongly indicates that sperm RNAs are a possible epigenetic vector of intergenerational and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grandjean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). However, these data do not exclude the possible involvement of epigenetic modifications, namely, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin structure alterations. This study takes a step further in this direction. Indeed, on the one hand, we showed that sncRNAs signature is not only the reflect of the diet of the father, as already demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nätt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), but also that of the diet of the ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Whether this is associated to spermatic epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and chromatin structure alterations is an open question. On the other hand, our microinjection experiments showed that small RNAs are vectors of intergenerational inheritance but are not sufficient for the long-term inheritance of diet-induced metabolic alterations. In this context, our transcriptome profile of gWAT may provide important avenues to dissect the potential molecular mechanism(s) involved in this process, revealing an enrichment in genes potentially regulated by H3K4/K27 methylation and the PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>Finally, in the present study, we focused our analyses on perigonadal adipose tissue, glucose/insulin sensitivity, and liver alterations. Considering the healthy and economic consequences of obesity and its comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases and fertility abnormalities, future studies will be important to determine the impact of multigenerational ancestor exposure on the development of obesity-associated comorbidities.</p><p>In conclusion, environmentally induced epigenetic modifications in germlines would contribute to the environmental adaptation and evolution of animal species. In the future, it will be important to assess how each epigenetic vector for inheritance interacts together to modulate the embryonic epigenome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mouse experiments were performed with C57BL/6J mice obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories, France). All mice were housed in a temperature-controlled system and maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 7 a.m.). Experimental mice were given ad libitum access to either a high-fat high-sugar diet (WD) (U8954 version 205 HF 45% of energy from fat, SAFE, France) or a CD (SAFE A04, 5% of energy from fat, SAFE, France) and sterile water. To evaluate the impact of the diet of paternal ancestors on metabolic health, we developed two experimental models. On the one hand, WD feeding was maintained for five successive generations through the paternal line. Briefly, 3-week-old male mice were divided into two groups. Males from the first group were kept on CD, and the males of the other group were fed a WD for 3 months. This first generation of CD-fed and WD-fed males was named CD1 and WD1, respectively. At 4 months old, two independent males of WD1 group were then crossed with 7-week-old C57BL/6J female mice (CD-fed) obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories, France) to generate WD2 offspring. One or two litters were obtained per male. The male progenies were kept and subjected to the same experimental procedure. Then, at least one male, selected randomly, fed a WD for 3 months from each family was mated with CD-fed females to generate WD3 offspring. The same procedure was repeated twice to generate the WD4 and WD5 offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, from the WD2 generation, a considerable heterogeneity with respect to total body weight mass was observed within the same litter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). For this reason and as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> starting from this generation, more than one male per litter was chosen to mate. The complete experimental design was performed twice at approximately 6 months’ interval giving rise to four independent families. To demonstrate that we did not create significance with increasing the correlated sample, we selected a subset of 18 mice in WD4 and WD5 making sure that the four WD1 ancestors were equitably represented across the groups. Three combinations of 18 mice were selected and gave the same significant level with a p-value &lt; 0.001 when total body weight mass or gWAT weight relative to total body weight of WD4 and WD5 groups was compared to the corresponding weight of CD group. One of these combinations is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>. The same procedure was performed for the CD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The first generation was called F1-WD1 and F1-WD5, respectively. The F1 4-month-old male progenies were crossed with 7-week-old C57BL/6J female mice (CD-fed) to obtain the F2-WD1 and F2-WD5 progenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This experimental design was repeated once to obtain the F3-WD1 and F3-WD5 progenies. The control group of this experiment was obtained by crossing CD-fed males with 7-week-old C57BL/6J female mice (CD-fed) and maintained for four generations on CD.</p><p>To evaluate the role of sperm RNAs in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of metabolic alterations, sperm RNAs extracted from two different CD, WD1, and WD5 males were microinjected into zygotes at the Center for Transgenic Models (University of Basel, Switzerland) following the same procedure as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gapp et al., 2014</xref>. The resulting progenies were called F1-RNA-CD, F1-RNA-WD1, and F1-RNA-WD5 progenies, respectively.

Sequencing of small RNA in sperm from founders identified several differentially expressed tRF and miRNA species. Microinjection of RNAs recapitulated some, but not all effects on body weight and metabolism. The authors report an aggravation of adiposity along generations and a phenotype that persists for 4 consequent generations. Such persistence of phenotype was not observed in animals originating from microinjection of total RNAs, suggesting other epigenetic mechanisms are at play in the persistence of phenotype. Overall the studies were considered to be of interest by the referees but one major overarching problem identified by them concerned the study design and the statistical analyses that limited interpretation of the study. These issues need to be seriously addressed by the authors in a major revision. These and other points are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. In line 72, the authors state that &quot;the average body weight of the WD-fed male mice increased gradually with multigenerational WD feeding&quot;, however, the results of the test indicating gradual increase is not reported. As described in the legend of Figure 1, the test performed tested differences in body weight between the control group and each individual generation, not the generations to each other. Visually, it rather seems that in fact, body weight was not gradually increased for instance, comparison of WD1 and WD3, or WD2 and WD5, does not support the &quot;gradual increase&quot; in body weight that the authors are claiming.</p><p>2. There is a lack of clarity in the Materials and methods in regards to numbers of animals used in each generation, the number of founders, and what constitutes the control group. In the legend of Figure 1, it is stated that 5 males were used from WD2 and on. However, the method section states &quot;(…) 4 to 6 independent males of WD1 group&quot;. The reviewer assumes that the authors know how many animals were used in the WD1 group, and that the authors meant 4 to 6 animals per WD generation. However, if the details indicated in the legend of Figure 1 are accurate (5 fathers per group from WD2), how is it possible that 4 to 6 animals were used? The reviewer suggests to clarify this in the text, as well as in a more detailed experimental setup diagram/schematic stating the number of fathers in each generation, the number of offspring studied in each litter, and the total number of offspring studied for each generation.</p><p>3. In Supplemental Figure 1I, the CD1 group appears to be composed of 7 individuals and the CD2 group of 10 individuals. This is not consistent with the numbers reported in Figure 1A (10 in CD1 and 13 in WD3) and Figure 1B (22 visible dots). It is thus difficult for the reviewer to trust that body weights were truly compared between all animals in CD1 and CD5. Regardless, the reviewer is intrigued by the choice of the authors to only study control animals from the first generation (CD1), and the fifth generation (CD5) offspring, as they describe in the methods that, for the control group, they followed the same procedure as the WD group, which should have led to the generation of control animals in all F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5 generations. The authors should clarify on this, and if they indeed generated these animals, they should use body weight data in each generation of controls and compare them to their respective generation WD group (i.e. CD1 to WD1, CD2 to WD2 etc..). By having different sample size in the various groups, the authors are biasing results of the statistical test being made, as greater sample size is likely to compare statistically different than a group with lower sample size (as with CD(22 observations) and WD2(12observations) in Figure 1B, but also with the RNA-seq results). In the same line, there were more animals studied in WD4 and WD5 compared to WD1-3 which is likely biasing statistical analysis. Again, if the study design described in the methods section is accurately reported, it implies that an average of 3 offspring per fathers were used in WD1-3, and 8-10 (a full litter) for the WD4-5.</p><p>4. Number of mice per group range widely, and it is unclear how many matings this represents. Figure 3 legend states 4 WD1 and 9 WD5 males from different littermates were mated with CD females – again, unclear – do you mean from different litters? Numbers shown in panel A do not seem to concur with those in panels B, C.</p><p>5. It is unclear why mice were studied at the various ages- eg Across data sets, ages shown range from 10 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 18 weeks. Note there are inconsistencies regarding figure formats and some details are missing, which makes it hard to understand what the authors found. Figure S3 and S5- no n values given. Labels in S4 D, E hard to follow.</p><p>6. In several of the figures, it is not clear what the significance (*) is being compared to – is it always CD? Eg Figure 3, Figure 4</p><p>7. It appears that variability increases from WD1 to WD5- with larger ranges evident- is this why n increases across generations? And is this a consistent observation across paternal studies of this kind?</p><p>8. Regarding the phenotype induced by sperm RNA injection, the description should be more precise as the current description is not all consistent with the data presented. In Figure.4, some parameter changes persist to F2-F3, this already suggest transgenerational inheritance rather than merely intergenerational transmission. The more precise description should be that sperm RNAs can unequivocally induce intergenerational phenotype, but may induce some transgenerational features – although the effect is weaker than the effect induced by whole sperm. In fact, in a previous study using a mental-stress induced model, sperm RNA injection can also induce phenotype in both F1 and F2 generations (Nat Neurosci. 2014 May;17(5):667-9.).</p><p>9. The sperm small RNA analysis part (Figure S4) is relatively weak. The datasets generated are in fact quite valuable as they include the sperm from control diet, first-generation WD and the Fifth-generation WD. This is an opportunity to explore the difference especially between the first-generation WD and Fifth-generation WD as no one has done this before. The current data analyses are crude and did not show these differences in an informative way. It is needed to at least provide the overall length distribution of each datasets with the annotation of different types of small RNAs. The authors have shown some difference regarding miRNAs and tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) in Figure S4, it would be interesting to also look at the rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs) because rsRNAs are also extensively discovered in both mouse and human sperm and these sperm rsRNAs are sensitive to dietary changes (Nat Cell Biol. 2018 May;20(5):535-540; PLoS Biol. 2019 Dec 26;17(12):e3000559.), closely associated with mammalian epigenetic inheritance and thus represent a component of the recently proposed sperm RNA code in epigenetic inheritance (Nat Rev Endocrinol. 2019 Aug;15(8):489-498). The reanalysis of the datasets could be done by SPORTS1.0 (Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2018 Apr;16(2):144-151.), which provide the annotation and analyses of miRNAs, tsRNA, rsRNAs and piRNAs that have been used in the above mentioned publications (Nat Cell Biol. 2018 May;20(5):535-540; PLoS Biol. 2019 Dec 26;17(12):e3000559)</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>A much more detailed and thorough description of the experimental design with the possible inclusion of a schematic.</p><p>A better explanation of statistical analysis with a possible reanalysis of existing data.</p><p>Reanalysis of data according to Point #9 above.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Paternal multigenerational exposure to an obesogenic diet drives epigenetic predisposition to metabolic diseases in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In particular several referees mentioned that statistical analyses and their presentation remain a problem, and this needs to be rectified before we can move forward. Because of this we sought the opinion of a fourth referee who is an expert in Biostatistics, and their report is attached below. This individual raised similar concerns but felt that with appropriate revisions these problems might be overcome. This referee also provides comments for your help on some of the original Reviewer's feedback. You may in fact find it useful to consult with a Biostatistician to help address some of these problems. Please give these issues serious consideration before resubmitting your revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4</italic></p><p>The current manuscript studied the consequences of multigenerational (5 consecutive generations) of unbalanced diet feeding (WD) on the metabolic health of four subsequent generations of chow-diet-fed offsprings.</p><p>My review focuses primarily on the validity of the statistical analysis presented in this paper. In general, the analytics is appropriate but the presentation is confusing. Much of the statistical methods are written inside the caption and it's not very clear. Most of my comments below are related to improving the readability of the manuscript.</p><p>In summary, transcriptomics analysis (RNA-sequencing analysis) pipeline is standard and appropriate. Small RNA-sequencing analysis and annotation are based on SPORTS1.0 with DEseq used for DE analysis. Majority of statistical analyses were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the two-stage step-up method of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekuteil for multiple comparisons using GraphPad seems OK, but given a large number of comparisons, the multiple adjustments are really within WD1 to WD5 correct? Given the small n value in a certain context, caution is needed regarding the p-value interpretation.</p><p>Results presentations can be improved</p><p>- It is not clear what the significance (*) is being compared to – is it always CD? The caption wrote, &quot;and different numbers (1,2, 3) label significance when comparing the WDs groups with CD and with WD1, WD2, WD3, respectively.&quot; For example in Figure 1B, significance 1, 3 for WD4, is it compared with CD or WD1? Regardless, there looks like a bimodal distribution (a mixture of two groups) in WD4 in Figure 1B and the significant differences is driven by the sub-populations?</p><p>- Figure 3E demonstrate a clear bimodal distribution for the F3 cohort, and one should be extra careful on the p-value interpretation. These comments apply to a few other sub-figures.</p><p>- For Table 1, not sure why some of the results were mean+/- SD and others were median? Was the multiple comparison-adjusted across a mixture of median and mean or just one centralization measure.</p><p>Reviewer #1 comment 1</p><p>Authors address this issue – the term &quot;gradually&quot; was removed. There is a difference in the later generation but probably not before.</p><p>Reviewer #1 comment 2</p><p>Page 38 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) has the full exp design, however, the selection process is random (stated in the material and methods).</p><p>Reviewer #1 comment 3 – two key issues here:</p><p>a. All n = 53 (in WD5) is not independent.</p><p>Note, the design difference between WD3 and WD4-5, is that prior to WD3, only one mice from each litter is selected to mate whereas going from WD3 to WD4, there is no selection, nearly all litters (14 out of the 17 litter from WD3) were chosen to mate.</p><p>b. Why only CD1 an CD5 and not CD1, CD2,.… CD5. Should WD1 be compared to corresponding CD 1 rather than mixing CDs all together.</p><p>Re point (a) Reviewer #1 is concerned over the variability coming from (n=4) parents in WD1 is different from the variability coming from WD5. If you look at Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, the argument is mice from the same ancestor is likely to be more similar? The n isn't really as large as the authors have argued. One way to deal with this doing &quot;repeated measurement ANOVA&quot; accounting for the fact that mice from the same ancestor (same WD1) is dependent. Another adhoc way to demonstrate you didn't create significance with increasing the correlated sample is to select a subset in WD4 (e.g. n4 = 17) and WD5 to perform the analysis.</p><p>Re point b I think as far as body weights go, CDs (23 dots) looks very tight in Figure 1B, splitting them probably won't make a big difference.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Paternal multigenerational exposure to an obesogenic diet drives epigenetic predisposition to metabolic diseases in mice&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by David James (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>As before, the only issues concern the statistical analysis and so I opted to go back again to the original stats expert reviewer who also sought advice from an additional stats person. They considered the manuscript to be much improved but there are some relatively minor remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.</p><p>It is my opinion that these can be dealt with by you in a relatively straightforward manner but this will/may require some data re-analysis. I recommend that you consult with a statistician to help in addressing these comments if you are uncertain what the referee is asking.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is much improved, but I have one comment.</p><p>My previous comment on data heterogeneity did not intend to seek further statistical tests but for the authors to look deeper into their data. In particular, if there exists a subpopulation, how does that impact or change your conclusion. Furthermore, with the small sample size, it is difficult to conclude deviation from unimodal modality or outliers' existence.</p><p>In the author's response. I disagree that using a permutation test or a non-parametric statistical test justify investigating the mean in a bimodal distribution. The author's reply misunderstood my focus. There are two concepts here.</p><p>The appropriateness of a chosen statistics (eg difference in means), which is dependent on your question of interest and interpretation; and</p><p>The appropriateness of the distribution of statistics, which guides the p-value conclusion.</p><p>The use of non-parametric test deals with the latter but doesn't deal with the former. I question the interpretation of &quot;comparing two different means&quot; when the data is not unimodal. Here, there is a difference between what is statistically correct versus what is a reasonable assumption in practice. For data with a bimodal distribution, if you believe that there is only one population with a bimodal distribution, then non-parametric testing will provide the required solutions to compare the means. However, in practice, a more reasonable assumption when we observe bimodality or large spread in data (on the boxplot) is that this reflects two sub-populations suggesting latent classes. Here, care needs to be taken in the interpretation of your results. For example, if the data from group A has two modes (two sub-population) with two means of 4 and 8, respectively, and the data from group B has a mean of 4. Concluding that group B has a high overall average than group A doesn't capture the underlying latent structure. It isn't appropriate for the subpopulation in group A with a mean of 4.</p><p>Looking at Figure 1B and Figure 3, the data shows a huge spread, and this heterogeneity is either due to subpopulations or possibly outliers that you need to account for. Rather than a whole series of Dips test, some careful examination of the small number of cases where the data looks potentially bimodal or highly variable and describe how your overall interpretation would be alternated would be more informative than trying simply to justify interpretation based on the overall mean. I suggest performing sensitivity analysis and/or adding such a caveat in the discussion of your results and conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61736.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

What our study really shows is an exacerbation of the overweight phenotype upon successive WD-feeding generations. This exacerbation is evidenced by the fact that the males of WD4 and WD5 groups weighted significantly more than those of the WD1 group. This clarification has been included in the revised version lines 68-72 and stated in the legend of the Figure 1. This conclusion is supported by comparing differences in body weight among the different generations to each other (Figure 1B), thanks to a Kruskal-Wallis test, a rank-based nonparametric test, followed by the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamin, Krieger and Yekutieli for multiple comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, if the details indicated in the legend of Figure 1 are accurate (5 fathers per group from WD2), how is it possible that 4 to 6 animals were used? The reviewer suggests to clarify this in the text, as well as in a more detailed experimental setup diagram/schematic stating the number of fathers in each generation, the number of offspring studied in each litter, and the total number of offspring studied for each generation.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify our procedure, we added a detailed experimental setup (Figure1—figure supplement 1) and changed the text in both the legend of Figure 1 and in Materials and methods (Lines 326-336).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Supplemental Figure 1I, the CD1 group appears to be composed of 7 individuals and the CD2 group of 10 individuals. This is not consistent with the numbers reported in Figure 1A (10 in CD1 and 13 in WD3) and Figure 1B (22 visible dots). It is thus difficult for the reviewer to trust that body weights were truly compared between all animals in CD1 and CD5.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for that. The number of CD-fed mice obtained at the F1 and F5 generations were, as indicated in Figure 1A, 10 and 13, respectively. The Figure 1B has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regardless, the reviewer is intrigued by the choice of the authors to only study control animals from the first generation (CD1), and the fifth generation (CD5) offspring, as they describe in the methods that, for the control group, they followed the same procedure as the WD group, which should have led to the generation of control animals in all F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5 generations. The authors should clarify on this, and if they indeed generated these animals, they should use body weight data in each generation of controls and compare them to their respective generation WD group (i.e. CD1 to WD1, CD2 to WD2 etc..).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. In fact, to evaluate the evolution of body weight mass over successive generations of WD feeding, we used only one CD group as was the case in multigenerational studies (1, 2).</p><p>This strategy is based on previous studies showing that CD-fed generations exhibit very similar metabolic profiles such as total body weight mass and other metabolic parameters, ie fat mass, leptin and glucose sensitivity (3, 4).</p><p>Before mixing the control groups, body weight mass among all CD-fed generations were analyzed. No statistical difference (p&gt;0.05) was observed when we applied a Kruskal-Wallis test, a rank-based nonparametric test, two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamin, Krieger and Yekutieli for multiple comparisons (Figure 1—figure supplement 2J).</p><p>Finally, because only the first and fifth generation offspring were used to analyze organ weights (Figure 1B), we used a control offspring group of these two generations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>By having different sample size in the various groups, the authors are biasing results of the statistical test being made, as greater sample size is likely to compare statistically different than a group with lower sample size (as with CD(22 observations) and WD2(12observations) in Figure 1B, but also with the RNA-seq results). In the same line, there were more animals studied in WD4 and WD5 compared to WD1-3 which is likely biasing statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that increasing our sample size can give us greater power to detect differences. Accordingly, in our analysis, we took into account unequal size of the sample by using a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamin, Krieger and Yekutieli which can be used for multiple comparisons of independent sample of unequal size (5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, if the study design described in the Materials and methods is accurately reported, it implies that an average of 3 offspring per fathers were used in WD1-3, and 8-10 (a full litter) for the WD4-5.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the study design described in the methods section was inaccurately reported and has been corrected in the new version lines 326-336 and in Figure 1A—figure supplement 1. Because of the heterogeneity of the progenies, we, in fact, used 1, 2, 3 progenitors per offspring in WD1-5 generations. That explains why there were more animals studied in WD4 and WD5 compared to WD1-3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Number of mice per group range widely, and it is unclear how many matings this represents. Figure 3 legend states 4 WD1 and 9 WD5 males from different littermates were mated with CD females – again, unclear – do you mean from different litters?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, sorry we meant from different litters. The 4 WD1 males correspond to the male used in the Figure 1. Also, the 9 WD5 male were chosen arbitrary from the 4 different families.

No reason justified the use of various ages. The data have been homogenized. In all figures and Figures-Source data, body weight mass was indicated at 12 and 16 weeks.

It appears that variability increases from WD1 to WD5- with larger ranges evident- is this why n increases across generations?</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that the variability/heterogeneity increases from WD1 to WD5. This is the reason why n increases across generations. Indeed, since we observed heterogeneity among the same litter and to limit sampling bias and to keep the number of 4 independent families, we crossed more than one male from each litter to obtain the following generation. This precision has been added to the legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And is this a consistent observation across paternal studies of this kind?</p></disp-quote><p>In our knowledge, very few studies have been conducted on this condition in mice (2, 6, 7).

Regarding the phenotype induced by sperm RNA injection, the description should be more precise as the current description is not all consistent with the data presented. In Figure.4, some parameter changes persist to F2-F3, this already suggest transgenerational inheritance rather than merely intergenerational transmission. The more precise description should be that sperm RNAs can unequivocally induce intergenerational phenotype, but may induce some transgenerational features – although the effect is weaker than the effect induced by whole sperm. In fact, in a previous study using a mental-stress induced model, sperm RNA injection can also induce phenotype in both F1 and F2 generations (Nat Neurosci. 2014 May;17(5):667-9.).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and changed the text accordingly lines 211-221 and 231-236.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The sperm small RNA analysis part (Figure S4) is relatively weak. The datasets generated are in fact quite valuable as they include the sperm from control diet, first-generation WD and the Fifth-generation WD. This is an opportunity to explore the difference especially between the first-generation WD and Fifth-generation WD as no one has done this before. The current data analyses are crude and did not show these differences in an informative way. It is needed to at least provide the overall length distribution of each datasets with the annotation of different types of small RNAs. The authors have shown some difference regarding miRNAs and tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) in Figure S4, it would be interesting to also look at the rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs) because rsRNAs are also extensively discovered in both mouse and human sperm and these sperm rsRNAs are sensitive to dietary changes (Nat Cell Biol. 2018 May;20(5):535-540; PLoS Biol. 2019 Dec 26;17(12):e3000559.), closely associated with mammalian epigenetic inheritance and thus represent a component of the recently proposed sperm RNA code in epigenetic inheritance (Nat Rev Endocrinol. 2019 Aug;15(8):489-498). The reanalysis of the datasets could be done by SPORTS1.0 (Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2018 Apr;16(2):144-151.), which provide the annotation and analyses of miRNAs, tsRNA, rsRNAs and piRNAs that have been used in the above mentioned publications (Nat Cell Biol. 2018 May;20(5):535-540; PLoS Biol. 2019 Dec 26;17(12):e3000559)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very helpful comment.

One way to deal with this doing &quot;repeated measurement ANOVA&quot; accounting for the fact that mice from the same ancestor (same WD1) is dependent. Another adhoc way to demonstrate you didn't create significance with increasing the correlated sample is to select a subset in WD4 (e.g. n4 = 17) and WD5 to perform the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree with both reviewers that genetically and epigenetically speaking mice from the same ancestor is likely to be more similar than mice from different ancestors. To demonstrate that the significance is real and not affected by increasing the correlated sample, we selected a subset of 18 mice in WD4 and WD5 making sure that the 4 WD1 ancestors were equitably represented across the groups. 3 combinations of 18 mice were selected. All of these combinations gave the same conclusions, namely, the total body weight mass of the first three generations was different from the control group but very similar within the WD groups. In addition, the fourth and fifth generations were significantly different from CD and WD1 groups. One of these combinations is now presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B.</p><p>We use this option since while the total body weight mass appeared heterogeneous within a litter, this parameter was quite homogeneous within the same WD generation as now showed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Re point (b) I think as far as body weights go, CDs (23 dots) looks very tight in Figure 1B, splitting them probably won't make a big difference.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with the reviewer.

In particular, if there exists a subpopulation, how does that impact or change your conclusion. Furthermore, with the small sample size, it is difficult to conclude deviation from unimodal modality or outliers' existence.</p><p>In the author's response. I disagree that using a permutation test or a non-parametric statistical test justify investigating the mean in a bimodal distribution. The author's reply misunderstood my focus. There are two concepts here.</p><p>The appropriateness of a chosen statistics (eg difference in means), which is dependent on your question of interest and interpretation; and</p><p>The appropriateness of the distribution of statistics, which guides the p-value conclusion.</p><p>The use of non-parametric test deals with the latter but doesn't deal with the former. I question the interpretation of &quot;comparing two different means&quot; when the data is not unimodal. Here, there is a difference between what is statistically correct versus what is a reasonable assumption in practice. For data with a bimodal distribution, if you believe that there is only one population with a bimodal distribution, then non-parametric testing will provide the required solutions to compare the means. However, in practice, a more reasonable assumption when we observe bimodality or large spread in data (on the boxplot) is that this reflects two sub-populations suggesting latent classes. Here, care needs to be taken in the interpretation of your results. For example, if the data from group A has two modes (two sub-population) with two means of 4 and 8, respectively, and the data from group B has a mean of 4. Concluding that group B has a high overall average than group A doesn't capture the underlying latent structure. It isn't appropriate for the subpopulation in group A with a mean of 4.</p><p>Looking at Figure 1B and Figure 3, the data shows a huge spread, and this heterogeneity is either due to subpopulations or possibly outliers that you need to account for. Rather than a whole series of Dips test, some careful examination of the small number of cases where the data looks potentially bimodal or highly variable and describe how your overall interpretation would be alternated would be more informative than trying simply to justify interpretation based on the overall mean. I suggest performing sensitivity analysis and/or adding such a caveat in the discussion of your results and conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on Reviewer’s suggestions, we have now added several sentences to highlight phenotypic heterogeneity in the context of our model of paternal multigenerational exposure to Western diet. Please find here below, the sentences and the references added in the manuscript:</p><p>Lines 71-78</p><p>Despite marked heterogeneity in the WD4 and WD5 populations, we found that the WD4 and WD5 males weighted significantly more than the WD1 and WD3 ones (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B). Interestingly, growing heterogeneity of the body weight mass between the males of the first and the latter generations (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) was observed in the 4 independent families, indicating that the phenotypic heterogeneity previously observed in diet-induced obesity mouse models (10) increases progressively over the generations.</p><p>Lines 168-172</p><p>Thus, as illustrated in Figure 3B-I, the populations of males and females of the F3-WD1 progenies were very homogeneous, exhibiting metabolic characteristics very similar to control mice. By contrast, both populations of males and females of the F3-WD5 progenies were heterogeneous in terms of body and gWAT weights, some of them showing weights closed to CD mice and others being clearly overweight and fat. However, both F3-WD5 populations were significantly heavier and fatter (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) than control and F3-WD1 populations (Figure 3B-I and Figure 3—source data 1,2).</p><p>Lines 275-282</p><p>The main limitation of our study is the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in the males of the WD4 and WD5 generations (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) and in the CD-fed WD5 progenies (Figure 3) which might lead to biased conclusions. Indeed, although the statistical tests we used here should rule out this weakness, we cannot rule out the possibility of the presence of sub-populations. Metabolic heterogeneity induced by an unbalanced diet has already been reported in mice (10, 11) and the strong heterogeneity observed in our model may indicate an adaptative process whereby different subpopulations could emerge in response to the maintenance of an unbalanced diet.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
