SARS-CoV-2 in saliva based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification. The test has two steps: (1) heat saliva with a stabilization solution and (2) detect virus by incubating with a primer/enzyme mix. After incubation, saliva samples containing the SARS-CoV-2 genome turn bright yellow. Because this test is pH dependent, it can react falsely to some naturally acidic saliva samples. We report unique saliva stabilization protocols that rendered 295 healthy saliva samples compatible with the test, producing zero false positives. We also evaluated the test on 278 saliva samples from individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 but had no symptoms at the time of saliva collection, and from 54 matched pairs of saliva and anterior nasal samples from infected individuals. The Saliva TwoStep test described herein identified infections with 94% sensitivity and &gt;99% specificity in individuals with sub-clinical (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic) infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>testing</kwd><kwd>university</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PDEP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyerson</surname><given-names>Nicholas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PATH</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawyer</surname><given-names>Sara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1-DA-046108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawyer</surname><given-names>Sara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A quick and portable test makes saliva samples turn yellow when people are carrying SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Disease screening is one of the most basic and powerful tools in the public health arsenal. Screening tests identify unknown illness in apparently healthy or asymptomatic individuals. In the case of dangerous pathogens, screening tests serve to direct potential carriers of the pathogen into the healthcare system for confirmatory testing and to alert them that they could possibly infect others while they await confirmatory results. If dangerous pathogens are spreading at high rates, individuals will need to be screened frequently. As such, screening tests should operate with minimal requirements for laboratory equipment and labor, such that they are community deployable and do not burden the critical pipelines for diagnostics. In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, body temperature is a ubiquitous screening test being used on apparently healthy people around the world. However, using elevated body temperature as a sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection lacks specificity for this particular pathogen and sensitivity in identifying asymptomatic carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wright and Mackowiak, 2020</xref>). To help fill in the need for more reliable screening tests, here we present a simple and portable assay that detects the SARS-CoV-2 genome in saliva with specificity and sensitivity, even in samples from individuals with no symptoms at the time of saliva collection.</p><p>LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) is a simple nucleic acid diagnostic concept that has existed for more than 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Notomi, 2000</xref>). It has been used in diverse and even remote settings to test samples for the presence of viral nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewster et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chotiwan et al., 2017</xref>). LAMP utilizes loop forming primers and strand-displacement polymerases to achieve isothermal amplification of a target nucleic acid template, and therefore does not require a thermal cycler. LAMP assays can be performed anywhere because they simply require pipettors and a heating source (e.g. water baths or heat blocks) as equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewster et al., 2018</xref>). LAMP assays offer robust amplification of target material and can produce on the order of 10<sup>9</sup> copies of the target in an hour-long reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Notomi, 2000</xref>). Successful amplification in LAMP reactions can be directly visualized by simply looking at the reaction tube, where the reaction mix changes color upon successful target amplification. These colorimetric changes can be triggered by pH indicator dyes or metal ion indicators, which change color when successful target amplification changes the chemistry within the reaction tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kellner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Notomi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tanner et al., 2015</xref>). If more sophisticated visualization equipment is available, other indicators can used. Intercalating fluorescent DNA dyes or quenched fluorescent probes can be used which emit fluorescent signal over time during amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hardinge and Murray, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Seyrig et al., 2015</xref>). Alternately, real-time measurements of turbidity in the tube can be used to measure changes in turbidity resulting from magnesium pyrophosphate formation as amplification proceeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mori et al., 2001</xref>). Reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP, where a reverse transcription step is added upstream of the LAMP reaction, adapts all of these protocols for detection of RNA. RT-LAMP with a simple visual color change that occurs in sample tubes containing SARS-CoV-2 could be well suited as a rapid and deployable community-based screening test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Khan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have shown that saliva has high diagnostic value for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butler-Laporte et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Silva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vogels et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wyllie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yokota et al., 2020</xref>). Compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva samples harbor similar levels of viral load while being easier to obtain via self-collection. Several groups have developed RT-LAMP tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhadra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flynn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lalli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lamb et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nagura-Ikeda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rabe and Cepko, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Taki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yokota et al., 2020</xref>). However, due to pH variability between saliva samples, RT-LAMP often has a high rate of false positives when used with the common pH-dependent dye phenol red (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhadra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hardinge and Murray, 2019</xref>). In RT-LAMP reactions containing phenol red, reactions start as pink/red but turn strongly yellow at pH 6.8 and below. When RT-LAMP amplifies a target, hydrogen ions are released during dNTP incorporation. This causes a drop in pH within the tube to pH 6.0–6.5, triggering the color change to yellow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tanner et al., 2015</xref>). Human saliva naturally varies in pH between 6.8 and 7.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cameron et al., 2015</xref>), posing a significant problem in this pH-dependent assay. In fact, we find about 7% of human saliva samples are naturally acidic enough to immediately trigger phenol red-containing reactions to change to yellow without any target amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). If acidic samples are not anticipated and managed, colorimetric RT-LAMP has the potential to produce a high false-positive rate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optimized strategy for controlling natural variability in saliva pH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Here, saliva samples from 96 different individuals are analyzed for the prevalence of natural acidity extreme enough to trigger the pink-to-yellow color change of phenol red even before isothermal amplification. Each saliva sample was combined 1:1 with water (left) or 2× saliva stabilization solution (right; Materials and methods) and heated at 95°C for 10 min to liberate RNA from virions. Two microliters of each was then added to 18 µL RT-LAMP reaction mix (2× Colorimetric RT-LAMP Master Mix, RNase P primers, nuclease-free water). The pictures show tubes immediately after samples and master mix are combined, before any incubation steps are undertaken to commence isothermal amplification. With raw saliva, 7 of 96 tubes turned yellow at this step (highlighted in red boxes). These are false positives because no amplification reaction has occurred. None of these 96 saliva samples mixed with saliva stabilization solution turned the reaction tube prematurely yellow. (<bold>B</bold>) Here, we show the method used to identify the ideal pH of the saliva stabilization solution used in (<bold>A</bold>) and throughout this paper. We chose four normal and four acidic saliva samples and mixed each 1:1 with 2× saliva stabilization solution containing NaOH at various concentrations (final molarity of NaOH after mixing shown). Samples were then heated at 95°C for 10 min and combined with RT-LAMP reaction mix and control primers recognizing the human RNase P transcript. Before incubation, all tubes should be pink, and after incubation, all tubes should be yellow. Based on this, the red box indicates the final optimal NaOH concentration chosen.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65113-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Optimized heat inactivation for safely detecting SARS-CoV-2 in human saliva.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) This experiment shows that heating at 95°C for 10 min degrades viral RNA when it is not in the form of virions. Saliva samples were diluted 1:1 with saliva stabilization solution. In vitro transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA was spiked into the diluted saliva to reach the indicated concentrations before (left) or after (right) the heating at 95°C for 10 min. To match other experiments, the indicated concentration represents the copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the original undiluted saliva. The samples were then subjected to RT-LAMP at 65°C for 30 min. In this colorimetric version of RT-LAMP, reactions remain pink when no amplification occurred, and turned yellow if there was an amplification event. An RT-LAMP primer set targeting the human RNaseP transcript is included as a host RNA amplification control in addition to the three SARS-CoV-2 primer sets shown in (<bold>A</bold>). (<bold>B</bold>) This experiment shows that heating saliva at 95°C for 10 min does not degrades viral RNA when it is in the form of virions. Saliva samples were spiked with the indicated concentrations of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions before being diluted 1:1 with saliva stabilization solution. Samples were then heated at 95°C for 10 min and subjected to RT-LAMP similarly to the experiment shown in (<bold>A</bold>). (<bold>C</bold>) Results illustrate the optimal incubation time at 95°C to liberate SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virions. Saliva samples were spiked with the indicated concentrations of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions before being diluted 1:1 with saliva stabilization solution. Samples were then heated at 95°C for the indicated amount of time, and subjected to RT-LAMP similarly to the experiment shown in (<bold>B</bold>). Without heating, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected with RT-LAMP, presumably because virions remain intact and the viral RNA is not accessible by the amplification enzymes. Amplification is somewhat inconsistent at 5 and 30 min possibly because at 5 min hardly any RNA has been liberated, and by 30 min, it has been largely degraded. However, 10 or 15 min at 95°C appears to provide just the right balance between liberating and preserving RNA. All reactions contain the AS1E primer set.

This test does not require RNA purification but rather works directly with human saliva. We optimized a saliva stabilization solution that (1) addresses the pH variability of human saliva and essentially eliminates false positives, (2) lowers the viscosity of saliva, and (3) stabilizes RNA for analysis in the test. We validated the RT-LAMP test using a large cohort of saliva and matched nasal swab specimens collected from our local university population, comparing the test to two other quantitative RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests (one nasal test and one saliva test). We found that our optimized RT-LAMP procedure performs consistently with high specificity and sensitivity, even though our samples were largely from individuals who had no reported symptoms at the time of sample collection. Based on our experience performing screening on our university campus and elsewhere, we provide in Appendix 1 extensive operational details and recommendations for successful community deployment of this SARS-CoV-2 screening test.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimized universal saliva stabilization conditions for RT-LAMP</title><p>To deal with the variability in pH of human saliva, we optimized a basic saliva stabilization solution by titrating in various concentrations of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). We performed this optimization using a control RT-LAMP primer set, ‘RNaseP’, which amplifies the mRNA transcript produced from the human <italic>POP7</italic> gene (primer set developed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Curtis et al., 2018</xref>]). Our goal was to increase the pH of all saliva samples well above the indicator flip-point of pH 6.8, while not making the samples so basic that they could not reach this pH upon successful target amplification. We found that human saliva containing 14.5 mM NaOH is optimal to inhibit false positives caused by saliva acidity (N = 96; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right) without impeding the intended color change during amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, we designed our saliva stabilization solution to also include a chelating agent (1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] final concentration) and Proteinase K to inhibit RNases, both of which help preserve virion RNA and therefore to increase sensitivity. (Note that Proteinase K will inhibit the RT-LAMP reaction if it does not go through a heat inactivation step prior to that reaction.) Finally, the saliva stabilization solution contains TCEP, which aids in RNA stabilization by breaking disulfide bonds present in RNases and helps to reduce saliva viscosity. Our optimized saliva stabilization solution (2× solution: 5 mM TCEP, 2 mM EDTA, 29 mM NaOH, 100 μg/mL Proteinase K, diluted in DEPC-treated water) is key to this test.

However, when heating saliva samples for downstream analysis of RNA, one must balance heating long enough to liberate the target RNA from virions with not heating for so long that the target RNA will be degraded.

Participants were asked to refrain from eating or drinking 30 min prior to sample collection, and to not participate if they were experiencing any symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Therefore, individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were either pre-symptomatic at the time of saliva collection, or they never developed symptoms throughout the course of infection (we do not have the necessary follow-up data to delineate). All saliva samples were analyzed by a quantitative RT-PCR method performed directly on saliva, which was mixed 1:1 with 2× TBE buffer containing 1% Tween-20 (saliva sample prep as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ranoa et al., 2020</xref>). An in-house multiplex quantitative RT-PCR assay was used to determine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in saliva, with primers targeting the E and N gene regions of the SARS-2-CoV genome (see Materials and methods).

Since the heating component of our Saliva Preparation step had already been performed, an aliquot of the heated saliva sample was transferred into our 2× saliva stabilization solution (without Proteinase K) and then put through the RT-LAMP reaction as described above. For each of the 573 samples, three RT-LAMP reactions were performed with different primer sets: RNaseP (positive control), AS1E, and CU-N2 (the latter two sets detecting SARS-CoV-2). During this part of the study, we noticed that decreasing the input sample amount (saliva + saliva stabilization solution) from 4 μL to 2 μL in a total reaction volume of 20 μL further increased tolerance of the RT-LAMP reaction color to acidic saliva samples because less saliva is added. We thus reduced the input sample amount to 2 μL when evaluating these human samples.

Therefore, there were zero false positives, and the test had a specificity of 100% in this extensive sample set.

The mixture is heated at 95°C for 10 min. This step serves to increase the pH of saliva, liberate viral RNA from virions in the saliva, and inactivate virions for safe handling (although appropriate safety precautions should always be taken).

(2) We optimized a saliva stabilization solution that allows for analysis of a broad range of naturally acidic saliva samples while maintaining compatibility with a colorimetric RT-LAMP assay. The solution also helps preserve saliva samples for at least 4 days before processing and lowers saliva viscosity. (3) We determined the optimal sample heating condition that liberates the host and viral RNA with minimal degradation. The simple heating step increases biosafety and avoids formal RNA extraction procedures. (4) For RT-LAMP, we incorporated additional primers based on up-do-date SARS-CoV-2 genome databases and identified primers allowing efficient target amplification. These primers are expected to work on most or all viral variants currently circulating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, with the simplified two steps of saliva preparation and virus detection, the test has a rapid sample-to-result turnaround time of 45 min.</p><p>Through the optimization process, we identified other potential sources of false-positive results and provided a detailed summary for troubleshooting (Materials and methods and Appendix 1). In addition, from our experience of the actual deployment of this screening test, we summarized the standard operational procedures for saliva sample collection, including the design of a stabilization solution dispensing apparatus to preserve samples while avoiding environmental contamination and protecting workers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; Appendix 1). By strictly following these application notes, we completely avoided false positive results during the evaluation of a large cohort of human saliva samples, achieving 100% specificity. We also evaluated the RT-LAMP test performance based on the experimentally determined limit of detection. Using SARS-CoV-2-positive human saliva samples, we confirmed that the RT-LAMP test can consistently identify infected individuals with 94% sensitivity.</p><p>During the test development and optimization, we have also explored additional methods that may help enhance the RT-LAMP test performance and consistency. Previous work suggests that the addition of 40 mM of guanidine chloride in the RT-LAMP reaction mix could increase RT-LAMP amplification efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, we did not observe similar enhancement when included in our experiments. To further prevent carry over contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidi et al., 2020</xref>), the usage of dUTP and uracil-DNA-glycosylase-containing RT-LAMP reaction mix can be considered. Previous studies have shown that the addition of this alternative master mix does not affect the RT-LAMP limit of detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kellner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Saliva TwoStep requires less sample processing, reaction incubation time, and laboratory overhead as compared to quantitative RT-PCR methods. The result is the ability to run significantly more tests with a given amount of resources. Based on these observations, we conclude that the Saliva TwoStep test described herein can be used as a SARS-CoV-2 screening tool to reliably identify infectious individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) with minimal laboratory setup, potentially serving as a tool for effective SARS-CoV-2 surveillance at the community level. This RT-LAMP testing offers many solutions to a nation-wide shortage of COVID-19 testing. With minimal set-up, this test could be performed in diverse settings such as factories, office buildings, or schools.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>RT-LAMP primer design and preparation</title><p>Regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that are conserved among strains were identified using genome diversity data from NextStrain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">nextstrain.org/ncov/global</ext-link>). Next, nucleotide-BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) was used to filter out genome sequences that share high-sequence homology with other seasonal coronavirus genomes. Finally, PrimerExplorer V5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://primerexplorer.jp/e/">primerexplorer.jp/e/</ext-link>) was used to design RT-LAMP primers targeting the specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The F3, B3, FIP, BIP, Loop F, and Loop B primers were selected for optimal melting temperature and complementarity using A plasmid editor (ApE). In all cases, a 10× concentration of primer sets was made containing 16 μM FIP and BIP primers, 4 μM LF and LB primers, and 2 μM F3 and B3 primers.</p><p>All primers should be ordered with HPLC purification, which ensures the yield and avoids cross-contamination from other SARS-CoV-2-related synthesis projects being run on the same equipment at the oligo synthesis facilities (which can lead to false positives). This is particularly a problem during a pandemic where these facilities are handling many oligo synthesis orders focused on the same pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mögling et al., 2020</xref>). It is also recommended that you communicate with the primer synthesis company to inform them that primers are intended for use with a SARS-CoV-2 screening test. Several companies have dedicated facilities for minimizing cross-contamination of SARS-CoV-2 templates. In addition, primers should be diluted in nuclease-free water, instead of Tris–EDTA buffer, which will also inhibit pH change that takes place during RT-LAMP.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Primer set name</th><th>LAMP primer component</th><th>Primer sequence (5′–3′)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="6">‘RNaseP’ amplifies human RNA for positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Curtis et al., 2018</xref>)</td><td valign="top">F3</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TTGATGAGCTGGAGCCA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">B3</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CACCCTCAATGCAGAGTC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Loop F</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">ATGTGGATGGCTGAGTTGTT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Loop B</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CATGCTGAGTACTGGACCTC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">FIP</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GTGTGACCCTGAAGACTCGGTTTTAGCCACTGACTCGGATC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BIP</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CCTCCGTGATATGGCTCTTCGTTTTTTTCTTACATGGCTCTGGTC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">‘AS1E’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rabe and Cepko, 2020</xref>)</td><td valign="top">F3</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CGGTGGACAAATTGTCAC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">B3</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CTTCTCTGGATTTAACACACTT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Loop F</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TTACAAGCTTAAAGAATGTCTGAACACT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Loop B</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TTGAATTTAGGTGAAACATTTGTCACG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">FIP</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCAGCACACAAAGCCAAAAATTTAT<underline>TTTT</underline>CTGTGCAAAGGAAATTAAGGAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BIP</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TATTGGTGGAGCTAAACTTAAAGCC<underline>TTTT</underline>CTGTACAATCCCTTTGAGTG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">‘CU-N2’ developed herein</td><td valign="top">F3</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CGGCAGTCAAGCCTCTTC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">B3</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TTGCTCTCAAGCTGGTTCAA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Loop F</td><td valign="top"><italic>This set does not require a Loop F primer</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Loop B</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">ATGGCGGTGATGCTGCTCTT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">FIP</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCCCCTACTGCTGCCTGGAGCGTTCCTCATCACGTAGTCG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BIP</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCTCCTGCTAGAATGGCTGGCATCTGTCAAGCAGCAGCAAAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">‘ORF1e’ developed herein</td><td valign="top">F3</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GGCTAACTAACATCTTTGGC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">B3</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GTCAGCACACAAAGCCAA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Loop F</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCTTCAAGCCAATCAAGGAC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Loop B</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TTGTCGGTGGACAAATTGT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">FIP</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCTCTAAGAAACTCTACACCTTCC<underline>TTTT</underline>TACTGTTTATGAAAAACTCAAACC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BIP</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TATCTCAACCTGTGCTTGTGAAA<underline>TTTT</underline>AGAATGTCTGAACACTCTCCT</named-content></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>SARS-CoV-2 RNA and virion standards</title><p>Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA control (Twist Bioscience #102019) was obtained, and its copy number of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> copies/μL was confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR in conjunction with a DNA plasmid control containing a region of the N gene from the SARS-CoV-2 genome (IDT #10006625).

Two microliters of this diluted saliva was transferred into eight-strip PCR tubes containing RT-LAMP reaction mixture (enzymes and primers). For each sample, three RT-LAMP reactions were carried out to amplify human RNaseP as a control and AS1E and CU-N2 for SARS-CoV-2. The reactions were incubated at 65°C for 30 min followed by inactivation at 80°C for 2 min on a thermal cycler (Bio-RAD T100). A color change from pink to yellow was observed visually to interpret results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dan Larremore for valuable advice, Annika Rollock for help with graphics, and the University of Colorado Boulder for their ambitious and aggressive approach to keeping our campus safe.

1</title><boxed-text><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Section 1: Recommended procedures for sample collection</title><p>When deploying Saliva TwoStep RT-LAMP screening test, it is important to set up saliva sample collection sites that allow large numbers of participants to move through the sample collection process quickly and smoothly. In addition, it is important to exercise extra precautions to avoid sample cross-contamination as well as the exposure of the sample or stabilization solution. With this in mind, we have designed and optimized a saliva sample collection workflow that utilizes a customized stabilization dispensing apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>):</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>At the designated sample collection site, the screening test participants retrieve a 5 mL screw-cap tube (MTC Bio #C2530) and collect passive drool into the 5 mL tube until liquid saliva reaches the 1 mL graduation mark. Bubbles do not contribute toward the 1 mL volume.</p></list-item><list-item><p>After collecting saliva, the testing participants submerge capped 5 mL collection tube in a 250 mL beaker with 70% ethanol to decontaminate the surface. They then remove the tube, carefully uncap it, and place it in the slot of the dispensing apparatus sample tray while in Position 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Staff then move the sample tray towards themselves by gently pulling on sample tray handle until it is seated against the back wall and the sample tube is underneath the cover assembly and centered under the dispenser nozzle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, Position 2). This partially enclosed space limits the potential risk of splashes and aerosols during this solution addition step.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Staff then use the bottle top dispenser (Fisher Scientific #13681527) to gently add 1 mL of stabilization solution into sample tube (for an approximate 1:1 ratio of sample to solution). The apparatus holds the dispenser nozzle and sample tube in a fixed orientation to prevent cross-contamination during this step.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Staff slide the sample tray containing the collection tube back toward the participant. The participant re-approaches to cap their sample with the screw-top lid, shakes it vigorously for 5–10 s to mix, cleans the surface with a wipe or by dunking in disinfectant, and places it on ice.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Staff then heat-inactivates the sample on-site by incubating it in a 95°C water bath or heat block (heat block preferred for minimizing spill risk) for 10 min.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Before the next testing participant approaches, staff sprays the sample tray with disinfectant.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Staff subsequently stores the inactivated sample on ice in a cooler and then transports it to Saliva TwoStep RT-LAMP testing area (see below).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Biosafety note</title><p>Staff involved in saliva collection should wear all appropriate PPE including a fit-tested N95 mask. Regular surface decontamination is performed with 70% ethanol or bleach in the case of spills. Heating elements and cords are secured and situated away from foot traffic. Collection takes place outdoors for ventilation purposes whenever possible. Subjects maintain 10-foot distance from each other while unmasked and producing samples. Hand sanitizer is provided before and after collection procedure. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Collection site material list</title><p>Staff set up a table with the following supplies: one 250 mL plastic beaker with 70% ethanol, one 250 mL plastic beaker with 10% bleach, two spray bottles with 70% ethanol, one dispenser apparatus (custom polycarbonate device) with bottle top reagent dispenser (Fisher) and 100 mL glass bottle with stabilization solution, one ice bucket with ice, one water bath with tube rack and temperature probe, one digital timer, and one cooler with ice. Additional items include paper towels, trash receptacles, spill kits, power cords, hand sanitizer, and additional PPE, ethanol, and bleach. Quantities can be scaled up as needed.</p></sec><sec id="s11" sec-type="appendix"><title>Section 2: Recommended testing lab setup</title><sec id="s11-1"><title>Controlling acidic and variable human saliva samples</title><p>We found that the biggest obstacle to implementing the colorimetric RT-LAMP assay is the variability in the reaction pH condition. First, false-positive signal can result from saliva samples that are naturally acidic. We spent significant time addressing this issue and ultimately found that all samples must be rendered basic as described in the article in order to set the correct threshold for specificity in the test. This was achieved through a titration series of sodium hydroxide in the saliva stabilization solution to find the optimal concentration that would ensure all RT-LAMP reactions start pink and are still capable of turning yellow if amplification occurs. However, note that other components in the saliva stabilization solution (EDTA, pH = 8.0, and TCEP–HCl) have also played a role in establishing the optimal pH. Additional saliva stabilization solution optimization might be needed if other forms of these components are used. Second, the colorimetric RT-LAMP reaction relies on phenol red to detect the pH change during the amplification. Any additional buffering agents, such as tris–acetate or tris–borate that are commonly present in laboratory reagents, should be avoided to prevent potential false-negative signals, as these buffering agents tend to inhibit the pH change.</p></sec><sec id="s11-2"><title>Controlling reaction acidification by carbonic acid</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dao Thi et al., 2020</xref> for additional, excellent advice.</p><p>A second issue that has to be carefully controlled is the exposure of reaction components to the surrounding environment. When carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in water, it creates carbonic acid, which if present in high enough quantities can trigger the phenol red to turn yellow regardless of reaction state. Control measures should be implemented in three ways: First, we advise preparing the reaction mix (RT-LAMP master mix, primers, and water) right before sample loading. This is to prevent background amplification as well as the acidification of the reaction mix due to exposure to air. For this reason, we advise against the use of 96-well plates. Additionally, dry ice should be avoided or completely isolated from the reaction components during sample transportation, as the exposure to the excessive carbon dioxide could also lead to acidification of the reaction mix. Second, during the 30 min 65°C incubation, it is essential to completely seal off the reaction tubes to prevent vaporization of the reaction mix, as well as the infiltration of the water vapor if a water bath is used. We have noticed that an incomplete seal could lead to false positive signals. Last, because RT-LAMP amplification is highly robust, the test is very sensitive to contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidi et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, opening of reaction tubes after RT-LAMP has occurred should be strictly avoided as these tubes contain a large amount of target DNA. Alternatively, the NEB WarmStart LAMP 2× Master Mix with UDG (NEB M1804) can be used to eliminate DNA contamination. Through these results are not shown, we have verified the same limit of detection can be reach using this alternative master mix.</p></sec><sec id="s11-3"><title>Controlling laboratory-based contamination</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidi et al., 2020</xref> for additional, excellent troubleshooting advice.</p><p>When carrying out the RT-LAMP SARS-CoV-2 screening test at scale, it is critical to assign isolated workstations, each containing their own set of laboratory equipment such as pipettes, centrifuges, vortexes, and cleaning supplies. This equipment should never move between stations and be regularly decontaminated using a detergent-based cleaning solution such as 10% bleach or any other commercially available solution designed to eliminate nucleic acid contaminants. Additionally, special care should be taken by laboratory staff to regularly replace gloves if moving <italic>backwards</italic> from the following workstations:</p><sec id="s11-3-1"><title>Workstation 1: Setting up master mixes</title><p>This workstation is dedicated to making and aliquoting the master mix containing the RT-LAMP enzymes, primers, and water. All reagents should be centrifuged and spun down after thawing. As mentioned above, master mix should be made and aliquoted shortly before addition of saliva (Workstation 2) to avoid carbon dioxide solubilization due to atmospheric exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s11-3-2"><title>Workstation 2: Adding saliva samples to aliquoted RT-LAMP reaction tubes</title><p>This workstation is dedicated to handling the processed saliva samples. Once saliva samples are added to the aliquoted RT-LAMP reaction tubes, care should be taken to ensure that an appropriate seal is established (e.g. dome cap strips) to minimize airflow during reaction incubation. This workstation should include two micropipettes capable of pipetting a volume of 2 µl. One pipette can be used for saliva samples, while the other pipette should be used exclusively for pipetting any RNA controls (e.g. in vitro transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA).</p></sec><sec id="s11-3-3"><title>Workstation 3: RT-LAMP reaction incubation and results reporting</title><p>This workstation contains the heating element (e.g. heat block, thermal cycler) where RT-LAMP reactions are incubated. This workstation has the highest risk of contamination, since the RT-LAMP reaction products will be in high abundance and can themselves serve as a template in subsequent reactions. When reactions are removed from the heating element, they should immediately be analyzed, results recorded, and then reaction tubes should be disposed in a container with a lid. <italic>Never carry completed reaction tubes to any other part of the lab. Never open completed reaction tubes for any reason.</italic> Any laboratory technician that has entered Workstation three should dispose of their gloves before returning to any other part of the lab.</p></sec></sec></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><boxed-text><table-wrap id="inlinetable4" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Petr Chlanda (Reviewer #2); Viet Loan Dao Thi (Reviewer #3, co-reviewed with Prof. Michael Knop).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors develop a diagnostic testing approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH of samples. They tested the utility of the approach using clinical saliva samples (both PCR negative and PCR positive samples) thus demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity of their test. As SARS-CoV-2 infections increase around the world, this approach promises to deliver public health benefit.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p>1. The authors used NaOH to adjust the pH of the saliva before RT-LAMP and found that 14.5 mM NaOH is sufficient to neutralize the saliva without compromising RT-LAMP detection.</p><p>2. The method was validated on a cohort of human saliva samples (295 negatives, 168 positives) that were tested by RT-PCR.</p><p>The presented work provides a promising step towards rapid and inexpensive testing for SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. An important matter of concern is the sensitivity of the assay. The authors state that they investigated this using samples from university testing. This university testing was conducted using a direct RT-qPCR assay with a limit of detection (LOD) of approx. 5000 viral copies per ml of saliva sample. This reference (their ref 12) should be included also on page 25. This LOD is approx. 10x lower (3-4 CT steps) than RT-qPCR based on isolated RNA and using commercial state of the art RT-qPCR kits. The best commercial RT-qPCR kits, which employ novel primer designs and semi-nested PCR strategies that can detect a single RNA molecule in the reaction with &gt;95% sensitivity, are roughly 50x (5-6 CT steps) more sensitive than the direct RT-qPCR assay used in this study. The authors explained that they used from this student cohort &quot;295 negative samples, and 168 positive samples with viral loads at or above our limit of detection (200 virions/μL)&quot;. For this testing, they used 1 μl of saliva volume which corresponds to a sensitivity of 200'000 genomes per ml of saliva. From this, several questions arise: The 168 positive samples tested: from how many different people do they origin? Are there also longitudinal sample series included? What fraction of the RT-qPCR positive samples of the university testing contained a lower viral load than the detection limit estimate from Figure S4, and hence were not considered for the analysis? Why was the analysis limited to this high-load sample range? If they had included also the remaining positive samples, they could have better calculated the sensitivity as a function of the CT of diagnostic RT-qPCR. Samples with low viral loads must be included in the revision. From this, the authors can calculate the fraction of students they would have missed when using RT-LAMP instead of RT-qPCR, and, when combined with contact tracing data (which they seem to have available), they could have tried to estimate the impact of their RT-LAMP procedure vs the used RT-qPCR strategy. What would be the LOD if the results of both primer sets were combined?</p><p>2. No data are shown on the prevalence of acidic saliva in the tested cohort. It is not known how many samples were acidic, and it could also be that all tested negative samples had a neutral pH. Further, no data is available on whether the addition of NaOH to already neutral saliva will decrease the detection limit. The study could be improved by providing RT-LAMP data performed with and without NaOH on the same set of samples. This could be done by using RT-LAMP with and without NaOH on the same set of samples and show photographs of the test tubes before and after heat incubation. Besides, this would also allow direct determination of the false positive number in cases where NaOH is not used.

Figure 3 shows that the detection limit of RT-LAMP is around 200 virions/µl (Ct ~ 30) in the presence of 14.5 mM NaOH. The detection limit, specificity, and sensitivity for naturally neutral saliva with and without the addition of 14.5mM NaOH should be determined and directly compared, using both high and low viral load samples.</p><p>4.

An important matter of concern is the sensitivity of the assay. The authors state that they investigated this using samples from university testing. This university testing was conducted using a direct RT-qPCR assay with a limit of detection (LOD) of approx. 5000 viral copies per ml of saliva sample. This reference (their ref 12) should be included also on page 25. This LOD is approx. 10x lower (3-4 CT steps) than RT-qPCR based on isolated RNA and using commercial state of the art RT-qPCR kits. The best commercial RT-qPCR kits, which employ novel primer designs and semi-nested PCR strategies that can detect a single RNA molecule in the reaction with &gt;95% sensitivity, are roughly 50x (5-6 CT steps) more sensitive than the direct RT-qPCR assay used in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added significantly more detail to the methods section regarding the methods used in university testing, including adding the reference but also additional details as well.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that the detection limit of RT-qPCR is different depending on whether the template is purified RNA or saliva. We have been more careful to discuss this difference and to state the LoDs of each, where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors explained that they used from this student cohort &quot;295 negative samples, and 168 positive samples with viral loads at or above our limit of detection (200 virions/μL)&quot;. For this testing, they used 1 μl of saliva volume which corresponds to a sensitivity of 200'000 genomes per ml of saliva. From this, several questions arise: The 168 positive samples tested: from how many different people do they origin? Are there also longitudinal sample series included?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point which we now clarify. We have added the following text to the beginning of the Results section where we describe out sample cohort: “Because positive results in our screening regimen result in university affiliates being directed to their healthcare provider, with a few exceptions every positive sample is from a unique individual. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What fraction of the RT-qPCR positive samples of the university testing contained a lower viral load than the detection limit estimate from Figure S4, and hence were not considered for the analysis? Why was the analysis limited to this high-load sample range? If they had included also the remaining positive samples, they could have better calculated the sensitivity as a function of the CT of diagnostic RT-qPCR. Samples with low viral loads must be included in the revision. From this, the authors can calculate the fraction of students they would have missed when using RT-LAMP instead of RT-qPCR, and, when combined with contact tracing data (which they seem to have available), they could have tried to estimate the impact of their RT-LAMP procedure vs the used RT-qPCR strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>Done! We have now included the data requested in Figure 4A. As suggested, we also added the panel new Figure 4B, which illustrates the RT-LAMP sensitivity as a function of the RT-qPCR Ct values. In addition, we calculated the test sensitivity considering the entire cohort (new Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What would be the LOD if the results of both primer sets were combined?</p></disp-quote><p>We did such an experiment (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). When a test is considered positive only if both of the primer sets turn positive, the observed LOD using the positive saliva samples is 1607 virions/μl. If a test is considered positive if either of the primer sets turns positive, the observed LOD is 102 virions/μl. As would be expected, it lowers the sensitivity a little when you require two non-perfect primer pairs to both agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. No data are shown on the prevalence of acidic saliva in the tested cohort. It is not known how many samples were acidic, and it could also be that all tested negative samples had a neutral pH. Further, no data is available on whether the addition of NaOH to already neutral saliva will decrease the detection limit. The study could be improved by providing RT-LAMP data performed with and without NaOH on the same set of samples. This could be done by using RT-LAMP with and without NaOH on the same set of samples and show photographs of the test tubes before and after heat incubation. Besides, this would also allow direct determination of the false positive number in cases where NaOH is not used. Related to this, please provide data that would support your statement on page 4, &quot;In fact, we find about 10% of human saliva samples are naturally acidic enough to immediately trigger phenol red-containing reactions to change to yellow without any target amplification required.&quot; The number of naturally acidic saliva samples in the cohort is not reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We did all of these experiments and added them to the paper.</p><p>To test for the prevalence of the naturally acidic saliva, we tested 96 saliva samples and examined how many would turn the RT-LAMP reaction with or without the optimized stabilization solution (New Panel A in Figure 1).</p><p>We also did the requested experiments demonstrating that the stabilization solution helps prevent false positivity prior to incubation for RT-LAMP amplification, without creating false negatives. The experiments that the reviewers suggested are now shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 1.

Because it contains TCEP-HCl, the stabilization solution is acidic without the addition of any NaOH. This causes all RT-LAMP reactions turned yellow even before incubation for RT-LAMP amplification, just as acidic saliva samples also do.</p><p>An alternative negative control for 0 mM NaOH would be adding raw saliva directly into the RTLAMP reaction mix without any saliva stabilization solution at all. We have now done this experiment and it is shown in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (panel B).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65113-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An addition of 14.5 mM of NaOH to all samples might decrease the detection limit of RT-LAMP.

First, we measured the RT-LAMP detection upper limit using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA diluted in nuclease-free water and directly added to the RTLAMP master mix (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1, panel A). It is 200 genome copies/µl. We then confirmed that such detection limit remains at 200 virions/µl when using pH-neutral saliva spiked-in with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions and mixed 1:1 with stabilization solution containing 14.5 mM NaOH (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1, panel B). This suggests neither the saliva nor the stabilization solution has negative effect on the RT-LAMP detection limit.</p><p>To more directly address the question of whether the NaOH-containing stabilization solution has negative impact on RT-LAMP detection limit, we also attempted mixing pH-neutral saliva spiked-in with virions 1:1 with nuclease-free water. The samples were again heated at 95ºC for 10 minutes before added to RT-LAMP reaction mix. However, we observed inconsistent results (or detection limit &gt; 800 virions/µl), in the absence of stabilization solution (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1, panel B). This is likely due to RNA degradation due to heat and/or nuclease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We re-did the experiment described in now Figure 1—figure supplement 2 with the additional control conditions and remade a new Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Due to the rather complex experimental setup, we included panel A in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 illustrating the experimental conditions. Based on the results, we observed that the conditions used in our test (condition C in the new figure) were able to preserve the RNA in the samples and maintain the detection limit of 200 virions/µl for at least 96 hours. However, both control conditions failed to preserve human and viral RNA, thus resulting in inconsistent results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.

SARS-CoV-2 positive saliva samples were collected from September 16 – September 25, 2020, from which <italic>all</italic> positive saliva samples above the RT-qPCR detection limit were used for RT-LAMP validation illustrated in Figure 4A. The RT-qPCR method used for the SARS-CoV-2 screening is consistent during this time period, with the details described in the existing method section.</p><p>The “non-natural bimodal” observation by the reviewer is a combined result of two things: (1) The large majority of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples had a Ct value for N gene centered around 29-32; and (2) the separation of RTLAMP positive and negative samples from the same population for clear visualization. In addition, we also noticed the lack of separation of the data points in Figure 4A could lead to visual confusion, and subsequently fixed the figure width to address that problem.</p><p>To clarify this matter further, we added a figure showing the overall SARS-CoV-2 N gene</p><p>Ct distribution of all samples collected during the stated time period (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A).
