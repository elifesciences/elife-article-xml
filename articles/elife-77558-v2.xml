high-frequency firing and contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and disease pathophysiology. Here, we show, for the first time, that <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> can be reconstituted in a heterologous system by coexpression of sodium channel α-subunits and A-type fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs). Specifically, A-type FHFs induces <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> from Nav1.8, Nav1.9 tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant neuronal channels, and, to a lesser extent, neuronal Nav1.7 and cardiac Nav1.5 channels. Moreover, we identified the N-terminus of FHF as the critical molecule responsible for A-type FHFs-mediated <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>. Among the FHFs, FHF4A is the most important isoform for mediating Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>. In nociceptive sensory neurons, FHF4A knockdown significantly reduces <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> amplitude and the percentage of neurons that generate <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>, substantially suppressing excitability. Thus, our work reveals a novel molecular mechanism underlying TTX-resistant <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation and provides important potential targets for pain treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sodium channel</kwd><kwd>resurgent currents</kwd><kwd>FHF</kwd><kwd>Navβ4</kwd><kwd>dorsal root ganglion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS109896</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Yucheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Cummins</surname><given-names>Theodore R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS053422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cummins</surname><given-names>Theodore R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006977</institution-id><institution>Indiana Spinal Cord &amp; Brain Injury Research Fund from the Indiana State Department of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Yucheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A-type fibroblast growth factor homologous factors generate resurgent currents in tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channels, increase repetitive firing of sensory neurons, and provide a potentially important target for pain treatment strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are crucial determinants of action potentials in almost all excitable tissues. VGSCs are composed of a functional pore-forming α-subunit associated with auxiliary β-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catterall et al., 2005</xref>). VGSCs also interact with other intracellular proteins, such as fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) and calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catterall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wildburger et al., 2015</xref>). Although the α-subunit is sufficient to produce a functional VGSC, interacting partners can influence multiple properties of the α-subunits, regulating neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Namadurai et al., 2015</xref>). One of the most striking influences is generation of resurgent sodium currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> were originally observed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raman and Bean, 1997</xref>) and have been identified in cerebellum, brainstem, trigeminal ganglia, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enomoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> can enhance high-frequency firing in many neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raman and Bean, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xie et al., 2016</xref>), and aberrant <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> have been implicated in multiple human diseases including pain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jarecki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Theile et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanaka et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike classic sodium currents that are activated by step depolarizations, <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> are atypical sodium currents evoked by step repolarizations. Navβ4 has been implicated as a major contributor to <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grieco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannon and Bean, 2010</xref>). The most direct evidence supporting the Navβ4 mechanism is that a short peptide derived from the C-terminal tail of Navβ4 can reconstitute the <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>. However, the Navβ4 mechanism remains controversial for at least two reasons: (1) Navβ4 knockout or knockdown does not abolish <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in central (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ransdell et al., 2017</xref>) or peripheral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>), but rather results in only partial to no reduction of <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>; and (2) importantly, coexpression of full-length Navβ4 with VGSC α-subunits fails to reconstitute <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in heterologous systems. Therefore, other molecular mechanisms for <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation remain to be uncovered.</p><p>FHFs are widely distributed throughout the central nerve system (CNS)/peripheral nerve system (PNS). They represent an important group of auxiliary VGSC subunits that influence neuronal excitability. FHF is a subfamily of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) superfamily. They can bind to the VGSC C-terminal tails and can modulate VGSCs functional properties, trafficking, and axonal localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goetz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wittmack et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2011b</xref>). There are two main types of FHFs: A-type and B-type. The former has four isoforms (FHF1A [or FGF12-1a], FHF2A [or FGF13-1a], FHF3A [or FGF11-1a], FHF4A [or FGF14-1a]). There is emerging evidence that FHFs regulate <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation in neurons. In DRG neurons, overexpression of FHF2A and FHF2B (also known as FGF13-1b) decreases and increases Nav1.6 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, FHF4A, which has high sequence similarity to FHF2A, has been proposed to directly mediate <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation by Nav1.6. FHF4 knockout significantly reduced <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in Purkinje neurons, which is mainly carried by Nav1.6, and a peptide corresponding to FHF4A residues 50–63 induced robust <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in CA3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White et al., 2019</xref>). However, both FHF2A and FHF4A have been shown to induce accumulation of rapid-onset long-term inactivation when coexpressed with Nav1.6 in heterologous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Venkatesan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dover et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the reduction in cerebellar Purkinje neuron <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> with FHF4 knockdown has been proposed to be due to an indirect effect involving FHF4B modulation of channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, there is a lack of compelling evidence supporting a specific molecular mechanism of <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation.</p><p>In this study, we report that A-type FHFs directly mediate resurgent sodium current generation in Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 sensory neuron VGSCs, and show for the first time that <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> can be reconstituted in a heterologous system (ND7/23 and HEK293 cells, respectively) by coexpressing full-length A-type FHFs with VGSC α-subunits. These FHF-mediated <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> are independent of Navβ4. The novel FHF-mediated <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> could be fully reproduced by the amino acids 2–21 from the A-type FHF N-terminus. We also show that while FHF2A could induce small <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> with Nav1.5 and Nav1.7, FHF4A did not induce Nav1.5, Nav1.6, or Nav1.7 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in heterologous expression systems. We further show that reduction of FHF4A-mediated tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> substantially downregulated excitability of nociceptive DRG neurons. Because Nav1.7–Nav1.9 are predominantly expressed in neurons of DRG and trigeminal ganglia, and are crucial for pain perception and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cummins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dib-Hajj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cummins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dib-Hajj et al., 2010</xref>), our work not only uncovers a novel mechanism of <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation in sensory neurons, but also identifies an exciting target for the development of new pain treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A-type FHFs mediate <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in heterologously expressed Nav1.8 and Nav1.9</title><p>A-type FHFs can modulate TTX-sensitive VGSC inactivation and <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2014</xref>); however, it is unknown if A-type FHFs impact the functional properties of the TTX-resistant sodium channels Nav1.8 and Nav1.9. Therefore, we first asked whether FHF2A and FHF4A, which are widely expressed in DRG neurons, modulate sodium currents in cells expressing recombinant Nav1.8 and Nav1.9. As previously shown in ND7/23 and HEK293 heterologous cell expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), Nav1.8 generated a slow-inactivating TTX-resistant current, while Nav1.9 produced an ultra-slow-inactivating TTX-resistant current that activated at hyperpolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and d</xref>). Although ND7/23 are from a rat DRG/mouse N18Tg2 neuroblastoma hybridoma cell line, they do not express endogenous Nav1.8 currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">John et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) and are used here as they typically express recombinant Nav1.8 currents at higher levels than HEK293 cells. Here, we show that FHF2A, FHF2B, and FHF4A, when coexpressed with Nav1.8, shifted the voltage dependence of activation by &gt;7 mV in the negative direction and shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation by &gt;15 mV in the positive direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). FHF2A, FHF2B, and FHF4A also accelerated recovery rate from inactivation of Nav1.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). When coexpressed with Nav1.9, FHF2A and FHF4A, but not FHF2B, positively shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation by ~10 mV. Distinct from Nav1.8, none of the three FHF isoforms altered the voltage dependence of activation or rate for recovery from inactivation of Nav1.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that FHFs differentially regulate TTX-resistant VGSCs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) differentially modulated the gating properties of Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 in heterologous systems.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Family of classical currents recorded from ND7/23 cells expressing recombinant Nav1.8.

FHF2A and FHF4A induced robust <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> from Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–h</xref>). However, under control conditions and with coexpression of FHF2B, the repolarization pulses only elicited classic tail currents, which arise nearly instantaneously and decay rapidly, in Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a (left), b, e (left), and f</xref>). This is the first demonstration of <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation in a heterologous expression system without inclusion of an exogenous peptide in the intracellular solution. The FHF-mediated Nav1.8 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> peaked at –20 to –10 mV and could be observed at repolarization pulses ranging from +5 to –80 mV, while the FHF-mediated Nav1.9 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> displayed a more hyperpolarized voltage dependence, peaking at –85 mV and observed at repolarizing potentials ranging from –55 to –100 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e and g</xref>). Moreover, the Nav1.8 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> induced by FHF4A were fourfold larger than those by FHF2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, relative amplitudes of the peak transient current: FHF2A: 1.5% ± 0.2%; FHF4A: 5.9% ± 0.4%), and the Nav1.9 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> mediated by FHF4A was twofold larger than those induced by FHF2A (FHF2A: 14.8% ± 3.9%; FHF4A: 32.6% ± 3.0%). The kinetics of Nav1.8 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> mediated by A-type FHF are slow, with a slow onset and slow decay. The time to peak and the decay time constant for the FHF4A-mediated <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> elicited at –20 mV were 9.63 ± 0.61 ms and 85.97 ± 5.29 ms, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), similar to the TTX-resistant <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> previously recorded from DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dib-Hajj et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, FHF-mediated Nav1.9 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> exhibit fast onset and decay kinetics. At –70 mV, near the physiological resting membrane potential of DRG neurons, the time to peak and the decay time constant for FHF4A-mediated Nav1.9 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> were 1.92 ± 0.12 ms and 8.09 ± 1.31 ms, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). It is noteworthy that Nav1.9 produced a nondecaying inward current following the <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> (control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>). This nondecaying current activated extremely slowly during 100 ms voltage pulses, occurred in the absence and presence of FHFs, and persisted even when the repolarization pulse was extended to 1000 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Importantly, the current-voltage curve almost completely overlapped that of a predicted ‘window current’ formed by superimposition of steady-state activation and inactivation curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). Since ‘window current’ typically results in persistent current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwell et al., 1979</xref>), we suggest that these nondecaying currents result from a slow recovery from inactivation of Nav1.9 currents.

Our mutagenesis experiments show that an inner pore residue (K799) that is unique to Nav1.9 determines the inability of Navβ4 peptide to induce Nav1.9 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>. The K799 residue is replaced by asparagine at the corresponding position (D2-S6) in Nav1.1–Nav1.8. The homology model of Nav1.9 shows that the side chain of K799 projects into the channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), and thus the positively charged residue may prevent the positively charged Navβ4 peptide from accessing its binding site in the Nav1.9 inner pore by electrostatic repulsion, which is consistent with previous findings that positive residues are crucial for Navβ4 peptide mediating <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis and Raman, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The most salient finding from this study is identification of A-type FHFs as novel <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> mediators of Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 and, to a lesser extent, Nav1.5 and Nav1.7. A-type FHFs consist of a long N-terminus, an FGF-like β-trefoil core, and a short C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldfarb, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Here, we show that the long N-terminus of A-type FHFs, specifically residues 2–21, is the molecular component responsible for inducing TTX-resistant <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>. While the F2A and F4A peptides show limited sequence similarity to the Navβ4 peptide, they all exhibit similar patterns of interactions with VGSCs. The F2A, F4A, and Navβ4 peptides can all accelerate fast inactivation (likely through open-channel block), can be quickly expelled from the channel pore upon repolarization, and have positive and hydrophobic residues that seem to be essential for inducing <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis and Raman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Venkatesan et al., 2014</xref>). These similarities lead us to propose that A-type FHFs induce <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> via the N-terminus by a relief-of-open-channel-block mechanism, similar to the mechanism proposed for the Navβ4 peptide-dependent <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies proposed that FHF4 isoforms may regulate Nav1.6 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation in Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White et al., 2019</xref>). Although initially it was suggested that FHF4B indirectly enhanced <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> by attenuating inactivation of Nav1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2014</xref>), a more recent study indicated that FHF4A directly mediated Nav1.6 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>, showing a short peptide derived from a region of FHF4A adjacent to the β-trefoil core (residues 51–63) was able to induce robust <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in FHF4A knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White et al., 2019</xref>). However, our data do not support the idea that FHF4A alone can mediate Nav1.6 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> because FHF4A failed to mediate Nav1.6 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in our heterologous expression system. Previously we demonstrated that FHF2A decreases Nav1.6 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in DRG neurons. In contrast, FHF2B indirectly enhances <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>). FHF2B lacks the long N-terminus of A-type FHFs but retains the β-trefoil core found in all FHFs that can bind to the cytoplasmic tail of VGSCs and destabilizes Nav1.6 fast inactivation (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9h</xref>). Interestingly, FHF4 knockout accelerates the onset of fast inactivation of sodium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White et al., 2019</xref>) and hyperpolarizes the voltage dependence of sodium current inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 2015</xref>) in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. This makes it possible that FHF4 isoforms regulate Nav1.6 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in neurons, at least in part, by reducing channel fast inactivation, instead of directly mediating <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>.</p><p>While neither full-length Navβ4 nor full-length FHF4A has been shown to induce Nav1.6 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in heterologous expression systems, our data show that FHF4A can induce long-term inactivation of Nav1.6 in ND7/23 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that A-type FHFs induce long-term inactivation of Nav1.6 and Nav1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>). One possible explanation for the induction of long-term inactivation versus the induction of <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation is that A-type FHF N-terminus may bind more strongly to Nav1.6 and some other VGSCs than to Nav1.8 and Nav1.9. During repolarization, the driving force is only powerful enough to repel and unbind A-type FHF N-terminus from Nav1.8 and Nav1.9, but not from Nav1.6, and thus induces robust <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> from Nav1.8 and Nav1.9, but long-term inactivation in Nav1.6. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that post-translational modifications of either Nav1.6 or FHF4A allows FHF4A to directly induce <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in Nav1.6, rather than inducing long-term inactivation, in specific neuronal populations such as cerebellar Purkinje neurons. ND7/23 cells are derived from the fusion of rat DRG neurons with the N18Tg2 mouse neuroblastoma cell lines, and thus may express proteins in addition to the transfected VGSCs and FHF that could be important for the differential effects on resurgent currents and long-term inactivation that we observed with Nav1.8 and Nav1.6.</p><p>Intriguingly, our data show that heterologous expression of A-type FHF is sufficient to induce <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> in not only Nav1.8 and Nav1.9, but also, at least to some extent, in Nav1.5 and Nav1.7. This opens the door to further investigation of the molecular mechanism and the molecular manipulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>. Our data show that F4A peptide at up to 1 mM, a nonphysiological concentration, is required to fully induce the same level of <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> as those induced by full-length FHF4A. This concentration is 5-fold to 10-fold higher than that of Navβ4 peptide (100–200 µM) that is required to reconstitute TTX-sensitive <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>. The unusually high concentration apparently is due to the lack of the FHF β-trefoil core. The β-trefoil core does not directly generate <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub>, but it is likely crucial to facilitating <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> generation induced by N-terminus residues in A-type FHFs, as the core binding to the cytoplasmic tail of VGSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goetz et al., 2009</xref>) would greatly raise the local concentration of the N-terminus near the channel pore. In addition, our data and that of others demonstrate that the β-trefoil domain shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation in the positive direction, augmenting the ‘window currents’ region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and d</xref>), where VGSCs activate but do not fully inactivate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2013</xref> showed that open-channel blockers might have higher affinity in VGSCs with DIVS4 deployed than with DIVS4 in the resting or partially deployed configuration. This also suggests that the molecular manipulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> might be achieved by inhibiting the interaction of A-type FHF β-trefoil core with VGSC C-terminus.</p><p>Overall, our work substantially increases understanding of the role of A-type FHFs in sensory neuron excitability. We show that A-type FHFs exert various impact on neuronal excitability by differentially modulating the activities of VGSC isoforms. The accumulation of long-term inactivation seems to be the predominant effect of A-type FHFs on TTX-sensitive VGSC isoforms, although FHF-mediated <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> (only 0.3% of transient peak current) are inducible with some TTX-sensitive isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c and f</xref>). By promoting long-term inactivation, FHF2A accumulatively decreases TTX-sensitive sodium currents (e.g., Nav1.6, Nav1.7) by &gt;20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Venkatesan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Effraim et al., 2019</xref>). Prior studies demonstrated that A-type FHFs reduced action potential firing in hippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Venkatesan et al., 2014</xref>), and medium-sized DRG neurons, where Nav1.6 channels are predominantly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>). Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 are two TTX-resistant subtypes mainly expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cummins et al., 2007</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we demonstrate that A-type FHF-mediated <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> significantly upregulate excitability of nociceptive DRG neurons. The <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> also result in broader action potentials and higher firing frequency. These observations are similar to those detected in Nav1.8 T790A-transfected DRG neurons, in which the T790A variant identified in the <italic>Possum</italic> transgenic mouse strain leads to increased <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> and enhanced excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to DRG neurons, Nav1.8/Nav1.9 have been colocalized with A-type FHFs within other neuronal populations, such as trigeminal ganglion neurons, myenteric neurons, magnocellular neurosecretory cells of the supraoptic nucleus, the outer layers of the substantia gelatinosa, and cerebellar neurons in animal models of multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vohra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heanue and Pachnis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osorio et al., 2014</xref>). This opens up the possibility that A-type FHF-mediated <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> extensively regulate excitability of the neurons throughout the PNS and CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

DRG recordings were obtained from cells 2–5 days after transfection. Transfected cells were selected for recordings based on their ability to express EGFP. Under control conditions, the endogenous Nav1.8-type currents have an average current density of 947 ± 72 pA/pF (n = 70) and the Nav1.8 shRNA reduces endogenous Nav1.8-type current amplitudes in DRG neurons by 98% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Human Nav1.9, Nav1.9 K799N, Nav1.7, and Nav1.7 N945K channel cDNAs were stably expressed in the HEK-293-β1/β2 cell lines as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2016</xref>) and were provided by Icagen Inc (Durham, NC). They were incubated in 10% DMEM medium supplemented with G418 (400 mg/l) and puromycin (0.5 mg/l). Cell lines were transiently transfected by FHF1A, FHF2A, FHF2B, FHF3A, or FHF4A using the Invitrogen Lipofectamine 2000. Nav1.9 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and incubated at 30°C, 24 hr prior to patch-clamp recording.</p><p>HEK293 cells and ND7/23 cells were grown under standard tissue culture conditions (5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 37°C) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Using the Invitrogen Lipofectamine 2000, human Nav1.5 and the mutant construct (N927K) were transiently co-transfected with FHF2B, FHF2A, or FHF4A into HEK293 cells. The construct human Nav1.8 was transiently transfected into ND7/23 cells. The lipofectamine-DNA mixture was added to the cell culture medium and left for 3 hr after which the cells were washed with fresh medium. Cells with green fluorescent protein fluorescence were selected for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings 36–72 hr after transfection. ND7/23 cells do not express endogenous Nav1.8 currents but TTX-sensitive sodium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">John et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Transfected ND7/23 cells were pretreated with 500 nM TTX to isolate Nav1.8 currents. No authentication of cell lines was performed. Mycoplasma infection was not detected when tested for.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed at room temperature (~21°C) using an EPC-10 amplifier and the Pulse program (HEKA Electronics). Recordings for hNav1.7 and hNav1.7 N945K were conducted at Icagen Inc under similar conditions but with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and PCLAMP software (Molecular Devices).</p><p>For voltage-clamp recordings, fire-polished electrodes (1.0–2.0 MΩ) were fabricated from 1.7 mm capillary glass using a P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments), and the tips were coated with sticky wax (KerrLab) to reduce electrode capacitance and enable increased series resistance compensation. The pipette solution contained (in mM) 140 CsF, 1.1 EGTA, 10 NaCl, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. The bathing solution was (in mM) 130 mM NaCl, 30 mM TEA chloride, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05 mM CdCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM <sc>d</sc>-glucose, pH 7.3 (adjusted with NaOH). TTX (500 nM) was added to the bath solution in order to block endogenous TTX-sensitive currents in DRG neurons, Nav1.9 and K799N stable cells, and cells expressing Nav1.8, Nav1.5, and the mutant N927K. The liquid junction potential for these solutions was &lt;8 mV; data were not corrected to account for this offset. The offset potential was zeroed before contacting the cell. After establishing the whole-cell recording configuration, the resting potential was held at –120 mV or –100 mV for 5 min to allow adequate equilibration between the micropipette solution and the cell interior. Linear leak subtraction, based on resistance estimates from 4 to 5 hyperpolarizing pulses applied before the depolarizing test potential, was used for all voltage-clamp recordings. Membrane currents were usually filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. Voltage errors were minimized using 70–90% series resistance compensation, and the capacitance artifact was canceled using the computer-controlled circuitry of the patch-clamp amplifier.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Steady-state activation</title><p>Families of sodium currents were induced by 50 ms depolarizing steps to various potentials ranging from –120 to +40 mV in 5 mV (or 10 mV) increments. The conductance was calculated using the equation G(Nav) = I/(V - Vrev) in which I, V, and Vrev represent inward current value, membrane potential, and reversal potential, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Steady-state inactivation</title><p>The voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation was estimated using a standard double-pulse protocol in which sodium currents were induced by a 50 ms depolarizing potential of 0 mV following a 500 ms prepulse at potentials that ranged from –130 to +10 mV with a 10 mV increment. Currents were plotted as a fraction of the maximum peak current. To obtain the midpoint voltages (V<sub>1/2</sub>) and slope factor (k), the curves of both steady-state activation and inactivation were fitted to a Boltzmann function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Recovery from inactivation</title><p>Recovery from inactivation was assayed by the protocol that the cells were prepulsed to 0 mV for 50 ms to inactivate sodium channels and then brought back to –100 mV for increasing recovery durations before the test pulse to 0 mV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Resurgent currents</title><p><italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> were elicited by repolarizing voltage steps from +10 mV to −100 for 100 ms (200 ms, or 1000 ms as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> [inset]) in –5 mV increments, following a 20 ms depolarizing potential of +30 mV (or +100 mV). To avoid contamination from tail currents, Navβ4-induced Nav1.5 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> were measured after 3.0 ms into the repolarization pulse, FHF-induced Nav1.5, Nav1.7, and Nav1.9 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> were measured after 4.0 ms into the repolarization pulse, and FHF-induced Nav1.8 <italic>I</italic><sub>NaR</sub> were measured after 20 ms into the repolarization pulse.

The pipette solution contained the following (in mM): 140 KCl, 5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 ATP, 0.3 GTP, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3 (adjusted with KOH). The bathing solution contained the following (in mM): 140 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose, pH 7.3 (adjusted with NaOH). Neurons were allowed to stabilize for 3 min in the current-clamp mode before initiating current injections to measure action potential activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Immunocytochemistry was performed according to the procedure as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, the Helios Gene Gun (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used to transiently transfect the scrambled shRNA, or FHF4shRNA in cultured DRG neurons. Three days after transfection, DRG neurons were fixed with 4% PFA (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for 20 min and washed in PBS. Cells were then permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature (~21°C), washed in PBS, blocked for 2 hr (10% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) at room temperature, and washed with PBS. Cells were then incubated with monoclonal FHF4 antibody (1:200, N56/21, UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility) or polyclonal anti-Navβ4 antibody (1:500, #Ab80539, Abcam) diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. After additional PBS washes, cells were incubated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor Plus 555 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Invitrogen) in blocking solution at 1:1000 concentration for 2 hr at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen) and DRG neurons imaged using Leica Microscope system with a ×20 objective (Biocompare). Images were analyzed with Leica software, and corrected mean cell fluorescence was calculated in Excel (Microsoft) by applying measurements obtained from image analysis using the equations: CMCF = (mean fluorescence intensity of selected cell) – (mean fluorescence of background).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>The acquisition of control and experimental data was randomized.

molecular understanding of resurgent Na current. Reproducing resurgent current by expression of two proteins has never been done: here, the authors have for the first time molecularly reconstituted Na channels that produce resurgent Na current. Not only do these experiments satisfactorily and convincingly address a long-standing question in the field, but they also open the door to molecular manipulation of this current, potentially of significant practical use given the proposed role of the current in several disorders and disease states, including pain. The work will be of interest to many neuroscientists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77558.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Swartz</surname><given-names>Kenton J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bean</surname><given-names>Bruce P</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Goldfarb</surname><given-names>Mitchell</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00g2xk477</institution-id><institution>Hunter College</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.04.482974">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.04.482974v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce P. Bean (Reviewer #1); Mitchell Goldfarb (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Please see the individual reviews as they offer feedback for the authors and suggestions for revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure leg 2 and 3: (c,g) &quot;Voltage dependence of the relative Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 INaR mediated by FHF1A – FHF4A. &quot; It is not immediately obvious what &quot;relative&quot; means here, and it should be specified more exactly. From the Methods, I believe it means relative to peak transient current and this should be stated. The labeling of the y-axes was a little confusing because at first I assumed &quot;Ip&quot; might refer to persistent current. Using &quot;It&quot; for transient current seems more conventional and might be more quickly understandable.</p><p>Line 151. &quot;The relative amplitudes were 1.5% {plus minus} 0.1% and 2.5% {plus minus} 0.4% in Nav1.8 at -15 mV…&quot; It is not stated percent of what…presumably peak transient current.</p><p>Line 261. &quot;Furthermore, because changes at this position did alter A-type FHF mediated INaR …&quot; Should be &quot;did not alter&quot;.</p><p>Line434. &quot;tips were coated with sticky wax (Kerr Lab) to minimize capacitive artifacts and increase series resistance compensation.:. Would be clearer as to &quot;enable increased series resistance compensation&quot;.</p><p>Line 468. The sentence is missing an &quot;INaR&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper is strong in its present form. I do not have criticisms of the data or narrative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors are to be congratulated on a beautiful study.</p><p>1. Intro lines 47 and 48. &quot;classic sodium currents that are activated during the depolarizing phase of action potentials, INaR are atypical sodium currents evoked during the repolarizing phase.&quot; It would be more correct to say &quot;classic sodium currents that are activated by step depolarizations, INaR are atypical sodium currents evoked by step repolarizations.&quot; (Strictly speaking, during spiking, there is no way to say that an open channel is passing a resurgent or a transient current. Transient and resurgent currents are only evoked under voltage clamp, when (most) channels are preconditioned into a common state and then made to change state with a voltage step.

Transient and resurgent currents are only evoked under voltage clamp, when (most) channels are preconditioned into a common state and then made to change state with a voltage step.

The values of the τ<sub>fast</sub> component are 1.51 ± 0.13 ms (scramble) and 1.57 ± 0.14 ms (FHF4shRNA), respectively. The values of the τ<sub>slow</sub> component are 11.93 ± 1.25 ms (scramble) and 13.55 ± 1.10 ms (FHFshRNA), respectively. FHF4 knockdown shows a slight tendency to slow the decay of transient current; however, the change in both τ<sub>fast</sub> and τ<sub>slow</sub> is not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). A-type FHFs have the same binding site at sodium channel C-tails. One possible explanation is that after FHF4A knockdown, other A-type FHF isoforms (e.g.FHF2A) may take its binding site. Their N-terminus, like FHF4A N-terminus, induces open-channel block and speeds the decay of transient current so that FHF4A knockdown does not change the decay significantly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
