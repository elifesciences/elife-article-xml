Despite its significance, the underlying mechanism of the TOR pathway in <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> remains elusive. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the TOR signaling pathway in <italic>A. flavus</italic> by identifying and characterizing nine genes that encode distinct components of this pathway. The FK506-binding protein Fkbp3 and its lysine succinylation are important for aflatoxin production and rapamycin resistance. The TorA kinase plays a pivotal role in the regulation of growth, spore production, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and responses to rapamycin and cell membrane stress. As a significant downstream effector molecule of the TorA kinase, the Sch9 kinase regulates aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) synthesis, osmotic and calcium stress response in <italic>A. flavus,</italic> and this regulation is mediated through its S_TKc, S_TK_X domains, and the ATP-binding site at K340. We also showed that the Sch9 kinase may have a regulatory impact on the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway. TapA and TipA, the other downstream components of the TorA kinase, play a significant role in regulating cell wall stress response in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Moreover, the members of the TapA-phosphatase complexes, SitA and Ppg1, are important for various biological processes in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, including vegetative growth, sclerotia formation, AFB<sub>1</sub> biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. We also demonstrated that SitA and Ppg1 are involved in regulating lipid droplets (LDs) biogenesis and cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathways. In addition, another phosphatase complex, Nem1/Spo7, plays critical roles in hyphal development, conidiation, aflatoxin production, and LDs biogenesis. Collectively, our study has provided important insight into the regulatory network of the TOR signaling pathway and has elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms of aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic></kwd><kwd>TOR signaling pathway</kwd><kwd>aflatoxin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant No. 31972214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Shihua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exploration of the target of rapamycin pathway in <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> reveals critical regulatory elements influencing aflatoxin synthesis and stress tolerance, offering potential targets for antifungal strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> is a highly significant phytopathogenic fungus that frequently contaminates a diverse array of agricultural crops, leading to substantial economic losses in the food and agriculture industry and posing considerable health risks, particularly in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klich, 2007</xref>). Moreover, <italic>A. flavus</italic> is recognized as an opportunistic human pathogenic fungus that can cause aspergillosis in immune-compromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hedayati et al., 2007</xref>). The fungus is notorious for its production of aflatoxins, which are potent secondary metabolites with toxic and carcinogenic properties and are classified among the most powerful carcinogens known in nature, with established links to liver cancer in both humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khan et al., 2021</xref>). Aflatoxin biosynthesis is a multifaceted and intricate biochemical process encompassing a cascade of enzymatic reactions. Although the majority of the enzyme reactions and genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis have been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yabe and Nakajima, 2004</xref>), the related signaling pathway network and specific regulatory mechanisms governing aflatoxin biosynthesis remain elusive. Therefore, exploring the regulatory mechanism of the aflatoxin biosynthesis signaling pathway would provide new insights for preventing <italic>A. flavus</italic> and aflatoxin contamination.</p><p>In eukaryotes, the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway is highly conserved and plays essential roles in various significant biological processes, including ribosome biosynthesis, cell growth, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>). The serine/threonine-protein kinase Tor serves as a crucial protein component in the TOR signaling pathway, which interacts with other proteins to form multiprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Virgilio and Loewith, 2006</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, TOR exists in two distinct multiprotein functional complexes, namely target rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loewith et al., 2002</xref>). TORC1-mediated signaling governs cellular growth by modulating various growth-related mechanisms and exhibits sensitivity to rapamycin. Conversely, TORC2-mediated signaling primarily regulates cytoskeletal remodeling but remains unaffected by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loewith et al., 2002</xref>). In yeast, there are two <italic>tor</italic> genes, <italic>tor1</italic> and <italic>tor2</italic>, whereas in higher eukaryotes such as plants, animals, and filamentous fungi, there is only one <italic>tor</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beauchamp and Platanias, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Teichert et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the fungal kingdom, the TOR signaling pathway has been extensively investigated in three prominent species: the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crespo and Hall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rohde et al., 2008</xref>), the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishiguro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Otsubo and Yamamato, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petersen, 2009</xref>), and the human pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastidas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin forms a complex with the cytosolic protein Fkbp12, which effectively inhibits the catalytic function of the Tor kinase by interacting with its FRB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). The Tap42 phosphatase complex serves as the primary target of the Tor kinase and plays a crucial role in the regulation of downstream effectors. Additionally, the Tap42 protein interacts with the Tip41 protein to collaboratively modulate the activities of phosphatases, including PP2A and Sit4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yan et al., 2006</xref>). Among these, the Sit4 phosphatase is known to dephosphorylate the transcription factor Gln3, thereby regulating the nitrogen source metabolism pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tate et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the AGC kinase Sch9, an immediate effector of TORC1, is involved in regulating various cellular function processes, such as ribosome biosynthesis, translation initiation, and entry into the G<sub>0</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Urban et al., 2007</xref>). The TOR signaling pathway has been documented in various filamentous fungi, including <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>), <italic>Podospora anserine</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dementhon et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitzgibbon et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves de Castro and Dos Reis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldin et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Fusarium fujikuroi</italic>, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meléndez et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">López-Berges et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastidas et al., 2012</xref>). However, the TOR signaling pathway in <italic>A. flavus</italic> remains unexplored.</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, the TOR signaling pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways play an important role in regulating adaptive responses to extra- and intracellular conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Madrid et al., 2016</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that the TOR signaling pathway interacts with various other signaling pathways, such as MAPK and cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway. These pathways are recognized to participate in crosstalk, forming a complex metabolic network that regulates cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Torres et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qian et al., 2021</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms of multiple crosstalks between the TOR and other signaling pathways in <italic>A. flavus</italic> remain largely unknown. Therefore, we intended to identify the genes associated with the TOR signaling pathway and elucidate their roles and contributions in regulating vegetative development and aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Our results demonstrated that the TOR signaling pathway is involved in multiple cellular processes in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Notably, our findings revealed a complex interplay between the TOR pathway and other signaling pathways (such as high osmolarity glycerol [HOG] and CWI) in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, which play a crucial role in regulating cellular growth and survival under environmental stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapamycin exhibits inhibitory effects on the growth, sporulation, sclerotia formation, and aflatoxin production in <italic>A. flavus</italic></title><p>Rapamycin, a secondary metabolite synthesized by <italic>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</italic>, exhibits efficacy in suppressing specific filamentous fungi. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, rapamycin has a significant inhibitory impact on growth and asexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate the effects of rapamycin on vegetative development, sclerotia formation, and secondary metabolism in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we conducted an assay to determine the sensitivity of the wild-type (WT) strain to rapamycin. We observed that the WT strain exhibited a high sensitivity to rapamycin. We found that 100 ng/mL of rapamycin significantly inhibited mycelial growth and conidia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, D, and E</xref>). More importantly, the WT strain exhibited a significant reduction in sclerotia formation and aflatoxin synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C, F, and G</xref>). Additionally, rapamycin resulted in a significant decrease in spore germination rate and sparser conidiophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

This suggested that the TOR signaling pathway may have a conserved function in filamentous fungi. The number of FK506-binding proteins varies among different species: there are four Fkbps proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and three Fkbps proteins in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galat, 2013</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, rapamycin can bind to Fkbp protein, resulting in the irreversible inhibition of the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle and the regulation of cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasahara, 2021</xref>). In <italic>A. nidulans,</italic> the <italic>fkbp12</italic> gene homolog <italic>fprA</italic> displays considerable sequence similarity with homologs identified in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitzgibbon et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, based on the homologous alignment of the protein sequence of FprA, it was observed that four <italic>fkbp</italic> genes are present in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Among these, deletion of <italic>fkbp3</italic> exhibited enhanced tolerance to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). So we speculated that rapamycin forms a complex with Fkbp3 in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, subsequently targeting downstream target genes to exert its biological function. We found that Fkbp3 is involved in sclerotia formation and aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and subsequent analysis revealed that the underlying mechanism may be associated with succinylation modification. The succinylation sites of Fkbp3 were identified through the utilization of succinylation proteomics data. By constructing point mutant strains and conducting phenotype experiments, we found that the succinylation of Fkbp3 at residue K19 is involved in rapamycin resistance and aflatoxin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>). Our results provided new insights to the understanding of post-translational modifications in the regulation of TOR pathway components. Previous studies have demonstrated that Fkbp12 has been identified as the receptor for FK506 and rapamycin, which inhibits calcineurin and TORC1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasahara, 2021</xref>). The deletion of Fkbp12 confers the resistance to rapamycin in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruz et al., 2001</xref>) and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruz et al., 2001</xref>). The entomopathogenic fungus <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> contains three putative <italic>fkbp</italic> genes, and disruption of <italic>Bbfkbp12</italic> significantly increases the resistance to rapamycin and FK506 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The plant pathogenic fungus <italic>F. graminearum</italic> harbors three Fkbps proteins, among which deletion of <italic>Fgfkbp12</italic> leads to resistance to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we proposed that these Fkbps may exhibit analogous functionalities in conferring resistance to rapamycin. In <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, deletion of <italic>Bcfkbp12</italic> caused a reduction of the virulence of strain T4, while knockout of the <italic>fkbp12</italic> gene did not affect the pathogenic development of strain B05.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meléndez et al., 2009</xref>). These findings demonstrated that the <italic>fkbp12</italic> homologous genes exhibited conservation in terms of rapamycin resistance. However, there is significant variation in other biological functions among fungal species, which may be attributed to species or strain evolutionary divergence. Our study indicated the pivotal role of Fkbp3 in modulating the effects of rapamycin on <italic>A. flavus</italic>, Fkbp3 is also crucial for aflatoxin biosynthesis. Targeted inhibition of Fkbp3 could potentially suppress aflatoxin production, given its significance, Fkbp3 can be developed as a fungicide target to reduce aflatoxin biosynthesis, thereby reducing the risk of aflatoxin contamination in agricultural products.</p><p>The Tor kinase functions as a fundamental component of the TOR signaling pathway, which exhibits evolutionary conservation across fungi, plants, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiong and Sheen, 2014</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Tor kinase can interact with a diverse range of proteins, resulting in the formation of complex structures known as TORC1 and TORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weisman, 2016</xref>). TORC1 can detect various signals, including nutrients, growth factors, and environmental stress. It plays a crucial role in regulating cellular processes such as gene transcription, protein translation, ribosome synthesis, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>). A characteristic that distinguishes TORC1 is its interaction with KOG1 (raptor in mammals) and its sensitivity to the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adami et al., 2007</xref>). The Tor kinase is widely conserved both in terms of its structural characteristics and its role as the target of Fkbp-rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tatebe and Shiozaki, 2017</xref>). Typically, the Tor kinase exhibits similar structural characteristics, including the HEAT-like, FAT, FRB, kinase, and FATC domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tatebe and Shiozaki, 2017</xref>). The FRB domain is the binding region of the Fkbp-rapamycin complex, and rapamycin resistance is usually caused by the disruption of the FRB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>). Homology analysis and phylogenetic studies have identified a single predicted <italic>torA</italic> gene within the <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome. To elucidate the functional role of <italic>torA</italic> in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, our initial approach involved an attempt to generate an <italic>torA</italic> deletion strain through homologous recombination. However, these efforts were unsuccessful. We speculated that the deletion of the <italic>torA</italic> gene may be lethal in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. This observation aligns with the situation observed in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, to investigate the function of <italic>torA</italic> in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we constructed a mutant strain (<italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic>) using an xylose-inducible promoter, which allows for conditional induction with the addition of xylose. We observed that the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> mutant is completely unable to grow in YGT medium without xylose, whereas partial growth is restored in YXT medium with the addition of xylose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results indicated that TorA is essential for the growth of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. We also discovered that the TorA kinase is involved in the vegetative growth, asexual development, sclerotial, and aflatoxin production of <italic>A. flavus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, the the <italic><sup>xylP</sup>torA</italic> mutant shows a high sensitivity to rapamycin and SDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our findings have demonstrated that the TorA kinase plays a crucial role in the processes of morphogenesis, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and multiple stress responses in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Previous findings demonstrated that the Tor kinase could function as a molecular switch connecting an iron cue to defend against pathogen infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, the Tor kinase represents a central regulatory node controlling genes and proteins involved in nutrient sensing, stress response, cell cycle progression, protein biosynthesis, and degradation, as well as adaptation to low iron conditions. In summary, the Tor kinase acts as a central regulator in the TOR signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle, protein synthesis, and cellular energy metabolism. Its influence on key cellular processes makes it a promising target for future research to control fungal growth and aflatoxin production.</p><p>The serine/threonine protein kinase Sch9, a critical downstream effector of TORC1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, has been extensively studied for its roles in stress resistance, longevity, and nutrient sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pascual-Ahuir and Proft, 2007</xref>). In addition, the TORC1-Sch9 pathway is also recognized as crucial mediator of chronological lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pascual-Ahuir and Proft, 2007</xref>). In filamentous fungi, an intricate network of interactions exists between the TOR and HOG pathways. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2015</xref>), FgSch9 and FgHog1 mutants displayed increased susceptibility to osmotic and oxidative stresses. The phosphorylation level of FgHog1 increased significantly in FgSch9 mutant. Additionally, the affinity capture-MS assay showed that the Tor kinase was among the proteins co-purifying with FgSch9. These results suggested that FgSch9 serves as an intermediary for the TOR and HOG signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, FgSch9 plays a crucial role in the regulation of various biological processes such as hyphal differentiation, asexual development, virulence, and DON biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, the SchA mutant was sensitive to rapamycin, high concentrations of calcium and hyperosmotic stress, and SchA was involved in iron metabolism. The SchA mutant exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of SakA in response to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves de Castro and Dos Reis, 2016</xref>). In this study, we discovered that Sch9 is involved in regulating aflatoxin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and responses to osmotic and rapamycin stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). The S_TKc domain deletion strain (<italic>sch9</italic><sup>ΔS_TKc</sup>), S_TK_X domain deletion strain (<italic>sch9</italic><sup>ΔS_TK_X</sup>), and <italic>sch9</italic><sup>K340A</sup> mutant displayed a similar phenotype to the ∆<italic>sch9</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). These findings revealed that Sch9 plays a significant role in the biological synthesis of aflatoxin and in responding to various stresses. This role is primarily mediated through its kinase domain, kinase C domain, and ATP binding site K340. We also found that the phosphorylation level of Hog1 increased significantly in the ∆<italic>sch9</italic> strain under osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Based on the above results, we hypothesized that Sch9 was involved in the osmotic stress response by modulating the HOG pathway in <italic>A. flavus</italic>.</p><p>The phosphorylation state of Tap42 is crucial for its interaction with PP2A subunits and is regulated by a balance between Tor-mediated phosphorylation and Cdc55/Tpd3-mediated dephosphorylation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang and Broach, 1999</xref>). The genome of <italic>A. flavus</italic> contains a homolog of <italic>tap42</italic> named <italic>tapA</italic> (AFLA_092770), which is predicted to encode a 355 amino acid protein (sharing 31.9% identity with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Tap42). To further determine the function of the TapA regulator in the TOR signaling pathway of <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we conducted targeted gene deletion experiments on <italic>tapA</italic>. We failed to obtain a null mutant, we hypothesized that <italic>tapA</italic> knockout was lethal in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. To investigate the function of TapA, we employed homologous recombination, to replace the native promoter with the strong <italic>gpdA</italic> promoter, thereby constructing an overexpression strain (<italic>OE::tapA</italic>) with the enhanced promoter. Compared with WT strain, the <italic>OE::tapA</italic> strain were more sensitive to rapamycin and SDS stress, indicating that <italic>tapA</italic> gene plays an important role in regulating cell wall stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and F</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the protein Tip41, which interacts with Tap42, plays a significant role in the cellular responses to nitrogen sources by regulating type 2A phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fenyvuesvolgyi et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Tap42-phosphatase complexes associate with TORC1, whereas Tip41 functions to attenuate TORC1 signaling by stimulating the PP2A phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacinto et al., 2001</xref>). Unlike its yeast counterpart Tip41, TIPRL, a mammalian Tip41-like protein, exerts a positive influence on mTORC1 signaling by interacting with PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>). While some functions of Tap42 and its binding partners Tip41 may be conserved, the interaction between Tip41 and Tap42 was not observed in the filamentous fungi. The yeast two-hybrid assay showed that FgTip41 interacts with the phosphatase FgPpg1 rather than FgTap42, while the FgTap42 bind with phosphatase FgPp2A, implying that FgTap42, FgPpg1, and FgTip41 form a heterotrimer in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). In the rice blast fungus <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, MoTip41 does not interact with MoTap42. However, MoTip41 can bind with the phosphatase MoPpe1, thereby facilitating crosstalk between the TOR pathway and the CWI pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qian et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>A. flavus,</italic> the <italic>OE::tapA</italic> and ∆<italic>tipA</italic> strains showed increased sensitivity to cell wall stress compared with the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6H</xref>). Based on the conserved roles of Tap42 and Tip41 in yeast and other filamentous fungi, we hypothesized that TapA and TipA in <italic>A. flavus</italic> also participate in CWI pathway. In summary, our study provided important insights into the role of TapA and TipA in the TOR signaling pathway of <italic>A. flavus</italic>, particularly in relation to cell wall stress. However, their interaction and implications for TOR and CWI signaling in <italic>A. flavus</italic> remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Tap42 can bind and regulate various PP2A phosphatases, including Pph3, Pph21, Pph22, Sit4, and Ppg1. This interaction plays a crucial role in the TOR signaling pathway, particularly in response to rapamycin treatment or nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacinto et al., 2001</xref>). These phosphatases play important roles in other fungi and are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including growth, morphogenesis, and virulence. For example, the phosphatase Sit4 plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, morphogenesis, and virulence in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, FgSit4 and FgPpg1 are associated with various cellular processes, including mycelial growth, conidiation, DON biosynthesis, and virulence in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). These findings indicated the conserved role of PP2A phosphatases in fungal biology. In addition to their roles in growth and development, FgSit4 and FgPpg1 are involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, such as the CWI pathway and LDs biogenesis regulation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we found that the phosphatases SitA and Ppg1 play critical role in vegetative growth, conidiation, sclerotia formation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Additionally, the phosphatases SitA and Ppg1 also affect pathogenicity and LD biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10C and D</xref>). This highlights the multifaceted influence of PP2A phosphatases on cellular signaling.</p><p>After the deletion of the <italic>sitA</italic> and <italic>ppg1</italic> genes, the expression level of genes related to cell wall synthesis has decreased significantly, resulting in damage to the cell wall and showing a higher sensitivity to CWI stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Western blotting results showed that the phosphorylation level of MAPK kinase Slt2 has increased significantly in the ∆<italic>sitA</italic> and ∆<italic>ppg1</italic> strains under cell wall stress, indicating that SitA and Ppg1 exert a negative regulatory effect on the CWI pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). In <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, MoPpe1 and MoSap1 serve as an adaptor complex that connects the CWI and TOR signaling pathways. The activation of the TOR pathway leads to the inhibition of the CWI pathway, highlighting a critical regulatory interplay between these two pathways in fungal biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qian et al., 2018</xref>). We speculated that SitA and Ppg1 might exhibit similar regulation within the CWI and TOR pathways across different fungal species. In addition, the phosphatase MoPpe1 interacts with the phosphatase-associated protein MoTip41, facilitating the exchange of information between the TOR and CWI signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qian et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggested that the phosphatase Ppe1 engages in interactions with various proteins to effectively coordinate the TOR and CWI signaling pathways, thereby regulating the growth and pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qian et al., 2018</xref>). Given the conserved functions of PP2A phosphatases and the observed roles of SitA, Ppg1, TapA, and TipA in cell wall stress response, we hypothesized that TapA-phosphatase complexes may collaborate to regulate CWI processes in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. This hypothesis is supported by the similar functions exhibited by these proteins.</p><p>In <italic>F. graminearum,</italic> the phosphatase complex FgNem1/Spo7-FgPah1 cascade plays significant roles in fungal development, DON production, and LD biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Our study explored the conservation and functional significance of Nem1 and Spo7 homologs in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, revealing their pivotal roles in vegetative growth and secondary metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>). Our results indicated that LD biogenesis is facilitated by the Nem1/Spo7 and SitA/Ppg1 pathways in <italic>A. flavus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11E</xref>). These observations suggested a conserved and central role for PP2A phosphatases as core regulators within the LD biogenesis signaling network, highlighting their importance in cellular lipid metabolism and energy storage. While our findings underscored the significance of phosphatases in LD biogenesis, it is also plausible that other kinases contribute to the regulation of this process. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the precise molecular mechanism, it is essential to investigate the interplay between phosphatases and other kinases.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified the complex regulatory network that provides important insight into the interplay between the TOR, HOG, and CWI signaling pathways, and how they collectively regulate the development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. By elucidating the functions of genes associated with the TOR signaling pathway, our research could establish a solid foundation for comprehending the molecular mechanism underlying the aflatoxin biosynthesis of <italic>A. flavus</italic>.

Thank you again for your insightful feedback, which has been instrumental in improving the quality of our work. (Lines 464-469, page 22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Point 1: Our findings revealed that both the tor and tapA genes are present in double copies in our strains, which guided our decision to construct single-copy deletion strains using homologous recombination However, the tor gene in A. flavus exhibited varying copy numbers, as was confirmed by absolute quantification PCR at the genome level (Table S1). However, it is hard to understand for Table S1: Estimation of copy number of tor gene in A. flavus toro and sumoo stand for the initial copy number, and the data are graphed as the mean {plus minus} 95%confidence limit. CN is copy number. As indicated in the Methods, Using sumo gene as reference, the tor and tapA gene copy number was calculated by standard curve. In Table S1 of WT, for tor gene, CN value is1412537 compared to 1698243 in tor+/-, for the reference gene sumo,794328 compared to1584893, how these data could support copy gene numbers of tor?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comments. We understand the confusion with the data presented in Table S1 regarding the copy number estimation of the <italic>torA</italic> gene in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. We apologize for not providing a clear explanation for the data in the table. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is widely used to determine the copy number of a specific gene. It involves amplifying the gene of interest and a reference gene simultaneously using specific primers and probes. By comparing the amplification curves of the gene of interest and the reference gene, we can estimate the relative copy number of the gene.</p><p>To address your concern and provide more accurate information, we have re-performed the copy number analysis using southern blot. Southern blot analysis allows for the direct estimation of gene copy number by hybridizing genomic DNA with a specific probe for the gene. This method provides more reliable and accurate results in determining gene copy numbers. We discovered that the <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome contains a single copy of the <italic>torA</italic> gene. Consequently, we conducted additional experiments to elucidate its function. Specifically, we generated strains with a xylose-inducible promoter system to modulate the expression of <italic>torA</italic> (Lines 204-238, page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2: In response: For the knockout of the FRB domain, we used the homologous recombination method, but because tor genes are double-copy genes, there are also double copies in the FRB domain. Despite our efforts, we encountered challenges in precisely determining the location of the other copy of the tor gene. I could not understand these consistent data, why not for using sequencing?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We determined again and confirmed that the <italic>torA</italic> gene is a single copy. So we removed this part of the results to avoid any ambiguity or potential misinterpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3: Response in Due to the large number of genes involved, we did not perform a complementation experiment. If there were no complementation data, how to demonstrate data are solid?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your important suggestion. We understand that complementation experiments are commonly used to validate gene deletions. Therefore, to ensure the reliability of our data, we have conducted supplementary experiments on specific gene deletions, such as Δ<italic>sitA</italic>-C and Δ<italic>ppg1</italic>-C. Thank you again for your positive comments and valuable suggestions, which have significantly contributed to enhancing the quality of our manuscript (Lines 320-322, page 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 4: Acknowledge the confusion? We acknowledge the confusion in our presentation and will ensure that accurate genetic nomenclature is used consistently</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments on our manuscript. We recognize the importance of precise and consistent use of genetic nomenclature, as it is critical for the clarity and integrity of our research findings. We have carefully reviewed the sections of our manuscript where genetic terms were used and have made the necessary corrections to ensure that all nomenclature is accurate and used consistently throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 5: In the revised version of new manuscript, southern blotting was carried out and found only one copy was existed for tested genes at last. Thus, whole manuscript conclusions should be changed. In addition, Reviewer 1 suggestion for using Illumina-sequence strategy, their tor and tapA mutants could be verified whether they are aneuploid?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to express our gratitude for your insightful comments and suggestions. Following the new experimental data obtained from Southern blotting, we have identified that only one copy of the tested genes exists, and we have revised our conclusions throughout the manuscript. This has led to a significant reinterpretation of our results and a reassessment of the implications for our study. Based on this result, we designed and constructed strains with the tor gene under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter. This approach allows for the conditional expression of the tor gene. Thank you once again for your meticulous review (Lines 204-238, page 10).</p></body></sub-article></article>
