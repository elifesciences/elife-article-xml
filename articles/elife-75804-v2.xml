Dynamic changes in <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation are critical for neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Globa and Bamji, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matt et al., 2019</xref>), oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>), and astrocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, numerous neurological and psychiatric diseases have now been attributed to mutations in the genes encoding palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes, including schizophrenia, intellectual disability and CLN1 disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mukai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raymond et al., 2007</xref>), underscoring the importance of proper regulation of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation for normal brain function.</p><p><italic>S</italic>-Palmitoylation is catalyzed by a family of ZDHHC enzymes that share a consensus ‘Asp-His-His-Cys’ catalytic domain. These enzymes are structurally heterogeneous multi-pass transmembrane proteins that localize to a variety of subcellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), recycling endosomes and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Globa and Bamji, 2017</xref>). The ZDHHC enzymes are known to associate with accessory proteins that regulate their stability, activity, and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salaun et al., 2020</xref>). Several de-palmitoylating enzymes have also been identified that are divided into three classes: the acyl-protein thioesterases that shuttle between the Golgi and cytosol (APTs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vartak et al., 2014</xref>), the predominantly lysosomal palmitoyl-protein thioesterases (PPTs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koster and Yoshii, 2019</xref>) and the more recently discovered α/β hydrolase domain-containing proteins (ABHDs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin and Conibear, 2015</xref>). Unlike other post-translational modifications, palmitoylation lacks a consensus substrate amino sequence. To date, there is no unifying theory to explain how substrate recognition is achieved, with contrasting reports of substrate interactions being both promiscuous and specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malgapo and Linder, 2021</xref>). Currently, these interactions are thought to be governed by the subcellular targeting of ZDHHCs enzymes and the presence of protein-protein interacting motifs within the ZDHHC N- and C-termini, which are highly diverse among the ZDHHC enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rana et al., 2019</xref>). Differential gene expression can also have a profound influence on protein interactions and may play a role in the coordination of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in the brain. However, a detailed overview and analysis of the precise cellular and regional expression patterns of the palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes has not yet been described, and as such, little is known about how this expression is coordinated in the nervous system.</p><p>Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) techniques have enabled the classification of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in unprecedented detail, providing a better understanding of cellular diversity and function in the nervous system, while also providing a means to study the expression patterns of individual genes across an ever-expanding range of brain regions and cellular classifications. Here, we capitalized on the recent surge in RNAseq publications characterizing regional and cellular transcriptomics of the mouse nervous system. We curated and analyzed expression data from a number of publicly available RNAseq mouse datasets to generate a detailed analysis of the expression patterns of the genes associated with <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in the mouse brain. Furthermore, we present an interactive web tool that allows user-driven interrogation of the expression patterns of palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes from numerous collated studies across a variety of brain regions and cell types (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brainpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/">http://brainpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/</ext-link>). We demonstrate the utility of this resource by detailing the considerable cell-type and regional heterogeneity in expression patterns of these enzyme families and their accessory proteins, revealing numerous cell-type enrichments and co-expression patterns that allowed us to generate and test hypotheses about palmitoylating enzyme-substrate interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BrainPalmSeq: an interactive database to search palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzyme expression in the mouse brain</title><p>The recent development of scRNAseq has revolutionized our understanding of the complex transcriptional diversity of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in the brain. We found however, there were several barriers to the easy access for much of this data, with no single resource available to evaluate multi-study expression datasets. Data can also be difficult to access when studies are not accompanied by an interactive online web viewer, while datasets that do have a web viewer employ diverse interfaces that are often complex, particularly for large scRNAseq datasets. Furthermore, the differing study-specific analysis pipelines, as well as the variety of data presentation formats in web viewers including heatmaps, bar charts, tables or t-SNE plots can make datasets difficult for non-bioinformaticians to interpret and compare. In order to remove these barriers and provide easy access to expression data for the proteins that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in the brain, we created ‘BrainPalmSeq’, an easy-to-use web platform allowing user-driven interrogation of compiled multi-study expression data at cellular resolution through simple interactive heatmaps that are populated according to user-selected brain regions, cell-types or genes of interest (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brainpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/">http://brainpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/</ext-link>).</p><p>To create BrainPalmSeq, we first curated three large datasets from whole-brain scRNAseq studies that were acquired through selection-free cell sampling to provide high-resolution expression data covering hundreds of cell types at a variety of developmental ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). As scRNAseq has several caveats including low sensitivity and high frequency of dropout events leading to incomplete detection of expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haque et al., 2017</xref>), we complemented these datasets, where possible, with curation of several bulk and pooled-cell RNAseq studies that used population-level ensemble measurements from whole-brain and region-specific studies. We further included selected studies for the major glial cell types, and data from the most comprehensive neuron-specific study performed to date by the Allen Institute (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Together, the datasets curated in BrainPalmSeq cover all major regions of the mouse nervous system across a variety of regional and cellular resolutions.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>RNAseq published datasets curated to create BrainPalmSeq.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">First Author</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Year</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">PMID</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Regions</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Age</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Website</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Technique</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Sample</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Data Accession</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Zeisel</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2018</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">30096314</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CNS/PNS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Juvenile</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mousebrain.org/">http://mousebrain.org/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 X Genomics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Single-cell</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SRP135960</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Saunders</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2018</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">30096299</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Whole brain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adult (P60-70)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dropviz.org/">http://dropviz.org/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Drop-seq</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Single-cell</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GSE116470</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sjöstedt</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2020</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">32139519</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Whole brain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adult</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/">https://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNA-seq</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bulk tissue</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rosenberg</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2018</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">29545511</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Whole brain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Neonatal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">n/a</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPLiT-seq</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Single-cell</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GSE110823</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cembrowski</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2016</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">27113915</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hippocampus</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adult</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hipposeq.janelia.org/">http://hipposeq.janelia.org/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic labeling;

We sampled from RNAseq datasets that used a diverse range of sample collection, processing and analysis techniques, allowing for direct visualization of the relative expression patterns of selected genes within datasets. Users can then validate their observations across complimentary whole-brain or region/cell-type-specific datasets included in BrainPalmSeq. Dropdown menus allow for selection of individual ZDHHC genes or brain regions within each dataset, while the hover tool reveals metadata for each cell type, including neurotransmitter designations and marker genes. We provide download links to all expression data including cell type metadata so that users can replot gene expression profiles in their preferred format. To demonstrate the utility of this resource, we performed a detailed exploration of selected datasets from BrainPalmSeq, revealing how expression patterns can give insights into the function of the palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes in the mouse brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ZDHHC expression in the nervous system shows regional and cell-type-specific patterning</title><p>We began by exploring BrainPalmSeq data curated from the ‘MouseBrain’ dataset, which provides the broadest overview of expression patterns in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). This scRNAseq study sampled multiple dissected regions from the adolescent (mean age ~P25) mouse central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS, respectively), identifying 265 transcriptomically unique cell-types (referred to herein as metacells) for which we plotted re-normalized ZDHHC expression values, according to the hierarchical cell-type clustering established by the original study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While ZDHHC expression was detected in all regions of the nervous system, expression of the 24 ZDHHC genes was highly variable across metacell types and clusters. We measured the mean ZDHHC expression within each cluster to gain insight into which cell-types in the nervous system have the greatest overall expression of palmitoylating enzymes. The heatmap rows and columns were ranked (sorted by descending averages) to determine which cell-types had the highest expression of ZDHHCs, and which ZDHHCs were most abundantly expressed across cell-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mean ZDHHC expression was particularly high in neurons of the PNS, along with cholinergic/monoaminergic and hindbrain neurons of the CNS. Of the non-neuronal metacell clusters, oligodendrocytes had the highest ZDHHC expression, while other glial cell-types appear at the lower end of the ranking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>Zdhhc20</italic> was the most abundantly expressed ZDHHC, with the highest mean expression across all cell-type clusters, followed by <italic>Zdhhc2</italic>, <italic>Zdhhc17</italic>, <italic>Zdhhc3</italic> and <italic>Zdhhc21</italic>, while expression of <italic>Zdhhc11</italic>, <italic>Zdhhc19</italic> and <italic>Zdhhc25</italic> were negligible. We next clustered neuronal metacells of the PNS and CNS according to the neurotransmitter expression combinations, revealing the highest mean ZDHHC expression was observed in neurons that utilized acetylcholine and nitric oxide as co-neurotransmitters, with cholinergic neurons featuring near the top of the list in several neurotransmitter combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Monoaminergic neurons utilizing noradrenaline and serotonin also generally ranked high in the list, consistent with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> that ranked cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons as the metacell cluster with the second highest CNS ZDHHC expression overall, indicating a higher propensity for these cell-types to utilize <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation as a post-translational mechanism to modify cellular signaling. We performed comparative analysis of ZDHHC expression on another large-scale scRNAseq study of the mouse brain that sampled a variety of cortical and subcortical structures of the adult mouse (P60-P70) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; ‘DropViz’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Focusing on proteins from our list of genes that were detected in all four cell types in the proteomic dataset, we calculated cell type z-scores for mRNA or protein abundance in each study and compared enrichment patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). While we found numerous instances of similar patterns of cell-type enrichment for both mRNA and protein, including proteins that were primarily enriched in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>), microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>), neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>) and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>), we also observed instances where this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3F</xref>). Notably, several highly expressed genes from the RNAseq study were not detected at the protein level in any cell type, including ZDHHC2, ZDHHC9 and SELENOK, which may be due to poor depth of coverage in the proteomic screen, or may indicate that these genes may be subject to more extensive post-transcriptional regulation. Overall, we found a significant correlation (<italic>r</italic>=0.63, p&lt;0.0001) when plotting mRNA vs protein z-score across all cell types for the identified genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the cell-type mRNA enrichment for many of the family of proteins that mediate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation is maintained at the protein level. Future advances in single-cell proteomics, along with tandem studies of both RNA and protein in the brain, will enable more precise comparison between the cell-type transcriptome and proteome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Loss-of-function mutations in palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes</title><p>Impaired regulation of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation has been implicated in numerous neurological disorders, many of which are due to loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the genes encoding palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho and Park, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matt et al., 2019</xref>).

This is in line with the extensive neuronal transcriptional heterogeneity identified recently by a number of scRNAseq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). The genes that determine neuronal identity fall under four broad functional categories: those that control transcriptional programs, membrane conductance, neurotransmission, or synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). We also report heterogeneity in the neuronal fingerprint of palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzyme expression, which will in turn give rise to differential <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation of neuronal proteins. Future work is needed to determine how these specific ZDHHC expression patterns are related to dynamic <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in these neuronal sub-types, and how the elevated expression of certain ZDHHCs can alter neuronal function. Given that <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation is a key regulator of neuronal development, and that nearly half of all known synaptic proteins are substrates for palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanders et al., 2015</xref>), this heterogeneity is likely to be a key mechanism in the fine tuning of neuronal function and synaptic transmission.</p><p>Many of the ZDHHCs that we observed with consistently elevated expression across multiple studies in BrainPalmSeq have already been studied in the context of neuronal signaling, including ZDHHC2, ZDHHC3, ZDHHC8, and ZDHHC17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ji and Skup, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matt et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, ZDHHC20 and ZDHHC21 are relatively understudied in the nervous system, despite our observation that these are two of the most abundantly expressed ZDHHCs across neuronal cell types, with broad expression of <italic>Zdhhc20</italic> also in glial cells. A recent study defined a role for ZDHHC21 in the palmitoylation of serotonergic receptor 5-HT1A and implicated downregulation of ZDHHC21 in the development of major depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorinski et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, both ZDHHC20 and ZDHHC21 have a potential role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, as they can palmitoylate BACE1, Tau and amyloid precursor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho and Park, 2016</xref>). Further work is required to understand the likely important role of these enzymes in the brain.</p><p>We made several other interesting observations during our examination of BrainPalmSeq that were not discussed in detail in the present study but we believe warrant further investigation. For example, the particularly elevated expression of <italic>Zdhhc2</italic> in peripheral sensory neurons may indicate an important role for palmitoylation in this cell type. Across multiple studies we observed striking enrichment of <italic>Zdhhc14</italic> in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, a cell type in which <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation is known to be important for long-term depression, although the role of ZDHHC14 in this process has not yet been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomas et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Zdhhc23</italic> was similarly enriched in the CA2 region of the hippocampus, with comparatively low expression across other cell types. More broadly, the elevated expression of a variety of palmitoylating enzymes in central neurons that utilize acetylcholine or monoamines as neurotransmitters would suggest an important role for <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in these neurons that has yet to be explored. Accordingly, many of the key proteins involved in cholinergic synaptic transmission are <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation substrates including muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (CHRM2), acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), and ATP-citrate synthase (ACLY; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanc et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanc et al., 2019</xref>). Our observations of co-enrichment of certain palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes are also of interest, such as <italic>Abhd17b</italic> and <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> in oligodendrocytes. It is possible that these enzymes share substrates to mediate dynamic palmitoylation/de-palmitoylation, or conversely, have separate substrates in order to maintain stable <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation states of certain oligodendrocyte expressed proteins. Importantly, the data accessibility in BrainPalmSeq will enable researchers to develop hypotheses regarding their cell type, brain region or protein of interest.</p><p>The palmitoylome of each cell type in the nervous system is likely to be highly heterogeneous and will be determined by the expression of both the <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation substrates and the palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes in a given cell type.

While we have provided projected palmitoylomes composed of several highly expressed or enriched <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation substrates in select brain regions and cell types, experimental validation to reveal the relative palmitoylation of substrates under various conditions is needed to fully understand these cellular differences. Nevertheless, we were able utilize our projected palmitoylomes to validate substrates for ZDHHC9, providing insight into the potential role of this enzyme in myelin regulation in the brain.</p><p>Neurological disorders that arise from LOF gene mutations may be predicted to lead to pathological changes that are more severe in the brain regions in which these genes are most highly expressed. We observed this type of regional overlay for the expression patterns of <italic>Zdhhc8</italic>, <italic>Zdhhc9,</italic> and <italic>Ppt1</italic>. Numerous other brain disorders are thought to be exacerbated by an imbalance in <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation, such as decreased <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation of HTT in Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Virlogeux et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yanai et al., 2006</xref>), increased <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation of APP and TAU in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho and Park, 2016</xref>), and reduced <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation of 5-HTA receptor in major depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorinski et al., 2019</xref>). Efforts are already underway to normalize aberrant <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in neurological diseases in order to improve clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Virlogeux et al., 2021</xref>). Understanding the brain expression patterns of the enzymes that mediate palmitoylation in these diseases will be paramount to developing and targeting such therapeutics.</p><p>While scRNAseq has proven to be a groundbreaking tool that has helped identify many unique cell types in the brain while allowing a means to study cellular gene expression patterns at remarkable depth, characterization of the proteome of individual brain cells has lagged behind transcriptome profiling. This is largely due to the inability to amplify protein in the same way as RNA, greatly reducing the depth of coverage observed compared with transcriptomic analyses. Instead, proteomic studies generally utilize pooled cell isolation methods to improve detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goto-Silva and Junqueira, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilson and Nairn, 2018</xref>). Proteomic analysis is particularly important as previous studies have found that RNA and protein abundance are often moderately correlated, as a result of post-translational processing of protein or RNA molecules. Our comparison of mRNA and protein abundance in the major brain cell types during postnatal development revealed numerous instances of similar cell-type enrichments for the majority of the proteins detected. This would imply that while the absolute amount of mRNA and protein may differ in a given cell type, the mRNA cell-type enrichments are predictive of protein enrichment for many of the genes included in our study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Differential gene expression as a means to control <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in the brain</title><p>The mechanisms that govern ZDHHC enzyme-substrate interactions are complex and still not fully understood. While the majority of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and N-glycosylation are highly sequence specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwarz and Aebi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007</xref>), several studies have revealed that <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation by ZDHHCs can be stochastic, proximity based and lacking in stereo-selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rocks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodenburg et al., 2017</xref>). Contrasting studies have shown that numerous ZDHHCs have specific protein interacting domains including ankyrin repeat (AR), PDZ and SH3 domains that facilitate substrate interactions, providing support for a model in which more specific enzyme-substrate interactions can govern <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemonidis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plain et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verardi et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study found striking substrate specificity for several ZDHHCs with the G-protein subunit Gαo, and revealed intriguing observations that the subcellular localization of a number of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation substrates could be controlled by changing the localization, and importantly, the expression of certain ZDHHC enzymes. In this study, <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylated substrates were found to accumulate in the subcellular compartment in which their partner ZDHHCs were targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Solis et al., 2022</xref>). This is particularly relevant as the ZDHHCs are known to have diverse subcellular localizations including the Golgi, ER, endosomes and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Globa and Bamji, 2017</xref>). Transcriptional control of differentially compartmentalized palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes could therefore be an essential mechanism for regulating the subcellular localization, and function, of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylated protein substrates. Accordingly, LOF mutations in certain ZDHHC enzymes leads to cell-type-specific disruption in <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation that is not compensated by other members of the large ZDHHC family. We provide a means to investigate the expression of the proteins that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation, making BrainPalmSeq an invaluable resource to both researchers and clinicians that are working to better understand the role of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in the brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLAG-GOLGA7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Maurine Linder Washington University School of Medicine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HA-ZDHHC9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shimell et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLAG-MOBP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Origene, Maryland, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAT#: RC223946</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLAG-PLP1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Origene, Maryland, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAT#: RC218616</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLAG-CNP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Origene, Maryland, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAT#: RC207038</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAT #<break/>CRL-1573</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-HA, (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAT#: 3,724</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dilution 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-FLAG (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Origene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAT#: TA50011-100</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dilution 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-MOBP (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAT# PA5-100618</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">Dilution 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-PLP1 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAT# ab28486</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">Dilution 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-CNP (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAT# ab6319</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">Dilution 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAPTUREome S-palmitoylated protein kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Badrilla, UK</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAT# K010-311</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data processing for BrainPalmSeq</title><p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref> (‘MouseBrain’), single-cell counts (UMI from 3’ end counting) were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mousebrain.org/">MouseBrain.org</ext-link> (loom file named l5_all.loom), and log normalized by first scaling the expression values provided to a sum of 10,000 per cell before calculating log2(scaled_counts +1).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Experimental:</p><p>1. The result presented on Figure 6. should be validated by loss of function experiments.</p><p>2. At a few instances protein-level validation of RNA expression should strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p><p>3. It is unclear why certain established depalmitoylating enzymes were excluded from the database. At least some of them should be added.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>4. Please outline the long-term strategy for the future management of the database, explain how it will be updated with newly available experimental data.</p><p>Modification of the text:</p><p>5. Additional details regarding the discussion are detailed in the body of Rev. #3's report.</p><p>The authors are also invited to address all other points raised by the reviewers in their rebuttal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Could the authors comment on cross-validation with ISH? When is it possible, beneficial etc?</p><p>Do the authors plan to update the database with new datasets as they become available?</p><p>The authors could provide a clear description of the unique benefits of their web tool in comparison with other tools. What types of comparisons are available only with this tool? Ease of use? etc.</p><p>Only 2 types of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons are included. Is there any data available about additional inhibitory cell types or interneurons in general, i.e. cells identified with inhibitory specific cell markers (e.g. GAD65,67)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The main recommendation regards the possibility of the authors to greatly improve the robustness of their predictions by using available ZDHHC antibodies to test and validate the protein expression of certain ZDHHC enzymes in different neuro-associated tissue culture cell types.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. No information is provided about the long-term integrity of the web resource 'brainpalmseq'. Is the corresponding author's institution committing to maintaining this in perpetuity?</p><p>2. I appreciate that the current analysis is a snapshot of known palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes, but I don't see a justification to exclude ABHD10 (PMID: 31740833) from the analysis. Add this enzyme to Figure 4.</p><p>3. Line 307 (or discussion). It is important to comment on the very modest correlation of expression of Golga7b / Golga7 with either of the two zDHHC-PATs they have been suggested to regulate. This would appear to imply they are 'optional' rather than 'obligatory' partners, correct?</p><p>4. Figure 6. If both MOBP and PLP are zDHHC9 substrates how can you explain the relatively low palmitoylation of MOBP (~40% increased to ~90% by zDHHC9 &amp; Golga7) but relatively high palmitoylation of PLP (~80% increased to ~90%) in the same cell type? Could other zDHHC-PATs be involved?</p><p>5. Figure 6. I appreciate that the increase in PLP palmitoylation is statistically significant, but is the very small change in palmitoylation likely to be biologically significant? Can you be confident that there are no non-specific effects of overexpressing zDHHC9? These experiments would be significantly improved by silencing zDHHC9 (or repeating with the zDHHC9 knockout animals that this lab used in PMID: 31747610).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75804.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Experimental:</p><p>1. The result presented on Figure 6. should be validated by loss of function experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewers’ suggestion, we have now done loss of function experiments to determine whether ZDHHC9 is not only <italic>sufficient</italic> to palmitoylate proteins that we have predicted to be ZDHHC9 substrates, but also <italic>necessary</italic>. Reviewer 2 was specifically concerned about unspecific S-acylation, (‘This setup is known to often provide unspecific S-acylation events which result from excess enzyme or substrate availability’<italic>)</italic> and Reviewer 3 recommended repeating the experiment using <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockout mice.</p><p>As suggested by Reviewer 3, we performed acyl-rac assays on hemi-brains (half brain minus cerebellum) from postnatal day 23 WT and <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice. However, using this method we observed no changes in the palmitoylation of the 3 substrates tested, PLP1, MOBP and CNP (see Figure 6—figure supplement 2). This can be attributed to many factors, including compensation by other ZDHHCs that are also expressed in oligodendrocytes (e.g. ZDHHC20), or the use of lysate from a variety of brain regions that may ‘dilute’ the observable effects that are occurring in specific brain regions or cell populations. Of note, the palmitoylation of Ras has also been reported to be unchanged in whole brains of Zdhhc9 knockout mice (PMID: 29944857), and Ras is a very well-established substrate for ZDHHC9 (e.g. PMID: 16000296; PMID: 24127608). Compensation has been attributed to a lack of phenotype in many knockout mouse lines and does not negate the fact that our acyl-rac assays demonstrate that ZDHHC9 <italic>can</italic> palmitoylate MOBP and PLP1. It is possible that acyl-rac assays done specifically using oligodendrocytes from WT and KO brains may uncover differences in substrate palmitoylation, however this experiment is particularly challenging due to the large amount of starting tissue required for the acyl-rac assay and is beyond the intended scope of the present study.</p><p>We understand Reviewer 2’s concern about data that relies on overexpression of substrates and ZDHHC enzymes. However, we respectfully submit that this type of experiment is well established and a good starting point to determine whether a particular ZDHHC can palmitoylate a substrate. As a counter to the idea that unspecific S-acylation events may result from excess enzyme or substrate availability, in our assay CNP was not palmitoylated when overexpressed in HEK cells together with ZDHHC9 (i.e. only 2 of the 3 substrates tested were palmitoylated by ZDHHC9). Moreover, we have previously overexpressed ZDHHCs together with another putative substrate (δ-catenin) and demonstrated that only 2 of the 19 ZDHHCs tested could palmitoylate that substrate (see Brigidi, et al., 2014, Figure 7). Similar experiments have been done to identify palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes for PSD-95 (PMID: 15603741, PMID: 27307232).</p><p>Our study seeks to illustrate the utility of our web-tool and how users might use bioinformatics to begin investigating potential enzyme-substrate interactions. We believe we have shown this in Figure 6 and do not see a need to add this additional experiment that is subject to the caveats outlined above. However, we would be happy to include this negative data in a supplemental figure if the editors and reviewers deem it necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. At a few instances protein-level validation of RNA expression should strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewers that mRNA and protein levels are not always well correlated and that instances of protein-level validation would be an excellent addition to the study. We were unable to validate protein expression using immunohistochemistry as available antibodies for the ZDHHC family are not of sufficient quality to discern the expression patterns with acceptable specificity to compare directly with extremely high resolution RNAseq data. While characterization of the proteome of individual brain cells has lagged behind transcriptome profiling due to the inability to amplify proteins in the same way as RNA, in an attempt to address this point, we turned to a proteomic study that identified the proteome of pooled neonatal brain cells isolated by MACS microbead/antibody cell separation (PMID: 26523646). We compared the cell type enrichments of the detected palmitoylation associated proteins included in our study with cell-type averages of RNA expression from an age matched scRNAseq study (PMID: 29545511). Overall, we found a significant correlation between the cell type enrichments of both RNA and protein in the brain for palmitoylation associated proteins detected in the proteomic screen. We believe that the use of open proteomic data from isolated cell types is preferable to the use of low specificity antibodies when comparing protein enrichment patterns with RNAseq data. We have included this as a supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). A new Results section has also been added to line 364 and discussion to line 563.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is unclear why certain established depalmitoylating enzymes were excluded from the database. At least some of them should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that an extended list of de-palmitoylating enzymes should be included in both the manuscript and website. To this end, we have updated the manuscript and figures to include the depalmitoylating enzymes that are blocked by Palmostatin B and hexadecylfluorophosphonate (HDFP; PMID: 28630138 ), which includes all of the enzymes suggested by the reviewers (ABHD4, ABHD6 ABHD10, ABHD12) with the exception of ABHD11, which was weakly inhibited by these blockers and for which we unable to find a significant body of evidence supporting the depalmitoylating activity of this enzyme (although we will reconsider if the reviewers feel strongly about including this enzyme). We have however still included ABHD11 in the website heatmaps and data download for future investigation of those interested. Also included in the website and manuscript (although not requested by the reviewers) are ABHD13 and ABHD16A, which are both inhibited by HDFP and have been shown recently to depalmitoylate SNAP25 (unpublished data, Jennifer Greaves lab). In the event that future genes are discovered, we will update the website according to such feedback (see strategy below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Explanation:</p><p>4. Please outline the long-term strategy for the future management of the database, explain how it will be updated with newly available experimental data.</p></disp-quote><p>The website will be maintained and updated for a minimal period of 5 years by first author Research Associate, Angela Wild. This will include adding new genes to the website, particularly newly identified accessory proteins and de-palmitoylating enzymes, as they are discovered/validated. While we feel that the current studies included in the website provide sufficient coverage of the whole brain at a variety of developmental ages, we will add new datasets to the website that offer substantial improvements to the data curated. For example, we will consider studies that are broader in their scope offering new insights about brain cell development or regional heterogeneity, or those that feature improved techniques that considerably increase resolution of gene expression detection offering novel information. To facilitate updates, we have added a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://brainpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/contact-us/">‘Contact Us’</ext-link> feature to the website which will allow users to suggest new genes or datasets to add. In the event of A. Wild’s absence, a replacement student/staff member will be fully trained to perform these duties. The fully automated heatmap code used in the website (created by author Peter Hogg, PhD student at UBC) to display the interactive heatmaps can be easily updated by uploading a new gene list into the code. The collaboration to create the heatmaps for the website was initiated/managed by Jeff LeDue, who is head of the Managing Director of the Neuroimaging and Neurocomputation Centre at UBC and coordinator of the UBC Dynamic Brain Circuits in Health and Disease Research Excellence Cluster. This collaboration will continue if additional resources are needed in the future management of the website. We will continue to collaborate with Stephane Flibotte who is a permanent staff member at the UBC LSI Bioinformatics Facility, or with his colleagues, to process new datasets that we acquire according to the analysis pipeline utilized throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Modification of the text:</p><p>5.

We observed many instances of regionally restricted mRNA expression in the RNAseq datasets curated that was reflected in the Allen Brain ISH, supporting the use of RNAseq to generate cellular maps of gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the authors plan to update the database with new datasets as they become available?</p></disp-quote><p>We do plan to update the database with new datasets as they become available.

What types of comparisons are available only with this tool? Ease of use? etc.</p></disp-quote><p>In the manuscript we have already outlined the barriers and difficulties with previously available tools (page 4 line 95): “We found however, there were several barriers to the easy access for much of this data, with no single resource available to evaluate multi-study expression data. Data can also be difficult to access when studies are not accompanied by an interactive online web viewer, while datasets that do have a web viewer employ diverse interfaces that are often complex, particularly for large scRNAseq datasets. Furthermore, the differing study specific analysis pipelines, as well as the variety of data presentation formats in web viewers including heatmaps, bar charts, tables or t-SNE plots can make datasets difficult for non-bioinformaticians to interpret and compare.” And have further outlined how our tool improves accessibility: “In order to remove these barriers and provide easy access to expression data for the proteins that regulate S-palmitoylation in the brain, we created ‘BrainPalmSeq’, an easy-to-use web platform allowing user driven interrogation of compiled multi-study expression data at cellular resolution through simple interactive heatmaps that are populated according to user selected brain regions, cell types or genes of interest (http://brainpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Only 2 types of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons are included.

Included in our study is the detailed scRNAseq dataset of neurons performed by the Allen Institute, which identified 122 GABAergic neuron subtypes in the cortex and hippocampus.

I appreciate that the current analysis is a snapshot of known palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes, but I don't see a justification to exclude ABHD10 (PMID: 31740833) from the analysis.

We have addressed this point more completely in Essential revision point 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 307 (or discussion). It is important to comment on the very modest correlation of expression of Golga7b / Golga7 with either of the two zDHHC-PATs they have been suggested to regulate. This would appear to imply they are 'optional' rather than 'obligatory' partners, correct?</p></disp-quote><p>We are hesitant to over-interpret the correlation patterns to draw any firm conclusions about whether an accessory protein is optional or obligatory on the basis of bioinformatic correlation analysis alone. However, as this will be of interest to many groups working in palmitoylation, we have performed additional analysis on the relationships between ZDHHCs and known accessory proteins. We have added a new supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) that plots the expression values for each of the known ZDHHC/accessory protein pairs across 265 identified cell types from ‘MouseBrain’ dataset. These graphs reveal that while <italic>Zdhhc5</italic> is expressed in several cell types with little-to-no expression of <italic>Golga7b</italic>, both <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> and <italic>Zdhhc6</italic> were always co-expressed with their accessory proteins (<italic>Golga7</italic> and <italic>Selenok</italic>, respectively). This analysis also reveals the cell types in the brain with the highest co-expression between Zdhhcs and accessory partners, raising the possibility that there are certain cellular contexts in which pairing might be more important for regulating ZDHHC function. We have updated the results (line 354) to reflect these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 6. If both MOBP and PLP are zDHHC9 substrates how can you explain the relatively low palmitoylation of MOBP (~40% increased to ~90% by zDHHC9 &amp; Golga7) but relatively high palmitoylation of PLP (~80% increased to ~90%) in the same cell type? Could other zDHHC-PATs be involved?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that there are differences in basal palmitoylation of MOBP, PLP and CNP in our HEK cell assay is variable. Numerous PATs are known to be expressed in HEK293T cells (https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle/datasets) and PLP may be highly palmitoylated basally by endogenous ZDHHC9 or ZDHHC9 plus another PAT(s). The level of endogenous palmitoylation does not necessarily speak to multiple PATs, but merely the extent to which a substrate is palmitoylated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 6. I appreciate that the increase in PLP palmitoylation is statistically significant, but is the very small change in palmitoylation likely to be biologically significant? Can you be confident that there are no non-specific effects of overexpressing zDHHC9? These experiments would be significantly improved by silencing zDHHC9 (or repeating with the zDHHC9 knockout animals that this lab used in PMID: 31747610).</p></disp-quote><p>It is very difficult to determine biological impact based on the magnitude of change. As per reviewers’ request, we have repeated our work with <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockout mice (See Essential revision point 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
