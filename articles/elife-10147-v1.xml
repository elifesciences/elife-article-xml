spindles relative to neighboring cells. A molecular complex scaffolded by the GK protein-interaction domain (GK<sub>PID</sub>) mediates spindle orientation in diverse animal taxa by linking microtubule motor proteins to a marker protein on the cell cortex localized by external cues. Here we illuminate how this complex evolved and commandeered control of spindle orientation from a more ancient mechanism. The complex was assembled through a series of molecular exploitation events, one of which – the evolution of GK<sub>PID</sub>’s capacity to bind the cortical marker protein – can be recapitulated by reintroducing a single historical substitution into the reconstructed ancestral GK<sub>PID</sub>. This change revealed and repurposed an ancient molecular surface that previously had a radically different function. We show how the physical simplicity of this binding interface enabled the evolution of a new protein function now essential to the biological complexity of many animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10147.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10147.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10147.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For billions of years, life on Earth was made up of single cells. In the lineage that led to animals – and independently in those that led to plants and to fungi – multicellular organisms evolved as cells began to specialize and arrange themselves into tissues and organs. Although the evolution of multicellularity is one of the most important events in the history of animal life, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which it took place.</p><p>To form and maintain organized tissues, cells must coordinate how they divide relative to the position of their neighbours. One important aspect of this process is orientation of the mitotic spindle, a structure inside the dividing cell that distributes the chromosomes —and the genetic material they carry — between the daughter cells. When the spindle is not oriented properly, malformed tissues and cancer can result. In a diverse range of animals, the orientation of the spindle is controlled by an ancient scaffolding protein that links the spindle to “marker” proteins on the edge of the cell.</p><p>Anderson et al. have now used a technique called ancestral protein reconstruction to investigate how this molecular complex evolved its ability to position the spindle. First, the amino acid sequences of the scaffolding protein’s ancient progenitors, which existed before the origin of the most primitive animals on Earth, were determined. Anderson et al. did this by computationally retracing the evolution of large numbers of present-day scaffolding protein sequences down the tree of life, into the deep past. Living cells were then made to produce the ancient proteins, allowing their properties to be experimentally examined.</p><p>By experimentally dissecting successive ancestral versions of the scaffolding protein, Anderson et al. deduced how the molecular complex that it anchors came to control spindle orientation. This new ability evolved by a number of “molecular exploitation” events, which repurposed parts of the protein for new roles. The progenitor of the scaffolding protein was actually an enzyme, but the evolution of its spindle-orienting ability can be recapitulated by introducing a single amino acid change that happened many hundreds of millions of years ago.</p><p>How could a single mutation have conferred such a dramatically new function? Anderson et al. found that the ancient scaffolding protein uses the same part of its surface to bind to the spindle-orienting molecular marker as the ancient enzyme used to bind to its target substrate molecule, and the two partner molecules happen to share certain key chemical properties. This fortuitous resemblance between two unrelated molecules thus set the stage for the simple evolution of a function that is now essential to the complexity of multicellular animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10147.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10147.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>evolutionary cell biology</kwd><kwd><italic>Salpingea rosetta</italic></kwd><kwd>mitotic spindle</kwd><kwd>ancestral protein reconstruction</kwd><kwd>evolutionary biochemistry</kwd><kwd>protein evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM104397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thornton</surname><given-names>Joseph W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM087457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prehoda</surname><given-names>Kenneth E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM089977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimentally reconstructing the evolution of the molecular complex that animals use to orient the mitotic spindle establishes a simple genetic and physical mechanism for the emergence of a function essential for multicellularity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolution of organized multicellularity is one of the most important and least understood transitions in the history of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maynard Smith and Szathmary, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">King, 2004</xref>). Multicellularity – defined as the differentiation and spatial arrangement of cell types into functioning tissues within an integrated organism – evolved independently in several eukaryotic lineages, using unique mechanisms each time to drive the cellular functions necessary for tissue organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rokas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Smet and Beeckman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trillo and Nedelcu, 2015</xref>). Comparative analyses have established that many protein families involved in cell adhesion, signal transduction, and cell differentiation in modern animals first appeared in the genomes of unicellular eukaryotes that were progenitors of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">King, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nichols et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richter and King, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rokas, 2008</xref>). Virtually nothing is known, however, concerning the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins’ functions evolved. These events happened in the deep past, so horizontal comparisons between extant species are often not sufficient to establish the historical changes in protein sequence, function, or biophysical properties that caused them. Vertical evolutionary analysis using ancestral protein reconstruction – phylogenetic inference of ancestral sequences followed by gene synthesis, genetic manipulation, and experimental characterization – has proven to be an effective strategy for elucidating these questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harms and Thornton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harms and Thornton, 2013</xref>). Here, we apply ancestral protein reconstruction to investigate the historical trajectory, timing, and mechanisms of evolution of a new protein function important to organized multicellularity in diverse animal phyla.</p><p>For dividing animal cells to generate and maintain organized tissues, the mitotic spindle must be oriented relative to the position of surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillies and Cabernard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu and Johnston, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cabernard and Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). Cells that orient the spindle parallel to the epithelial plane, for example, expand the tissue; those that rotate it orthogonally to the plane escape the epithelium, as in epithelial-mesenchymal transitions during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillies and Cabernard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakajima et al., 2013</xref>). Experiments have identified a protein complex that mediates robust positioning of the mitotic spindle by using a scaffolding protein to link the spindle’s astral microtubules to a molecular marker that is localized on the cell’s cortex by external signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu and Johnston, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siegrist and Doe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Siegrist, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The complex and its functions have been most extensively studied in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> neuroblasts, but it plays a similar role in birds and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saadaoui et al., 2014</xref>) and in other cell types, such as several kinds of epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakajima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saadaoui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2015</xref>). In this complex, the scaffold is the GK protein interaction domain (GK<sub>PID</sub>) of the protein Discs large (Dlg), which binds microtubule-associated motor proteins, such as the kinesin-3 family member KHC-73, and the Partner of Inscuteable protein (Pins in insects, LGN in vertebrates). In neuroblasts, the complex is localized relative to the position of adjacent cells by the interaction of a transmembrane receptor – which receives local extracellular signals – with Pins, which in turn recruits GK<sub>PID</sub>, KHC-73, and the spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshiura et al., 2012</xref>). In epithelia, in contrast, localization of the complex relative to surrounding cells appears to be mediated by Dlg itself; Pins is then recruited into the complex via interaction with Dlg’s GK<sub>PID</sub>. In addition to serving as a localized molecular mark in some cell types, Pins also brings other proteins to the complex, including Mud/Numa and its partners, which generate pulling forces and reinforce proper spindle orientation once it is established by the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu and Johnston, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>). Other molecules and pathways may be important in spindle orientation in other kinds of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillies and Cabernard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu and Johnston, 2013</xref>), and further work is required to comprehensively assess the generality of the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex’s role in spindle orientation across cell types and in the most basal animal lineages. Nevertheless, the fact that the GK<sub>PID</sub>-mediated complex orients the mitotic spindle in multiple cell types in both protostomes and deuterostomes suggests an ancient and essential role in the biology of complex animals. Indeed, compromising Dlg’s GK<sub>PID</sub> or other components of the Pins-Dlg-KHC-73 complex affects numerous tissues and cell types by causing impaired spindle orientation, tumorigenesis plasia, defects in cell polarity and differentiation, and developmental failures of tissue organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakajima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siegrist and Doe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshiura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woods, 1996</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10147.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Function and phylogeny of the guanylate kinase (gk) and GK<sub>PID</sub> protein family.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The GK<sub>PID</sub> of the protein Discs-large (Dlg, blue) serves as a scaffold for spindle orientation by physically linking the localized cortical protein Pins (green) to astral microtubules (red) via the motor protein KHC-73 (black).

Dlg is a member of a larger family of membrane-associated multidomain proteins, all of which contain a GK<sub>PID</sub> and form protein complexes important to cell adhesion, neural synapse organization, and other functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Funke et al., 2005</xref>). The GK<sub>PID</sub> has been found only in animals, choanoflagellates, and Filasterea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">te Velthuis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Mendoza et al., 2010</xref>), but it is similar in both sequence and structure to the guanylate kinase (gk) enzymes, which are common to all life and regulate nucleotide homeostasis by catalyzing the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 1996</xref>). These observations suggest that Dlg’s GK<sub>PID</sub> may have evolved from an ancient gk enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2011</xref>), but this hypothesis is untested and its evolutionary implications are unexplored. For example, it is not known when the GK<sub>PID</sub>’s scaffolding functions first evolved, either in relation to the emergence of organized multicellularity or the origin of the other components of the spindle orientation complex; it is therefore unclear how the complex was assembled by evolution or what its role may have been in the emergence of spindle orientation and tissue organization. Some work has been done to identify amino acids that contribute to the functional differences between gk enzymes and GK<sub>PID</sub>s in present-day organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2011</xref>), but it is unknown whether those residues are historically relevant to the evolution of GK<sub>PID</sub>’s functions or whether they provide a necessary and sufficient explanation in the context of the ancestral protein to explain the emergence of the protein’s spindle-orienting functions.</p><p>How an ancient gk enzyme gave rise to a protein domain with scaffolding/spindle orientation functions is also a striking model for the evolution of novel molecular functions. Most studies of protein evolution to date have focused on relatively subtle shifts in function, such as changes in relative ligand preference, in allosteric regulation, or in quantitative measures of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harms and Thornton, 2013</xref>). GK<sub>PID</sub>s and gk enzymes, however, have entirely different biochemical functions – specific protein binding and catalysis of a nucleotide substrate – suggesting the evolution of an entirely new function. Virtually nothing is known concerning the mechanisms and dynamics by which fundamentally novel protein functions evolve.</p><p>We therefore used ancestral protein reconstruction to reconstruct the sequences of ancestral members of the protein family that contains the gk enzymes and GK<sub>PID</sub>s. This strategy allowed us to trace their functional evolution through time and dissect the genetic and biophysical mechanisms that mediated the evolution of the GK<sub>PID</sub>’s new functions. To understand the context in which GK<sub>PID</sub>s evolved, we also sought insight into the evolution of other components of the spindle orientation machinery – and spindle orientation itself – by examining their presence in the single-celled eukaryotes most closely related to animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogeny of the gk/GK<sub>PID</sub> family</title><p>Understanding the historical process of protein evolution begins with a phylogeny. We first assembled a sequence alignment of the gk enzyme/GK<sub>PID</sub> family by searching publicly available databases and genomes. We recovered gk enzymes from taxa across the tree of life, suggesting a universal distribution, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">te Velthuis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Mendoza et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, GK<sub>PID</sub>s are present in all animal genomes analyzed as well as in their closest unicellular relatives, the choanoflagellates and Filasterea; however, GK<sub>PID</sub>s are absent from the genomes of all sequenced fungi and all other eukaryotic and prokaryotic lineages analyzed. We aligned 224 broadly sampled amino acid sequences and inferred the phylogeny of the gk enzyme/GK<sub>PID</sub> family using maximum likelihood phylogenetics, rooted using the bacterial gk enzymes as an outgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>All GK<sub>PID</sub>s cluster together as a monophyletic group, with the gk enzymes forming a paraphyletic set of basal lineages. Within the GK<sub>PID</sub>s, there are two major clades, one of which contains Dlg and closely related paralogs; the other contains other family members, which are involved in cell adhesion and numerous other processes. Choanoflagellate and Filasterean genomes each contain both a gk enzyme and a GK<sub>PID</sub>, with the latter proteins occupying a well-supported basal position sister to the metazoan Dlg-containing clade. This topology indicates that the gene that came to code for GK<sub>PID</sub>s was generated by duplication of an ancient gk enzyme before the last common ancestor of Filozoa (animals+choanoflagellates+Filasterea) and after the split of Filozoa from the lineage leading to fungi, which contain no GK<sub>PID</sub>s. Further gene duplications within the animals produced the diverse proteins that now contain GK<sub>PID</sub>s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, ref.

We focused on two key ancestral proteins: Anc-GK1<sub>PID,</sub> which represents the single GK<sub>PID</sub>s from which GK<sub>PID</sub>s in all Filozoan taxa descend) and its progenitor, Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub>, which existed just before the gene duplication that split the gk enzymes from the GK<sub>PID</sub>s. Most sites in Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> were reconstructed with high confidence (mean posterior probability per site 0.94, with only 20 ambiguously reconstructed sites, defined as having a second plausible reconstruction with PP &gt; 0.20); Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> was reconstructed with lower confidence (mean PP = 0.77, and 51 ambiguous sites, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data SD3-data">Figure 1—source data 2 and 3</xref>)</p><p>To determine when GK<sub>PID</sub>’s functions evolved, we synthesized DNAs coding for the ancestral protein sequences, expressed and purified the proteins in cultured cells, and characterized their functions by 1) measuring guanylate kinase activity in vitro using a coupled enzyme assay, 2) assessing affinity for a labeled Pins peptide using a fluorescence anisotropy assay, and 3) characterizing spindle-orienting function using an assay of mitotic spindle geometry in cultured cells transfected with a GK domain of interest. In the latter assay, <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells in which native Dlg is knocked down were transfected with Pins fused to the cell-adhesion protein Echinoid, which localizes a crescent of Pins to the area of contact between adjacent cells; if and only if a functional GK<sub>PID</sub> is cotransfected will the spindle align during mitosis at a right angle to the crescent, along the axis between the two cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We found that Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> is an active guanylate kinase enzyme, with a Michaelis constant (K<sub>M</sub>) comparable to that of the human enzyme, albeit with a slower k<sub>cat</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It displays no measurable Pins binding and failed to orient the mitotic spindle in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>). These data indicate that enzyme activity is, as predicted, the ancestral function of the family; further, the scaffolding functions associated with spindle orientation were not yet present, even in suboptimal form, when duplication of the gk enzyme gene gave rise to the locus leading to GK<sub>PID</sub>s.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10147.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Evolution of a novel spindle-orientation function in ancestral GK<sub>PID</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> (circles) is an active nucleotide kinase in a coupled enzyme assay for the reaction shown; Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> (boxes) is inactive.

Specifically, we found that Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> has no detectable guanylate kinase activity, but it binds Pins with moderate affinity and is highly effective in orienting the mitotic spindle in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,F</xref>). We also reconstructed Anc-GK2<sub>PID</sub> – the more recent progenitor of all Dlg proteins in the ancestral animal – and found that it too orients the mitotic spindle and binds Pins with even higher affinity, suggesting a subsequent fine-tuning of Pins-binding capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>It is unlikely that the ML ancestral reconstruction is precisely correct at all sites, so it is important to determine whether our conclusions about the functions of Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> and Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> are robust to uncertainty about their inferred sequences. We therefore constructed an alternative version of each ancestral protein, in which all plausible alternative amino acid states (defined as those with posterior probability &gt; 0.20) were introduced at once. These ‘Alt-All’ sequences represent the far edge of the cloud of plausible ancestral sequences, and they contain more differences from the ML reconstruction than the expected number of errors in the ML sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). They therefore represent a conservative test of functional robustness to statistical uncertainty about the ancestral sequence. When assayed experimentally, the alternative version of Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub>, like the ML reconstruction, was an active gk enzyme that did not bind Pins, and the alternative version of Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> bound Pins, as did the ML sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that both the inferred trajectory of functional evolution and the phylogenetic interval during which protein scaffolding activity first evolved are robust to statistical uncertainty about the precise ancestral sequences.</p><p>Taken together, these findings indicate that the capacity of the GK<sub>PID</sub> to bind Pins and orient the mitotic spindle arose well before the evolution of animals or multicellularity itself. Indeed, these functions arose even before the divergence of the choanoflagellate and filasterean lineages and before the subsequent gene duplication that gave rise to the modern subgroups of GK<sub>PID</sub>-containing proteins, including Dlgs. The capacity of GK<sub>PID</sub>s to carry out these functions therefore evolved before the evolution of organized multicellularity itself, because filastereans do not form organized colonies (although cells from some species do aggregate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2013</xref>]). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the emergence of the GK<sub>PID</sub>’s derived functions in protein scaffolding contributed to the subsequent evolution of animal complexity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Evolution of the spindle orientation complex by molecular exploitation</title><p>The evolution of GK<sub>PID</sub>’s peptide-binding functions could have conferred spindle orientation only if its binding partners were already present. To understand when the other key components of the spindle orientation complex evolved, we characterized the taxonomic distribution of orthologs of metazoan KHC-73 and Pins by searching protein sequence databases and then inferring the age of each protein by parsimony-based inference on the taxonomic tree of life.</p><p>We found that KHC-73 orthologs are clearly present in animals, choanoflagellates, and Filasterea; fungal genomes do not contain a convincing ortholog of KHC-73 but do contain a closely related paralogous member of the kinesin-3 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). This observation indicates that the KHC-73 gene is as old as the Filozoan ancestor and originated during the same phylogenetic interval in which Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> evolved its novel functions.</p><p>Pins orthologs have a more recent origin. The genome of <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic>, a choanoflagellate that forms spatially organized spherical colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>), contains an ortholog of Pins, which is very similar in sequence and domain architecture to its metazoan orthologs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> , <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). A Pins ortholog is also present in another choanoflagellate, <italic>Monosiga brevicollis</italic>, but none was detected in Fungi, Filasterea, or any lineages outside of choanoflagellates and animals. In Filasterea, for example, the most similar protein to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Pins has a different domain structure, has detectable sequence similarity in only one small portion of the protein, and, when used as a query in a reciprocal search of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome, returns a protein from an entirely different family as the best hit with significance score 10 orders of magnitude better than its match to Pins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Indeed, a key domain of Pins – the GoLoco domain, a simple 23-amino acid sequence that mediates Pins’ contact with membrane-associated G-proteins and is therefore crucial to its cortical localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith and Prehoda, 2011</xref>) – exists only in animals and choanoflagellates. This observation establishes that Pins evolved before the split of choanoflagellates and animals and suggests that it evolved after a functional GK<sub>PID</sub> emerged in the Filozoan stem lineage.</p><p>The association of GK<sub>PID</sub> with Pins in the spindle orientation complex therefore evolved through a stepwise process of molecular exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bridgham, 2006</xref>) – a form of exaptation in which a newly evolved molecule recruits as a binding partner a more ancient molecule, which previously had different functions and a fortuitous but unrealized affinity for its new partner. In this case, GK<sub>PID</sub>'s affinity for Pins apparently existed before the Pins protein came into existence. What could the functions of GK<sub>PID</sub> and KHC-73 have been before Pins evolved in the lineage leading to choanoflagellates and animals? GK<sub>PID</sub> and KHC-73 may have associated with each other to orient the mitotic spindle relative to a cellular mark other than Pins. Alternatively, GK<sub>PID</sub> may have functioned in other processes executed by its descendants, such as cell adhesion; KHC-73 also has numerous functions as an intracellular motor protein that are independent of spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanada, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horiguchi, 2006</xref>). In either case, when a suitable form of Pins evolved considerably later, GK<sub>PID</sub> already had the capacity to bind it and thus form a scaffold for spindle orientation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Spindle orientation in choanoflagellates without GK-Pins association</title><p>The experiments reported above establish when GK<sub>PID</sub> evolved its capacity to bind extant animal Pins protein and to organize spindle orientation in extant animal cells; they do not reveal when a Pins protein that could bind GK<sub>PID</sub> first evolved. Pins is too poorly conserved for its ancestral form to be reconstructed with confidence. We therefore evaluated this question indirectly by investigating whether choanoflagellate GK<sub>PID</sub> binds choanoflagellate Pins, as expected if the association of Pins and GK<sub>PID</sub> and its role in spindle orientation predate the metazoan-choanoflagellate ancestor. We purified the GK<sub>PID</sub> of the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> Dlg-like protein and measured its affinity for the linker peptide of the Pins protein – the region to which GK<sub>PID</sub> binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>) – from <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and from metazoans.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10147.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Taxonomic distribution of proteins in the spindle orientation complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The genomes of the choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> and the filasterean <italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic> contain orthologs of human Dlg, Pins, and KHC-73.

Spindle orientation itself is not a metazoan novelty; indeed, most eukaryotes – even unicellular ones – orient the mitotic spindle, but most appear to do so relative to the cell’s internal structure alone rather than in response to cues from adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). We visualized the mitotic spindle in colonial <italic>S. rosetta</italic> using fluorescence microscopy and found that dividing <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells appear to orient their mitotic spindles relative to the surface of the colony in a way that maintains the colony’s spherical geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). If GK<sub>PID</sub> and Pins do not associate in choanoflagellates, how do colonial cells accomplish this? <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells form colonies in a flagellum-out fashion, so orienting the spindle relative to the colony surface also entails orienting it at a right angle to the axis of the flagellum and, more generally, to the apical-basal (A-B) axis of the cell. We found that individual dividing <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells that are not organized into colonies also orient their spindles relative to the flagellum and the A-B axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Because spindle orientation relative to the cellular axis occurs in both colonial and noncolonial <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells, spindle orientation is likely to involve internal marks imposed by the cell’s polarity rather than cues from neighboring cells.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that spindle orientation mediated by the GK<sub>PID</sub>-Pins complex in response to external cues replaced a more ancient mode of spindle orientation along the stem lineage leading to animals. This more ancient mechanism may have involved the flagellar basal bodies. The deeper choanoflagellate-metazoan ancestor almost certainly had flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nielsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buss, 1988</xref>). Previous research indicates that during choanoflagellate mitosis, the flagellar basal body duplicates; the daughter bodies migrate symmetrically away from the cell’s basal pole and then serve as microtubule organizing centers for assembling the spindle and orienting it perpendicular to the A-B axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buss, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leadbeater, 2015</xref>). A parsimonious hypothesis is therefore that spindle orientation in the choanoflagellate-animal ancestor was oriented relative to the A-B axis via the position of the flagellar basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buss, 1988</xref>). This ancient mechanism would have been retained in choanoflagellates, allowing organized cell division in the context of flagellum-out spherical colonies. Along the branch leading to the metazoan ancestor, basal-body mediated orientation would have been replaced by the GK<sub>PID</sub>-Pins association, providing a mechanism for the spindle to be oriented relative to adjacent cells via an externally organized molecular mark as the flagellum was lost from many animal cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A simple genetic basis for the evolution of GK<sub>PID</sub>’s spindle-orienting functions</title><p>We next sought to identify the genetic mechanism by which the GK<sub>PID</sub> evolved its capacity to bind Pins and thus serve as a localized scaffold for spindle orientation. The potential candidate mutations are those that occurred during the phylogenetic interval between Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> and Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> – the same branch on which the transition to GK<sub>PID</sub> function took place. Seventy-one amino acid replacements occurred along this branch, making identification of the functionally important changes an apparent challenge.</p><p>To identify potentially causal substitutions from this large set of candidates, we used both structure-function information and the phylogenetic pattern of sequence conservation/divergence within and between gk enzymes and GK<sub>PID</sub>s. Extant gk enzymes contain two nucleotide binding lobes connected by a flexible hinge region around a central catalytic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In crystal structures of the gk enzyme in the absence of nucleotide substrate, the binding lobes are separated from each other in an open conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blaszczyk et al., 2001</xref>). Upon nucleotide binding, the lobes move inward and occupy a closed conformation, bringing GMP and its co-substrate ATP together and allowing catalysis to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sekulic et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, the GK<sub>PID</sub> remains constitutively in the open conformation, and Pins – which is considerably larger than the enzyme’s nucleotide ligands – binds to the exposed surface of the guanylate-binding lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnston et al., 2012</xref>). We reasoned that the substitutions that caused the functional transition from enzyme to scaffold might have affected residues in the GMP/Pins binding interface or, alternatively, in the hinge that determines the orientation of the lobes relative to each other, thus affecting the size, geometry, or accessibility of the ligand-binding cleft.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10147.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Evolution of the binding interface and hinge during the evolution of AncGK<sub>PID</sub> spindle orientation functions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) All gk/GK<sub>PID</sub> family members share a common structural architecture, comprising a catalytic core, two binding lobes (the GMP-binding domain, GBD, shown in dark hue, and the ATP-binding lid), and a flexible hinge region, which connects the GBD to the core and comprises two segments of contiguous residues (magenta).

To test these substitutions’ functional importance, we introduced the derived states individually into Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> and characterized their effects on guanylate kinase activity, Pins binding, and spindle orientation. Remarkably, we found that either of two amino acid changes in the hinge is sufficient to confer the protein-binding function. Substitution s36P, located where the hinge meets the binding lobe, virtually abolished the catalytic activity of Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> and established moderate-affinity Pins binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>; lower and upper case residue symbols denote ancestral and derived states, respectively).

A single substitution – either s36P or f33S – was sufficient to recapitulate the evolution of the new functions that emerged during the evolution of the GK<sub>PID</sub> and to completely or partially abolish the ancestral function. The historical order of these amino acid changes is unknown. If s36P occurred first, it would have conferred on the protein all the major aspects of the functional transition, and f33S would have been subsequently inconsequential. If f33S occurred first, however, our data suggest that it would have generated a functionally hybrid intermediate that both bound Pins and retained some enzyme activity; s36P would then have completed the functional transition by abolishing the residual enzyme activity.</p><p>The two causal historical substitutions that we identified are both reconstructed without any statistical ambiguity at the relevant nodes.

Homology models of the ancestral proteins, as well as the structures of extant family members, indicate that the key portion of the Pins-binding surface of GK<sub>PID</sub> was derived without significant modification from the ancient surface that gk enzymes use to bind GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This GMP-binding site could be repurposed for binding Pins because the two ligands – one a nucleotide, the other a peptide -- share a key structural feature: a negatively charged head flanked by a small hydrophobic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>, ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnston, et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, the phosphate group at the head of GMP is anchored to the enzyme with hydrogen bonds to four clustered residues that form a positively charged pocket (R40, R43, Y80, Y82); in the GK<sub>PID</sub>, these same residues form hydrogen bonds to the phosphate group of Pins’ phospho-serine 436. At the other end of GMP, the hydrophobic guanosine ring occupies a hydrophobic groove in the enzyme, and the same groove on the GK<sub>PID</sub> binds to a hydrophobic methionine side chain on Pins. Additional interactions beyond this common interface are required for Pins binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>), but the physical interactions are relatively simple, including a series of small hydrophobic patches that bind to hydrophobic side chains on Pins and just two additional hydrogen bonds, both from backbone atoms on Pins to polar residues on the GK<sub>PID</sub> surface that were solvent-exposed in the enzyme. Thus, the fortuitous similarity between GMP and one portion of Pins, along with the fortuitous arrangement of hydrophobic patches near the ancestral enzyme’s GMP-binding site, made it possible for GK<sub>PID</sub> to evolve Pins binding by a very minor genetic modification.</p><p>If the binding surface for Pins was already present in latent form in the Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> enzyme, how did s36P or f33S confer Pins binding? Several lines of evidence suggest that these substitutions altered the protein’s dynamics and/or increased the relative occupancy of a conformation in which the latent binding site is exposed for peptide binding. First, the hinge where these two residues are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>) is known to mediate the dynamic opening/closing of the binding lobes relative to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blaszczyk et al., 2001</xref>). Second, the degree to which the domain is open or closed appears to be essential for function. In gk enzymes, closing is critical for catalysis, because it brings the nucleotide substrates close together in the protected active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhabha et al., 2013</xref>); in GK<sub>PID</sub>s, however, open conformations appear to be required for Pins binding, because the Pins peptide is significantly larger and is therefore predicted to sterically clash with the GK<sub>PID</sub> when the lobes are close together. Third, substituting a proline at position 36 could restrict backbone dihedral angles in the hinge, possibly altering the dynamics of the hinge and/or the distribution of conformations it occupies. Replacing the bulky phenylalanine at position 36 could also change backbone dynamics, altering the occupancy of conformations in this region. Fourth, introducing a proline at residue 36 into extant gk enzymes has been shown to impede the GMP-induced closing motion, abolish enzyme activity, and to confer Pins binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2011</xref>). Because the effects of mutation s36P on the function of the ancestral gk enzyme are nearly identical to those it has on the extant enzyme, it is likely that similar biophysical mechanisms pertain in the two proteins. Fifth, engineering yet a third mutation in the hinge – a serine-to-proline replacement at site 34 – into extant gk enzymes has been previously found to reduce enzyme activity, confer spindle orientation, and impede conformational closing, further supporting a causal link between these phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We therefore propose that the historical hinge substitutions s36P or f33S inhibited enzyme activity and conferred the novel scaffolding function on GK<sub>PID</sub> by restricting the ancestral enzyme’s dynamic hinge motions and/or changing its occupancy of conformations that have high affinity for Pins. This scenario is consistent with recent findings that changes in conformational occupancy may play an important role in the evolution of protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harms et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>). Subsequent substitutions apparently fine-tuned Pins-binding affinity, yielding the higher-affinity Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> and Anc-GK2<sub>PID</sub>. In addition to its likely effects on conformational occupancy and/or dynamics, Pro36 makes van der Waals contact to the Pins ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), so it is possible that s36P may also have contributed to optimizing the latent Pins binding interface itself; in contrast, f33S does not contact the ligand and is therefore unlikely to have directly affected the interface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Simplicity and complexity in cellular evolution</title><p>A central issue in evolutionary biology is how complex systems originate through the action of mutation, drift, and natural selection. Tissue organization, spindle orientation, and the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex itself are all examples of complexity, defined as the integrated functioning of a system made up of differentiated, interacting parts. The GK<sub>PID</sub> complex can orient the mitotic spindle because of specific interactions between its component molecules and with other molecules in the cell and its local environment. In turn, the cellular phenomonenon mediated by this complex – regular orientation of the plane of cell division relative adjacent cells – allows the development and maintenance of organized, differentiated tissues, and this phenomenon in turn makes possible a higher level of biological complexity– the multicellular organism – from a collection of individual cells. Understanding the evolution of complexity at the molecular level can therefore help to illuminate the evolution of macroscopic complexity, including functions that are now crucial to animal biology per se.</p><p>Our work indicates that the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex was assembled stepwise through a process of molecular exploitation, in which old molecules with one function are recruited into a functional binding interaction with a newly evolved molecule. In this case, the GK<sub>PID</sub>, a duplicate of an ancient enzyme with an essential metabolic role in all life forms, already had the fortuitous capacity to bind the Pins protein, even before the latter protein appeared or subsequently acquired its relatively simple GK<sub>PID</sub>-binding linker motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Once Pins did evolve this linker — along with its GoLoco motif, which interacts with G-protein complexes, which are also ancient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Mendoza et al., 2014</xref>)— then a mechanism would have been assembled that could bring to specific locations on the cell cortex the GK<sub>PID </sub>and other proteins associated directly or indirectly with it, such as KHC-73 and astral microtubules, thus enabling externally-cued spindle orientation.</p><p>Our analyses do not establish a complete history of the spindle orientation complex. Many key steps remain to be reconstructed, including how and when the interaction between GK<sub>PID</sub> and KHC-73 evolved, the mechanisms by which Pins’ acquired its linker and GoLoco sequences, and the relationship of these components to other molecular complexes and pathways involved in animal spindle orientation. Despite these knowledge gaps, our observations establish a broad overview of the history of the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex, provide a detailed mechanistic reconstruction of a key event, and point to the importance of reusing molecules – and specific surfaces within them – for fortuitous new purposes that have the potential to become biologically essential.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10147.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Historical evolution of GK<sub>PID</sub>-mediated spindle orientation complex.</title><p>The center portion shows the phylogeny of Metazoa and closely related taxa.

All that was required to confer the protein's new function was a single mutation that revealed this molecular surface, apparently by changing the protein’s conformational flexibility. In this way, the physical simplicity of an interaction between ancient molecules set the stage for the easy evolution of a novel molecular complex and, in turn, a cellular function that now plays an important role in the complex biology of multicellular animals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Phylogenetics, ancestral protein reconstruction, homology modeling, and ortholog identification</title><p>Annotated protein sequences of 224 guanylate kinases and GK<sub>PID</sub>s were downloaded from UniPROTKB/TrEMBL, GenBank, the JGI genome browser, and Ensemble databases.

Ancestral protein sequences and their posterior probability distributions were inferred by the ML/empirical Bayes method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 1995</xref>), assuming the ML phylogeny and the best-fit model, using PAML v3.13 and Lazarus software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanson-Smith et al., 2010</xref>). Average probabilities were calculated across all GK sites except those containing indels. Plausible alternative non-ML states were defined as those with posterior probability &gt;0.20. Alternate ancestral sequences at each node were prepared containing the ML state at all unambiguously reconstructed sites and the state with the second highest posterior probability at all ambiguously reconstructed sites. Sequences of reconstructed proteins Anc-gk<sub>dup,</sub> Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub>, and Anc-GK2<sub>PID</sub> were deposited in Genbank with identifiers KP068002, KP068003, and KP068004, respectively.</p><p>Homology modeling was performed with MODELLER software using the automodel single comparison class. 1GKY and 1EX6 were used as the template for Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> and 3UAT for Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub>. For each protein, 10 homology models were prepared, and that with the lowest DOPE score was used as the best model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eswar et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Choanoflagellate and filasterean genes orthologous to metazoan guanylate kinase, Dlg, Pins, and KHC-73 proteins were identified by using the NCBI BLAST tool using <italic>Homo sapiens or Drosophila melanogaster</italic> protein sequences as queries. For each search, the top hit in the target species was verified with a reciprocal BLAST search against the query genome. Domain architecture similarity was assessed using the SMART domain recognition tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schultz et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Protein expression</title><p>DNA sequences coding for reconstructed ancestral proteins and optimized for <italic>E. coli</italic> codon bias were synthesized (Genscript) and then inserted into pBH plasmid vector with a hexa-His tag for <italic>E. coli</italic> expression at 20°C. Protein purification was carried out using sequential NiNTA affinity, anion exchange, and size-exclusion chromatographies. All proteins eluted as predicted monomers from the size-exclusion column at purity &gt;95% by Coomassie staining of an SDS–PAGE gel. Proteins were concentrated using Vivaspin concentrators (Sigma-Aldrich), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C in buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Guanylate kinase activity assay</title><p>We used a coupled enzyme assay, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 1978</xref>), which quantifies release of ADP in the guanylate kinase-catalyzed reaction by coupling it to pyruvate kinase- and lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reactions and measuring the consequent oxidation of NADH by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, which we measured on a Tecan Safire plate reader. Guanylate kinase enzyme was at 50–200 nM in assay buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM sodium phosphoenolpyruvate, 300 mM NADH, 4 mM ATP, and 100 units pyruvate kinase and 100 units lactate dehydrogenase). Initial GMP concentrations ranged from 500 nM to 1 mM. The reaction was initiated by adding GMP and briefly mixing. Reactions were carried out at 30°C and measured 30 times at 15s intervals. Data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Reaction rates are plotted as initial rate of ADP production.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Protein binding assays</title><p>Binding of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Pins was assayed by fluorescence anisotropy on a Tecan Sapphire plate reader equipped with automatic polarizers using default settings for anisotropy assays. A NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal FITC-labeled peptide (GVRVRRQ(pS)MEQLDLIKITPD, Genscript) of the fly Pins-Linker peptide (0.25 µM) was incubated with increasing concentrations of GK protein in phospho-buffered saline solution with 1mM DTT. A one-site binding model was used to fit the data and infer binding affinity in Graphpad Prism. Attempts to measure affinity of the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> GK<sub>PID</sub> for the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> Pins linker using MBP pull-down experiments were unsuccessful under a variety of assay conditions due to loss of the immobilized MBP-Pins fusion protein upon addition of GK<sub>PID</sub>. Ancestral Pins peptides were not reconstructed because Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> and Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> both correspond to gene duplications rather than speciation events; no nodes precisely corresponding to the same genomes would exist on a Pins phylogeny. Our inferences are therefore limited to the capacity of ancestral Anc-gk<sub>dup</sub> and Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> to bind to Pins peptides found in extant animals.</p><p>For GST pull-downs, we expressed GST fused to the 20-residue Pins linker of <italic>S. rosetta</italic> (PRGSKTGEVEQFTIDDSDD) or <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (GVRVRRQSMEQLDLIKITPD) and MBP-tagged GK<sub>PID</sub> proteins from the same species. Proteins were expressed separately in BL21(DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures and purified with glutathione or amylose agarose, respectively. All four proteins expressed in soluble form. The GST-Pins fusion was left attached to the resin and incubated with MBP-tagged GK<sub>PID</sub> , followed by three washes. Bound GK<sub>PID</sub> was eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and visualized using Western electrophoresis and an anti-MBP antibody (Qiagen); unbound GK<sub>PID</sub> from the final wash was visualized by electrophoresis and Coommassie staining. Binding reactions were performed in the absence and presence of Aurora A kinase (Calbiochem), which is necessary for phosphorylation of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Pins linker at residue S436 and subsequent GK<sub>PID</sub> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Spindle orientation assays</title><p>Maintenance of S2 cells, construction of expression plasmids, and cell-adhesion/spindle orientation assays were performed as detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2011</xref>). S2 cells were transfected with constructs coding for a FLAG- or HA-tagged GK protein and for a Pins-GFP-Echinoid fusion protein, using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and 0.4–1 μg total DNA for 24–48 hr. Endogenous Dlg was knocked down using RNAi: transfected cells were incubated for 1 hr in serum-free media containing approximately 1 μg RNAi followed by 72 hr in normal growth media. Protein expression was induced by adding 500 μM CuSO4 for 24 hr. Cell-adhesion clustering was induced by constant rotation at approximately 175 rpm for 1–3 hr. Pins fusion protein was visualized by fluorescence (excitation 488 nm, emission 509 nm). Mitotic spindles were visualized using rat anti-tubulin (Abcam 1:500) and goat anti-rat conjugated to Alexa 555 (Life Technologies, 1:500). GK was visualized using mouse anti-FLAG or anti-HA (Sigma 1:500) and chicken anti-mouse:Alexa 647 (Life Technologies 1:200); histones were visualized using rabbit antiphospho-histone3 (Upstate 1:8000) and donkey anti-rabbit:Alexa 488 (Life Technologies, 1:500). For immunostaining, clustered cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in buffer (0.01% saponin plus 0.1% albumin diluted in phosphate-buffered saline). Slides were subsequently washed and fluorescently linked secondary antibodies were added for 2 hr at room temperature (RT). Finally, slides were again washed and mounted using Vectashield Hardset medium (Vector Laboratories). All images were collected using a Biorad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope with a 1.4NA 60× objective. Spindle angles were measured in ~20 cells for each condition and their distribution displayed in a radial histogram.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Choanoflagellate culture, spindle orientation assays, and gene ortholog inference</title><p>Growth medium was prepared in artificial sea water. <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cultures (ATCC 50818) consisting primarily of chain colonies and slow swimmers were maintained by passaging 2 ml of culture into 18 ml fresh medium every day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King et al., 2009</xref>).

Log phase <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells were treated with 0.33 micromolar Nocodazole (Sigma M1404) for 18 hr at RT. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 x g, and washed thrice in artificial sea water to remove drug. Cells were allowed to recover for 30, 45, or 60 min at RT before fixation. Approximately 0.1 ml of cells were applied to poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates and left to attach for 30 min. Cells were fixed for 5 min with 0.2 ml 6% acetone, and then for 20 min with 0.2 ml 4% formaldehyde. Acetone and formaldehyde were diluted in artificial seawater, pH 8.0. Wells were washed gently four times with 1 ml washing buffer (100 mM PIPES at pH 6.9, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) and incubated for 30 min in 1 ml blocking buffer (washing buffer with 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 0.15 ml blocking buffer for 1 hr, washed four times with 0.2 ml of blocking buffer, and incubated for 1 hr in the dark with fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:1000 in blocking buffer, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse, and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit; Invitrogen). Wells were washed thrice with washing buffer, blocked with 0.2 ml DAPI at 1 μg/ml for 5 min, and washed twice more. The following primary antibodies were used: Mouse monoclonal antibody against β-tubulin (E7, 1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and nuclear pore complexes (1:100, Covance ab24609). Images were taken with a 63× oil immersion objective on a Leica DMI6000 B inverted compound microscope and Leica DFC350 FX camera.</p><p>The spindle angle for individual, non-colonial <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells was measured from images of cells fixed and stained for tubulin and DNA as described above. Only mitotic cells with clear flagella, spindle poles, and cell body axis position were selected for analysis. We measured the acute angle between the spindle axis (defined as a line connecting the two spindle poles) and a line extending from the cell body's centroid to the midpoint between the duplicated flagella's basal bodies. The ImageJ software package was used to calculate the centroid and angle.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Aaron Turkewitz, Vincent Lynch, and Jamie Bridgham, Dave Anderson, and other members of the Thornton laboratory for comments on the manuscript.

Your manuscript has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel as Senior editor, Jesse Bloom as Reviewing editor, as well as by two anonymous reviewers with substantial expertise in spindle positioning.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We find considerable value in your work. It is remarkable that one or two ancestral mutations are sufficient to convert GK<sub>PID</sub> from a guanylate kinase to a protein capable of binding PINS in a species (e.g. <italic>Drosophila</italic>) greatly diverged from this ancestor. Your biophysical characterization of this reconstructed protein and your assessment of this characterization to uncertainty in the reconstruction are major pluses. This study represents a notable advance over most existing studies of protein evolution since it examines the wholesale repurposing of a protein rather than an incremental shift in activity or specificity.</p><p>We also appreciate the innovative mix of approaches that you have used to elucidate some of the steps towards the evolution of organized multicellularity. This is a complex and multi-factorial evolutionary transition, and a better understanding of its basis is of great interest.</p><p>Our major critique is that the broader interpretation is overstated in terms of the centrality of KHC73-DLG-PINS to spindle orientation in all animals and multicellularity in general, and in terms of external orientation being a unique novelty of animals. We also think that some clarification / caveats are needed regarding the experiments on positioning in Choanoflagellates. Finally, we think the manuscript would benefit from more discussion of some puzzling aspects of the co-evolution of GK<sub>PID</sub> and PINS (or lack thereof).</p><p><italic>eLife</italic> attempts to provide reviews that do not require new work beyond the scope of the original manuscript. It is our opinion that the critiques can be addressed largely or completely by textual changes – even if your work leaves many questions about the evolution of spindle orientation unanswered, it is a sufficient step forward to be of interest to the <italic>eLife</italic> readership. However, please take seriously the task of making revisions that address the critiques below. Depending on the revisions, I may be able to editorially evaluate a revised manuscript myself, or I may have to consult with reviewers who have more expertise in spindle orientation.</p><p>Major critiques:</p><p>1) The implication that all oriented cell division in animals is due to GK<sub>PID</sub> is overstated. Nearly all of the data and cited literature is specific to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> it appears that the PINS of Worm (presumably <italic>C. elegans</italic>?) doesn't even have the phosphoserine posited to be recognized by GK<sub>PID</sub>, although worms obviously orient their spindles. Other pathways have been implicated in oriented cell division. One reviewer notes that, &quot;cell division in early embryos follows Hertwig's rule (i.e. that cells tend to divide along their long access) and it has been argued that Myosin activity is the primary determinant of the division plane in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuroblasts. I am unaware of evidence that those two phenomena are primarily caused by GK<sub>PID</sub>.&quot; Another reviewer notes that, &quot;Even in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell induced cell polarity assay, the function of this complex is mostly studied in the context of TPR-deleted PINS. TPR-deleted PINS cannot bind Mud (NuMA). The PINS/MUD pathway IS highly conserved in multiple phyla. I would be happy if the authors could cite high quality data for a spindle positioning role for KHC73:DLG:PINS in ONE additional phylum other than Arthropoda. There are many papers on the mammalian scribbled polarity complex. Polarity is not the same thing as spindle orientation.&quot; We do not expect you to undertake new experiments to test the essentiality of GK<sub>PID</sub> for oriented cell division across all animals, but it is absolutely essential to make substantial textual changes to reflect the fact that although current evidence indicates that GK<sub>PID</sub> is an important mechanism for spindle orientation in some organisms, neither your data nor the literature currently support it being a universal mechanism in metazoans.</p><p>2) The claims about the flagellar basal body serving as the microtubule organizing center in Choanoflagellates seem overstated, particularly as this is a substantially new claim. First, this section should include data about the number of cells analyzed. Second, the following statement seems to be more of a hypothesis than a fully supported claim: &quot;During mitosis, the flagellar basal body duplicates; the daughter bodies migrate symmetrically away from the cell's basal pole and then serve as microtubule organizing centers for assembling the spindle and orienting it perpendicular to the A-B axis, a process that may or may not involve GK<sub>PID</sub>. Because this mode of spindle orientation relative to the cellular axis occurs in both colonial and non-colonial <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells, it must involve internal marks imposed by the cell's polarity rather than cues from neighboring cells.&quot; Unless you are prepared to undertake substantial new experiments to fully demonstrate that the basal bodies are in fact the organizing centers, this statement and similar ones should be dramatically tempered.</p><p>3) Your work clearly demonstrates that GK<sub>PID</sub> evolved the latent capacity to bind PINS long before it appears to have actually been paired with a PINS that it could bind. We do not think this is an artifact, as your ancestral reconstruction samples broadly across species and the result is robust to the reconstruction – so this somewhat puzzling finding does appear to be true. It may be impossible to explain exactly why this occurred, but more discussion of this conundrum is warranted. Why should the ancestral and Choanoflagellate GK<sub>PID</sub> bind a <italic>Drosophila</italic> PINS but not the PINS in that same organism? This question is going to come up in the mind of every reader, so your best guesses at plausible explanations would be helpful.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>The authors write: &quot;[…] for the evolution of a new protein function crucial to the emergence of animal multicellularity.&quot; While GK<sub>PID</sub> is certainly very important in at least some modern animals, that does not mean that it is important for the &quot;emergence&quot; of animal multicellularity. This statement should be clarified, qualified, or removed.</p><p>The author's write: &quot;[…] Spindle orientation itself is not a metazoan novelty; indeed, most eukaryotes orient the mitotic spindle, but most appear to do so relative to the cell's internal structure.&quot; It's also true that in many metazoan cell divisions the spindle is responding to &quot;the cell's internal structure&quot;. Indeed, in many contexts that internal structure may be the distribution of GK<sub>PID</sub> proteins. Of course, that distribution may be controlled by external signals.</p><p>The authors write: &quot;Orientation of the mitotic spindle relative to an externally induced molecular mark was an essential novelty in the evolution of animals and the emergence of a higher level of biological organization – the multicellular individual&quot;. What is their evidence that there are no single-celled Eukaryotes that orient their spindle relative to external cues? One could certainly imagine some single-cell organisms might orient their spindle based on environmental cues. The authors should remove or better justify their statement that this is &quot;an essential novelty&quot;.</p><p>It might be helpful to include a brief discussion of the orientation of cell division in plants, which are multicellular organisms that do not use GK<sub>PID</sub>.</p><p>The actual sequence of the PINS peptide used in anisotropy assays is not given anywhere; how does it relate to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>? This is actually very important to clarify.</p><p>The amino acid sequences of the GK domains used in biochemical experiments should be given.</p><p>Since all the GK proteins were purified by gel filtration, showing the purity and gel filtration profiles of all the GK domains purified as Figure supplements would be appropriate. Aggregated protein would be one artifactual reason for binding PINS linker peptide in anisotropy assays while having no guanylyl kinase activity.</p><p>A clearer description of the reconstruction of DLGs used in the S2 cell assay would be helpful.</p><p>Is it really necessary to introduce the acronym of APR for ancestral protein reconstruction? There are already a lot of gene name acronyms.</p><p>Does the choanoflagellate PINS have the putative phospho-serine 436?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10147.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major critiques:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The implication that all oriented cell division in animals is due to GK<sub>PID</sub> is overstated.

We have modified the text in numerous ways to be more cautious on this point and to base our claims more solidly on what is known in the literature. Recent work indicates that the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex coordinates spindle orientation not only in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts but also in both mammals and birds and in other cell types, including epithelia from numerous tissues; we have added discussion of these citations to the manuscript. The role of the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex in spindle orientation in both protostomes and deuterostomes and in multiple cell types suggests an ancient and general role. However, this does not mean that the role of GK<sub>PID</sub> is the universal mediator of spindle orientation in all animal cells: other mechanisms may be important in certain taxonomic lineages and cell types, and we have changed the text to explicitly address these points. We have also discussed the role of other molecules and pathways in spindle orientation.</p><p>More generally, we have gone through the text and have changed our wording to dispel the impression that GK<sub>PID</sub> complex is the sole driver of spindle orientation in all animals and all cell types and to avoid the implication that the evolution of the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex explains all instances of spindle orientation in all animals.</p><p><italic>2) The claims about the flagellar basal body serving as the microtubule organizing center in Choanoflagellates seem overstated, particularly as this is a substantially new claim. First, this section should include data about the number of cells analyzed. Second, the following statement seems to be more of a hypothesis than a fully supported claim: &quot;During mitosis, the flagellar basal body duplicates; the daughter bodies migrate symmetrically away from the cell's basal pole and then serve as microtubule organizing centers for assembling the spindle and orienting it perpendicular to the A-B axis, a process that may or may not involve GK<sub>PID</sub>.

According to the description of mitosis in Leadbeater’s canonical book in the field, &quot;The flagellar and non-flagellar basal bodies separate, the latter moving towards the cell surface just beneath the plasma membrane. At this stage both basal bodies possess a ring of microtubules […] The two basal bodies move apart and become foci (poles) for the developing mitotic spindle.” (Leadbeater, p. 40, 2015). Leo Buss’ book The Evolution of Individuality also discusses the evidence for this mechanism in detail.</p><p>We have added these references to support this point. We have also softened the language claim to make clear that the scenario we propose for the ancient mode of spindle orientation is a hypothesis to be further tested. We also reorganized this section of the text to improve its clarity. As requested, we also included the number of choanoflagellate cells analyzed for both colonial and solitary spindle orientation (12 and 7, respectively).</p><p><italic>3) Your work clearly demonstrates that GK<sub>PID</sub> evolved the latent capacity to bind PINS long before it appears to have actually been paired with a PINS that it could bind. We do not think this is an artifact, as your ancestral reconstruction samples broadly across species and the result is robust to the reconstruction – so this somewhat puzzling finding does appear to be true.

This question is going to come up in the mind of every reader, so your best guesses at plausible explanations would be helpful.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is puzzling. We have addressed this point briefly in the text, acknowledging the surprising nature of the result and suggesting the possibility is that the surface of GK-<sub>PID</sub> that fortuitously binds <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins might be used to bind another structurally similar ligand, possibly an ancient one. Because whatever we say here would be very speculative, we did not go into much detail on this point.</p><p><italic>Minor comments: The authors write: &quot;[…] for the evolution of a new protein function crucial to the emergence of animal multicellularity.&quot; While GK<sub>PID</sub> is certainly very important in at least some modern animals, that does not mean that it is important for the &quot;emergence&quot; of animal multicellularity. This statement should be clarified, qualified, or removed.</italic> </p><p>We agree and have rewritten this paragraph.</p><p><italic>The author's write: &quot;[…] Spindle orientation itself is not a metazoan novelty; indeed, most eukaryotes orient the mitotic spindle, but most appear to do so relative to the cell's internal structure.&quot; It's also true that in many metazoan cell divisions the spindle is responding to &quot;the cell's internal structure&quot;. Indeed, in many contexts that internal structure may be the distribution of GK<sub>PID</sub> proteins. Of course, that distribution may be controlled by external signals.</italic> </p><p>This is certainly true. We have attempted to be more precise by revising our statement to read: &quot;Spindle orientation itself is not a metazoan novelty; indeed, most eukaryotes – even unicellular ones – orient the mitotic spindle, but most appear to do so relative to the cell’s internal structure alone rather than in response to cues from adjacent cells.&quot;</p><p><italic>The authors write: &quot;Orientation of the mitotic spindle relative to an externally induced molecular mark was an essential novelty in the evolution of animals and the emergence of a higher level of biological organization – the multicellular individual&quot;.

One could certainly imagine some single-cell organisms might orient their spindle based on environmental cues. The authors should remove or better justify their statement that this is &quot;an essential novelty&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We have removed the sentence to which the reviewer objected and have emphasized instead that cues from adjacent cells per se – rather than external cues more generally – are important for tissue organization in animals. We have also avoided calling this phenomenon a novelty.</p><p><italic>It might be helpful to include a brief discussion of the orientation of cell division in plants, which are multicellular organisms that do not use GK<sub>PID</sub>.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the text to acknowledge that multicellularity evolved repeatedly in different lineages and that key cellular functions typically have different underlying mechanisms. We did not go into detail about the specific mechanisms of spindle orientation in plants, in the interest of keeping the paper concise.</p><p><italic>The actual sequence of the PINS peptide used in anisotropy assays is not given anywhere; how does it relate to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>? This is actually very important to clarify.</italic> </p><p>We have provided this sequence in the Methods section, and we say explicitly that it is the peptide from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><p><italic>The amino acid sequences of the GK domains used in biochemical experiments should be given.</italic> </p><p>These sequences have been deposited in GenBank; we added the identifiers to manuscript in the Methods section.
