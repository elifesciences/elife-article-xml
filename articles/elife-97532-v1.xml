However, some limitations remain to be resolved, such as the short-lived induced immune response and certain adverse effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new vaccines that address these issues. While live-attenuated vaccines are a highly effective modality, they pose a risk of adverse effects, including virulence reversion. In the current study, we constructed a live-attenuated vaccine candidate, BK2102, combining naturally occurring virulence-attenuating mutations in the <italic>NSP14</italic>, <italic>NSP1</italic>, spike, and <italic>ORF7-8</italic> coding regions. Intranasal inoculation with BK2102 induced humoral and cellular immune responses in Syrian hamsters without apparent tissue damage in the lungs, leading to protection against a SARS-CoV-2 D614G and an Omicron BA.5 strains. The neutralizing antibodies induced by BK2102 persisted for up to 364 days, which indicated that they confer long-term protection against infection. Furthermore, we confirmed the safety of BK2102 using transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) that are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. BK2102 did not kill the Tg mice, even when virus was administered at a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> plaque-forming units (PFUs), while 10<sup>2</sup> PFU of the D614G strain or an attenuated strain lacking the furin cleavage site of the spike was sufficient to kill mice. These results suggest that BK2102 is a promising live-vaccine candidate strain that confers long-term protection without significant virulence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>live-attenuated vaccine</kwd><kwd>non-clinical study</kwd><kwd>intranasal vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004206</institution-id><institution>The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ebina</surname><given-names>Hirotaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20pc0101047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ebina</surname><given-names>Hirotaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP23fa627002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikawa</surname><given-names>Masahito</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Central institute for experimental animals</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP23fa627006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikawa</surname><given-names>Masahito</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The novel live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 nasal vaccine candidate is highly safe, induces robust cellular and mucosal immunity, and generates long-lasting neutralizing antibody titers.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>mRNA- and adenovirus vector-based vaccines have been successfully developed and used in clinical practice against SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that caused the COVID-19 pandemic. These vaccines were highly effective, inducing robust humoral and cellular immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Polack et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, certain drawbacks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines remain to be addressed, including adverse effects, such as thrombosis, fever, and fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>). Further, several boosters of the mRNA vaccines have been required to reactivate the immune response and increase efficacy against variants. New and improved vaccine modalities are therefore required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>In general, live-attenuated vaccines are among the most effective vaccine modalities as they induce humoral and cellular immunity both systemically and locally (e.g., within mucosal surfaces), conferring protection against various infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoft et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the live-attenuated poliovirus vaccine developed in 1962 was highly effective in reducing the spread of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sabin, 1985</xref>). Nevertheless, this modality has certain disadvantages, the most concerning being the risk of reversion to a virulent state as a result of mutations generated during viral replication in vivo. In fact, vaccine-derived paralytic polio was reported 38 years after the vaccine had been introduced, representing a threat to uninfected populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macklin et al., 2020</xref>). Advances in our basic knowledge of viruses have enabled the design of attenuated strains, such as that in the new type 2 oral polio vaccine (nOPV2), which is associated with a reduced risk of reversion due to genome modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yeh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yeh et al., 2023</xref>). nOPV2 was recently approved by the World Health Organization, indicating that live-attenuated vaccines that overcome the risk of reversion are still in demand.</p><p>Various mechanisms leading to reduced pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported. A cold-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain was isolated through passaging at low temperatures, eventually showing an attenuated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seo and Jang, 2020</xref>). We also reported a temperature-sensitive (TS) strain with low pathogenicity and sufficient immunogenicity in vivo, achieved through the introduction of multiple TS-related mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to temperature sensitivity, several naturally occurring mutants exhibit attenuated phenotypes. Passaging SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells facilitates isolation of strains with deletions in the furin cleavage site (FCS) (PRRAR) at the S1/S2 junction within the spike protein, resulting in low proliferation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peacock et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a mutant that lacks four amino acids (PRRA) within the FCS did not induce weight loss in hamsters during challenge experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lau et al., 2020</xref>). Reportedly, S1/S2 cleavage is essential for TMPRSS2-mediated entry into host cells, and the deletion in the FCS is thought to reduce viral growth in lung cells, which express more TMPRSS2 than the cells of the upper respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lau et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, partial loss of <italic>NSP1</italic>, which correlates with a lower viral load and less severe symptoms of infection in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, or of <italic>ORF8</italic>, which has been reported as associated with milder infection in humans, were also associated with attenuated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ueno et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Young et al., 2020</xref>). Recovery of lost segments of viral genomes carrying deletions is more difficult than the reversion of amino acid substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bull, 2015</xref>). In this study, we designed and constructed live-attenuated vaccine candidates through a combination of substitutions and deletions involved in attenuation and reduced risk of virulent reversion. We then evaluated the candidate’s immunogenicity and safety in animal models, providing evidence that BK2102 is a promising vaccine candidate that confers prolonged protection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of the live-attenuated vaccine candidate strains</title><p>Several genomic alterations are involved in the attenuation of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we focused on deletions at three different sites within the viral genome: FCS within the spike protein, NSP1, and ORF7-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While loss of the FCS inhibits virus-cell fusion mediated by TMPRSS2 in lung cells, partial deletion of NSP1 has been shown to impair viral proliferation in vitro, and the lack of ORF8 has been associated with milder symptoms and disease outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ueno et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Young et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zinzula, 2021</xref>). We previously obtained SARS-CoV-2 TS strains showing diverse attenuated phenotypes and revealed that NSP3 L445F, NSP14 G248V, G416S, and A504V as well as NSP16 V67I were substitutions responsible for such phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). Each substitution conferred some advantage for the development of an attenuated vaccine candidate with restricted proliferative capacity in deep regions of the body, such as lungs and brain. In addition, the presence of deletions is generally considered to confer a lower risk of reversion to a wild-type genotype compared to amino acid substitutions. To this end, we constructed three candidates by combining several of the above-described mutations to design a safe live-attenuated vaccine strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The three candidates were inoculated locally into hamsters via the nasal route to mimic a natural infection. The immunogenicity of candidates 1 and 3 was much greater than that of candidate 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Candidate 1, which has three deletions in the viral genome and contains three TS-responsible substitutions in NSP14, induced neutralizing antibodies when inoculated at a dose of 10<sup>3</sup> plaque-forming unit (PFU). Candidate 2, which has TS-related substitutions in both NSP3 and NSP14 and three deletions, and Candidate 3, which has only two deletions, were speculated to be excessively attenuated or to have a higher risk of virulent reversion. Taking these observations into consideration, we selected Candidate 1 for the vaccine, hereafter referred to as BK2102. The growth dynamics of BK2102 was evaluated at 32°C and 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It proliferated similarly to the wild-type B-1 strain at 32°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but the infectious virus titer was significantly lower compared to that of the wild-type B-1 strain 1 day post-infection at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, BK2102 showed a severe TS phenotype but could be amplified by incubating infected cells at 32°C, which would also facilitate the manufacturing process.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Growth dynamics of the vaccine candidate strain at different temperatures.</title><p>Vero cells were infected with the wild-type parent B-1 (D614G) or the BK2102 vaccine candidate strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.01, and virus titers in the supernatants were determined for samples harvested every day, after incubating at 32°C (<bold>A</bold>) or 37°C (<bold>B</bold>).

For example, a reduction in neutralizing antibodies was observed in humans after 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). In hamsters, these were undetectable after 250 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Machado et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated the persistence of the immune response induced by BK2102 using a hamster model. We measured neutralizing antibody titers for up to 364 days after inoculation with BK2102. The titer peaks were observed 28 days after the first inoculation and slightly decreased, but were maintained until 364 days post-inoculation with a dose of 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU. For example, the neutralizing antibody titer in the sera of hamsters inoculated with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU was 2<sup>8</sup> at 28 days and 2<sup>5</sup> at 364 days post-inoculation. Also, 2 of the 10 hamsters inoculated at a dose of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU showed neutralizing antibody titers below the detection limit from the beginning, and those of another hamster in the same dose group began to decrease gradually from day 224 and fell below the detection limit on day 364 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the neutralizing antibody titers in hamsters inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU did not exhibit such a decrease during the evaluation period. Remarkably, a single dose of BK2102 was sufficient to induce long-lasting immunity, and there was no need for booster immunization 28 days after the first inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we evaluated cellular immune responses following inoculation with BK2102. Antigen-specific IFN-γ and IL-4 production in spleen cells from inoculated hamsters was measured via ELISA after in vitro re-stimulation with spike or nucleocapsid peptides. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, spike peptide-specific IFN-γ production significantly increased in the splenocytes of BK2102-inoculated hamsters, as did the nucleocapsid peptide-specific IFN-γ production, although in this case it did not reach statistical significance. IL-4 production was significantly increased by spike-peptide stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). IFN-γ-producing cells were also detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In correlation with the ELISA results, significant induction of spike peptide-specific IFN-γ-producing cells were detected in the splenocytes of BK2102-inoculated hamsters and the nucleocapsid peptide-specific IFN-γ-producing cells were also increased.</p><p>Moreover, a 10-μg-dose of a conventional mRNA vaccine prepared in-house, expressing spike protein of D614G strain of SARS-CoV-2, was intramuscularly injected into hamsters and compared to BK2102. Neutralizing antibody titers against the D614G strain showed no significant difference between the BK2102-inoculated group and the mRNA vaccine group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Notably, under conditions that induced equal serum neutralizing antibody titers in hamsters, higher levels of spike-specific IgA in nasal wash samples were induced by BK2102 than by the conventional mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, we qualitatively analyzed the spike-specific IgG subclasses (IgG1 and IgG2/3) in hamsters to evaluate the nature of the immune response induced by BK2102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). When we inoculated BK2102 and our mRNA vaccine, total IgG antibodies were detected in both groups. IgG2/3 antibodies were detected in the sera of BK2102-inoculated hamsters, but we could not detect IgG1. On the other hand, mRNA-vaccinated hamsters showed both IgG subclasses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As other studies have demonstrated that aluminum adjuvant preferentially induces a Th2 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marrack et al., 2009</xref>), we also administered recombinant spike protein with alum adjuvant as a control. The result was the same since BK2102-inoculated hamsters showed only production of IgG2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). IL-4 production and the presence of IgG1 reflects a Th2 response, while IFN-γ production and IgG2/3 are indicative of a Th1 response in hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kushawaha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ploquin et al., 2013</xref>). Our results therefore suggest that BK2102 mainly induced a Th1 immune response in hamsters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BK2102 induced protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection</title><p>Next, we performed challenge experiments with the SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain, BA.5 or gamma variants in order to evaluate whether the immune responses induced by BK2102 would protect against infection.

One hamster in the 10<sup>3</sup> PFU dose group showed detectable levels of infectious virus following D614G challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This result was consistent with the undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies in this animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The virus titer in the lung and nasal wash of one animal in the 10<sup>3</sup> PFU dose group was 6.4 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/g and 3.8 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, respectively, and the mean virus titers in the naïve group was 6.1 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/g and 3.7 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, respectively. Although the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies against the BA.5 variant was below the limit of detection in all hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right), no infectious virus was detected following challenge with the BA.5 variant in most of the vaccinated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>).

Lung tissue damage after the viral challenge was also evaluated in the hamsters. The inflammation score of hamsters inoculated with BK2102 was lower than that of naïve hamsters, regardless of the strain/variant used for the challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and H</xref>, respectively).

In addition, virulent reversion may occur during replication in vivo. Therefore, we evaluated the risk of transmission and reversion to virulence by passaging in vivo using hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 A50-18 is a previously isolated TS strain, in which substitutions within the NSP14 protein alone account for the TS phenotype, without the need for deletions, such as those in NSP1, spike, or other accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). The viral genome was detected in all nasal wash specimens from A50-18 strain-infected hamsters during primary infection, and an increase in this amount was observed in subsequently passaged samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which correlated with progressive weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). When we confirmed the sequence of the viruses detected in samples, we observed that the TS-responsible substitutions in NSP14 had reverted to the wild-type sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

We established a mouse line expressing hACE2 driven by the CAG promoter, and these mice were used to evaluate the safety of BK2102 live-attenuated vaccine candidate. hACE2 expression was detected not only in the respiratory tract, but also in various tissues such as the central nervous system, heart, skeletal muscle, digestive system (except the small intestine), spleen, and testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We evaluated the survival rates and body weight of Tg mice infected with various SARS-CoV-2 strains. All of the mice died after weight loss by infection with the D614G strain and even with the FCS deleted B-1 (B-1 ΔFCS) strain, previously established attenuated phenotype, within 6 days after receiving a dose of 10<sup>2</sup> PFU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Meanwhile, a higher survival rate was observed in mice infected with the L50-33 and A50-18 strains, which were previously isolated TS and live-attenuated strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>), even at a dose of 10<sup>5</sup> PFU. However, one mouse in each group infected with 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of the L50-33 strain died 10 days post-infection that is 4 days later than those in the D614G strain-infected group. This time lag before death was expected as the virus could have reverted during replication in vivo, being able to grow in deeper regions of the body. Thus, we evaluated the presence of infectious virus in the lungs and brains of mice that died following infection with the D614G, B-1 ΔFCS, and L50-33 strains. Infectious virus titers in the lungs were approximately 2.40–5.64 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/g, while those in the brains were higher, at approximately 5.75–8.69 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/g (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We noticed that mice exhibiting head nodding, intense running, jumping and repeated falling died despite a generally mild inflammation in the lungs at necropsy (data not shown). These results suggest that Tg mice were killed due to replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain rather than in the lungs. Sanger sequencing analysis of viruses in the lungs and brains of mice that died following infection with the L50-33 strain revealed that the 445F substitution in NSP3, responsible for the TS phenotype of this strain, had reverted to the wild-type amino acid leucine (TTT → TTG), which is the same in the D614G and B-1 ΔFCS strains (CTT, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These results suggest that the mice died due to viral proliferation in the brain, where a small virus population lost its temperature sensitivity, becoming virulent. This mouse is a highly susceptible model of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection able to detect a few TS revertant viruses. In contrast to L50-33 with the NSP3-based TS phenotype, A50-18, harboring three TS-responsible substitutions in NSP14, did not kill any mice. Moreover, in the case of BK2102, no mice died or lost weight following infection, even at a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> PFU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, respectively).

Deletions within viral genes are less prone to reversion to the wild-type genotype, and TS-associated substitutions restrict viral dissemination to deep or warmer regions of the body, including the brain, which makes them an attractive backbone for developing safe live-attenuated vaccines. Our BK2102 vaccine candidate was designed with three deletions in addition to TS-associated substitutions.</p><p>We previously reported that TS strains replicate only in the anterior regions of the nasal cavity and do not proliferate in the posterior areas or lungs of hamsters. However, these isolated TS strains posed a risk of reversion to virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). K18-hACE2 Tg mice have been shown to die after infection with several SARS-CoV-2 strains due to viral proliferation in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Natekar et al., 2022</xref>). To better assess the safety of BK2102, we generated and used CAG-hACE2 Tg mice in addition to hamsters. The TS strains (L50-33 and A50-18) showed an attenuated phenotype in this mouse model, emphasizing the ability of TS to limit viral replication and restrict replication-permissive regions by temperature. The TS-responsible substitutions in NSP14 were more stable than those in NSP3, as L50-33 caused the death of one mouse in each of the dose groups tested, whereas A50-18 did not. Additionally, infectious viruses lacking TS mutations were detected in the central nervous system and respiratory tracts of mice that died following L50-33 infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These findings suggest that our mouse model is particularly suitable for assessing safety and evaluating TS strains’ entry into the nervous system as it enables the detection of even a small population of revertant viruses. This animal model also addresses regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection via the intranasal route causing central nervous system damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>BK2102 did not proliferate in the brains of Tg mice even at a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> PFU, which was 10,000 times higher than the dose that killed mice infected with the D614G or B-1 ΔFCS strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Importantly, BK2102 was not detected during passaging in vivo using naïve hamsters, probably due to the multiple defective mutations that controlled replication in the host animal, preventing sufficient proliferation for transmission. In contrast, the A50-18 strain, with a genetic background similar to BK2102 but lacking the three deletion mutations, showed an attenuated phenotype during primary infection, but reverted to virulence during replication in hamsters, leading to transmission of the virulent strain to naive animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We hypothesized that even if TS-related substitutions are lost during primary infection, the remaining deletion mutations in BK2102 ensure low replication efficiency, preventing transmission. Indeed, mutations in the FCS coding region have been reported to reduce proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sasaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2021a</xref>) and prevent transmission in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peacock et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our vaccine candidate BK2102 induced humoral and cellular immune responses in hamsters, and animals were protected against challenge with the heterologous BA.5 variant, even though the neutralizing titer in serum was below the limit of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right). The nucleocapsid proteins of many coronaviruses are highly immunogenic and are abundantly expressed in infected cells, making them effective targets for antigen-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dutta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hasanpourghadi et al., 2023</xref>). Studies have also reported the benefit of vaccination with the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, showing protective immunity in animal models vaccinated with the nucleocapsid protein alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Primard et al., 2023</xref>) or in combination with the spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiuppesi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hasanpourghadi et al., 2023</xref>). In our hamster study, we observed cellular immune responses against both the nucleocapsid and spike protein. BK2102 may induce a cellular immune response against various structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, providing protection against multiple variants. We also considered the potential induction of mucosal immunity. In this study, BK2102 induced spike-specific IgA in nasal wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Live-attenuated influenza vaccines have been reported to be effective against a broad range of variants due to the robust humoral and cellular immune responses they elicit, even in mucosal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thwaites et al., 2023</xref>). BK2102 was administered intranasally, and inhibition of onward transmission was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), similar to what was reported for the SARS-CoV-2 live-attenuated vaccine candidate sCPD9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nouailles et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, we assumed that BK2102 also induced a mucosal immune response in addition to systemic humoral and cellular immunity, contributing to protection against mutant strains and prevention of onward transmission to other animals.</p><p>The findings of this study should be interpreted in light of certain limitations. First, the limited availability of analytical reagents for hamster models restricted the detailed immunological characterization of the response. Additionally, it took time to gather preclinical data due to the space-related restrictions of BSL3 facilities, which delayed the clinical trials for BK2102 until many individuals had already acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2. It remains to be seen whether our candidate will be optimal for human use as the immunogenicity of live-attenuated vaccines is generally influenced by pre-existing immunity. Finally, species-related differences in susceptibility must also be considered. The minimum infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported as 10 TCID50 in hamsters and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindeboom et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenke et al., 2020</xref>), but 3.84 × 10<sup>4</sup> PFU in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnston et al., 2021</xref>). When we inoculated this candidate into monkeys, they were less susceptible than hamsters, requiring a very high titer and multiple doses to induce immunity. Therefore, the dosage for first-in-human trials should be carefully optimized. It is also important to note that live-attenuated vaccines are contraindicated in immunosuppressed individuals or those with chronic diseases, and BK2102 is not intended for these populations.</p><p>The key to developing live-attenuated vaccines lies in balancing immunogenicity and safety. Most live-attenuated vaccine candidates, such as sCPD9 and CoviLiv (which is in phase III clinical trial), have been evaluated with a primary focus on immunogenicity in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>). In this study, we rigorously assessed not only the immunogenicity, but also the safety of BK2102, demonstrating its superior safety profile. For example, sCPD9 and CoviLiv are attenuated by codon deoptimization or a combination of codon deoptimization and FCS deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trimpert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>). These strategies affect viral proliferation but not necessarily virulence. The TS-responsible substitutions in NSP14 included in BK2102 selectively restrict the infection site, reducing the likelihood of lung and brain infection and enhancing safety.</p><p>Our findings also indicated that the TS substitutions in BK2102 made it difficult to passage the virus in vivo, limiting its spread to the central nervous system. Although attenuated strains with amino acid substitutions pose a risk of reversion to virulence, combining multiple modifications related to diverse attenuated phenotypes may allow for the construction of safer live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Among these modifications, deletions are particularly useful in reducing the risk of reversion to virulence, and TS-responsible substitutions significantly limit viral replication in deep regions of the body. This strategy of combining multiple modifications could be effective for the development of live-attenuated vaccines against other viruses, such as the Japanese encephalitis and influenza viruses, which have been reported to replicate in the brain and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Desai et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weinheimer et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Vero cells (Cat# CCL-81) were purchased from ATCC and maintained in D-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL).

Biotinylated anti-Syrian hamster IgG1 Ab (Southern Biotech, Cat# 1940-08, 1/100 dilution), IgG2/3 subclass Ab (Southern Biotech, Cat# 1935-08, 1/200,000 dilution), and IgA Ab (Brookwood Biomedical, Cat# 3003a, 1/100 dilution) were used and detected with HRP-labeled streptavidin (Abcam, Cat# ab7403, 1/10,000 dilution). TMB one-component substrate and stopping solutions (Thermodics) were used for the chromogenic reaction, and the optical density (OD) was measured at 450–650 nm with a microplate reader. Endpoint titers of IgG were calculated based on a calibration curve using a five-parameter, nonlinear curve fitting. Samples for which the endpoint titers could be calculated were defined as ‘positive’, and the mean was calculated using only the titer of positive samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ELISPOT assay</title><p>Hamster IFN-γ ELISPOT was performed using the ELISpot Flex: Hamster IFN-γ (ALP) (MABTECH, Cat# 3102-2A) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MSIP plates (Millipore) were washed five times with sterile water, coated with Capture mAb (MTH21), and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Coated plates were washed five times with PBS, blocked for 30 min (at room temperature) with RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. 250,000 splenocytes were seeded in each well and stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleocapsid peptide pools, consisting mainly of 15-mer sequences with 11-amino-acid (aa) overlaps (Miltenyi Biotec). Negative controls for non-stimulated cells were included in the test. After stimulation for a day at 37 °C, the spots were detected with the detection mAb (MTH29-biotin) and Streptavidin-ALP. After drying the plate, spots were counted using the ImmunoSpot S5 (Cellular Technology Limited). The average number of spots in the two negative control wells was subtracted from each well stimulated with peptide pools. The result was shown as the difference in spot-forming cells (SFC)/10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes between the negative control and the peptide pool stimulated wells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>mRNA and LNP production process</title><p>A codon-optimized mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) S protein was in vitro synthesized and purified following the procedure of Moderna Therapeutics’ mRNA-1273 as reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hassett et al., 2019</xref>). The mRNA was encapsulated using a NanoAssemblr Ignite nanoparticle formulation system. The sample was subsequently concentrated to 1 µg/100 µL/dose using Amicon Ultra 4-100K, and filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane for in vivo use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Evaluation of immunogenicity in hamsters</title><p>The animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the approved protocols corresponding Osaka University’s Review Committees (approval no. R02-10) and BIKEN’s Review Committees (approval no. ZAE240126-290125-01). Four-week-old male Syrian hamsters were purchased from Japan SLC Inc After a 1-week housing period, they were first anesthetized via inhalation with 3% isoflurane, followed by intraperitoneal anesthesia with a combination of medetomidine, midazolam, and butorphanol (0.3, 4, and 5 mg/kg, respectively). 1000 or 1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU of BK2102 were administered intranasally in a volume of 20 μL to confine administration to the upper respiratory tract. To evaluate the humoral immune response, blood samples were collected from the facial vein using a lancet (MEDIpoint), and neutralizing antibody titers in the sera were measured as described above. In addition, to evaluate mucosal immunity, nasal wash samples were collected through a plastic catheter using two separate washes of 1 mL of PBS. Only one animal inoculated BK2102 once was not used for IgA measurement because the nasal wash was contaminated with blood. To evaluate the cellular immune response, 1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU of BK2102-inoculated hamsters were euthanized 1 week post-inoculation, and spleens were collected. The spleens were mechanically crushed with the piston of a syringe and passed through a cell strainer (100 μm). Cell suspensions were treated with RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend) to remove red blood cells, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The spleen cells were then suspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics at a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleocapsid peptide pools, consisting mainly of 15-mer sequences with 11- aa overlaps (Miltenyi Biotec). Negative controls for non-stimulated cells were included in the test. Stimulated cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 day, and supernatants were collected and stored at –80°C until use. IFN-γ and IL-4 were quantified with commercially available ELISA kits (MABTECH AB, Cat# 3102-1H-6 and FineTest, Cat# EHA0001, respectively) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Furthermore, IFN-γ-producing cells were identified after a 22 hr stimulation culture with spike or nucleocapsid peptide pools, and analyzed by ELISpot Flex (MABTECH AB). We also performed a challenge assay to investigate whether these immune responses were effective in protecting against other variants. Four weeks post-inoculation with 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> PFU or 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of BK2102, 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain, TY41-702 strain (Omicron variant BA.5) or gamma strain were used to challenge the hamsters through the intranasal route to target the lower respiratory tract. The weights of the hamsters were monitored daily, and they were euthanized 4 days after the challenge. Lungs were divided, cut into small pieces, and homogenized with a biomasher II device in 500 μL of D-MEM. Supernatants were collected as lung homogenates after centrifugation at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. Nasal wash specimens were obtained by flushing 1 mL of D-PBS into the nasal cavity from the trachea in the direction of the nose where it was collected. Infectious virus titers in these samples were evaluated using a PFA, as described above. To evaluate immune response persistence, hamsters inoculated with 1×10<sup>3</sup> PFU or 1×10<sup>4</sup> PFU of BK2102 were maintained for 364 days post-infection. Blood samples were collected from the facial vein using a lancet (MEDIpoint), and neutralizing antibody titers were measured. At 420 days after inoculation, a viral challenge assay was performed to evaluate whether the immunity contributing to infection protection was maintained. Hamsters were infected with 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain, and weight changes were monitored daily for 10 days post-infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Evaluation of immunogenicity in monkeys</title><p>The animal experiments were in line with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols of Hamri Co, Ltd. (#22-H115). Sixteen male and female cynomolgus monkeys, 2–3 years old, were purchased from Hamri Co, Ltd. After a 1-week acclimatization housing period, they were sedated with a mixture of ketamine (5 mg/kg) and xylazine (2 mg/kg) administered intramuscularly. Ten million PFU of BK2102 were inoculated intranasally in a volume of 1.6 mL. Four monkeys were inoculated with a single-dose of BK2102, and blood samples were collected at 0, 28, 35, and 42 days after inoculation from the radial vein, femoral vein, or abdominal vena cava using a syringe. Neutralizing antibody titers in the sera were measured as described above to evaluate the humoral immune response. Another 12 monkeys were inoculated with 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> PFU of BK2102 or the solvent, receiving three doses given at 2-week intervals. Blood samples were collected 42 days after the last inoculation, and neutralizing antibody titers in the sera were measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Evaluation of BK2102 pathogenicity in hamsters</title><p>The animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the approved protocols corresponding Osaka University’s Review Committees (approval no.

After acclimatization, 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of BK2102 or 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain were used for infection, as described above. These and naïve hamsters were euthanized 3 days post-infection. The heads and lungs were collected and fixed in 10% formalin. Sections of the head were prepared to expose different regions of the nasal cavity and were stained with H&amp;E or an immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining kit (Abcam, Cat# ab64261) using a SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD-specific antibody (Sino Biological, Cat# 40592-T62). The damage score of each section was defined as 0: not remarkable (&lt;10%); 1: minimal (10–50%); and 2: mild (50–70%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>In vivo passage of BK2102 in hamsters</title><p>The animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the approved protocols corresponding Osaka University’s Review Committees (approval no.

After a 1-week acclimatization period, 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of BK2102 or A50-18 strain (a TS mutant isolated in a previous report) in a volume of 20 μL were used to infect the hamsters intranasally. The hamsters were observed daily, and their body weights were measured at 0 and 3 days post-infection. At this point, hamsters were euthanized, and nasal wash specimens were collected with 500 μL D-PBS. After filtration through 0.45 μm and 0.22 μm filters, 100 μL were used to infect a new group of naive hamsters. The passage of inoculum was repeated three times, and nasal wash samples were collected at every passage. The viral genome in these nasal wash samples was quantified via qPCR, as described above. Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze the mutations introduced to generate an attenuated phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Generation of human ACE2-transgenic mice</title><p>The animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the approved protocols corresponding Osaka University’s Review Committees (approval nos.

The transgene fragment was excised using <italic>Sac</italic>I and <italic>Pac</italic>I and gel-purified. Transgenic mouse lines were generated by injecting purified transgene fragments into C57BL/6N×C57BL/6N fertilized eggs. A total of 350 DNA-injected eggs were transplanted into pseudopregnant mice, resulting in 32 newborn pups. Three of these were transgenic, and the first line was established as Tg (CAG-hACE2) 01Osb. The Tg mice were kept of a B6D2F1 background. Expression of hACE2 in each organ was confirmed via western blotting. Briefly, organ homogenates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific) using a bead mill homogenizer (Fischer Scientific). Protein concentrations were measured via BCA assay (Pierce), and 10 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent western blotting. hACE2 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against hACE2 (Abcam, Cat# ab15348) with Can Get Signal solutions (TOYOBO).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Evaluation of safety in transgenic mice</title><p>The animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the approved protocols corresponding Osaka University’s Review Committees (approval nos.

The comparison should include details of the doses, neutralizing antibody titers with duration of protection, tissue damage in the various organs, and other risks, including virulence reversal.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer’s comment regarding the lack of data to compare BK2102 with an mRNA vaccine. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain commercially available mRNA vaccines for research purposes and could not produce mRNA vaccines of equivalent quality. As a result, a direct comparison of the safety profiles of BK2102 and mRNA vaccines was not possible. To address this, we conducted a GLP study with an additional twelve monkeys to evaluate the safety of BK2102. Following three intranasal inoculations of BK2102 at two-week intervals, no toxic effects were observed in any of the parameters assessed, including tissue damage, respiratory rate, functional observational battery (FOB), hematology, or fever. These results are detailed in lines 115-117.</p><p>Furthermore, we compared the immunogenicity of BK2102 with that of an in-house prepared mRNA vaccine. The mRNA vaccine was designed to target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and its immunogenicity was evaluated in hamsters. When serum neutralizing antibody titers were found to be comparable between the two, intranasal inoculation of BK2102 induced higher IgA levels in nasal wash samples compared to those from hamsters injected intramuscularly with the self-made mRNA vaccine (Supplementary figures. 2A and B, respectively). Additionally, while the mRNA vaccine induced Th1 and Th2 immune responses, as indicated by the detection of IgG1 and IgG2/3 (Supplementary figure. 2C), BK2102 mainly induced a Th1 response in hamsters. These explanatory sentences have been added to the manuscript (lines 140-150).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The vaccine's effect on primates is doubtful. The study fails to explain why only two of four monkeys developed neutralizing antibodies. Information about the vaccine's testing in monkeys is also missing: What was the level of protection and duration of the persistence of neutralizing antibodies in monkeys? Were the tissue damages and other risks assessed?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the reason neutralizing antibody titers were observed in only 2 out of 4 monkeys in the immunogenicity study reported in the original manuscript is that only a single-dose was administered. We measured the neutralizing antibody titers in sera collected from monkeys used in the GLP study and confirmed the induction of neutralizing antibody in all 6 monkeys that received three inoculations of BK2102. This data has been included in a new figure (Supplementary figure 3B). While we would have liked to evaluate the persistence of immunity and conduct a protection study in monkeys, limitations related to facility availability and cost prevented us from doing so. As noted in (1), tissue injury and other risk assessments were evaluated in the GLP study, which showed no evidence of tissue injury or other toxic effects. These results are described in lines 113-117.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The vaccine's safety in immunosuppressed individuals or individuals with chronic diseases should be assessed. Authors should make specific comments on this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>In general, live-attenuated vaccines are contraindicated for immunosuppressed individuals or those with chronic conditions, and therefore BK2102 is also not intended for use in these patients.</p><p>This information has been added to the Discussion section (lines 309-311).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The candidate vaccine has been tested with a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 strains. Of note, the latest Omicron variants have lesser virulence than many early variants, such as the alfa, beta, and delta strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the results of a protection study against the SARS-CoV-2 gamma strain to Supplementary figures 5A and B. No weight loss was observed in BK2102-inoculated hamsters following infection with the gamma strain. These results are described in lines 109-111, 158-162.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Limitations of the study have not been discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the ambiguity in the description of the Limitations of this paper. One major limitation of this study is that, despite observing high immunogenicity in hamsters, it remains uncertain whether the same positive results would be achieved in humans. Differences in susceptibility exist between species, which are not solely attributed to weight differences. For instance, while a single dose of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of BK2102 was sufficient to induce neutralizing antibodies in hamsters, a higher dose of 10<sup>7</sup> PFU in monkeys was required to induce antibodies in only about 50% of the monkeys. Additionally, two more challenges in development of BK2102 were added to the discussion. The first was the limited availability of analytical reagents for hamster models, which restricted the detailed immunological characterization of the response. Second, it took time to gather preclinical data due to the space-related restrictions of BSL3 facilities, which delayed the clinical trials for BK2102 until many individuals had already acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2. It remains to be seen whether our candidate will be optimal for human use, as the immunogenicity of live-attenuated vaccines is generally influenced by pre-existing immunity.</p><p>We added these considerations to the discussion section (lines 300-309).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>No major weaknesses were identified, however, this reviewer notes the following:</p><p>The authors missed the opportunity to include a mRNA vaccine to demonstrate that the immunity and protection efficacy of their live attenuated vaccine BK2102 is better than a mRNA vaccine.</p><p>One of the potential advantages of live-attenuated vaccines is their ability to induce mucosal</p><p>immunity. It would be great if the authors included experiments to assess the mucosal immunity of their live-attenuated vaccine BK2102.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer’s suggestion regarding the importance of comparing BK2102 with the mRNA vaccine modality and evaluating the mucosal immunity induced by BK2102. In hamsters, under conditions where serum neutralizing antibody titers were equivalent, intranasal inoculation of BK2102 induced higher levels of antigen-specific IgA in nasal wash compared to intramuscular injection of the conventional mRNA vaccine. This new data has been added in Supplementary figures 2A and B, and corresponding sentences have been included in the Results and Discussion sections (lines 140-145, 292-299).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Lack of a more detailed discussion of this new vaccine approach in the context of reported live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in terms of its advantages and/or weaknesses.</p></disp-quote><p>sCPD9 and CoviLiv, two previously reported live-attenuated vaccines, achieve attenuation through codon deoptimization or a combination of codon deoptimization and FCS deletion. These two strategies affect viral proliferation but do not directly impact virulence. In contrast, the temperature sensitivity-related substitutions in NSP14 included in BK2102 selectively restrict the infection site, reducing the likelihood of lung infection and providing a safety advantage over the other live-attenuated vaccines. As mentioned in the response to comment (5) of Reviewer #1, a limitation of BK2102 is that its development began later than that of the previously reported live-attenuated vaccines. Consequently, we must consider the impact of pre-existing immunity in future human trials. Based on these points, we have added sentences discussing the advantages and disadvantages to the Discussion section (lines 302-305, 312-319).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Antibody endpoint titers could be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We calculated the antibody endpoint titers for Figure 2A and included the results in lines 105-107 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lack of elaboration on immune mechanisms of protection at the upper respiratory tract (URT) against an immune evasive variant in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment. The potential role of cellular and mucosal immunity in protection has been discussed in more detail in the revised manuscript, specifically in lines 283-295. According to the reference we initially cited, Hasanpourghadi et al. evaluated their adenovirus vector vaccine candidates and reported that the protection was enhanced by co-expression of the nucleocapsid protein rather than relying solely on the spike protein (Hasanpourghadi et al., Microbes Infect, 2023). Therefore, cellular immunity against the nucleocapsid and/or other viral proteins induced by BK2102 may also contribute to protection, as evidenced by more pronounced cellular immunity to the nucleocapsid detected through ELISPOT assay. Moreover, antigen-specific mucosal immunity was successfully detected in additional studies. The involvement of mucosal immunity in protection against mutant strains has been documented in the previously cited reference (Thwaites et al., Nat Commun, 2023). We have included these new data in Figure 2F and Supplementary figure 2B. Additionally, the results and discussion regarding the mechanisms of protection in the upper respiratory tract, in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies, have been incorporated into the revised lines 136-139, 143-145 and 283-295, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Figure 1: Please include the LOD and statistical analysis in both panels. Please consider passaging the virus in Vero cell s, approved for human vaccine production, to assess the stability of BK2102 after serial passage in vitro, which is important for its implementation as a live-attenuated vaccine. The authors should consider evaluating viral replication in different cell lines, and also assessing the plaque phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comments. First, we have added the statistical analysis and the limit of detection (LOD) to Figure 1. In response to the comments regarding the stability of BK2102 after serial passage in Vero cells, as well as its replication and plaque phenotype in different cell lines, we manufactured test substances for GLP studies and clinical trials by passaging BK2102 in Vero cells, which are approved for human vaccine production. We confirmed that BK2102 is stable (data not shown). Additionally, we verified that BK2102 replicates in BHK, Vero E6, and Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells, in addition to Vero cells. Among these options, we selected Vero cells due to their high proliferative capacity and ability to produce clear plaques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: Please, include statistical analysis in panels A, B, and D. Please, include the LOD in panels A and D. Please, include viral titers from these experiments in hamsters and NHPs.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to note that Figure 2D has been replaced by Figure 2C in the revised manuscript, and the data on neutralizing antibody titers in non-human primates (NHPs), originally presented as Figure 2C, have been moved to the Supplementary figure 3A.</p><p>We have added the statistical analysis to Figure 2B and C, as well as the LOD to Figure 2C. Figure 2A (Spike-specific IgG ELISA) was intended for qualitative evaluation based on OD values, so the LOD was not defined. We have also added a detailed description of virus titer in the Methods section under the headings “Evaluation of Immunogenicity in Hamsters” and “Evaluation of Immunogenicity in Monkeys”, and updated the information in the Figure legends of the revised manuscript (lines 451, 459, 468-474, 566-567, 576-578, 582-584, 661-662).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: Please, include the viral titers of the challenge virus in the NT and lungs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the virus titers for the challenge experiments to the Results section under the heading “BK2102 induced protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection” (lines 168-174).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: Please, include statistical analysis in panels B and C and evaluate viral titers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the statistical analysis to Figure 4B and C. Unfortunately, all samples in Figure 4 were fixed in formalin for histopathological examination, so virus titers could not be measured. However, in past experiments, we measured viral titers in the nasal wash samples and lungs of hamsters three days post-infection with D614G and BK2102. We confirmed that infectious virus was detected in both the nasal wash and lungs of the hamsters infected with D614G strain (2.9 log10 PFU/mL and 5.3 log10 PFU/g, respectively), but not in the lungs of the hamsters with BK2102. The viral titers in the nasal wash of BK2102-infected hamsters were equivalent to those of the hamsters infected with the D614G wild-type strain (3.0 log10 PFU/mL). However, we did not include this data to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: Please, include viral titers in different tissues with the different vaccines (panels A and B). Please, include the body weight changes. Finally, please, consider the possibility of challenging the vaccinated mice with the same SARS-CoV-2 strains used in the manuscript to demonstrate similar protection efficacy in this new ACE2 transgenic mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The different tissues of Tg mice were not sampled, as no gross abnormalities were observed in organs other than lungs and brains during necropsy. We have added new data on the body weight of Tg mice after infection to Supplementary figures 9B and 9C in the revised manuscript, along with additional lines in the Results section (lines 228-230 and 247-248). Although we do not know the reason, we have observed that immunization of this animal model does not lead to an increase in antibody titers. Therefore, we do not consider this animal model suitable for the protection study as you suggested. However, it could be useful in passive immunization experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 1: Since most of the manuscript focuses on BK2102, the authors should consider removing the other live-attenuated vaccines (Supplementary Figure 1A).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer’s suggestion and have simplified the description for Supplementary Figure 1A (lines 93-97).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 3: Please, include statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, Supplementary Figure 3 from the original manuscript has been moved to Supplementary Figure 2D. The IgG subclass ELISA was intended for a qualitative evaluation based on OD values, and therefore the results were included in the Supplementary figure. However, we realized the description was not clear, so we added further clarification in the Results section (lines 145-147).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 4: Please, include the viral titers in both infected and contact hamsters from this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, Supplementary Figure 4 in the original manuscript has been moved to Supplementary Figure 6. Unfortunately, due to limited breeding space for the hamsters, we were unable to prepare groups for the evaluation of viral titer, and instead prioritized evaluation by body weight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>(1) It would be helpful to discuss this new vaccine in the context of other reported live-attenuated vaccines in terms of its advantages and/or disadvantages.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to the Reviewer’s “first comment” above, as well as to the response in Public comment (5) of Reviewer #1. The modifications made in the manuscript are described in lines 302-305 and 312-319.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 2A: end-point titers could be presented, other than OD values.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is addressed in the reviewer’s second public comment. The endpoint titer has been included in lines 105-107 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2C: it is unclear why only 2 out of 4 NHPs show neutralization titers. This could be moved to a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, Figure 2C of the original manuscript has been moved to Supplementary Figure 3A in the revised manuscript. In response Public comment (2) from Reviewer #1, we have also added new data on neutralizing antibodies in the monkeys as Supplementary figure 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figures 2E-F: bulk measurement of cytokine production in supernatants is not an optimal way to measure vaccine-induced Ag-specific T cells. ELISPOT or ICS are better. T-cell ELSIPOT for hamsters is available. This should at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to this Reviewer’s third public comment. We have added the new results in Figure 2F of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is quite interesting that no N-specific cellular response was observed, given that it is a live-attenuated vaccine. What about N-specific binding Abs?</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted the ELISPOT assay as suggested by the Reviewer and detected cellular immunity against both spike and nucleocapsid proteins (Figure 2F). We did not examine nucleocapsid-specific antibodies, as they do not contribute to the neutralizing activity; however, nucleocapsid-specific cellular immunity was confirmed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 3: limit of detection for virological assays could be labeled.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the LOD in Figures 3C, D, F and G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figures 3E-F: it is interesting to see that the vaccine elicits almost complete protection at URT against BA.5, despite no BA.5 neutralizing titers being detected at all. What mechanism of URT protection by BK2102 would the authors speculate? T cells or other Ab effector functions?</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to the response to this Reviewer’s third public comment. We have added new results regarding cellular and mucosal immunity (Figure 2F and Supplementary figure 2B) and discussed the mechanisms of protection in the upper respiratory tract in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies (lines 136-139, 143-145 and 283-295, respectively).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 3I: the durability of protection is a strength of the study. Other than body weight changes, what about viral loads in the animals after the challenge?</p></disp-quote><p>We primarily assessed the effect of the vaccine by monitoring changes in body weight, as the differences compared to the naïve group were clear. Unfortunately, we did not collect samples at different time points throughout the study, which prevented us from evaluating the viral titers.</p><p>In addition, we made corrections to several other sections identified during the revision process. The revised parts are as follows:</p><p>- In the Methods section under the title “Evaluation of BK2102 pathogenicity in hamsters”, the infectious virus titer of D614G strain has been corrected (line 478).</p><p>- In the Methods section under the title “In vivo passage of BK2102 in hamsters”, infectious virus titer of BK2102 and A50-18 strain has been corrected (line 487).</p><p>- The collection time of splenocytes after inoculation has been corrected in the figure legend of Figure 2D, (line 583).</p><p>- There was an error in Figure 2D. The figure has been replaced with the appropriate version.</p><p>- A new reference on NSP1 deletion (Ueno et al., Virology, 2024) has been added to the references.</p><p>- Several methods have been described more clearly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
