Specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) co-ordinate the translational regulation of distinct mRNA cohorts during stress. To identify RBPs with previously under-appreciated roles in translational control, we used polysome profiling and mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins associated with translating ribosomes in unstressed yeast cells and during oxidative stress and amino acid starvation, which both induce the integrated stress response (ISR). Over 800 proteins were identified across polysome gradient fractions, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and many others without previously described translation-related roles, including numerous metabolic enzymes. We identified variations in patterns of PE in both unstressed and stressed cells and identified proteins enriched in heavy polysomes during stress. Genetic screening of polysome-enriched RBPs identified the cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, Aat2, as a ribosome-associated protein whose deletion conferred growth sensitivity to oxidative stress. Loss of Aat2 caused aberrantly high activation of the ISR via enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation and <italic>GCN4</italic> activation. Importantly, non-catalytic <italic>AAT2</italic> mutants retained polysome association and did not show heightened stress sensitivity. Aat2 therefore has a separate ribosome-associated translational regulatory or ‘moonlighting’ function that modulates the ISR independent of its aspartate aminotransferase activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ISR</kwd><kwd>polysome proteomics</kwd><kwd>Gcn2</kwd><kwd>moonlighting</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M011208/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crawford</surname><given-names>Robert A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014383</institution-id><institution>Weizmann UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020/129488</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pavitt</surname><given-names>Graham D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using mass spectrometry to study protein composition of translating ribosomes under unstressed or stress conditions, aspartate aminotransferase 2 (Aat2) is identified as a metabolic enzyme with a moonlighting function in the yeast integrated stress-response pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translation and its regulation are highly complex processes requiring the concerted action of numerous factors associated with mRNAs: translation factors (TFs), tRNAs, ribosomes, and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dever et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the translation apparatus is nimble in that its regulation immediately impacts upon the protein content of cells to meet changing conditions. Both general and mRNA-speciﬁc translational regulatory mechanisms co-ordinate cellular responses to diverse cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). One translational control pathway common to all eukaryotes is called the integrated stress response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>) also known as general amino acid control in yeast. Distinct cellular stress signals activate one or more of a family of protein kinases (GCN2, PKR, PERK, and HRI) that each phosphorylate the general translation initiation factor eIF2 on a conserved single serine residue of its alpha subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wek, 2018</xref>). This causes a rapid global downregulation of protein synthesis. Under active translation conditions, eIF2 in its GTP-bound form recruits initiator tRNA to ribosomes. Phosphorylated eIF2 instead forms an inhibited complex with the key guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, which otherwise generates active eIF2-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pavitt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adomavicius et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kashiwagi et al., 2019</xref>). However, not all translation is inhibited by the ISR. mRNAs encoding stress-protective proteins need to be translated for cells to adapt to the altered cellular environment. The 5′ untranslated regions (5′UTRs) of some translationally controlled mRNAs contain <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements promoting their translation when bulk protein synthesis is attenuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinnebusch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wek, 2018</xref>). Key examples include the mammalian <italic>ATF4</italic> and yeast <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNAs, which are both transcriptional activators whose expression is controlled via regulated ribosome reinitiation at upstream open reading frames (uORFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinnebusch et al., 2016</xref>). Once the stress has been neutralised, translation patterns revert to steady state, restoring proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crawford and Pavitt, 2019</xref>). In the ISR, this requires the dephosphorylation of eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wek, 2018</xref>). In humans a failure to restore proteostasis in a timely manner can contribute to a range of diseases, including cognitive disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Other stress-dependent mechanisms also operate on translation. Inhibiting RNA helicases that promote ribosome recruitment and the unwinding of secondary structures during 5′UTR scanning has been shown to reduce translation significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). In yeast, both glucose starvation and heat shock stresses are accompanied by a dramatic reduction in mRNA binding by both the eIF4A and Ded1 RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>), which contributes to very rapid translational repression, within 1 min following glucose withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, translation elongation can be regulated through modulation of the activity of elongation factors such as eEF2, which is modified downstream of some stress signalling pathways, including oxidative stress. tRNA availability also controls elongation rates. Local variations in codon usage and ribosomal pausing and stalling events all slow elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dever and Green, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schuller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tesina et al., 2020</xref>). Stalled ribosomes lead to ribosome collisions, which can activate Gcn2 and the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pochopien et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan and Zaher, 2021</xref>) as well as ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathways that recycle stalled ribosomes and degrade defective mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">D’Orazio and Green, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Ribosomes themselves are not necessarily uniform and can vary between conditions and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Slavov et al., 2015</xref>). Variation in ribosome composition can confer preferences for binding to different subsets of mRNAs. Examples include the ribosomal protein (RP) Rps26/eS26, where both high salt and raised pH reduce its incorporation into yeast ribosomes. Rps26-deficient ribosomes are proposed to preferentially translate stress-responsive mRNAs via altered Kozak sequence recognition preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferretti et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, some paralogous RPs, where two genes encode the same RP, have been demonstrated to have specific roles in translational regulation. For example, yeast Rpl1a/uL1 and Rpl1b show preferences for translating different sets of mRNAs, as Rpl1b-containing ribosomes promote more efficient translation of mitochondrial proteins required for respiratory growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Segev and Gerst, 2018</xref>). Mutations in RPs lead to Diamond–Blackfan Anemia and other ribosomopathies in humans, which might imply specialised roles for RP-deficient or paralog-specific ribosomes. Alternatively, reducing the abundance of active ribosomes via defects in RPs likely changes the balance of expression of mRNAs observed in different cells or tissues, potentially contributing to ribosomopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mills and Green, 2017</xref>).</p><p>RBPs and ribosome-interacting proteins also contribute to translational control. Several RBPs have been observed to modulate the expression of sets of target mRNAs, which range from a few target transcripts to several thousand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hogan et al., 2008</xref>). For example, the RBP CPEB is only recruited to mRNAs containing a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element and helps to modulate ribosome recruitment and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Richter, 2007</xref>). Multiple studies have attempted to either identify mRNA targets of specific RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hogan et al., 2008</xref>) or identify new RBPs across a range of organisms, using a variety of methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hentze et al., 2018</xref>). Curiously, these latter studies have uncovered an unexpectedly large number of metabolic enzymes that bind RNA. Very few of these newly recognised RBPs have a defined role in RNA biology, but it has been suggested that many could have a second ‘moonlighting’ function when bound to RNA. These results highlight the possibility that undiscovered post-transcriptional regulatory networks link gene expression and intermediary metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hentze and Preiss, 2010</xref>).</p><p>A model has therefore emerged of a complex interplay between mRNA-specific elements, RBPs, and ribosome-associated factors that may combine to enable selected stress-responsive mRNAs to escape globally repressive regulatory mechanisms. Here, we set out to identify candidate proteins that might be involved in mRNA-specific translational regulation during stress in yeast. Oxidative stress caused by the addition of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) brings about rapid translational repression via Gcn2 activation and the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shenton et al., 2006</xref>), as well as the induction of antioxidant enzymes at both the transcriptional and translational levels to ameliorate the stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morano et al., 2012</xref>). How these antioxidant enzymes are translated under such repressive conditions is unclear. We took an unbiased proteomics approach to determine patterns of ribosome association across polysome gradients in actively growing cells and how these change in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In parallel, we assessed how cells respond to amino acid starvation caused by the addition of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), a well-characterised inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). Both stresses activate the yeast ISR and translation of <italic>GCN4</italic> (Hinnebusch; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shenton et al., 2006</xref>) but also need to promote the expression of different stress-specific genes. We find that the changes in polysome enrichment (PE) of proteins in response to both stresses are remarkably well correlated, with similar changes observed across both stresses for TFs, RPs, and a wide range of RBPs including metabolic enzymes. While some RBPs closely followed the PE profiles of RPs during stress by accumulating in the 80S/monosomal fraction, other proteins maintained or enhanced their association with the remaining heavy polysomes during the stress response. By screening candidate RBP knockout strains for oxidative stress phenotypes, we identified cytoplasmic aspartate amino transferase (Aat2) as a novel ribosome-interacting protein with a ‘moonlighting’ function. We show that Aat2 binds to 60S ribosomes and moderates Gcn2 activation in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Remarkably, mutational analyses show that the stress-response role is independent of its metabolic role.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantification of co-ordinated alterations in polysome association of proteins during acute stress</title><p>To gain insight into mechanisms of stress responses, we set out to identify candidate proteins that might be involved in mRNA-specific translational regulation during stress as cells adapt to their changing environment. Proteins involved in translational regulation have been found associated with the translational machinery by previous mass spectrometry (MS) approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fleischer et al., 2006</xref>), and by targeted studies of individual proteins which have high PE in stressed conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirschmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>). Proteins with mRNA-specific activation roles may retain or enhance their PE during stress. Similarly, RQC factors should be ribosome associated during stress, as both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 3-AT have been associated with enhanced slowing and stalling of ribosomes which recruits the RQC machinery and activates Gcn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shenton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meydan and Guydosh, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan and Zaher, 2021</xref>). In contrast, the rapid loss of factors from polysomes may contribute to translational repression, as observed for eIF4A during glucose starvation and heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We initially compared the growth and polysome profile responses of a histidine prototrophic version of the standard yeast lab strain, BY4741, under two stress conditions: acute oxidative stress induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and amino acid starvation induced by addition of the His3 inhibitor 3-AT. Each stressor was added during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), causing an interruption to cell growth which caused a loss of polysomes by 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>), in accord with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costello et al., 2017</xref>).

For each fraction, as well as the respective unfractionated cytoplasmic lysates (Totals, T), four biological replicates were analysed (originating from separate yeast colonies).

Principal component analysis showed good clustering of replicates for all three conditions, with adjacent sucrose gradient fractions indicating a gradual change in their composition when moving in sequential order from monosomes (F1) to heavy polysomes (F5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

As expected, RPs and ribosome-associated chaperones (e.g. Ssz1) were highly associated with ribosomes. In contrast, other proteins showed broad variations in ribosome association, from &lt;2.5% to 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For abundant and transiently associating translation elongation factors, we estimate less than 20% of each protein was present in F1–F5, while all initiation factors except for the highly abundant eIF4A were over 30% ribosome associated in unstressed cells. Known RBPs (yellow) and proteins not assigned to any other class (grey) showed highly varied ribosome association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), reflecting the large functional diversity within these categories. In response to both stresses, most TFs and related factors either reduced or maintained their overall ribosome association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As there is a rapid attenuation in global translation initiation rates, as evidenced by polysome run-off, reduced engagement of initiation factors is expected. Under conditions of glucose starvation or heat shock the RNA helicase eIF4A is rapidly dissociated from polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, we observed no change in eIF4A or Ded1 association, indicating that loss of eIF4A is not a universal response to stress. In addition, a reduction of elongation rates accompanies oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shenton et al., 2006</xref>), with enhanced eEF2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we find slightly enhanced association of both eEF2 and eIF5A with ribosomes during both oxidative stress and amino acid starvation, although neither change was statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings are consistent with slowed translocation and enhanced ribosome pausing during stress.

Proteins in clusters 1–3 exhibited low abundance in ribosome fractions relative to totals, but maintained PE during both stresses. In contrast, those in clusters 11–14 were typically highly associated with ribosomes and enriched in heavier polysome fractions in unstressed conditions, but shifted into the monosome fraction following stress, in line with the global polysome profile change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Almost all RPs were found in clusters 11 and 12 and generally behaved similar to Rps3/uS3, for example Asc1/RACK1 and Rpl38/eL38 (both cluster 12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with the idea that the RPs are responding in a concerted manner. Within these two clusters, there was some variation in the degree to which the different RPs shifted into monosomes during stress, for example Rps2/uS5 was relatively more depleted from heavy polysomes compared with Rps3/uS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Only three RPs separated into other clusters. Rpl8b/uL8 and Rps10/eS10 (cluster 13) appear to be more depleted from heavy polysomes during stress, suggesting that they might be selectively lost from the mRNA-engaged pool of ribosomes during stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Conversely, Rpl7b/uL30 (cluster 6) retained PE during both stresses in a similar manner to mRNA-binding factors such as Pab1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Although a growing body of evidence suggests that variations in the association of specific RPs and paralogs with ribosomes contributes to mRNA-specific translation e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Slavov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferretti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerst, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>), our data did not provide strong evidence that variations in RP abundance were critical for these stress responses, so we did not explore the variation we observed among the RPs further. Instead we focused on accessory ribosome-associated proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RBPs exhibit varied polysome association in response to stress</title><p>Several recent genome-wide studies have defined yeast RBPs by crosslinking proteins to RNA and then identifying them by an MS approach or by an in vitro protein array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matia-González et al., 2015</xref>). Such studies have found proteins with typical RNA-binding domains (e.g. RRM, KH, and PUF) as well as a range of proteins lacking classical domains, including numerous metabolic enzymes. A recent review concluded over 1200 yeast proteins had been identified as RBPs in high-throughput studies, with many found by multiple independent methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hentze et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we identified over 240 polysome-associated RBPs in addition to the core RPs and TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – sheets 2 and 3). In contrast to the RPs, which form a relatively tight co-regulated group, RBPs are distributed across all 14 clusters, indicating they differ widely both in their percentage ribosome association (low in clusters 1–3, medium in 8–10 and high in the other clusters) and in how their PE changes in response to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast to the RPs, which generally became less abundant in heavier fractions during stress, proteins in clusters 1–3 and 8–9 were evenly spread across the fractions in both unstressed and stressed cells, while factors in clusters 4–6 and 10 became more enriched in the heavier polysome fractions during both stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – sheet 3).</p><p>We reasoned that the factors remaining associated with polysomes during stress would likely include those acting to resolve the impact of stress at the translational level. For example, the multi-KH domain-containing protein Scp160 (cluster 4) is known to interact with polysomal mRNAs during both optimal growth conditions and during glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere et al., 2011</xref>). Scp160 behaved equivalently here following both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 3-AT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A recent study proposed that Scp160 enhances the polysome association of codon-optimised transcripts by channelling or recycling tRNAs at ribosomes using successive synonymous codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirschmann et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) were enriched in clusters 2 and 3, which maintain PE during stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Several RQC factors were identified in our dataset. For example, Mbf1 (cluster 3) is recruited to stalled disomes where it can prevent frameshifting of collided ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, Cdc48 (also cluster 3) is recruited to ribosomes to promote ubiquitination of stalled proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Defenouillère et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast Gcn1, which was recently shown to bind across both stalled and collided ribosome disome partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pochopien et al., 2021</xref>) and is necessary for activation of Gcn2 for eIF2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marton et al., 1997</xref>), is placed in cluster 9, which is evenly associated across polysome fractions under all conditions sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the ribosome-associated chaperone (RAC) complex members Zuo1 and Ssz1, follow the RP pattern in cluster 12. Thus various proteins associated with resolving stalled/collided ribosomes have distinct patterns of PE following these stresses, likely reflecting their individual roles in RQC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase moderates the ISR</title><p>Gene ontology analysis revealed that many of the most highly polysome-enriched proteins were metabolic enzymes, including glycolytic enzymes (e.g. Pgk1, Fba1, and Eno1) and amino acid biosynthetic enzymes (e.g. Met6, His4, and Trp5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – sheet 5).

While their association with mRNA is known (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – sheet 3), their additional roles (if any) remain unclear. To assess whether any of these RBPs function in the stress response, we screened a selection of single gene deletion strains for growth phenotypes in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

Aat2 was placed in cluster 3 in our polysomal proteomics, indicating that it is associated evenly throughout the polysome fractions in both unstressed and stressed cells, similar to the profiles for eIF4A and translation elongation factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Polysome profile analysis revealed that translation was similar in untreated <italic>aat2∆</italic> and wild-type (parent) cells, but ribosome run-off caused by addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was more acute in <italic>aat2∆</italic> at lower concentrations of peroxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

As phosphorylation of eIF2α by Gcn2 is responsible for ribosome run-off following oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shenton et al., 2006</xref>), we used phospho-specific antibodies to assess the state of eIF2α in whole cell extracts, which showed heightened phosphorylation in response to lower concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>aat2∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Aat2 has a paralog, Aat1, which performs the same reactions within mitochondria, although the cytosolic form is the major contributor of total aspartate aminotransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blank et al., 2005</xref>). When grown on minimal medium, the <italic>aat2∆</italic> mutant is an aspartic acid auxotroph, but when amino acids are supplied, as here in our experiments, cells grow well as Aat2 enzymatic function is not required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To determine if the polysome-associated role of Aat2 in the stress response can be separated from its role in metabolism, we used a crystal structure of the Aat2 homodimer (PDB 1YAA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jeffery et al., 1998</xref>) and its homology to other aspartate aminotransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Winefield et al., 1995</xref>) to identify active site residues K255 and R387, which engage the cofactor pyridoxal-5′-phosphate and the active site competitive inhibitor maleate, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We used a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated approach to introduce glutamic acid charge reversal mutations individually at these two positions in <italic>AAT2-TAP</italic> cells, as well as creating a control strain containing four silent mutations (SM) in the guide RNA-binding sequence. Importantly, both K255E and R387E mutations conferred aspartic acid auxotrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>), despite being expressed well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Both mutants retain ribosome-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The mutations therefore compromise aspartate aminotransferase enzyme function, but not expression or ribosome binding.</p><p>All three versions of Aat2-TAP maintained the same polysome profile responses to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), unlike <italic>aat2∆</italic> cells which show enhanced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and the Aat2 mutant proteins all migrated into polysomes in both unstressed and stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>).

Our polysomal proteomics approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) captures many aspects of translation and its regulation during stress, including the behaviour of RPs, initiation factors, elongation factors, and RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). This is a powerful approach and is unbiased in the identification of proteins in sucrose gradient fractions, although we cannot definitively rule out the co-sedimentation of other large cytoplasmic assemblies with polysomes, for example P bodies or stress granules. Some of the proteins detected in ribosomal fractions therefore may not be truly RNA- or ribosome associated. However, all the proteins shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref> were detected in ribosome fractions under unstressed conditions, when P bodies and stress granules are absent in yeast. Furthermore, the large enrichment of RNA-binding and translation-related proteins in our data gives confidence in polysomal proteomics to assess changes in proteins associated with the translational machinery during stress.</p><p>Our unbiased clustering reveals that proteins displaying common changes in polysome association profiles across unstressed and stressed conditions share common functions in translational control. These shared regulatory responses likely result from the reductions in growth rates and global translation initiation and elongation activity that occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As expected, when global translation initiation was reduced, initiation factors reduced in relative ribosome association during stress. This applied to almost all, except for the 60S joining factor eIF5B and the RNA helicases eIF4A (along with its associated eIF4B) and Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The RNA helicases associated with polysomes equally in unstressed and stressed cells. This is perhaps surprising, because eIF4A, eIF4B, and Ded1 were found to be rapidly lost from polysomes following both glucose starvation and heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>). Perhaps importantly, neither glucose withdrawal for 10–15 min nor the immediate response to heat shock requires eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grousl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castelli et al., 2011</xref>). eIF4A has at least two separate roles in yeast translation: first, it contributes to the recruitment of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) to the 5′ end of capped mRNAs, and second it helps to unwind mRNA secondary structures during scanning towards the AUG start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Merrick and Pavitt, 2018</xref>). Here, the mRNA cap-binding factor eIF4E and its partner eIF4G were the most ribosome-depleted initiation factors during stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), while their global RNA binding was found to be unchanged following glucose starvation or heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>). It was also noted previously that protein–protein interactions among these 5′ cap-associated factors were not altered by stress, but that interactions with specific mRNAs were changed when these were quantified using a RNA-immunoprecipitation and RNA-sequencing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costello et al., 2017</xref>). Together these data are consistent with models where H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and amino acid starvation act at early time points via enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation to reduce 43S PIC–mRNA association, while heat shock and glucose starvation instead retain these 43S PIC–mRNA interactions but act to impede the subsequent scanning step via selective loss of RNA helicases.</p><p>In addition to impacting translation initiation, both stresses we investigated impair translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shenton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harding et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Stalled or collided ribosomes have been proposed to facilitate activation of Gcn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pochopien et al., 2021</xref>). In this model of Gcn2 activation, a blockage in elongation (e.g. caused by a lack of available aminoacylated tRNA) logically precedes the rapid attenuation of initiation. Slower migration of ribosomes increases ribosome density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). We observed increased interactions of both eEF2 (<italic>EFT2</italic>) and eIF5A (<italic>HYP2</italic>) with ribosomes during stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). eEF2 (cluster 2) promotes ribosomal translocation and its PE was maintained under all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Enhanced eEF2 phosphorylation during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) may reduce its activity and lead to the higher ribosome interaction we observe. In contrast, eIF5A (cluster 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) binds to the ribosomal exit site to promote peptide bond formation on stalled or paused 80S ribosomes, and has recently been observed in Gcn1-bound disome structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schuller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pochopien et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the increased association of eIF5A with ribosomes makes mechanistic sense in the context of stress-induced ribosome pauses during elongation.</p><p>The RPs generally behaved coherently in their ribosome association in our data, becoming highly enriched in the monosomal fraction (F1) during both oxidative stress and histidine starvation, consistent with most ribosomes remaining intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, differences in the degree to which some RPs became monosome-enriched during stress were observed. Rpl8b/uL8 and Rps10/eS10 (cluster 13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were both more depleted from the heavy polysome fractions (F4–F5) during stress than the other RPs, suggesting that they might be selectively depleted from the mRNA-engaged pool of ribosomes under these conditions. Rpl8 has been implicated in contributing to 60S biogenesis: the absence of Rpl8 causes the depletion of several large subunit RPs and ribosome assembly factors from pre-ribosomes, including Rpl28/uL15 (cluster 12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jakovljevic et al., 2012</xref>). Rps10 is located within the mRNA entry channel and contacts mRNA during translation. It is commonly mutated in Diamond–Blackfan Anemia, an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doherty et al., 2010</xref>). A recent study showed that the ribosome assembly factor Ltv1 promotes the incorporation of Rps10, Rps3, and Asc1 into the 40S head and that <italic>ltv1∆</italic> cells have growth defects, including enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2018</xref>). The mammalian ortholog of Rps10 is a target for ZNF598 (the homologue of Hel2) ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garzia et al., 2017</xref>). Yeast Rps10 can also be ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swaney et al., 2013</xref>), so partial ubiquitination of Rps10 might explain its reduced detection by MS in heavy polysomes. The four other members of cluster 13 (Dbp2, Nmd3, Arb1, and Arx1) are involved in ribosome biogenesis, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) or RQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>), consistent with their strong depletion from heavy polysomes in both unstressed and stressed conditions.</p><p>Uniquely among RPs, Rpl7b/uL30 was placed in cluster 6 along with mRNA-binding factors such as Pab1, which remained polysome-enriched during both stresses. Isoform-specific roles have been investigated for this paralog pair, with potential differential impacts on Ty element transposition described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Palumbo et al., 2017</xref>). In our MS data, the signal for Rpl7a (thought to be the major isoform) differed from that for Rpl7b, peaking in F5 in unstressed cells and F2 (disome/trisomes) during both stresses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – sheet 2). Further dedicated studies will be needed to determine whether these RPs have specific roles in stress responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Aat2 alters the sensitivity of the ISR to oxidative stress</title><p>Here, we identified Aat2 as a ribosome-binding factor modulating the oxidative stress sensitivity of yeast cells. We found that the protein was polysome associated in unstressed growth conditions and maintained its PE during both oxidative stress and amino acid starvation. Loss of Aat2 enhances both stress sensitivity and the activation of the eIF2 kinase Gcn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). In yeast, Gcn2 is the sole eIF2 kinase activating the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pavitt, 2018</xref>). Previously, it was found that mutations deleting RPs or associated factors can modulate Gcn2 activation. For example, deletion of <italic>RPS10A</italic> or <italic>RPS10B</italic> (both encoding Rps10/eS10) limits the activation of Gcn2 kinase in replete conditions and following amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), thus slowing activation of the ISR. Rps10 was found to contact Gcn1 in yeast two-hybrid experiments, suggesting that the RP can modify the sensitivity of Gcn1, a factor which is necessary for Gcn2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, loss of the RQC factor Hel2 promotes or enhances eIF2α phosphorylation both in unstressed cells and in response to the alkylating agent MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan and Zaher, 2021</xref>). Hel2 is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates Rps20/uS10 and Rps3/uS3 (both cluster 12) in response to ribosome stalling to initiate RQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>). Since RQC is inhibited in the absence of Hel2 and the Gcn2 activator Gcn1 binds to stalled/collided disomes, these findings suggested a model whereby Hel2 helps to resolve moderate stalls, and that Gcn2 activation ensues when Hel2 is unable to act or is overwhelmed during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan and Zaher, 2021</xref>). We observed heightened eIF2α phosphorylation at low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels after only 15 min of treatment in <italic>aat2∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which resembles these recent <italic>hel2∆</italic> observations under similar stress conditions. Aat2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and Gcn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ramirez et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Inglis et al., 2019</xref>) both bind to 60S ribosomal subunits, suggesting a potential model where Aat2 binding to polysomal 60S subunits in optimal growth conditions can antagonise Gcn2 activation. At present we cannot say how direct this role of Aat2 is, only that it appears to be acting upstream of Gcn2. Aat2 functions in amino acid metabolism as one of two enzymes that interconvert aspartate and glutamate, so we performed our studies under conditions where amino acid supply is in excess and its aspartate aminotransferase function is not essential. Two mutants that target key residues for catalytic function remain able to bind translating ribosomes and do not show the aberrant eIF2-phosphorylation and polysome profile patterns in response to stress that are characteristic of <italic>aat2∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These results imply that the global ISR-repressing role of Aat2 in unstressed cells is distinct from its aspartate aminotransferase function. However, while the global stress-response signalling and activation of Gcn2 appears normal in the <italic>aat2</italic> catalytic mutants, <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> reporter expression was repressed. This suggests that there may a further role of Aat2 downstream of Gcn2 activation and eIF2 phosphorylation that is impacted in these strains. It was recently shown that Gcn2 can phosphorylate additional substrates relavent to the ISR including Gcn20 and the eIF2 beta subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dokládal et al., 2021</xref>). Investigating if any of these or other downstream events necessary for <italic>GCN4</italic> translational activation are impacted by Aat2 will require additional tools beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Enzymes with secondary roles have been termed ‘moonlighting enzymes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castello et al., 2015</xref>) and those that bind RNA have been proposed to act as a post-transcriptional network linking metabolism to gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hentze and Preiss, 2010</xref>). The best-studied example of an RNA-binding metabolic enzyme is IRP1. In the presence of iron, IRP1 functions independently of RNA as the enzyme aconitase, while in the absence of iron it instead binds to specific target mRNAs via stem loop structures known as iron response elements, thus regulating their stability or translation. Other examples from glycolysis and other metabolic pathways have been reviewed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hentze and Preiss, 2010</xref>). However, as far as we are aware, Aat2 is the first example of a metabolic enzyme that binds to ribosomes and modulates the ISR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Both Totals and Fractions were briefly run on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and protein samples were excised from the gels. Samples were dehydrated using acetonitrile and centrifuged under vacuum. Dried gel pieces were reduced with 10 mM DTT and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide, then twice washed alternately with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile. Gel pieces were dried by vacuum centrifugation and samples digested using trypsin overnight at 37°C.</p><p>Liquid chromatography was carried out using an UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation Binary System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Of these, 840 were uniquely identified proteins encoded by single genes, while 61 are ‘grouped’ proteins that are not distinguishable by MS (most of which are RP paralog pairs).

The proportion of each protein that is ribosome associated was estimated by inverse log<sub>2</sub> transforming the FS/T ratio and dividing by 30 (to account for the difference in the relative amounts of the Fractions and Totals analysed by MS). Changes in ribosome association during stress were assessed by calculating the difference in FS/T from the condition of interest to unstressed (ΔFS/T). The RPs in general showed no change in overall ribosome association so were used to model a ‘null distribution’ of non-changing proteins (a normal distribution with the same ΔFS/T mean and standard deviation as the RPs), which was used to generate p values for each protein’s ΔFS/T value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-4"><title>Hierarchical clustering</title><p>Hierarchical clustering was used to identify sets of proteins with similar ‘polysome association profiles’ using the R functions <italic>dist</italic> (method: ‘euclidean’) and <italic>hclust</italic> (method: ‘complete’).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-5"><title>Peptide intensity distributions</title><p>To assess the contribution of nascent peptides to MS signal, cumulative peptide intensity from N- to C-terminus was calculated for proteins with a greater than median number of peptides detected (median = 7 peptides) and sequence coverage (proportion of residues that were detected in at least one peptide, median = 21.4%).

associated with translating ribosomes in yeast using mass spectrometry-based approaches. This revealed that cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase 2 (Aat2) is associated with polysomes. Aat2 deletion sensitizes yeast to oxidative stress which is paralleled by aberrantly elevated integrated stress response. The authors also show that polysome-association of Aat2 and its role in oxidative stress response are independent of its aminotransferase activity. Altogether, it was found that this study is of broad interest since it provides further evidence that metabolic enzymes may &quot;moonlight&quot; as post-transcriptional regulators while highlighting previously unappreciated aspects of adaptation to stress.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73466.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Topisirovic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/056jjra10</institution-id><institution>Jewish General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Topisirovic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/056jjra10</institution-id><institution>Jewish General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Valasek</surname><given-names>Leos Shivaya</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02p1jz666</institution-id><institution>Institute of Microbiology ASCR</institution></institution-wrap><country>Czech Republic</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.09.10.459737">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.10.459737v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

To this end, the conclusion that Aat2 associates with 60S ribosome is largely derived from their co-sedimentation presented in figure 6. However, at least as far as I could tell, association between Aat2 and 60S ribosomal subunit has not be demonstrated. It also remains unclear whether this is direct binding or indirect association. Although it is appreciated that addressing precise mechanisms of Aat2:ribosome association is likely to be out of the scope of the present study, at least some mechanistic insights appear to be warranted.</p><p>– It appears that the factors that mediate the signals from stressors to stimulate Aat2:ribosome association remain elusive. Does association of Aat2 with the ribosome require ongoing translation or not? Dynamics of Aat2:ribosome association are also not clear. Is Aat2 retained on the ribosomes throughout the adaptive phase? Does it dissociate during recovery from stress? Addressing some of these points was thought to be required to strengthen the proposed model.</p><p>– Notwithstanding proposed role of Gcn2, some additional mechanistic insights in how Aat2 moderated ISR would be appreciated.</p><p>– In figure 2B, eIF4E appears to be highly associated with polysomes. Is this a consequence of using FA over CHX? In other words, are the FA crosslinked 48S PICs present in polysomal fractions? Is there diffusion of PICs to disome fraction? Considering PMID: 31534220, it is also somewhat surprising that ~50% of eIF5B appears to be polysome associated. Finally, it appears that the authors were not able to validate 3 out of 4 hits from mass spec. Based on this, it may be advisable that the authors point out the shortcomings of their and similar approaches. Of note, in comparison to some similar studies, it was thought that his should not be a major reason of concern, considering that the authors validated Aat2 using elegant genetic and biochemical studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

This could be achieved e.g., by crosslinking-immunoprecipitation approaches or by performing in vitro ribosome binding assay (e.g., PMID: 18557705).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestions here and have attempted to address this issue in several ways.</p><p>Firstly, our data shows that a consistent fraction of Aat2 associates with polysomes both in the absence of, and the presence of, stress (Figure 3C). Individual comments by reviewers suggest that this point was not made clearly enough in our original manuscript as reviewers apparently thought Aat2 association with polysomes was exclusively promoted by stress. Hence, the observed constitutive association with polysomes would appear to rule out Aat2 association with ‘stress-associated cytoplasmic bodies’ which are not found in unstressed cells.</p><p>We have modified the text on page 10 to clarify:</p><p>'Aat2 was placed in cluster 3 in our polysomal proteomics, indicating that it is associated evenly throughout the polysome fractions in both unstressed and stressed cells, similar to the profiles for eIF4A and translation elongation factors (Figure 3C).'</p><p>Secondly, our experimental time window for examining the effect of stress on polysome-associated proteins is very short (15 mins). This is earlier than when P bodies and/or Stress granules typically appear during oxidative stress. Early in the study we undertook a microscopic analysis of P body and Stress granule formation using a strain with a marker for each (Dcp2-CFP for P bodies and Cdc33-RFP for stress granules). With this strain glucose starvation (which targets eIF4A) rapidly induced both types of granules in a high percentage of cells. However, the stresses we used in our study did not induce stress granules and especially oxidative stress was very slow at forming P-bodies such that at the earliest time possible for microscopy (25 mins) almost no P-bodies formed. Thus, we concluded that at our early time point during stress adaptation, protein synthesis initiation was impacted (polysome run-off) without causing appreciable formation of P-bodies and or stress granules which could interfere with our MS study.</p><p>Thirdly, studies aimed at determining P-body and stress granule composition have not identified Aat2 as part of these stress-induced cytoplasmic bodies (eg doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.038 and DOI: 10.1080/15476286.2021.1976986). These bodies are also significantly larger than polysomes and are likely completely sedimented during centrifugation.</p><p>In summary it is highly unlikely that Aat2 co-sediments with stress induced P-bodies or stress granules. However, we acknowledge that there may be other high-molecular weight complexes that are not polysomes that Aat2 could potentially associate with, that these arguments cannot exclude, so we set out to address this experimentally.</p><p>We have attempted to address the point directly with an IP experiment. However, we were hampered by the lack of specific Aat2 antiserum, so are reliant on tagged Aat2 to detect it (except via MS). We used our TAP-tagged Aat2 strain to immunoprecipitate Aat2 from RNase-treated free and 80S/monosome fractions. Unfortunately, we encountered a common technical issue with IPs, which is that ribosomes often co-sediment non-specifically with the immunoprecipitating resin. To counter this, we applied a stringent wash with a high salt buffer and detergent which inevitably reduced the signals we were aiming to capture. We were able to see a modest enrichment of the ribosomal marker protein uS3/Rps3 in 3 of 4 replicates done (mean enrichment of Aat2-TAP strain over parent=1.630±0.575). Hence, although we feel that this experiment does confirm Aat2-ribosome interaction via an alternative technique, it does not enhance the overall message of our paper so have not included it in the main manuscript.</p><p>In summary, the technical complications described here prevented us from completing what we thought would be relatively straightforward experiments. Hence, we have modified the text at the start of the Discussion section to indicate it remains possible that some of the proteins identified may co-sediment rather than co-associate with polysomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although it was appreciated that elucidating precise mechanism underpinning stress-induced association of Aat2 with the polysomes and/or the effects of Aat2 on integrated stress response is outside of the scope of the present article, it was thought that further characterization of non-catalytic Aat2 mutants is warranted. To this end, the effects of non-catalytic Aat2 mutants on stress response should be further characterized by monitoring phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and the GCN4-lacZ activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now completed these experiments and they are included in new panels in a revised Figure 7 – panels D and E. They show that the mutants (which are enzyme auxotrophs, but retain ribosome association) exhibit a normal eIF2 phosphorylation response unlike <italic>aat2∆</italic> cells (Figure 7D). They lower <italic>GCN4</italic> expression under optimal growth but do not induce Gcn4 expression upon the extended oxidative stress needed to induce <italic>lacZ</italic> expression in WT cells (Figure 7E). The mutants therefore behave distinctly to the <italic>aat2∆</italic> strain and support the idea that catalytic aminotransferase enzyme function and the protein’s role in the ISR are distinct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Description of statistical methods used to analyze mass spectrometry data was found to be incomplete. Potential limitations of the polysome profiling/mass spectrometry approach should also be discussed. Finally, it was thought that a list of top hits should be provided to the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the Methods to include more details on the processing of the MS data and have added an additional figure supplement to support Figure 2. A list of top hits has been included within Supplementary file 1. We have also discussed potential limitations of the experimental approach in the Discussion. Each point is discussed in further detail below.</p><p>Firstly, we have added in further details about the statistical processing within MaxQuant (Methods, page 21):</p><p>“The peak list was searched against the Uniprot <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> database (accessed 10<sup>th</sup> February 2017) using the built-in Andromeda search engine (Cox et al. 2011). Peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and protein groups were each filtered at a false-discovery rate (FDR) of 1%…”</p><p>Second, we have added additional data processing for the changes in FS/T (% ribosome association) during stress, shown in Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1. We assessed the statistical significance of changes in FS/T for proteins during each stress condition by modelling a population of proteins that does not change in FS/T compared with unstressed conditions. We assumed that the ribosomal proteins (RPs) did not generally change in their % ribosome association during stress, which was confirmed by both the SDS-PAGE and MS data, so we used this as a normally distributed sample sub-population against which to assess other proteins and estimate p-values (see dotted line indicating ‘null’ distribution in new Figure 2 —figure supplement 1B). The arrows on the right of Figure 2B have been updated to reflect this, now showing only statistically significant changes (p &lt; 0.05) in FS/T. These data are now shown in Supplementary file 1–Sheet 3. The Methods have been updated to reflect the additional data processing.</p><p>Third, we have included a list of top hits in Supplementary file 1–Sheet 4. Proteins were defined as ‘top hits’ from the data presented in Supplementary file 1–Sheet 3 based on three criteria:</p><p>(1) Estimated percentage ribosome association in unstressed conditions. Only candidates with an estimated % ribosomal greater than 5% were considered.</p><p>(2) Change in ribosome association during H2O2 and/or 3-AT stress. Only candidates showing significant changes in ribosome association during one or both stresses were considered (i.e. ΔFS/T p-value &lt; 0.05).</p><p>(3) Known function. RPs and TFs (translation factors) were excluded from the list of candidates, as the focus of the study was to identify proteins with previously under-appreciated roles in translational regulation.</p><p>The 74 candidate proteins defined by these criteria were then assigned a rank. Proteins showing significant changes during both stress conditions were ranked above those showing changes in only one, and proteins were then ranked based on their estimated % ribosome association (highest to lowest). Although not exhaustive, we believe that this list highlights many of the most interesting candidates for further investigation.</p><p>Fourth, we investigated methods to assess the statistical significance of the clustering shown in Figure 3C. We note that in the wider literature the statistical significance of clustering is not routinely tested, with unsupervised clustering methods instead being used to gain a broad overview of interesting patterns within the data. We did attempt to apply the methodology implemented in the R package <italic>sigclust2</italic> (Kimes <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017 PMID: 28099990) to analyse our clusters. <italic>Sigclust2</italic> tests whether the two groups (‘clusters’) separated at each node of the dendrogram are likely to belong to different normally distributed populations or are subsets of the same normally distributed population. It does this hierarchically, working down from the top of the clustering tree so that each node is only tested if its ‘parent’ showed a significant separation between the ‘daughter’ clusters.</p><p>We analysed our data (that used in Figure 3C) using <italic>sigclust2</italic>, however we encountered issues that prevented us from analysing the data fully in this way. Notably, <italic>sigclust2</italic> does not accept missing values, in contrast to the base R functions <italic>dist</italic> and <italic>hclust</italic>, which we used originally for our clustering. Only five proteins (of 353) contained one to three missing values (only in the Totals), while the rest contained none, but these still affect the clustering so <italic>sigclust2</italic> did not reproduce the exact same pattern as our original base R method – not a surprising result given the sensitivies of most clustering algorithms to minor variations in parameters or data. When comparing the two results however, the major divisions in the dendrogram remained and were significant (including the major division between clusters 1-3 and 4-14, and between clusters 6-11 and 12-14; p &lt; 0.05). Given the strong similarity in the cluster sets derived in the original paper with the <italic>sigclust2</italic> set, with the latter offering statistical significance on the main separations, this persuaded us that the current clustering represents groups with distinctly different profiles and hence biologically significant patterns. We have therefore not replaced the clusters or figures in the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– In general, it was found that there is a lack of mechanistic detail pertinent to Aat2 association with ribosomes.

We attempted to address this question by immunoprecipitating Aat2-TAP from both RNase-treated free and 80S/monosomal fractions and probing for ribosomal proteins in the resulting western blots. However, we found that ribosomal proteins non-specifically co-sedimented with the immunoprecipitating resin, which necessitated very stringent washing that reduced the signal of interest. We observed a modest enrichment of uS3/Rps3 in the IP fraction compared with the untagged control on average (mean=1.630 ±0.575, n=4), although this was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>=0.071, t-test, Reviewer Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It appears that the factors that mediate the signals from stressors to stimulate Aat2:ribosome association remain elusive.

We have amended the description of the metabolic enzyme clusters (page 10) to reflect that these proteins are polysome-associated under unstressed conditions as well as during stress:</p><p>“Cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase moderates the ISR</p><p>Gene ontology analysis revealed that many of the most highly polysome-enriched proteins were metabolic enzymes, including glycolytic enzymes (e.g. Pgk1, Fba1, Eno1) and amino acid biosynthetic enzymes (e.g. Met6, His4, Trp5) (Figure 3C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 1–sheet 4). These proteins are polysome-associated under unstressed conditions and retain or increase both their ribosome association and PE during stress (clusters 1-6 and 8-10). While their association with mRNA is known (Supplementary file 1–sheet 3), their additional roles (if any) remain unclear …”</p><p>We have also stressed this point further with respect to Aat2 specifically (page 10/11), to clarify that it is present in F1-F5 in both unstressed and stressed cells (and therefore that its association is not dramatically altered by stress):</p><p>“Aat2 was present in cluster 3 in our polysomal proteomics, indicating that it is associated evenly throughout the polysome fractions in both unstressed and stressed cells, similar to eIF4A and elongation factors (Figure 3C).”</p><p>Finally, we stressed this point again in the Discussion:</p><p>“Aat2 alters the sensitivity of the ISR to oxidative stress</p><p>Here we identified Aat2 as a ribosome binding factor modulating the oxidative stress sensitivity of yeast cells.

We have included new experiments measuring eIF2α phosphorylation and <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression in both of our point mutant strains (revised Figure 7, panels D and E).

In addition, both mutants show normal <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression in unstressed cells, but do not activate <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> translation during oxidative stress (Figure 7E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In figure 2B, eIF4E appears to be highly associated with polysomes.

Considering PMID: 31534220, it is also somewhat surprising that ~50% of eIF5B appears to be polysome associated.</p></disp-quote><p>The current understanding of the mechanism of initiation is that it should occur on both free mRNAs (i.e. where the initiation event is the first event/pioneer round on that mRNA) and mRNAs that already contain elongating ribosomes, otherwise no polysomes should form. Therefore we would expect that initiation factors would associate with polysomal complexes (as well as monosomes). It is not thought that any initiation factors are only required for the first initiation event. Our view is that the associations of those factors shown in Figure 2B are entirely consistent with current ideas of how initiation operates.</p><p>FA vs CHX: We used FA in order to stabilise complexes to retain RPs, TFs, RBPs and other proteins during ultracentrifugation. CHX would only retain ribosomes on the mRNA, whereas other proteins would potentially be lost if they detach from polysomes during ultracentrifugation, causing them to migrate to lighter sucrose concentrations. FA is widely used to stabilize initiation complexes. Combined with the above logic, the data are consistent with FA-crosslinked 48S PICs being present in polysomal fractions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it appears that the authors were not able to validate 3 out of 4 hits from mass spec.
