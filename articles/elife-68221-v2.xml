mutations remains largely undefined. Eliminating mutant or restoring wild-type p53 is challenging; nevertheless, understanding p53 variant effects on tumorigenesis remains central to realizing better treatment outcomes. In ERMS, &gt;70% of patients retain wild-type <italic>TP53</italic>, yet mutations when present are associated with worse prognosis. Employing a <italic>kRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic>-driven ERMS tumor model and tp53 null (tp53<sup>-/-</sup>) zebrafish, we define wild-type and patient-specific <italic>TP53</italic> mutant effects on tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that <italic>tp53</italic> is a major suppressor of tumorigenesis, where <italic>tp53</italic> loss expands tumor initiation from &lt;35% to &gt;97% of animals. Characterizing three patient-specific alleles reveals that <italic>TP53<sup>C176F</sup></italic> partially retains wild-type p53 apoptotic activity that can be exploited, whereas <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> and <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> encode two structurally related proteins with gain-of-function effects that predispose to head musculature ERMS. <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> unexpectedly also predisposes to hedgehog-expressing medulloblastomas in the <italic>kRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic>-driven ERMS-model.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>TP53</italic> is the best-known tumor suppressor protein that is mutated or functionally disrupted in more than 50% of human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muller and Vousden, 2014</xref>). Germline mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> are responsible for Li–Fraumeni syndrome that predisposes to a wide but distinct spectrum of tumors that varies with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malkin, 2011</xref>). Comprehensive analyses of <italic>TP53</italic> function in vivo and in vitro have revealed three different ways by which <italic>TP53</italic> can modulate tumorigenesis. These include effects caused by loss- or gain-of-function or dominant-negative mutations that disrupt the function of wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ko and Prives, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levine et al., 1991</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>TP53</italic> mutation spectrum is likely tumor-specific (e.g., G&gt;T transversions in lung cancer that do not correspond to the classic <italic>TP53</italic> hotspot mutations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olive et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petitjean et al., 2007</xref>). Recent studies looking at <italic>TP53</italic> alterations in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) patients show that <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are correlated with an increased risk of developing RMS and a worse prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shern et al., 2021</xref>); however, the role for specific <italic>TP53</italic> variants in sarcoma progression remains to be defined.</p><p><italic>TP53</italic> mutations are present in &gt;40% of adult carcinomas and thought to play a major role in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gröbner et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> are found in less than 6% of pediatric cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gröbner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shern et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tirode et al., 2014</xref>). One major exception is Li–Fraumeni syndrome, where germline <italic>TP53</italic> mutations predispose individuals to a unique tumor spectrum that includes soft tissue sarcomas, such as RMS, and bone tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guha and Malkin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malkin, 2011</xref>). It is important to also note that the <italic>TP53</italic> pathway is often suppressed in sarcomas. For example, in human embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), a common pediatric cancer of muscle, the <italic>TP53</italic> locus is mutated or deleted in 16% of tumors, while transcriptional activity is altered in &gt;30% of tumors, either through direct locus disruption or MDM2 amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shern et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are also detected in ERMS at relapse, suggesting a role in tumor progression and/or resistance to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mouse models have led the way in understanding <italic>Tp53</italic> function in vivo.

Of note, the tumor spectrum in mice varies depending on the mutant allele and genetic background; however, most in vivo studies have focused on a subset of hotspot mutations compared to a null or heterozygous background, and are seen only in a subset of sarcoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attardi and Donehower, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia and Attardi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guha and Malkin, 2017</xref>). The vast majority of mutations observed in patients have not been interrogated in animal models, but rather function is inferred from these commonly studied hotspot mutants. <italic>TP53</italic> variants likely play different roles depending on tumor type, mutation, or the genetic background, presenting a significant challenge when defining pathogenicity and potential impacts on therapeutic approaches.</p><p>To define p53 biology in vivo, we recently generated a complete loss-of-function <italic>tp53</italic> deletion allele in syngeneic CG1-strain zebrafish using TALEN endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ignatius et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>tp53<sup>del/del</sup></italic> (<italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) zebrafish spontaneously developed a spectrum of tumors that includes malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors (MPNSTs), angiosarcomas, germ cell tumors, and an aggressive natural killer cell-like leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ignatius et al., 2018</xref>). The role for <italic>tp53</italic> in self-renewal and metastasis of <italic>kRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic>-induced ERMS tumors was assessed using cell transplantation assays and revealed that <italic>tp53</italic> loss does not change the overall frequency of ERMS self-renewing cancer stem cells compared to tumors expressing wild-type <italic>tp53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ignatius et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ERMS were more invasive and metastatic compared to <italic>tp53</italic> wild-type tumors, providing new insights into how <italic>tp53</italic> suppresses ERMS progression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ignatius et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, we take advantage of the fact that in zebrafish, similar to humans, p53 loss of function is not required for tumor initiation. We employ <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish to further assess the role for p53 on <italic>kRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic>-driven ERMS and find that wild-type <italic>tp53</italic> is a major tumor suppressor in ERMS, affecting proliferation with a smaller effect on apoptosis. Next, we find that wild-type human <italic>TP53</italic> is functional in zebrafish and potently suppresses ERMS initiation in vivo. We also define the pathogenicity of three <italic>TP53</italic> mutations: (1) a <italic>TP53<sup>C176F</sup></italic> variant found in ERMS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shern et al., 2014</xref>); (2) a <italic>TP53<sup>P153</sup></italic><sup>Δ</sup> variant of unknown significance, found in a teenager with an aggressive osteosarcoma at our clinic; and (3) a p53<sup>Y220C</sup> mutant that is structurally related to p53<sup>P153Δ</sup> and may share some aspects of its function. We find that these three <italic>TP53</italic> mutants have different effects on tumor initiation, location, proliferation, and apoptosis in our zebrafish model.

Interestingly, mutations in P151 and P152 are present in a subset of tumors overlapping with the Y220C mutation (TCGA Research Network data; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov">http://cancergenome.nih.gov</ext-link>). Previous molecular dynamics simulations of p53<sup>Y220X</sup> (X = C, H, N, or S) mutations found that the tri-proline loop (P151-153) is mobile and can precipitate a concerted collapse of the pocket, forming a frequently populated closed state and contributing to p53 instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2020</xref>). Since the binding of small molecules in the pocket increases the stability of p53<sup>Y220X</sup> mutants, it is not inconceivable that mutations lining this pocket such as the tri-proline loop could be involved in fluctuations that decrease structural stability. Similarly, in our static models, the loss of P153 caused this pocket to be slightly occluded, suggesting further destabilization and abnormal p53 function. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> mutation is the ninth most frequent <italic>TP53</italic> missense mutation and is the most common ‘conformational’ <italic>TP53</italic> mutation in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baud et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> allele is frequently associated with sarcomas and head and neck carcinomas, and has been reported in patients with osteosarcoma and RMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castresana et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Overholtzer et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that loss of P153 via an in-frame deletion might result in similar structural defects as <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> by contributing to the overall structural instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Fersht, 2017</xref>). Therefore, we predicted that ERMS tumors expressing <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> may phenocopy <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> with increased ERMS in the head region. To test this hypothesis, we generated ERMS that expressed <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> with <italic>kRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> in <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Western blot analyses confirmed that mutant p53<sup>Y220C</sup> protein was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Kaplan–Meier analyses indicated that while <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> expression inhibited ERMS initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, p&lt;0.0001) and decreased the number of primary ERMS per fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, p&lt;0.0001), <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> expression also led to a significant increase in head ERMS tumors compared to <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals, reminiscent of <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals expressing <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, F and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>; 30.8% of ERMS; n = 150). We confirmed ERMS pathology on tumor sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and G</xref>). Histological analyses confirmed ERMS in 11 of 12 tumor burdened animals, with one tumor displaying characteristics of round blue cell tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also assessed <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic>-expressing tumors for effects on proliferation and apoptosis and similar to <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup>; TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> ERMS, expression <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> decreased tumor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, p&lt;0.0001).

A <italic>TP53<sup>C176F</sup></italic> mutation was identified in a patient with ERMS that displayed functional loss of the second <italic>TP53</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen, 2013</xref>). A second <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> mutation was found as a germline variant in a patient with osteosarcoma. Finally, the <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> mutation is commonly found in sarcomas, including RMS and osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castresana et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Overholtzer et al., 2003</xref>). Using our in vivo assays, we were able to define <italic>TP53<sup>C176F</sup></italic> as a hypomorph with respect to ERMS initiation that retains the ability to induce apoptosis. These findings are consistent with studies showing that <italic>TP53<sup>C176F</sup></italic> does retain some aspects of wild-type p53 function, can form tetramers with wild-type p53, and can differentially induce <italic>TP53</italic> target gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffman-Luca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato et al., 2003</xref>). Compounds like ZMC1 that stabilize mutant protein to enhance p53-mediated tumor cell apoptosis and decrease growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) selectively increased ERMS apoptosis in <italic>tp53</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + <italic>TP53<sup>C176F</sup></italic> but not in <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tumors, further highlighting our assay as an effective in vivo drug efficacy screening tool. Altogether, our data shows that <italic>TP53<sup>C176F</sup></italic> is likely hypomorphic and chemical stabilization of the resulting mutant protein could be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with this allele.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>TP53<sup>C176F</sup></italic> or <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic>, the <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> variant is rare, with only one other known patient reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Michalarea et al., 2014</xref>). This patient was diagnosed with multiple tumors over several decades, including bilateral breast cancer, malignant fibrous histocytoma, and an EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma. The patient’s mother, maternal aunts, and maternal grandmother all experienced early-onset cancers, meeting the criteria for a Li–Fraumeni diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Michalarea et al., 2014</xref>). The specific Proline 153 residue, while in a region that is highly conserved across mammalian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), is not conserved in mice or zebrafish, creating a challenge for modeling endogenous p53<sup>153</sup> expression in vivo. Due to its rarity in the literature and lack of animal models, genetic testing done through Invitae, a medical genetic testing provider, could not assign pathogenicity to <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic>; however, the family experience strongly suggested that this is a Li–Fraumeni variant. Clinically, the patient’s osteosarcoma was extremely aggressive and refractory to multiple anticancer agents. Using our in vivo model, we found that <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> predisposes to head ERMS that are relatively resistant to apoptosis. Currently, no other gene or pathway has been identified in the zebrafish model that predisposes to head tumors, with both <italic>TP53<sup>P153</sup></italic><sup>Δ</sup> and <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> expression in zebrafish leading to an increase in head ERMS. This reveals two <italic>TP53</italic> variants that may have shared gain-of-function effects in ERMS with respect to the initiation of head tumors. Unexpectedly, approximately 20% of tp53<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish expressing <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> also develop medulloblastoma-like tumors with gene signatures consistent with the sonic hedgehog subgroup. Brain tumors have not been observed in <italic>rag2:kRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic> –induced ERMS model, and we did not identify any brain tumors in our <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> or <italic>TP53<sup>C176F</sup></italic> experimental groups. We did identify however one medulloblastoma-like tumor in <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish. Given the rapid onset of ERMS is our model, it is possible that medulloblastoma requires more time to initiate and that removal of ERMS burdened animals from the experiment before 30 days precludes study of additional tumor types in <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals. Tumors in the <italic>tp53<sup>-/-</sup> + TP53</italic><sup><italic>C176F</italic></sup> group grew slowly and experimental animals were followed for up to 90 days, yet no medulloblastoma tumors were observed, suggesting that hypomorphic <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> activity is likely not sufficient to initiate medulloblastoma tumors, in addition to head and neck ERMS.</p><p>Head and neck ERMS represent a significant proportion of all ERMS diagnoses, with the basis of regional predispositions not fully understood. Expression of activated Smoothened protein in mice under the control of the Ap2 promoter results primarily in head and neck ERMS that arise from Kdr-positive endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hatley et al., 2012</xref>). Smoothened is a key component of the hedgehog signaling pathway that is commonly activated in ERMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drummond et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Satheesha et al., 2016</xref>). Modeling in mice indicates that the cell of origin plays a major role in initiation, given that activated Smoothened under the control of a more ubiquitously expressed promoter leads to ERMS tumors in other skeletal muscle populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, a recent analysis of <italic>TP53</italic> in RMS found a higher proportion of head and neck RMS tumors have <italic>TP53</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shern et al., 2021</xref>). Our data suggests that differential features of <italic>TP53<sup>P153Δ</sup></italic> and <italic>TP53<sup>Y220C</sup></italic> may predispose patients to head ERMS via regulation of <italic>kdr</italic> expression, providing additional mechanistic insights into anatomical differences in sarcoma initiation. Therefore, certain <italic>TP53</italic> variants may predispose individuals to head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma tumors; however, the cell of origin for zebrafish head ERMS remains to be identified, as well as whether mutant <italic>TP53</italic> interacts with hedgehog pathway signaling in head ERMS and medulloblastoma.</p><p>Finally, we would like to state the limitation of our zebrafish ERMS model. In Li–Fraumeni patients, <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are germline with somatic modifier mutations occurring secondarily. In our experiments, while our starting point is a tp53<sup>-/-</sup> null background, <italic>kRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic> and the human <italic>TP53</italic> variant allele are introduced at the same time under the control of the <italic>rag2</italic> promoter. A second limitation is that effects of mutant <italic>TP53</italic> in the tumor microenvironment are missed in our assays. However, our assay is rapid, given that the generation of zebrafish strains with germline knock-in of the equivalent mutations takes an average of 2 years for full assessment. In mice, only the most common <italic>Tp53</italic> variants have been fully characterized, and prioritizing which <italic>TP53</italic> mutants to model is a challenge given cost and time restraints. Our mosaic assay bridges a gap, especially for sarcomas where the majority of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations remain uncharacterized. Our finding that expression of three different patient <italic>TP53</italic> variants leads to very different effects on tumor formation highlights the importance of in vivo precision modeling, with our model promising to help further define patient-specific p53 biology. In summary, we highlight that the zebrafish ERMS model can be effective in defining multiple aspects of p53 tumor suppressor function and delineating a spectrum of null, partial loss- and gain-of-function mutational effects in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal studies were approved by the UT Health San Antonio Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol #20150015AR (mice) and 20170101AR (zebrafish).

Efficient nuclease activity of guides 1 and 3 would result in a 334 bp deletion, leading to a predicted frameshift and premature termination of the polypeptide sequence. When this larger deletion does not result from synchronous CRIPSR nuclease activity of guides 1 and 3, similar consequences are likely to result due to independent indels generated from nuclease activity and NHEJ repair at each of the three individual target sites of guides 1, 2, and 3. This region being upstream of the transmembrane domain (aa 773–795), we predict that indels or deletions leading to frameshift mutations would, at best, produce a partial extracellular domain containing polypeptide incapable of transducing signals into the cell.</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Guide</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Target sequence (<bold>PAM</bold>)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Benchling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>) <bold>o</bold>ff-target score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">g1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GGTAGCGATGCACCTGTATA</named-content> (GGG)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">95.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">g2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">CTATAACTTGCGCTGGTATC</named-content> (GGG)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">96.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">g3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">CCTGGCAAGCGTACAAGCCT</named-content> (TGG)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">98.4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Using PCR and TBE-PAGE, the presence of deletions was visualized by small PCR amplicons corresponding to a loss of 334 bp in a 641 bp wild-type PCR product (deletion mutant amplicon = 212 bp). In addition, presence of heteroduplex products was observed via PAGE, indicating the presence of indels. Indels were confirmed by cloning PCR products and sequencing individual clones. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref> are indels +21 bp, –7 bp at the g1 site, 7 bp deletion at the g2 site, and 25 bp deletion at the g3 site. The effectiveness of the three sgRNA/CRISPR guides by way of the spectrum of mutations they cause suggests that despite the mosaicism of the mutations in sgRNA-Cas9-injected embryos, tumors that arise harbor a relatively high-frequency loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>kdr</italic> gene in all tumors. <italic>mitfa</italic> was selected as a control gene because loss-of-function mutations can be easily screened by looking for the loss of pigmentation in developing larvae using brightfield microscopy. In addition to not having an effect on embryo survival and development, it obviates the need to obtain sequence data to confirm the presence of loss-of-function mutations in the embryos.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources, Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con22"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Patient presenting with osteosarcoma signed a Consent to be part of a Repository, Epidemiology of Cancer in Children, Adolescents and Adults.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Maura McGrail (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Are the TP53 alleles really hypomorphic? The cell line work does not address this issue. It should be demonstrated that the proteins retain some level of transcriptional activity. qPCR of P53 target genes (BAX, BBC3/PUMA, PMAIP1/NOXA) in the zebrafish tumor model would address the mechanism by which the human variants can induce apoptosis.</p><p>2) The osteosarcoma cell line work should be removed as it is out of place in this manuscript, given the focus on embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. These should be removed and if any in vitro studies are included, these should be in in an ERM cell line.</p><p>3) Language: For example, the authors overstate their claim in the Introduction, &quot;highlight the zebrafish ERMS model as a powerful and high-throughput system&quot; when they describe examining only 3 specific mutations in this report. This should be addressed throughout to reflect the focus of this work on embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Such focus will improve the communication of this story.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Results and Discussion:</p><p>1. The Langenau et al., 2007 rag2-kRASG12D ERMS model is well established and the results briefly describe the model, but it would be helpful to provide a more thorough description of the model in the first paragraph, particularly since this is a somatic model created by injecting linear DNA expressing rag2 promoter driven kRASG12D and a rag2 promoter driven fluorescent reporter. Data presented later in the manuscript underscores the considerable variability in generating tumors or driving gene expression using this approach. The concentration of DNA injected into single cell embryos to create tumors was indicated in the Methods, but the amount of DNA injected wasn't recorded. Please include. A diagram in figure 1 showing how the model is generated would also be very helpful.</p><p>2. Figure 1. Include the age of the individual fish shown in Figure 1. Some of the arrows point to tissue with DsRed expression, which may or may not be transformed by expression of kRASG12D. It would be useful to explain the criteria used to determine a tumor vs. simply expression of the co-injection marker.</p><p>3. Figure S1C-E The impact of loss of tp53 on the rate of ERMS tumor growth was assessed over a 3 week period using age matched fish. The age of the fish wasn't indicated, but they appear to be adults, not juveniles as shown in Figure 1. Overall, a more complete description of procedures and analyses would strengthen the paper.</p><p>4. Figure S1C-E The text states that metastases were observed in ERMS ; tp53-/- fish #3. A second site tumor isn't visible in the image of fish #3. To support this claim in the text, evidence for metastasis vs. occurrence of a second site primary tumor is required.</p><p>5. Figure 2 A and B. Cellular characterization of the ERMS; tp53-/- tumors reveals increased cellular proliferation compared to ERMS tumors. The numbers for panels A (Edu+ cells) and B (pHH3+ cells) appear to be switched: 2.3 vs. 13.3 should be in B, 21 vs 65.5 should be in A. Does n refer to individual tumors, or individual sections? The data is very strong, but quantification plots should be included with p values for both markers of proliferation.</p><p>6. Figure 2 C-E and Figure 3. The analysis of apoptosis in the ERMS vs. ERMS; tp53 tumors indicates a lack of apoptosis in the tumor model. Figure 3 presents data to show that expression of human Tp53 significantly suppressed tumor initiation and tumor size in ERMS; tp53-/- animals. The data is significant, and indicates a reduction in the number of EdU positive proliferating cells. Given ERMS tumors in a wildtype zebrafish tp53 background have very little apoptosis, the observation that there is an increase in apoptosis could be further clarified.</p><p>7. The comparison of ERMS;tp53-/- with and without expression of human TP53 showed that there isn't a significant difference in the number of tumors per fish. Data is needed to support the claim that expression of human tp53 prevents spreading and/or metastasis.</p><p>8. Figure S3: An experiment testing the dose dependency of tumor suppression was performed by injection of different concentrations of rag:TP53. 15ng/ul vs. 20ng/ul of linear construct was injected. Details on the volume injected, whether this was human tp53 or zebrafish tp53, were not included. In order to demonstrate a dose response, the data should show that there is a significant difference between 15 ng/ul vs. 20 ng/ul, and the experiment completed with at least 3 biological replicates. The data in c shows high variability in tp53 protein levels in individual tumors, without details on the source of the tumors – were they from fish injected with the same dose, or different doses. Overall this data suggests the method of the tumor model and expression of tp53 variants leads to significant inconsistencies. A more thorough analysis is necessary to draw a conclusion about dose dependency.</p><p>9. Figure 4 and Figure 5. The activity of tp53-C176F and tp53-P153∆ were analyzed in osteosarcoma cells, and it was observed neither inhibits cell growth, suppresses colony formation in vitro, drives luciferase expression, or induces apoptosis or expression of p21. This indicates neither mutant has wild type function, transcriptional activation activity, or is a gain of function.</p><p>When expressed in the zebrafish ERMS; tp53-/- model, tp53-C176F can suppress tumor formation (Figure 5B) and lead to increased apoptosis (Figure 5F) – a p value to demonstrate significance should be included. This doesn't match with the lack of apoptosis in ERMS; tp53+/+ data referenced in point 6. Including qPCR analysis of tp53 target gene expression in the zebrafish tumors would address whether tp53-C176F retains some level of wild type activity.</p><p>10. Section heading starting on page 9. Figure 5. The analyses of tp53-C176F and tp53-P153∆ could be placed in separate sections or described in separate paragraphs, so the results documenting effect on tumor incidence, location, effects on proliferation and apoptosis are clearly and systematically described for each mutant in comparison to wild type. In the text tp53-C176F is described as a hypomorph. tp53-P153∆ is described as a gain of function. But the figure legend for Figure 5 indicates both are gain of function.</p><p>Figure 5D. Does the incidence of head tumors occur in relatively young fish? The image in Figure 5D bottom panel appears to be a juvenile fish, in contrast to the adult fish shown in the top and middle panels. The scale bar isn't indicated in the figure legend. This could be an interesting result to follow up – a correlation between age of onset and tumor location.</p><p>11. Figure S5. The critical experiment to demonstrate tp53-C176F is a hypomorph that retains some wildtype function was designed as follows: tp53-C176F was expressed in the ERMS; tp53-/- model, then tumors from control and tp53-C176F were explanted into hosts and the hosts were treated with or without the tp53 stabilizer ZMC1. The representative images in panels D (ERMS; tp53-/- + tp53-C176F) and H (ERMS; tp53 -/-) aren't equivalent – both control groups treated with DMSO should show the same level of tumor growth/expansion; both ZMC1 treatment groups appear to impact tumor expansion equally.</p><p>12. In the Results section &quot;Expression of TP53Y220C predisposes to head ERMS in zebrafish&quot; starting on page 10 there is extensive discussion of the co-occurrence of tp53-P153∆ with tp53-Y220C. This would fit better in the introduction and/or in the discussion.</p><p>13. Figure 6 shows results examining the tp53-Y220C variant on tumor incidence, location, level of apoptosis and proliferation. The switch from co-expressing a DsRed marker to a GFP marker wasn't described.</p><p>Similar to the analysis of tp53-C176F and tp53-P153∆, the tp53-Y220C variant did not demonstrate wild type tp53 activity in in vitro assays, but had a suppressive effect on tumor incidence in the zebrafish ERMS;tp53-/- model. It also appeared to lead to increased incidence of head tumors. Figure 6 D and F doesn't indicate age or size of the fish shown.</p><p>14. Inclusion of a summary diagram or table that maps activities to each tp53 mutant/variant analyzed would help to clarify the key findings of the study.</p><p>15. Overall, there was an absence of detail in the figure legends, number of biological replicates for key experiments, age of fish shown in the images, and scale bar measurements.</p><p>16. Discussion:</p><p>The discussion could better address why overexpression of tp53 variants in the zebrafish ERMS; tp53-/- model could suppress tumor initiation, with or without impact on proliferation and apoptosis, when the same tp53 variants did not have an impact on osteosarcoma cell proliferation, viability, and colony formation in vitro. The conclusion that the variants are either hypomorphs or gain of function alleles would be better supported by demonstrating their effect on gene expression or other cellular activity.</p><p>A number of statements were made that are vague or not supported by the data:</p><p>&quot;when compared to wild-type animals, tp53-/- animals … exhibit a relatively less pronounced effect on tumor cell apoptosis.&quot; &quot;Thus, while TP53 is shown to suppress tumor progression by multiple mechanisms depending on tumor type, our results suggest that loss of TP53 in human ERMS may increase aggressiveness through enhanced proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.&quot; Evidence of invasion or metastasis in the tumor model aren't presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors overstate their claim in the Introduction, &quot;highlight the zebrafish ERMS model as a powerful and high-throughput system&quot; when they describe examining only 3 specific mutations in this report.</p><p>2. More details regarding the transgenic generation approach should be described and the transgenic constructs clearly articulated throughout the Results section. The authors shouldn't assume that readers are familiar with prior strategies undertaken by these authors or by the Langenau lab.</p><p>3. Page 6: in the phrase &quot;Treatment of wild-type and tp53-/- tumors with a 6-hour pulse of EdU&quot; – it needs to be clarified that this is being undertaken in whole larval context.</p><p>4. The concepts of early and late apoptosis need to be properly defined and explained.</p><p>5. Page 6: the phrase &quot;introducing wild-type human TP53 (TP53WT) in ERMS tumors in tp53-/- animals&quot; is not an accurate reflection of what is being undertaken, which is introducing WT TP53 along with the KRAS transgene at the outset rather than adding the gene to already developed tumors, which is how the text currently reads.</p><p>6. The authors should comment on the amino acid conservation between human and zebrafish p53 and how this may impact interactions with other endogenous zebrafish proteins.</p><p>7. Page 8: the statement that the TP53 mutants tested &quot;do not show any gain-of function activity in the SaOS2 TP53-/- background&quot; appears a generalization not justified by the experimental data presented.</p><p>8. The Discussion should reference that the order in which oncogenic mutations occur may impact tumor phenotype and as such, may not be fully reflected in the zebrafish models as presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In many figures, including Figures 1D, 3C, S1E, and S5G, the plots of Tumor/body size or Tumor area ratio showed very high tumor burden in certain groups, the ratios in some plots were even higher than 0.6. Please make sure your studies complied with the IACUC regulation on the tumor size/weight per animal.</p><p>2. Although the SaOS2 cell line is a commonly used assay system to study effects of TP53 variants, the data generated in this cell line were not consistent at all with those obtained from the in vivo zebrafish studies. Could authors discuss this inconsistency? Can authors use ERM cell line(s) instead of the SaOS2 osteosarcoma cell line to assess the activities of the TP53P153△, TP53C176F and TP53Y220C variants? In addition, engineering the cell lines with these exact mutations, not overexpression, would be helpful to accurately characterize their activities in vitro.</p><p>3. Coinjection of either TP53P153△ or TP53Y220C mutant with kRASG12D can increase development of ERMS in the head musculature. However, these two mutants behave very differently in many aspects, such as in kRASG12D-induced tumor initiation (Figures 5B vs. 6C) or in cell survival of ERMs (Figures 5F vs. 6I). Can authors provide clearer explanation on how these two different mutants promote more ERM tumorigenesis in the head musculature? Since it has been hypothesized that both TP53P153△ and TP53Y220C mutants might cause p53 instability, it would be interesting to test whether ZMC1 can stabilize these mutants leading to inhibition of head tumor development. In addition, whether Hedgehog signaling pathway could be specifically activated in the head tumors with overexpression of kRASG12D and TP53P153△ or TP53Y220C?</p><p>4. TP53C176F coinjection with kRASG12D in p53-/- fish can reduce kRASG12D-induced tumorigenesis (Figure 5B) and increase apoptosis (Figure 5F), suggesting TP53C176F functions as a hypomorphic mutant. Can authors examine whether the p21 expression is upregulated in the ERMs with TP53C176F overexpression, which would provide further mechanistic insight on the hypomorphic effect of the TP53C176F mutant.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Defining function of wild-type and three patient specific TP53mutationsin a zebrafish model of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard White (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>There is strong consensus that the manuscript has been substantially improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>First, there appears to be a missing item – Supplemental Table I. Second, the new findings about the occurrence of medulloblastoma in the tp53P153 model should be mentioned in the Abstract.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the revised manuscript addressed the essential revisions and the authors have responded to the reviewer's requests. The revised manuscript also presents two new analyses, which weren't mentioned in the abstract or introduction. A new Figure 5 and supporting figures show identification of medulloblastoma in addition to head ERMS arising in the tp53P153delta ERMS model. A new Figure 7 shows experiments to test the dependence of the tp53P153delta ERMS tumor induction on Kdr, which is overexpressed in patient osteosarcoma and the zebrafish model. The Kdr gene and function of the protein could be better introduced, and the experiment have stronger experimental validation as described below. But the kdr experiment illustrates how this model can be used to investigate the in vivo mechanisms by which patient tp53 variants drive ERMS tumorigenesis.</p><p>Some issues were not adequately addressed: the statement that the model is high throughput has not been removed from the discussion, Figure 2 A, B quantification data was not included and it's still unclear what the numbers in those panels reflect, and new RT-qPCR on p53 target gene expression contained contradictory or inconsistent results. Different tp53 variants did not lead to consistent elevation of apoptotic genes bax, bbc3, noxa, – tp53C176F and tp53P153delta induced expression of bbc3, but not noxa or bax; tp53Y220C increased noxa and cell growth arrest gene gadd54a; cell cycle arrest gene cdkn1a was elevated in all variant models including the tp53 null. A discussion of this data, in the context of demonstrating that the tp53 variants retain some level of transcriptional activity, was not included.</p><p>The experiment to demonstrate ERMS tp53P153delta is dependent on elevated kdr expression via somatic CRISPR RNP kdr targeting did not contain much detail. A more thorough analysis of kdr deletion/mutagenesis in the tumors, kdr transcript knockdown measured by RT-qPCR, would validate the conclusion that Kdr drives oncogenesis in the ERMS tp53P153delta model. Figure 7 Supplement 1 does not contain enough detail explaining how targeted mutagenesis was induced, documented and measured.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done an admirable job responding to previous reviews, resulting in a manuscript that is more logically constructed and better focused in the data presented.</p><p>A few residual comments:</p><p>1. I was not able to find the Supplemental Table that was suggested by reviewers and referred to in the Response to Reviewers that summarizes and highlights the main findings and differences between wild type and various tp53 zebrafish mutants described in the manuscript.</p><p>2. The choice of analyzing the TP53 P153 mutation remains a bit unusual given its rarity and identification as a germline mutation in an aggressive osteosarcoma, given the focus of this manuscript on ERMS (especially now with removal of the osteosarcoma cell line data which contrasted with the zebrafish data).</p><p>3. Moreover this P153 mutation leads to Shh medulloblastoma tumors in a subset of zebrafish. This is new data that is interesting, but a bit of a distraction from the focus of the manuscript on ERMS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68221.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Are the TP53 alleles really hypomorphic?

Second, the amount of kRAS<sup>G12D</sup> or <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type or mutant total DNA injected is kept constant with a mix of 40 ng <italic>rag2-kRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic>/ 20 ng <italic>rag2-dsRED/GFP (</italic>60 ng/μL<italic>)</italic> in experiments in Figure 1 and for the rest of the manuscript 35 ng <italic>rag2-kRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic>/15 ng <italic>rag2-TP53</italic> wild-type or mutant/ 10 ng <italic>rag2-GFP/dsRED</italic> (60 ng/μL).</p><p>Addressing variability in generating tumors. As ERMS tumors arise very quickly within 60 days (2 months) and animals can start breeding on average between 4-6 months, it is not possible to maintain stable rag2:kRAS<sup>G12D</sup> stable transgenic lines. We have attempted to generate conditional transgenic lines (UAS-Gal4 transgenics) in the past and while we have shown that the method works in principle. However, we were unable isolate stable lines that generate tumors possibly due to silencing of the kRAS<sup>G12D</sup> in the germline. To account for variability in our experiments in each figure we perform both experimental and control arms of the experiment at the same time. i.e. on any given day we inject zebrafish (100 to &gt;500) embryos from zebrafish mattings for both experimental groups and raise animals in the exact same conditions. We also perform at least 2 or more independent micro-injection experiments for each analyses. As there are loses of larval zebrafish due to normal animal husbandry, we combine data from experiments that were done close together i.e. within the same 4-8 week period. Thus, while the ERMS in zebrafish model is relatively easy use, each Kaplan Meijer analyses in the figure panel takes on average 3-6 months to complete and for each Kaplan Meijer analyses we have &gt; 100 larval zebrafish per group except for Figure 7F (n&gt;45 in both experimental arms). Additionally, because tumor initiation in the tp53<sup>-/-</sup> background results in &gt;75-97% of the experimental zebrafish initiating tumors it is possible to study more subtle differences between human <italic>TP53</italic> mutants. However, in the zebrafish tp53 wild-type setting, where tumor initiation can vary to about 15-35% of zebrafish getting tumors, it is extremely difficult to discern subtle differences in ERMS initiation. We would like to state that our protocol is a similar to protocols used by the laboratories of Dr. David Langenau, Dr. Thomas Look, Dr. Leonard Zon and former members from these laboratories to generate ERMS, leukemia, neuroblastoma, melanoma and other tumors. Lastly, in murine or zebrafish in vivo tumor models where tumors can take 10 days to a year or more to initiate, biological replicates are not the norm but rather a power calculation used to assess number of animals needed to achieve a p value of &lt;0.05 compared to experimental and the control group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1. Include the age of the individual fish shown in Figure 1. Some of the arrows point to tissue with DsRed expression, which may or may not be transformed by expression of kRASG12D. It would be useful to explain the criteria used to determine a tumor vs. simply expression of the co-injection marker.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated all our figures and provide age of animals. We have previously shown that rag2:dsRED is highly expressed in all ERMS tumors, including in tumors in zebrafish that are &lt; 10 days old. In the muscle, <italic>rag2:dsRED</italic> is expressed at very low levels which is not easily observable in non-tumor muscle cells even in the <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>rag2-GFP)</italic> or <italic>Tg (rag2-dsRED)</italic> transgenic animals and hence easy to exclude from our analyses. We have previously confirmed tumors and developed methods to stage our ERMS tumors in experiments and show by co-labeling that even the earliest rag2:DsRED tumors that occur in one half or single somites express high levels of tumor propagating cell marker <italic>myf5-GFP</italic> and these early stage tumors were also confirmed via histology (Ignatius et al., Cancer Cell 2012). In our manuscript, we are being conservative and calling only stage 2 and above tumors, we also confirm tumors by performing HandE staining on a subset of all our tumors in all figures/experiments and the histology has been confirmed by soft tissue expert pathologist Dr. Eleanor Chen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure S1C-E The impact of loss of tp53 on the rate of ERMS tumor growth was assessed over a 3 week period using age matched fish.

Figure S1C-E The text states that metastases were observed in ERMS ; tp53-/- fish #3. A second site tumor isn't visible in the image of fish #3. To support this claim in the text, evidence for metastasis vs. occurrence of a second site primary tumor is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, the experiments we have done in the primary tumor setting cannot exclude the possibility that tumors occurring at secondary sites are not a primary tumor at the secondary site. Since suppression of invasion and metastasis effects of wild-type tp53 have already been previously established in a transplant model using syngeneic zebrafish (Ignatius et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2018) and invasion and metastasis is not directly relevant to our current study, we have removed this analyses from our revised manuscript. Secondly, as tumors in tp53<sup>-/-</sup> mutants initiate in younger animals and grow rapidly we had to pick from the subset that occur later and are smaller slower growing in order to carry out this analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 2 A and B. Cellular characterization of the ERMS; tp53-/- tumors reveals increased cellular proliferation compared to ERMS tumors. The numbers for panels A (Edu+ cells) and B (pHH3+ cells) appear to be switched: 2.3 vs. 13.3 should be in B, 21 vs 65.5 should be in A. Does n refer to individual tumors, or individual sections? The data is very strong, but quantification plots should be included with p values for both markers of proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer in pointing out this discrepancy. We have updated our figures and figure legends to point out how these counts were performed. In panels A and B, we are estimating the percentage of Edu+ cells compared to the total number of DAPI-positive nuclei which are also dsRED-positive (Tumor). In B we calculate the total number of pHH3-positive nuclei in 6 confocal sections. Since much fewer cells are actively undergoing mitosis compared to those in S phase (Edu labeling), this sampling is able to overcome the variability of performing counts on single sections. In the figure we show one section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 2 C-E and Figure 3. The analysis of apoptosis in the ERMS vs. ERMS; tp53 tumors indicates a lack of apoptosis in the tumor model. Figure 3 presents data to show that expression of human Tp53 significantly suppressed tumor initiation and tumor size in ERMS; tp53-/- animals. The data is significant, and indicates a reduction in the number of EdU positive proliferating cells. Given ERMS tumors in a wildtype zebrafish tp53 background have very little apoptosis, the observation that there is an increase in apoptosis could be further clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have included a statement in the text to clarify this difference. We believe the increased apoptosis seen in tumors co-expressing zebrafish or human WT <italic>TP53</italic> is due to higher levels of the wild-type protein. This is a limitation of our experimental set up, but it is also the approach that is commonly used to study effects of oncogenes, for example, Myc, Notch, Akt2, or tumor suppressors for example, <italic>bbc3/ puma</italic>, <italic>noxa</italic> on tumor biology in zebrafish cancer models (Blackburn et al., 2014; Langenau et al., 2007; Lobbardi et al., 2017; White, Rose, and Zon, 2013). In order to ensure we are not expressing high levels of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins, we compared the amount of mutant or wild-type protein expressed to mutant p53 in the Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. Rh30 cells express the p53<sup>R273C</sup> hotspot mutant protein. It is important to note that mutant p53 proteins can be highly expressed in tumors and the p53<sup>C176F</sup> and p53<sup>P153Δ</sup> mutant proteins studied here are highly expressed via IHC and western blot analyses (see Figure 4C, D). Further, our data also show that methods that can reactivate wild-type or mutant protein can also effect apoptosis if induced sufficiently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The comparison of ERMS;tp53-/- with and without expression of human TP53 showed that there isn't a significant difference in the number of tumors per fish. Data is needed to support the claim that expression of human tp53 prevents spreading and/or metastasis.</p></disp-quote><p>Since in primary tumors we are unable to study metastasis and the data we have is mostly corelative, we have removed invasion and metastasis from the manuscript and focus on effects on tumor initiation, tumor number, growth, proliferation, apoptosis and site of tumor initiation. We do find that compared to tumors that initiate in the tp53<sup>-/-</sup> background, overall fewer <italic>TP53</italic> or <italic>Tp53</italic> expressing animals initiate tumors. However, in the tp53<sup>-/-</sup> background in zebrafish expressing rag2:kRAS<sup>G12D,</sup> rag2:TP53 and rag2:dsRED in tumor burdened zebrafish multiple tumors can initiate per animal suggesting possibly non-cell autonomous roles for <italic>tp53</italic> in tumor initiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure S3: An experiment testing the dose dependency of tumor suppression was performed by injection of different concentrations of rag:TP53. 15ng/ul vs. 20ng/ul of linear construct was injected. Details on the volume injected, whether this was human tp53 or zebrafish tp53, were not included. In order to demonstrate a dose response, the data should show that there is a significant difference between 15 ng/ul vs. 20 ng/ul, and the experiment completed with at least 3 biological replicates. The data in c shows high variability in tp53 protein levels in individual tumors, without details on the source of the tumors – were they from fish injected with the same dose, or different doses. Overall this data suggests the method of the tumor model and expression of tp53 variants leads to significant inconsistencies. A more thorough analysis is necessary to draw a conclusion about dose dependency.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have removed the 20 ng/μL arm from our analyses and include data only for the 15 ng/μL arm as this corresponds to the amount of <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type and mutant DNA we use in all our analyses. All western blots analyses were from the 15 ng/μL injections of the small tumors that arise from this injection.

Figure 4 and Figure 5. The activity of tp53-C176F and tp53-P153∆ were analyzed in osteosarcoma cells, and it was observed neither inhibits cell growth, suppresses colony formation in vitro, drives luciferase expression, or induces apoptosis or expression of p21.

We would like to note that while the SaOS2 and other <italic>TP53</italic> deficient cells have traditionally used to characterize mutant <italic>TP53</italic> function a significant subset of mutants do not show any phenotypes or show mutant p53 effects only in some and not in other assay systems. Additionally, whether <italic>TP53</italic> mutants can have GOF effects remains controversial in some tumors for example leukemia (Boettcher et al., 2019). We initially added the SaOS2 data to highlight that the SaOS2 cell based system may not be optimal for the mutants we study. However, as we have not tested other cell systems and have not generated knock-in alleles for these mutants in ERMS cells lines, we cannot fully support this assertion and have accordingly removed the SaOS2 data as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When expressed in the zebrafish ERMS; tp53-/- model, tp53-C176F can suppress tumor formation (Figure 5B) and lead to increased apoptosis (Figure 5F) – a p value to demonstrate significance should be included.

However, we do find that the head tumors grow slightly more slowly. To clearly reveal the head tumor phenotypes, we waited until the tumors were more prominent. This is consistent with our finding that the tumors in the tp53<sup>-/-</sup> background come up quickly and grow rapidly. We also generated head ERMS tumors expressing <italic>TP53<sup>P153</sup></italic><sup>Δ</sup> in the syngeneic CG1; tp53<sup>-/-</sup> background. We expanded 3 head tumors expressing <italic>TP53<sup>P153</sup></italic><sup>Δ</sup> and also 3 tp53<sup>-/-</sup> tumors (1 head and 2 trunk tumors), sorted pure secondary tumors and performed RNAseq analyses across both groups. Rather unexpectedly, the head tumors we isolated were all pro-neural brain tumors with gene signatures consistent with the sonic hedgehog sub-group of medulloblastoma (See new Figure 5). To address how frequent the medulloblastoma tumors were, we generated additional tumors with the following genotypes kRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/ tp53<sup>-/-</sup>, kRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/ <italic>TP53<sup>P153</sup></italic><sup>Δ</sup>, tp53<sup>-/-</sup> and kRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/ TP53<sup>C176F</sup>, tp53<sup>-/-</sup>.

In mice, only the most common <italic>Tp53</italic> variants have been fully characterized and prioritizing which <italic>TP53</italic> mutants to model is a challenge given cost and time restraints.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

In many figures, including Figures 1D, 3C, S1E, and S5G, the plots of Tumor/body size or Tumor area ratio showed very high tumor burden in certain groups, the ratios in some plots were even higher than 0.6. Please make sure your studies complied with the IACUC regulation on the tumor size/weight per animal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Our studies comply with our IACUC protocol. In the tumor initiation studies in Figure 1B, 1D, 3 B, 3C we are scoring for tumors at the earliest time point 10-20 days at which time in the tp53-/- animals that initiate tumors are removed from the analyses. An important criteria is if the animals are experiencing any distress or are showing differences in their ability to swim. Since the muscle is the major tissue in the zebrafish at 10-20 days most of the tumor burdened animals are in-distinguishable from the no tumor animals under the naked eye and fluorescence is the only way to distinguish the difference. We also present new figure 5 to follow medulloblastomas that occur in the zebrafish brain. In these experiments as the tumors are slower growing and unexpected, we allow the tumors to grow a little bit to help with the histology before we euthanize the animals. In the adult animals (Figure S5G now S4D,H), we again are using fluorescence area and intensity to estimate relative size and growth rates. In these animals the tumors are again on a subset of the normal tissue and externally visible only if they grow locally. In all our experiments death is not an end point and any animal experiencing distress is immediately euthanized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although the SaOS2 cell line is a commonly used assay system to study effects of TP53 variants, the data generated in this cell line were not consistent at all with those obtained from the in vivo zebrafish studies. Could authors discuss this inconsistency? Can authors use ERM cell line(s) instead of the SaOS2 osteosarcoma cell line to assess the activities of the TP53P153△, TP53C176F and TP53Y220C variants? In addition, engineering the cell lines with these exact mutations, not overexpression, would be helpful to accurately characterize their activities in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the studies in the SaOS2 cells which are <italic>TP53</italic> deficient osteosarcoma cells do not agree with in vivo studies in our zebrafish embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma model.

Coinjection of either TP53P153△ or TP53Y220C mutant with kRASG12D can increase development of ERMS in the head musculature. However, these two mutants behave very differently in many aspects, such as in kRASG12D-induced tumor initiation (Figures 5B vs. 6C) or in cell survival of ERMs (Figures 5F vs. 6I). Can authors provide clearer explanation on how these two different mutants promote more ERM tumorigenesis in the head musculature? Since it has been hypothesized that both TP53P153△ and TP53Y220C mutants might cause p53 instability, it would be interesting to test whether ZMC1 can stabilize these mutants leading to inhibition of head tumor development. In addition, whether Hedgehog signaling pathway could be specifically activated in the head tumors with overexpression of kRASG12D and TP53P153△ or TP53Y220C?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and have addressed them with the following four sets of experiments.</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>We tried to generate <italic>TP53<sup>P153</sup></italic><sup>Δ</sup> in the syngeneic CG1; tp53<sup>-/-</sup> background but unexpectedly discovered that <italic>TP53<sup>P153</sup></italic><sup>Δ</sup> can collaborate with kRASG12D and tp53 loss to initiate medulloblastomas with a sonic hedgehog signature.

This whole project was initiated because of a patient in our clinic with an aggressive osteosarcoma who responded very poorly to therapy. The patient had a rare germline <italic>TP53</italic> variant of unknown significance (Dr. Amanda Lipsitt attending physician-Second author). The rare <italic>TP53</italic> variant and the patient history where the mom also succumbed to osteosarcoma suggested to us that this may be a gain of function mutant. Assessing the literature, we were surprised that for such a well-known gene, the majority of mutations in sarcoma (osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma) were uncharacterized and had a different spectrum from the mutations in adult cancers and from those modelled in mice. Since a robust osteosarcoma model in zebrafish is lacking, we decided to test if the <italic>TP53</italic> variant was able to show different effects from the <italic>tp53</italic> null background in our zebrafish ERMS model. The advantage of this model is that tumor initiation occurs as early as 7-10 days and in most analyses majority of the tumors initiate by 60 days. Finally, we unexpectedly found that &gt;97% of animals initiate tumors in the tp53 null background. This enabled us to assess differences in tumor initiation and the retention of wild-type function in <italic>TP53</italic> variants. However, to understand if our system worked, we had to define human wild-type <italic>TP53</italic> and at least one other mutant that was present in a patient with ERMS. These were our controls.</p><p>Our unbiased approach has revealed that the zebrafish ERMS model can be used to assess effects on tumor initiation, apoptosis, proliferation, site of tumor initiation and also in the rag2-kRAS<sup>G12D</sup> ERMS model the initiation of medulloblastoma tumors. We also find that the different <italic>TP53</italic> mutants/variants can differentially regulate the expression of well-known p53 direct transcriptionally regulated genes <italic>puma, noxa, baxa</italic> and <italic>gadd45a</italic>. Specifically, we find that the <italic>TP53<sup>153</sup></italic><sup><italic>Δ</italic></sup> is a pathogenic gain of function mutant that predisposes to head ERMS and also the hedgehog-positive sub-type of medulloblastoma tumors. <italic>TP53<sup>153</sup></italic><sup><italic>Δ</italic></sup> also directly or indirectly regulates <italic>kdr</italic> expression to promote head ERMS formation. Medulloblastoma initiation in the rag2-kRAS<sup>G12D</sup> ERMS model has never been reported and strongly supports our finding that <italic>TP53<sup>153</sup></italic><sup><italic>Δ</italic></sup> displays gain-of-function effects with respect to site of ERMS initiation and the initiation of medulloblastoma tumors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
