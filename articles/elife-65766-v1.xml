consumption decisions—we ingest foods that taste good and reject those that don't. Gustatory cortex (GC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) almost certainly work together to mediate palatability-driven behavior, but the precise nature of their interplay during taste decision-making is still unknown. To probe this issue, we discretely perturbed (with optogenetics) activity in rats’ BLA→GC axons during taste deliveries. This perturbation strongly altered GC taste responses, but while the perturbation itself was tonic (2.5 s), the alterations were not—changes preferentially aligned with the onset times of previously-described taste response epochs, and reduced evidence of palatability-related activity in the ‘late-epoch’ of the responses without reducing the amount of taste identity information available in the ‘middle epoch.’ Finally, BLA→GC perturbations changed behavior-linked taste response dynamics themselves, distinctively diminishing the abruptness of ensemble transitions into the late epoch. These results suggest that BLA ‘organizes’ behavior-related GC taste dynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gustatory cortex</kwd><kwd>basolateral amygdala</kwd><kwd>neural ensembles</kwd><kwd>taste dynamics</kwd><kwd>palatability</kwd><kwd>rats</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC006666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>Donald B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC016706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Jian-You</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IBN180002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>Donald B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Blocking input from basolateral amygdala to gustatory cortex (GC) severely reduces the coherence of GC ensemble activity, which negatively affects epochal dynamics involved in driving palatability-driven consumption.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A significant part of our daily lives is spent on acquiring and consuming food and drink. The ultimate goal of this pursuit is the ingestion of nutrients that satisfy bodily needs and maintain physiological health, but our food choices are seldom consciously made to satisfy such needs. Rather, we eat food that is delicious, regardless of whether it is nutritious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marshall et al., 2017</xref>). In many situations, this still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berridge, 2000</xref>) drive to consume high-palatability food overwhelms and subverts the need for nutrition (e.g. binge eating; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yeomans et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Given the centrality of palatability to consumption decisions, it is unsurprising that palatability-related activity is prominent in gustatory cortical (GC) taste response dynamics. Across the 0.2–1.5 s period following taste delivery (the initial 0.2 s of responses is non-specific), GC neural ensembles progress through a sequence of processing ‘epochs,’ such that, after briefly coding chemosensory information (the taste ‘Identity Epoch’), responses become dominated by activity correlated with hedonics (the ‘Palatability Epoch;’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fontanini and Katz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sadacca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maier and Katz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sadacca et al., 2016</xref>). The transition between these epochs occurs suddenly and coherently across GC, a fact that can be observed using ensemble analyses such as Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sadacca et al., 2016</xref>). These analyses make it possible, despite significant trial-to-trial variability, to accurately identify the onset latency of the Palatability Epoch in single trials, and thereby to show that this ensemble event accurately predicts the onset of palatability-specific orofacial responses (e.g. gaping, an egestive response typically evoked by aversive bitter taste stimuli; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sadacca et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, perturbing the neural activity preceding this transition interferes with production of these palatability-driven behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The very nature of GC taste response dynamics themselves—their complexity, their coherence, and the transitions in functionality—implies the functioning of complex networks, suggesting that GC does not perform this task alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, GC does receive potentially relevant input from several brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krettek and Price, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saper, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1991</xref>), notably including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a region that: (1) is reciprocally connected with GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stone et al., 2011</xref>); (2) codes taste palatability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontanini et al., 2009</xref>); and (3) participates generally in reward-guided behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nishijo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blundell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balleine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holland and Gallagher, 2004</xref>). As palatability-related information emerges one epoch earlier in BLA than in GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontanini et al., 2009</xref>), it could be suggested that taste hedonics are ‘passed’ between the two. Support for this specific hypothesis has come from a study showing that pharmacological inactivation of BLA impacts GC taste coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piette et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The interpretability of this earlier study is limited by several factors, however. First, whole-region pharmacological inhibition impacts all projection pathways; the effect of BLA inhibition on GC taste coding could be wildly indirect, involving (among others) brain regions such as lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krettek and Price, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saper et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berk and Finkelstein, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petrovich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthoud and Münzberg, 2011</xref>) and/or the parabrachial nuclei in the pons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lundy and Norgren, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2005</xref>), both of which also code taste palatability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baez-Santiago et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition persists for hours, a fact that introduces the possibility that circuit plasticity (rather than real-time inactivation) might explain the manipulation’s effect on GC coding, and that also renders within-session comparisons of conditions impossible (greatly limiting the hypotheses that can be tested).</p><p>Here, we use pathway-specific optogenetics to directly test whether (and how) BLA input controls GC population coding of taste palatability. We discretely perturbed BLA→GC axons for 2.5 s starting at the time of taste delivery, without silencing somas in either structure. Our results demonstrate that this perturbation impacts GC taste responses in an ‘epoch-wise’ manner, in that: (1) the likelihood of firing-rate changes peaks at epoch onset times, despite the perturbation itself being tonic; (2) the perturbation reduces Palatability Epoch content, without reducing Identity Epoch information; and (3) the loss of BLA input ‘blurs’ the onset of the Palatability Epoch by reducing the suddenness of the firing-rate transition in all neurons in the ensembles. These data suggest BLA to be more involved in the organization of emergent network dynamics than in the delivery of palatability information to GC per se.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Perturbation of BLA→GC axons (BLA→GCx) impacts taste responses</title><p>We analyzed AAV-induced gene expression <italic>via</italic> immunohistochemical evaluation of the presence of GFP.

Note the cell body staining in BLA, and the utter lack of cell body staining in GC, where expression is restricted to axon filaments. ArchT (which in this case co-expresses with GFP) is carried from the injection site in BLA in a purely anterograde direction, and a subset of infected axons terminate in the ventral part of GC—a result consistent with earlier rat and mouse data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levitan et al., 2019</xref>).

For two recording sessions/rat (separated by one rest day), a battery of basic tastes (sucrose, NaCl, citric acid, and quinine HCl) were delivered via IOC. The impact of BLA→GCx on GC activity was analyzed using a ‘within-subject’ approach, whereby we compared GC neural responses in Laser-Off and Laser-On trials. Preliminary analyses revealed that neither the percentage of recoded neurons impacted by laser stimulation nor the direction of impact (suppression vs enhancement) significantly differed between the first and second sessions (all <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> &lt;1). Nor did strength of impact (<italic>t</italic>-values comparing control and perturbed trials) significantly differ between recording sessions (<italic>F</italic> = 1.95, p&gt;0.05). This pattern of results suggests that in the current experimental setting, the novelty of tastes (i.e., difference in taste familiarity between 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> sessions) plays little role in the impact of BLA→GCx on GC taste response. Accordingly, data from the two sessions were pooled together, without inclusion of session as an additional analysis variable.</p><p>Activation of the optical silencer ArchT in BLA→GC axons ( i.e. laser illumination of GC) at the time of taste delivery had a strong impact on taste responses, but it was immediately clear that this impact wasn’t a simple general reduction of taste response magnitude. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows representative examples of the various ways in which BLA→GCx changed GC taste activity. Each panel shows raster plots (top) and the peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH; bottom) of the taste response of a single GC neuron to taste presentation, with laser-on and laser-off trials plotted separately. For the purpose of visualization, the responses shown here were averaged across all taste trials (these examples were chosen on the basis of the impact of laser stimulation being comparable for all taste stimuli). In some cases, taste responses were unaffected by the laser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas in others the responses were enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and in still others they were reduced in magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Panels A-D: GC taste responses with raster plots (top) and peri-stimulus histogram (bottom; averaged across all taste trials) during Laser-Off and Laser-On trials.</title><p>Each panel shows a representative GC neuron whose activity: (<bold>A</bold>) was not modulated, (<bold>B</bold>) increased, (<bold>C</bold>) immediately decreased, or (<bold>D</bold>) had a delayed decrease due to BLA→GCx.

Even with sub-threshold (i.e. non-significant [<italic>ts</italic> &lt; 1]) changes included in the plot, positive and negative firing-rate changes are found in the same neuron only once. The influence of BLA on GC activity can be to increase or decrease firing, but is largely unimodal for individual neurons.</p><p>Furthermore, the response changes wrought by the laser did not simply reflect the laser-on time: the initial 150–200 ms of the responses (i.e. the period preceding the two taste coding epochs) was unaffected by the laser (only ~10% of our GC neurons were affected in this early period by the perturbation, also see Figures 5C and 6A), and in some cases the latency to the laser’s impact was substantially longer (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The dispersion of these latencies appears, at least visually, to reflect the timing of the epochs making up the dynamics of GC taste responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fontanini and Katz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller and Katz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sadacca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maier and Katz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sadacca et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Below, we unpack and test these observed impacts of BLA→GCx on taste response firing in whole sample analyses—first examining the magnitudes and directions of the firing rate changes, and then the epoch-specific nature of the changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Both enhancement and suppression of GC taste response firing are wrought by optogenetic perturbation of BLA→GC axons</title><p>A total of 55.7% of the recorded GC neurons (78 out of 140) produced taste responses that were impacted by BLA→GCx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>: pie chart on the left).

The ease with which neuron groups could be distinguished using this criterion is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, along with representative neurons of each type (note the difference in the 2nd half width of the two action potentials). Consistent with a great deal of prior research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quirk et al., 2009</xref>), putative INs showed (on average) significantly higher basal firing rates than did putative PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Classification of putative interneurons (INs) and pyramidal cells (PCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Given the radical difference in waveforms between INs and PCs (representative examples of each type shown on the top of the figure), neuronal type assignment was based on the half-spike width (calculated from valley to the post-valley peak); units with width &lt;0.35 ms are marked as INs (red dots) while those with width &gt;0.35 ms are classified as PCs (blue dots).

This result is consistent with data (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saper, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1991</xref>) suggesting that BLA→GC projection neurons provide excitatory glutamatergic input to both PCs and INs: it would be expected that some changes in PC responding came directly via loss of (excitatory) BLA input, and some as the indirect effect of a loss of input to inhibitory INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haley et al., 2016</xref>); the fact that only a small portion of INs showed enhanced firing rates, meanwhile, likely reflects the fact that INs were impacted mostly by direct loss of BLA input (because PCs in sensory cortices make fewer local connections; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haley et al., 2016</xref>). Beyond this basic property, however, we observed no significant neuron-type differences—BLA→GCx changed taste responsiveness, specificity, or palatability-related activity similarly for INs and PCs (all Chi-Squared &gt;0.05), a result consistent with our previous studies showing little evidence of neuron-type specificity in GC taste coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fontanini and Katz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2007</xref>).

A comparison of our data with datasets previously collected in our lab (specifically, data collected as part of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>), however, allows us to reject this hypothesis, in that the impact of our manipulation is qualitatively different from direct optogenetic perturbation of GC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For one thing, our manipulation altered the taste responses of ~50% of recorded GC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); direct activation of ArchT expressed in GC somas, meanwhile, changes the taste responses of almost all of the neurons (91% of the recorded population; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B1</xref>). The nature of the changes differs between the two preparations, as well: 87.9% of the response changes caused by direct optical perturbation of GC neurons involve suppression of firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B2</xref>)—a significantly different percentage than that caused by BLA→GCx in this experiment (60% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 17.07, p&lt;0.01).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Comparisons between laser perturbation on GC somas and BLA→GC axons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GC recording was done ~4 weeks after ArchT AAV virus was infused into GC.

When GC somas are themselves led to express ArchT channels, in contrast, laser illumination of GC causes immediate, steeply developing changes that reach asymptote within ~250 ms.

A bi-modal fit of the data suggested the timing these peaks to be 347.28 (SD = 110) and 754.39 ms (SD = 179), and attempts to fit the data with an exponential decay function produced a lower coefficient of determination (an index of absolute goodness of a fit) than that of the Gaussian mixture model; moreover, the error scores at each time bin (i.e. estimated values – raw values) were significantly smaller with the bi-modal Gaussian fit than those with exponential fit (<italic>t(24)</italic> = −2.39, p&lt;0.05).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Dynamics revealed in analysis of impact latency and duration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram of impact latencies occurring post-taste delivery.

This difference between epochs is significant (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 5.86, p&lt;0.05), and it means that the majority of the effects of BLA→GCx are felt in the time period in which palatability-related processing is found.</p><p>In summary, 2.5 s perturbations of BLA input to GC change taste-driven activity in ways that are both non-random and complex—firing is modulated in specific relation to the dynamics that characterize GC taste processing.

Below, we test these two hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Perturbing BLA→GC axons selectively impacts (late epoch) palatability coding</title><p>Unlike taste responses in GC, those in BLA contain only two epochs, with the early detection epoch transitioning directly into the palatability-rich information epoch at ~200 ms following taste delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontanini et al., 2009</xref>). The lack of identity-related activity in BLA, the well-known involvement of BLA in value coding (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Malvaez et al., 2019</xref>), and epoch-specific laser impact on firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) together led us to hypothesize that: (1) taste discriminability would be at most only minimally altered by perturbation of BLA→GC axons—that our ability to identify the administered taste stimuli on the basis of GC single-neuron responses (and more particularly from responses in the middle, ‘Identity’ epoch) would survive the perturbation of BLA input, despite changes in absolute firing rates; and that (2) palatability processing, which is part and parcel of the Late epoch, would in contrast be greatly affected by BLA→GCx.</p><p>To assess the proposed (lack of) influence of BLA→GCx on GC identity coding, we first brought repeated-measures ANOVAs to bear on Identity epoch responses in laser and no-laser trials (separately), directly evaluating the incidence of taste specificity (i.e. whether a given neuron responded differently at least to one taste from other tastes across the first 2 s of taste processing) in each condition. While the perturbation did significantly change the firing rates of a large number (78 out of 140 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) of neurons, we observed little evidence that BLA→GCx changed the incidence of taste-specific responses—the percentage of GC neurons responding in a taste-specific manner was identical (71.4%) in the two trial types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Laser perturbation of BLA→GC axons has little impact on GC taste specificity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The numbers of taste-specific neurons (71.4%) in Laser Off and Laser On trials are essentially identical.

Note that more than 50% of our GC sample responded to each taste; the fact that this percentage is far higher than 1/4 of 71.4% (the percentage of neurons that produced taste specific responses) means that GC neurons are broadly tuned—a result that is consistent with the vast majority of electrophysiological datasets involving &gt;1–2 deliveries of each taste. GC neurons remained broadly tuned even when BLA→GC axons were perturbed via optogenetic inhibition, such that a chi-squared analysis failed to identify a significant difference between conditions (Laser Off vs. On; <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 2.78, p&gt;0.05).</p><p>Given the fact that BLA→GCx changed firing rates in GC taste responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref> imply that similar numbers of taste responses were created and destroyed by BLA→GCx. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> confirms this implication: several taste responses were lost when activity in BLA→GC axons was perturbed, but for each GC neuron for which taste specificity was lost, another neuron became a taste-specific neuron. Although BLA→GCx changed the specific composition of the neural ensembles producing taste-specific responses, the tastes continued to be coded by similarly sized GC populations when BLA input to GC was perturbed.</p><p>Of course, it remains possible that the magnitude of taste-specific information contained in the firing of each taste-responsive neuron was reduced by this manipulation—that despite there being similar numbers of taste-specific responses in both types of trials, the average ‘magnitude’ of taste specificity in the responses was reduced by the axonal perturbation. To evaluate this possibility, we asked how well tastes could be identified by these responses by subjecting the data from sets of simultaneously recorded GC neurons to a jack-knife classification test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foffani and Moxon, 2004</xref>), testing the specific hypothesis that perturbation of BLA input reduces the distinctiveness (i.e. classifiability) of GC taste responses.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, we failed to find substantial support for this hypothesis, in that BLA→GCx again proved to have little impact on the taste specificity of GC firing: the left panel confirms that GC single-neuron activity was reliably taste-specific—the classifier allowed us to correctly identify each administered taste (x-axis) on more than 50% of the held-out trials (y-axis), a percentage far higher than chance (25%). An essentially identical result was obtained from trials in which BLA input to GC was perturbed; furthermore, this held true regardless of whether we performed the analysis on whole-trial data or limited our analysis to firing within the Identity epoch.</p><p>The above result suggests that GC taste responses are discriminable in the absence of BLA input. This does not mean that the responses are unchanged by BLA→GCx, however; in fact, many Identity epoch responses were clearly changed by the input perturbation. To directly determine whether GC uses the same or different taste codes across laser conditions, we tested whether a classifier trained on one laser condition could be used to predict taste trials obtained from the other condition. The result of this analysis is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; in this case, each bar represents the overall percentage of trials correctly predicted across different training/testing conditions.</p><p>The results of this analysis are plain: when the classifier was trained and tested on trials within the same laser condition (the solid gray and green bars), 64% of control trials and 58% of perturbed trials were correctly classified—the patterns of performance, both well above chance, do not differ from one another, demonstrating that BLA→GCx had no deleterious impact on the quality of coding content (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 2.96, p&gt;0.05). Classification performance dropped, however, when the classifier was tested and trained on different trial types (left hatched green bar; <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 5.22, p&lt;0.05), a reduction that became significantly worse (45% correctness; right hatched green bar) when the analysis was focused on neurons for which firing rates were changed by the input perturbation (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 30.22, p&lt;0.001). Thus, while GC remains taste discriminative without BLA input, coding for taste identity is altered.</p><p>But this result, whereby inhibition of BLA→GC axons changes firing without having measurable impact on the magnitude of GC taste coding in the first ~750 ms of taste responses, contrasts strongly with the result of this same perturbation on Late-epochal palatability-related activity.

These data would be expected to hover close to the gray dashed ‘unity’ (slope = 1) line in this plot if BLA→GCx failed to influence the precipitousness of single-neuron firing rate changes; in fact, however, a regression analysis of the data revealed that slope (0.42) of the fitting line to be significantly shallower than 1 (p&lt;0.05). To probe further, we grouped the data into intervals of slope ranges calculated in control trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>); perturbation of activity in BLA→GC axons reduced the rate of firing rate changes (p<italic>s</italic> &lt; 0.05) across most of these intervals. This pattern of results strongly supports the hypothesis that the firing rate changes of most neurons in an ensemble were ‘blurred’ in the vicinity of the transition into palatability-related firing when BLA→GC axon activity was perturbed. In other words, disconnecting GC from BLA kept the single neurons within the GC network from changing their firing rates quickly in the vicinity of the transition into palatability-relatedness; this in turn explains the loss of suddenness in the GC ensemble transition into the Palatability state.</p><p>We went on to test the second possible mechanism for the ensemble results, asking whether BLA→GCx might have (also) directly disorganized ensembles such that the simultaneity of the transitions was reduced. We identified the times at which each single neuron’s firing-rate changes in the vicinity of calculated state transitions reached their maximal slopes (see Materials and methods); these data allow us to determine whether the spread of these times within a simultaneously recorded neural ensemble differed depending on trial type.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref> shows the result of this analysis. While inspection of the figure reveals a good deal of noise in the distributions (likely the result of the small sample), it does not suggest any major differences in the spread of the distribution. Certainly the difference between distributions failed to reach significance (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 13.93, p&gt;0.05), indicating that the coherence of the timing of the GC response dynamic has not been altered by the perturbation of BLA→GC projections, a result consistent with the analysis that found comparable means of the distributions between each trial type (OFF vs ON trials: −17.98 ± 5.29 ms vs. −16.23 ± 5.51 ms). This conclusion is further corroborated by examination, ensemble by ensemble, of the means and standard deviations of the distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref> inset), which again appear very similar (<italic>t</italic>(6) = −0.33, p&gt;0.05). Overall, the loss of the normally observed sharp ensemble transitions into palatability-related firing appears to not reflect decoupling of still sharp single-neuron transitions, but rather an alteration of the basic functioning of the networks, such that entire ensembles of neurons fail to cleanly transition from one state to the next.</p><p>The impact of BLA→GCx on slopes changes during state transition times is not universal but epoch-dependent. We repeated the same analysis depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> on firing rate changes comprising transitions into the identity state (which typically occurred 100–600 ms after taste delivery). We found very little impact of BLA→GCx on either the sharpness or timing of these firing-rate changes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref> displays the slopes of this earlier transition for each neuron, with control trials plotted against perturbed trials. As revealed by a regression analysis, the fit line (slope = 0.79; red solid line) did not differ significantly from unity (p&gt;0.05), indicating that the perturbation has little impact on the firing rate changes when the ensemble is transitioning into the identity state. This null effect was confirmed when the range of slopes observed in control trials was divided into subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>); an ANOVA conducted on these data revealed no significant main effect of Laser (<italic>F(1,58)</italic> = 1.44, p&gt;0.05) and no significant interaction (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1). When examining the timing of sharpest slope changes relative to transition times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>), we also found no evidence indicating that BLA→GCx alters the dynamics of firing changes (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 20.06, p&gt;0.05). Overall, this pattern of results further confirms that the input from BLA critically modulates the dynamics of GC taste response by altering palatability-related activity while leaving the identity processing relatively intact.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>GCx has little impact on state transitions into the identity epoch.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter plot shows the slope changes during the transition times into the identity state (a dominant during 100 ~ 600 ms post-taste delivery) for each GC neuron (Laser-Off [x-axis] against Laser-On [y-axis]). The red line is the regression fit of the data, whose slope is not significantly from the unity line (gray-dashed line with slope as 1, i.e. no impact of laser).

Stimulus responses reflect not just taste identity but also taste palatability, and through the latter GC acts as an essential element in the process of not only ‘coding’ but also in the decision process for consumption-driven behavior. These different activities are mediated, not by distinct subpopulations of neurons, but by different stages of the response generated by a (mostly) single population of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2007</xref>). Such functional complexity all but requires a circuit wherein the dynamically responsive region integrates input from multiple brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maffei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Staszko et al., 2020</xref>). Given lesion and pharmacological studies demonstrating that GC-governed consummatory behavior—both learned (e.g. CTA) and innate (taste neophobia)—is impaired following BLA dysfunction, it is reasonable to hypothesize that BLA might be a region that vitally interacts with GC during taste processing. The current work tests and confirms this hypothesis, and goes on to characterize that interaction.</p><p>The involvement of BLA in GC coding is, as predicted, related to palatability, but the simplest hypothesis—that BLA simply relays palatability-related information to GC—proves too simple. BLA→GCx affected both GC taste identity and taste palatability coding, but only the latter impact was qualitative: while identity-related responses changed, neither the number of responses showing taste-specificity nor our ability to decode taste identity from the responses was altered by laser stimulation; in the absence of BLA inputs, taste-specific information remains readily available in GC. In contrast, the palatability-processing epoch was both quantitatively and qualitatively altered by BLA→GCx—there was a significant loss of palatability-relatedness in GC taste responses, both in terms of number of responses showing significant correlations with palatability and in terms of overall correlation with palatability. This finding extends work demonstrating an impact of whole-region BLA inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piette et al., 2012</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamamoto et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bielavska and Roldan, 1996</xref>): by taking advantage of optogenetics to silence a single axon pathway without silencing somas in either BLA or GC, we show that it is specifically the direct BLA→GC projection that modulates GC palatability-related activity—conclusions that are consistent with prior findings that acquisition of learned palatability changes enhances the BLA-GC connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossman et al., 2008</xref>). Optogenetics also made it possible to perform fine-grained, within-session/within-neuron analyses that greatly extended our specific understanding of the function of this projection.</p><p>Those more fine-grained analyses allowed us to expose important complexities of the effect, revealing that BLA→GCx, despite being tonic, impacts GC function in an ‘epoch-wise’ manner (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The onset latencies of that impact were neither random nor exponentially decaying across time: while some responses were impacted starting only a few hundred milliseconds after taste delivery, the distribution of latencies showed peaks around the beginnings of each successive epoch; many responses were altered only during the palatability epoch (i.e., with effect latencies of ~750 ms after taste delivery). Meanwhile, for the vast majority (&gt;90%) of responses impacted at shorter latencies, that impact persisted through the later, palatability epoch. Not only does the impact of BLA→GCx conform to the dynamics that we have reliably observed in GC taste processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sadacca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sadacca et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>), it also impairs late palatability responses while leaving coding in the identity epoch relatively intact.</p><p>Previous studies have reported robust effects of similar perturbations on palatability-guided behavior (CTA learning and taste neophobia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin and Reilly, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lavi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levitan et al., 2020</xref>). In our hands, however, the impact of BLA→GCx was less complete, and some GC neurons even gained palatability responses in perturbed trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). There are multiple possible explanations for this mild discrepancy. The relatively brief laser stimulation (2.5 s in duration) used here to perturb the system, for instance, could have mitigated the strength of the effect. This explanation seems unlikely, however, given that even briefer stimulation is sufficient to significantly alter the production of orofacial responses evoked by taste presentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, given the fact that our intervention purposefully blocks only the direct projection from BLA to GC while leaving the function of BLA cell bodies intact, residual GC palatability activity could reflect input from BLA routed via a third area that is anatomically connected to both GC and BLA (perhaps lateral hypothalamus [LH]). However, this hypothesis is rendered unlikely by the findings of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piette et al., 2012</xref>) in which BLA cell body inactivation (achieved via muscimol administration): this wholesale BLA manipulation foreshadowed the results presented here—reducing (rather than eliminating) palatability-related information in GC taste responses (and sparing identity coding).</p><p>Thus, the fact that palatability-related activity in GC survives removal of BLA input likely means that the hedonic taste information reaches GC via an independent pathway not involving BLA. Two prime candidates are LH and the parabrachial nuclei of the pons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamamoto et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosar et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Norgren, 1974</xref>): both are directly connected to GC and, importantly, also display similar dynamics of taste responses to those occurring in GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baez-Santiago et al., 2016</xref>). Future work will investigate the importance of these regions in the production of GC dynamics.</p><p>Regardless of the results of future work, the above-discussed findings, in conjunction with our own analyses, suggest that the central role played by BLA has to do with organizing GC taste response dynamics, rather than with driving palatability-related responses specifically. BLA→GCx significantly ‘blurred’ the onset of palatability-related activity, which in control trials is a sudden, coherent firing-rate transition. This blurring could potentially account for behavioral deficits in animals with dysfunction in the BLA-GC circuitry, in that the loss of activity synchrony severely reduces the occurrence of learning-related synatic plasticity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li, 2018</xref>).</p><p>While a full explanation of how blocking BLA input causes the incoherent transitions into the palatability epoch in GC must await the results of future experimentation, work from theoretical neuroscience may offer clues to the underlying mechanisms. These studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller and Katz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escola et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mazzucato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mazzucato et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">La Camera et al., 2019</xref>) suggest that the taste system functions as a nonlinear ‘attractor network,’ in which (as we have again shown) taste responses evolve through a sequence of discrete, quasi-stationary ‘states,’ and that the transitions between these states are jointly determined by the strength of both the attractors and noise impinging upon the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller and Katz, 2010</xref>). We hypothesize that BLA is an essential part of this dynamical system, and that, given the critical involvement of BLA in palatability processing, the loss of BLA input may reduce the nonlinearity of the attractor dynamics (and to predispose the network to random noise). Accordingly, the neurons become less well synchronized; they continue to display palatability activity, but in a less coherent manner.</p><p>What is the implication of this role of BLA in organizing GC activity? Based on our results, it is reasonable to speculate that during taste processing, BLA actively interacts with GC and coordinates activity among cortical neurons, so that the cortical ensemble can transition suddenly and coherently into the palatability state. An important question, therefore, has to do with when that interaction occurs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref> employed brief (500 ms in duration) optogenetic inhibition of GC itself, shedding light on this issue. When GC was inhibited for the first 500 ms of the taste response, a time period that reliably ended prior to the transition into the palatability epoch, palatability-driven behavior was significantly delayed—a fact that strongly implies that processing intrinsic to GC is important in the time leading up to the Late epoch. Combined with the fact that palatability-related activity occurs much earlier in BLA than it does in GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontanini et al., 2009</xref>), we speculate that BLA-GC interactions across the first 0.5–1.0 s are responsible for causing the transition into GC palatability epoch; this could be the specific way in which BLA assists/coordinates the processing of this ‘emotion-rich’ process in GC. Finally, given the nonlinearity of this dynamic population effect, and the dense reciprocal connections between BLA and GC, their interaction is unlikely to be unidirectional, a suggestion that receives support from an earlier study demonstrating that electrical stimulating GC can alter BLA taste responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamamoto et al., 1984</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lavi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, as revealed in our 20 years of research, taste processing in GC is complex, involving a sequence of firing rate transformations that chart the evolution of those responses from reporting the presence of stimuli on the tongue, to discriminating the taste identity, and then finally to generating affective responses. The nature of this dynamic process almost necessarily requires that GC collaborates with other brain regions, and while such a collaboration could simply involve information passage from one area to another, the results of the current research suggest that GC palatability-related activity is organized by connections to GC from BLA. Future work will assess whether input to GC received from other regions, such as LH, gustatory thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cechetto and Saper, 1987</xref>), and parabrachial nucleus play similar or complementary roles in the processing of taste information in the service of modulating feeding behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (virus)</td><td valign="top">AAV9-CAG-ArchT-GFP</td><td valign="top">UNC Vector Core</td><td valign="top">Lot #: AV6221E</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-GFP-rabbit IgG (rabbit Polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td valign="top">Cat#: A11122 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221569">AB_221569</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Flour 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Donkey Polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td valign="top">Cat#: A21206 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535792">AB_2535792</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (female Long Evans Rat)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Charles River Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Strain code: 006</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Sodium chloride</td><td valign="top">Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat#: S271-500</td><td valign="top">0.1M (0.29 g/50 ml)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Sucrose</td><td valign="top">Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat#: S5-500</td><td valign="top">0.3M (5.14 g/50 ml)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Citric acid</td><td valign="top">Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat#: A104-500</td><td valign="top">0.1M (1.05 g/50 ml)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Quinine hydrochloride dihydrate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat#: Q1125-5G</td><td valign="top">1 mM (0.0198 g/50 ml)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Conda</td><td valign="top">Conda</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_018317">SCR_018317</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">DAPI stain</td><td valign="top">Vector Laboratories, Inc</td><td valign="top">Cat#: H-1200–10</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>The experimental subjects were female Long-Evans rats (Charles River Laboratory, Raleigh, NC), singly housed in a vivarium with controlled temperature and 12:12 hr light-dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 am).

This analysis collapses across all four tastes, such that ‘taste responsivity’ indicates purely that a GC neuron responds to taste delivery and reveals nothing about taste specificity (which is described below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Taste specificity</title><p>To determine whether a GC neuron responds distinctly to some subset of the four taste stimuli, we performed two-way repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA), with Taste and Time as variables, on 2 s of post-delivery firing rates (broken into four 500 ms bins, to facilitate comparison with previous reports of taste dynamics; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2001</xref>). Significance of either the taste main effect or the taste x time Interaction indicates that the firing of the neurons conveys information specific to the taste stimulus—that is, the response to at least one taste differs significantly from the response to at least one other taste.</p><p>Note that a neuron may potentially fail to be identified as ‘taste responsive’ while nonetheless displaying ‘taste-specific’ activity. This occurs, for example, when some tastes increase GC firing but others decrease it, and is noteworthy because it reflects the multifaceted nature of taste responses in GC.</p><p>A jack-knife classification algorithm was also employed to further evaluate the impact of BLA→GCx on how well tastes could be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foffani and Moxon, 2004</xref>). Single trials of ensemble taste responses taken from 250 to 1750 ms post-stimulus time were first binned into 250 ms bins and compared to the average responses of all other trials for each taste (the single trial being compared was left out/jack-knifed). Using the number of units in each ensemble as the space dimension, Euclidean distance was then calculated from each single trial to the taste template (average responses of each taste). A trial was classified as correct when the minimal distance occurred between the trial and the same taste’s template. Performance greater than 25% (i.e. the chance level) indicates taste specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Taste palatability</title><p>Correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the degree to which taste-driven firing rates reflect the hedonic value of tastes. As hedonic value can be treated as a ranked variable, we used the nonparametric Spearman’s rho test to compute these correlations. A great deal of prior literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sinclair et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tordoff et al., 2015</xref>), including data collected in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sadacca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>), confirms that the palatability order of the four tastes used here is reliably sucrose &gt;NaCl &gt; Acid&gt;QHCl.</p><p>To reveal the dynamics of palatability-relatedness in GC single-neuron activity, we conducted a 'moving window analysis'—extracting 250 ms segments of each neuron’s evoked response to each taste, evaluating the response-palatability correlation, sliding the time window 25 ms forward, performing the analysis again, etc. Responses were deemed palatability-related if this correlation was significant (p &lt;.05) for 3 or more consecutive bin windows.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Determining the impact of BLA→GCx on neuronal firing</title><p>We built a hierarchical Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) to estimate the change in taste-evoked GC activity induced by laser stimulation. For each neuron, we specifically compared the mean firing rates during the laser duration (0–2500 ms post-taste delivery) in control and perturbed trials for each taste stimulus. Taking advantage of the Poisson distribution’s suitability for spiking data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kass and Ventura, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trousdale et al., 2013</xref>), this GLM model can accurately estimate the significance of changes in neural firing. Model parameters include the mean firing rates for every taste and optogenetic perturbation condition, that are in turn composed of taste- and perturbation- specific effects (‘random effects’) and means across tastes and perturbation conditions (‘fixed effects’). For each neuron <italic>n</italic> in our dataset, we aggregated the spikes produced on trial <italic>i</italic> of taste <italic>T</italic> in optogenetic perturbation condition <italic>O</italic>. There were four levels for <italic>T</italic>, corresponding to the four tastes used in our dataset (sucrose, NaCl, Acid, and QHCl). The number of levels for <italic>O</italic> were two (control and perturbed trials).</p><p>We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC; specifically, the No-U-Turn sampler) to sample the posterior distribution of <italic>firing<sub>n;T;O</sub></italic> for every taste and condition. We performed this analysis for every neuron in our dataset, and ultimately calculated the impact of perturbation on firing as the difference in <italic>firing<sub>n;T;O</sub></italic> between control and perturbation trials. A significant impact of laser stimulation on neuronal firing was concluded if the 95% Bayesian credible interval for these differences in <italic>firing<sub>n;T;O</sub></italic> for a neuron did not overlap 0 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref> for details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)</title><p> Initially developed for speech recognition, HMM has recently gained attention as a way to analyze in vivo electrophysiology with the utility of determining whether population neuronal activity shifts from ensemble state to ensemble state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rabiner, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seidemann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kemere et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller and Katz, 2010</xref>). In accordance with our well-tested model of dynamic GC taste responses, HMM reveals the degree to which data can be described as reflecting a sequence of two taste-specific (first identity- and then palatability-related) states. Trained on neural ensemble data containing neurons from both hemispheres, the algorithm returns its best estimate of the set of underlying states, each defined as a vector of firing rates—one for each neuron—as well as the probability of transitioning from any one state to any other.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Post-HMM realignment</title><p>For each hidden Markov model, we determined the putative underlying state with the highest probability of occurring across all trials within a time window identified, on the basis of current results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sadacca et al., 2016</xref>), as being the time at which rising ramps of palatability, observed using analyses keyed to stimulus delivery, reach asymptote (between 0.5–1.5 s after taste delivery). These states were deemed the most likely candidate ‘palatability’ states. The onset time of these 'palatability' states was determined as the time at which the identified state reached the 0.5 probability threshold on each trial. The ensemble data were then re-aligned to these onset times as the ‘zero’ time point of each trial. Following data alignment, we repeated the above-described palatability analyses that had already been brought to bear on stimulus-aligned data (taste palatability section).</p><p>To determine whether BLA→GCx altered the quality of state transitions, we compared how the PSTH changes around the transitions into the late, palatability, state between Laser-Off and Laser-On conditions. Using a moving window analysis (100 ms window, 20 ms step), we measured (1) the slope of PSTH changes around the transition time, and (2) the latency between when the largest PSTH changed and the transition time. The peri-transition time period used for this analysis was 160 ms; the pattern of results, however, remained unchanged if the time-period was limited between 100 and 200 ms.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants DC006666 (DBK) and DC016706 (J-YL) from the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.

GC activity was recorded in rats while 4 different tastes were delivered via intraoral cannula; axons in GC from BLA were optogenetically-inactivated for the first 2.5s after taste delivery on half the trials. Activity was analyzed for the well-known 3-epoch evolution of non-specific, identity-based, and finally hedonic information, and the authors provide convincing evidence that silencing of BLA-&gt;GC input disrupted hedonic encoding in GC. Notably this was true even though the hedonic epoch extends well beyond the period of inactivation, and the impact of the inactivation of BLA input in GC was relatively specific, being largely limited to the hedonic information, not the detection or identification of the tastants, and especially to the sharpness of its onset and organization. This relatively subtle result is exciting because, while it confirms the general &quot;cartoon&quot; hypothesis regarding BLA function, it also carves out a very specific role for the direct projections in the normal real-time organization of hedonic information. This is a unique, dramatic, and important demonstration of the specific interactions between two areas in processing the full richness of sensory information. Concerns were minor, with one area of potential improvement being and examination of the effect of inactivation on identity encoding.</p><p>So overall I think the paper is excellent. I do however have a couple of areas where I have questions or would like more information.</p><p>The first is that the authors should spend a little time at the start of the results describing what they did. A few things of particular interest to me would be whether the rats had any experience with the tastants prior to recording, and if not, do analyses of initial sessions show differences from sessions after experience? Also was there any impact on behavior and, relatedly, was inactivation done in every session or is it possible to compare neural measures on control trials within inactivation sessions with measures from trials in sessions without inactivation?</p><p>A second area where I would like more information is regarding the claim that BLA inactivation had little or no impact on representation of identity. I appreciate that the numbers of cells responding to identity was not altered, but the authors present convincing evidence that the ensemble changes dramatically. While the authors show that encoding does not differ in a classification analysis, I think this does not fully address the question assuming they are using all trials to train the classifier. I wonder if they might also check whether classification is the same if trials without inactivation are used as the classifier (or vice versa)? If I follow the data, it seems to me that if the analysis is done this way, then it will likely show that the classification performance is better when a withheld trial is from the same set as the training data than when it is not. It seems to me that this will show that even though the identity information is not rendered less detailed or robust by BLA inactivation, it is altered. Assuming this is true, I think it potentially alters or at least provides additional detail for why a subsequent transition to the hedonics might be &quot;blurred&quot;.</p><p>Finally I wonder if the authors might be more clear in the discussion about the implication of their terminal inactivation and the relatively subtle effect on hedonic information. Specifically while there are dramatic changes to the hedonic information, it is not completely abolished I think? While LH or other areas might be a source of this remaining information, presumably BLA is still active and sending input to other areas. So it may indirectly be still driving the hedonic coding. Is this plausible or does data from ablation or cell body inactivation contradict this? Directly addressing this in the discussion with a paragraph on the significance of the very specific approach would help me understand the authors interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript from Jian-You Lin and colleagues presents results from experiments investigating the role of the basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BLA) in modulating taste-evoked activity in the gustatory cortex (GC). Specifically, the experiments test the hypothesis that silencing of BLA axons in GC affects spiking dynamics and suppresses coding of taste hedonic value (palatability). The authors rely on electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic silencing of axonal afferents in rats consuming tastants delivered through an intraoral cannula.</p><p>Silencing of BLA afferents can lead to either an increase or a reduction in firing rates of GC neurons (with reduction being more prevalent for putative GABAergic interneurons). Prolonged silencing of amygdalar axons leads to changes in GC firing rates that have complex dynamics. Specifically, tonic silencing impacts taste responses at various latencies, generally corresponding with the coding epochs for taste quality and hedonic value. Despite affecting firing rates, BLA afferent silencing has minimal impact on coding of taste quality. Instead, silencing has a significant impact on palatability coding. Finally, the authors use hidden markov model analysis to show that silencing BLA afferents impacts GC metastability.</p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript that provides important results on the role of BLA in shaping processing of hedonic value in sensory cortices. The data presented here are a very substantial addition to the literature and will be of wide interest. The article is very well written, the experiments are designed carefully and well-executed. The analyses are thorough, rigorous and provide insights on both single neuron as well as population dynamics. This excellent manuscript could be further improved if the authors could address the following issues:</p><p>Figure 1: the author should show higher magnification images detailing axons in GC and cell bodies in BLA. The figures should have a calibration bar. Finally, it would be helpful to have a schematic summarizing optrode placements in GC.</p><p>Figure 2: can the authors show raster plots as well? Did the authors observe any bimodal effect, i.e. neurons whose firing rates were first suppressed and then enhanced by optostimulation? It would be helpful to provide a heatmap showing the difference in firing rates (ctrl-opto) for all the neurons whose responses changed with opto silencing.</p><p>Page 5: The authors cite Stone at al 2011 in reference to in vitro recordings showing BLA inputs onto pyramidal and GABAergic interneurons. Stone et al. 2011 was an in vivo study. They may want to consider also citing Haley et al. 2016 and 2020 (both are in vitro studies).</p><p>Figure 6A shows a number of neurons whose changes in firing rates have an onset within 200ms. This contrast with the text on page 7 (&quot;optogenetic perturbation of BLA-GC axonal activity, started at the time of taste delivery, seldom impacted the initial 200msec of the GC taste response&quot;). The authors should consider downplaying their statement.</p><p>Figure 7D: the author should include in the panel the classification performance averaged across all tastants.</p><p>Figure 9: is the effect of BLA silencing on state transition time restricted to the palatability epoch?

We have performed the new analysis suggested, evaluating how well a classifier trained on non-perturbed trials classifies tastes delivered in perturbed trials (and vice versa). The results (Figure 7E) show, as the reviewer predicted, that the classification is significantly worse when evaluated across conditions than when within each laser condition – particularly when the sample was limited to neurons for which activity was altered by BLA→GCx. These results suggest, as we now note in the manuscript, that in the absence of BLA input, GC does not loss its capacity to process taste identity, but does code identity differently. This fact is particularly intriguing given the fact that further analysis (described below) suggests that the impact of BLA→GCx on the transition into palatability-related firing is NOT paralleled by analogous earlier changes to the transition into identity coding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally I wonder if the authors might be more clear in the discussion about the implication of their terminal inactivation and the relatively subtle effect on hedonic information.

We consider this explanation to be unlikely, however, given a prior study (Piette et al., 2012) demonstrating that wholesale, semi-chronic BLA cell body inactivation (achieved via muscimol administration) causes a similar reduction in GC palatability activity. We therefore suspect (and note in the manuscript) that the significant residual palatability activity reflects processing performed in regions other than BLA itself, for example the lateral hypothalamus (Li et al., 2013) or parabrachial nuclei of the pons (Baez-Santiago et al., 2016). More detailed speculation is now found in the Discussion (lines 598-614) – specifically, a proposal that evolutionarily-important palatability processing is performed redundantly across the taste neuroaxis, and that the primary “job” of BLA→GC cooperation might be to dynamically organize this processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] This excellent manuscript could be further improved if the authors could address the following issues:</p><p>Figure 1: the author should show higher magnification images detailing axons in GC and cell bodies in BLA.
