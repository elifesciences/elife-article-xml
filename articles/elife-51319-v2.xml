(TANGO1) proteins play pivotal roles in the secretory pathway. Full length TANGO1 is a transmembrane protein localised at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites, where it binds bulky cargo within the ER lumen and recruits membranes from the ER Golgi intermediate compartment to create an exit route for their export. Here we report the first TANGO1-associated syndrome in humans. A synonymous substitution that results in exon eight skipping in most mRNA molecules, ultimately leading to a truncated TANGO1 protein was identified as disease-causing mutation. The four homozygously affected sons of a consanguineous family display severe dentinogenesis imperfecta, short stature, various skeletal abnormalities, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, sensorineural hearing loss, and mild intellectual disability. Functional studies in HeLa and U2OS cells revealed that the corresponding truncated TANGO1 protein is dispersed in the ER and its expression in cells with intact endogenous TANGO1 impairs cellular collagen I secretion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>collage secretion</kwd><kwd>dentinogenesis imperfecta</kwd><kwd>diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>TANGO1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SEV-2012-0208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Foresti</surname><given-names>Ombretta</given-names></name><name><surname>Raote</surname><given-names>Ishier</given-names></name><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2013-44188-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Foresti</surname><given-names>Ombretta</given-names></name><name><surname>Raote</surname><given-names>Ishier</given-names></name><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSD2009-00016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Foresti</surname><given-names>Ombretta</given-names></name><name><surname>Raote</surname><given-names>Ishier</given-names></name><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IJCI-2017-34751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raote</surname><given-names>Ishier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RYC-2016-20919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Foresti</surname><given-names>Ombretta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first human <italic>TANGO1</italic>-associated syndromal disease manifests as impaired collagen secretion, highlighting the importance of TANGO1 in human pathophysiology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Collagens are the most abundantly secreted molecules in mammals and needed throughout the whole body for bone mineralization, skin and tissue assembly.

On the other hand, the mutation creates a sequence motif (UAGGGU) that is recognised by hnRNPA1, which may repress splicing (hypothesis II). Most morpholinos alter splicing by sterically blocking the snRNP binding sites utilised by the spliceosome, which are usually located in the intron near the splice donor/acceptor junctions. The TGO morpholino used here targets the entire TANGO1 exon eight but not enough intronic sequences to block snRNP binding sites. It rather obstructs the consensus sequence for SC35 binding. If disruption of a splice enhancer motif is the underlying mechanism, TGO treatment of WT-transfected cells should also prevent SC35 binding and thus induce exon eight skipping. If a splice inhibitor is recruited by the mutated sequence, TGO treatment of WT-transfected cells should not affect TANGO1 exon eight splicing. In cells expressing the mutation from a transfected vector, addition of the TGO morpholino would prevent the binding of hnRNPA1 and induce exon eight skipping. (<bold>B</bold>) Effects of the TANGO1 exon eight morpholino (TGO) on HeLa cells transfected with mutated TANGO1 exon 8 (Mnt vector) or wild-type (WT vector). To discriminate between vector-derived and endogenous splice products, vector-specific primers were used for cDNA sequencing. The vector-derived splice products of TGO treated HeLa cells transfected with either mutated (Mnt) or wild-type (WT) TANGO1 both showed exon skipping. HeLa cells transfected with the Mnt vector but not with TGO were endowed with two splice products, one lacking the entire TANGO1 exon eight and one presenting the normal cDNA. Cells transfected with the WT vector but not with TGO demonstrated only the normal TANGO1 splice product. (<bold>C</bold>) To prove that the exon skipping effect is not caused by morpholino treatment alone, HeLa cells were either treated with TGO or a standard control morpholino (CTRL). As expected, cDNA from TGO-treated cells lacked TANGO1 exon 8, whereas cDNAs from CTRL-treated or untreated cells included exon 8.

However, it was not possible to determine how the relative abundance of the two splice products translated to protein levels in patient-derived samples. Therefore, possible effects of the overexpression of Ex8-HA on top of endogenous levels of normal <italic>TANGO1</italic> splice product at the cellular level were investigated using human osteosarcoma U2OS as a model system. U2OS cells produce and rapidly secrete collagen I, so they are the ideal system to monitor possible effects of Ex8-HA overproduction on collagen homeostasis. For this purpose, a stable U2OS cell line expressing Ex8-HA under a constitutive promoter was generated and compared with control cells by microscopy. Cells expressing Ex8-HA showed weaker and more diffuse staining of collagen I compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To confirm that this reduction was not due to unequal immunofluorescent staining, total RNA was isolated from the two cell populations and the relative amount of collagen I/GAPDH transcript was quantified by qRT-PCR analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This confirmed that collagen I expression is reduced in the Ex8-HA stable cell line. The reduction in expression was not due to unfolded protein response (UPR) as there was no difference in XBP-1 splicing upon expression of Ex8-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The next step was to test whether the secretion of collagen I was also affected. Since different rates of collagen synthesis will affect the amount available for secretion in the two cell populations, a cycloheximide chase experiment was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). By inhibiting protein synthesis, it was possible to monitor the rate of secretion of the available pool of collagen I present in the cells at time zero. By quantifying the relative amount of collagen I present in the cells and in the media at each time point, a drastic reduction in the rate of collagen I secretion from the EX8-HA stable cell line compared to control cells was observed. Importantly, this effect was not due to a general reduction of protein secretion since the small cargo antitrypsin was produced and secreted at a comparable rate in the two cell populations. Under the same conditions, we tested secretion of collagen IV and collagen XII in EX8-HA stable line. Six independent trials revealed a consistent trend of a net reduction in their secretion, but because of the low relative abundance of these collagens the magnitude of the effect varied considerably and cannot be statistically quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).These secretion defects were specific to Ex8 expression as we observed no change in collagen I secretion when full-length TANGO1 was overexpressed in U2OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The heterozygous parents show exon eight skipping but no detectable symptoms, whereas all four homozygous children are severely and similarly affected. This is consistent with a threshold model, where the disease only manifests when the ratio of truncated versus normal protein exceeds a critical level. <italic>Tango1</italic> knockout mice represent a full loss-of-function (LoF) situation and are defective for the secretion of numerous collagens, exhibiting short-limbed dwarfism, compromised chondrocyte maturation and bone mineralization, and other features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>), resembling our patients' phenotype. The human <italic>TANGO1</italic> locus lies within a homozygous interval shared among the affected children, which strengthens its role as the disease-causing gene in the investigated family. <italic>TANGO1</italic> does not seem to be haploinsufficient, since there are several heterozygous LoF mutation carriers listed in big population databases, ExAC and gnomAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lek et al., 2016</xref>). However, no homozygous LoF mutation carriers have been reported so far. Thus, complete ablation of functional TANGO1 may cause embryonic lethality in humans.</p><p>The skipped exon eight in full length TANGO1 corresponds to exon three in the isoform TANGO1-short. Its exclusion there also leads to a premature stop codon 27 bp downstream of exon 2. TANGO1-short has a similar structure to TANGO1, but lacks the lumenal portion within the cargo-binding SH3 domain. However, TANGO1-short has been shown to substitute the function of TANGO1 in collagen export, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maeda et al., 2016</xref>). It has been postulated that the cytoplasmic portion’s capacity to recruit ERGIC-53 membranes, Sec23/24 complexes, and cTAGE5, shared by both isoforms, is sufficient to export collagen at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). The lumenal SH3 domain may therefore rather play a role in modulating the efficiency or the quality (folding status) of collagens to be secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Raote et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Saito et al., 2009</xref>).

Its expression in cells along with endogenous full length TANGO1 displayed a negative effect on collagen secretion.

In two previous descriptions of TANGO1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Saito et al., 2009</xref>), we reported that it had no obvious role in collagen I export. However, it has been demonstrated subsequently that TANGO1 functions to export all soluble collagens tested thus far, including collagen I. We have noticed a change in the mRNA level of collagen α1 chain in U2OS cells expressing mutant TANGO1. Although, we have not tested the effects on the expression of other chains of collagen one and other collagens, it is conceivable that expression of this mutant causes accumulation of collagens in the ER, which then affect their further synthesis by a feedback mechanism. However, this appears not to involve the activation of UPR in U2OS cells. Whether this is also the situation in vivo in the individuals with TANGO1 mutation is unknown.</p><p>Type I collagens provide tensile strength to connective tissue and are abundant in bone, skin, dentin, cementum, tendons, and ligaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deshmukh et al., 2016</xref>).

The PCR reaction consisted of 4 µl (10 ng) cDNA, 1 µl (2.5 pmol) primer pair, 2 µl 5x HOT FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR Mix Plus, and 3 µl water. All samples were run in technical triplicates. Cycling conditions on a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) were as follows: 95°C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 20 s. The melt curve was obtained from 60°C to 95°C and indicated no secondary amplicons.</p><p>In addition, qRT-PCRs were conducted to measure the relative expression of full length TANGO1, truncated TANGO1, and Collagen I. For this purpose, U2OS cells WT or stabling expressing Ex8-HA were lysed and total RNA extracted with the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen). cDNA from two biological replicates was synthesized with Superscript III (Invitrogen).

Media and cell lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE (6% or 8% acrylamide) and Western blotting with antibodies raised against collagen I, collagen XII, collagen IV, TANGO1, calnexin, hemagglutinin (HA), and antitrypsin. Band intensities were measured using QuantityOne (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA), and four independent repetitions of the experiment were used to plot the graph. For each time point, the band intensities of collagen I or antitrypsin were measured for the cell extract and media samples, and expressed as percentage of the total (cells plus media).

cargo molecules including collagens and facilitates the export of cargoes from the ER by creating giant transport carriers. Malhotra and colleagues discovered and characterised TANGO1 in the past. In the present paper, Haaf, Malhotra and their colleagues identified a first patient with a balletic mutation in the TANGO1-encoding MIA3 gene, which leads to a truncation of the protein. Since the authors do not have access to patient cells, they established a surrogate cell model and characterised the relationship between the mutation and protein truncation, and the exocytosis defect of collagens. In light of the complex disease phenotype, the authors also discuss previously published data, which showed that the ubiquitously expressed TANGO1 is packing various cargo for exocytosis and support the complex disease syndrome of the patient. This paper highlights the importance of TANGO1 for human disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Biallelic TANGO1 mutations cause a novel syndromal disease due to hampered cellular collagen secretion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

HeLa are not a good cell choice for studies of collagen. Do HeLa cells express prolyl 4-hydroxylase, which is essential for procollagen folding and assembly into a thermally-stable triple helix?

What is the explanation of this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this concern, but many others including our own data now show that TANGO1 is required for export of many collagens including Collagen 1. We do not know whether it was the serum, the cells, the growth conditions, the siRNA reagents, or the antibodies used to detect collagens that led us astray in our earlier descriptions of TANGO1. With this report, we correct our previous mistake and hope that we can move forward with the accepted role of TANGO1 in export of collagens in general.</p><p>We have explicitly stated this in the Discussion. It now reads, “In two previous descriptions of TANGO1function (Nogueira et al., 2014; Saito et al., 2009), we reported that it had no obvious role in collagen I export. However, it has been demonstrated subsequently that TANGO1 functions to export all soluble collagens tested thus far, including collagen I”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Determine whether also the secretion of additional collagens, collagen II and VII are affected by the mutation, ideally in patient-derived fibroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included data showing the effect on the secretion of collagen IV and collagen XII in U2OS cells.

On a related point, do HeLa cells synthesise Hsp47, which is a collagen chaperone that binds TANGO1?</p></disp-quote><p>We have used U2OS cells and modified Figure 4 accordingly and removed the data obtained from HeLa cells. In answer to the reviewer query, HeLa cells do express both P4HA1 and HSP47. Data from Itzhak et al. (<italic>eLife</italic>, 2016) show copy numbers of P4HA1 and HSP47 as 646,700 and 8,094,200 molecules per cell respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4: quantify the co-localisation (TANGO1/Sec16A).</p></disp-quote><p>The colocalisation (or lack thereof) has been quantified and plotted in Figure 4 alongside the immunofluorescence images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5: the TANGO1 mutation is dominant over the wild type protein.

[…] This is consistent with a threshold model, where the disease only manifests when the ratio of truncated versus normal protein exceeds a critical level.&quot;</p><p>In addition, we have carried out an added experiment to demonstrate the specificity of the effect of the truncated TANGO1 on collagen secretion. We now show that overexpression of full-length TANGO1 in the same system shows no effect on the secretion of collagen 1. These data are included as Figure 5—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The defects of the TANGO1 mutation are pleiotropic and therefore the syndrome should not be called collagenopathy.

Prerequisite to this experiment would be the establishment of a stable mutation cell line or to use patient derived cells for the analyses. We performed a number of unsuccessful experiments to establish a mutation-specific TANGO1 cell line via CRISPR and/or homologous recombination. Moreover, we are unable to get access to patient derived cells. An alternative experiment would be using transiently transfected or stably overexpressing cells, which would have the disadvantage of harboring unnaturally high amounts of TANGO1 transcripts, subsequently resulting in unspecific binding to SR proteins and in misleading RIP-Seq results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please test whether the mutation induces UPR.</p></disp-quote><p>We include data (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) to show that the expression of the truncated TANGO1 does not induce UPR.

This should be shown or the text modified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the statement from the manuscript but retained the discussion of literature showing a role of cTAGE5 and TANGO1 in insulin homoeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The complex disease phenotype (e.g. defects in dentinogenesis/dentinogenesis imperfecta, diabetes, hearing loss, etc.) due to the TANGO1 mutation is probably not only caused by the aberrant export and secretion of collagens.

[…] For example, mutations in the dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) gene and, by extrapolation, TANGO1-associated defects in DSPP secretion, may cause DGI 1 (#605594) with or without hearing loss (Xiao et al., 2001) as well as DGI, Shields type II (#125490) and III (#125500), which may be phenotypic variation of the same entity rather than separate diseases (Kim et al., 2005).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Western blots do not show a convincing chance in collagen XII and IV levels, nor do the authors report the technical repeats and statistics with these antibodies. This information needs to be provided. It is also necessary to mention the source of the collagen XII and IV antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>By quantifying the relative amount of collagen I present in the cells and in the media at each time point, a drastic reduction in the rate of collagen I secretion from the EX8-HA stable cell line compared to control cells was observed. Importantly, this effect was not due to a general reduction of protein secretion since the small cargo antitrypsin was produced and secreted at a comparable rate in the two cell populations. Under the same conditions, we tested secretion of collagen IV and collagen XII in EX8-HA stable line. 6 independent trials revealed a consistent trend of a net reduction in their secretion, but because of the low relative abundance of these collagens the magnitude of the effect varied considerably and cannot be statistically quantified (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). These secretion defects were specific to Ex8 expression as we observed no change in collagen I secretion when full-length TANGO1 was overexpressed in U2OS (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Collectively, these results show that expression of the exon 8 skipped splice product even in the presence of full length TANGO1 affects collagen I homeostasis.</p><p>The source of antibodies is now stated in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Discuss how does mutated TANGO1 or altered levels (?) of TANGO1 expression lead to decreased Col1 transcription or steady-state levels of Col1xx.

Although, we have not tested the effects on the expression of other chains of collagen 1 and other collagens, it is conceivable that expression of this mutant causes accumulation of collagens in the ER, which then affect their further synthesis by a feedback mechanism. However, this appears not to involve the activation of UPR in U2OS cells. Whether this is also the situation in vivo in the individuals with TANGO1 mutation is unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) pro-α1(I) or α1(I) are the proteins; COL1A1 and COL1A2 are the genes.
