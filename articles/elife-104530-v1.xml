clear risk factor for chromosome missegregation, the main source of aneuploidy. Here, we report that old yeast cells lose chromosomes by partitioning them asymmetrically to their daughter cells together with the pre-existing (old) spindle pole body (SPB, centrosome equivalent in yeast). Strikingly, remodelling of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the displacement of its nuclear basket triggered these asymmetric chromosome segregation events. Simultaneously, nuclear basket displacement caused unspliced pre-mRNAs to leak into the cytoplasm. We show that removing the introns of three genes involved in chromosome segregation was sufficient to fully suppress chromosome loss in old cells. Promoting pre-mRNA leakage in young cells also caused asymmetric chromosome partitioning and loss through the same three introns. Therefore, we propose that basket displacement from NPCs and its consequences for pre-mRNA quality control are key triggers of aging phenotypes such as aneuploidy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>intron</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>NPC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00yjd3n13</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A-105904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barral</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01gavpb45</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201809PJT-407549-BMB-CFDA-53473</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elela</surname><given-names>Sherif Abou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aging results in remodeling of the nuclear pore complex and leakage of intron-containing pre-mRNA out of the nucleus, altering gene function and mitotic stability of old cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular aging results in conserved phenotypes, including chromosome mis-segregation, fragmentation of mitochondria, accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins, and alteration of nuclear morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">López-Otín et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janssens and Veenhoff, 2016</xref>). Importantly, the NPC is remodelled in aging across evolutionary lineages, as shown in fungi, worms, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rempel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rempel et al., 2019</xref>). As the primary gateway between the nucleus and cytoplasm, the NPC controls mRNA export and protein distribution between these two cellular compartments. The most prominent change in the NPCs of old cells is the loss of their nuclear basket, which lies on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. Nuclear basket loss is observed both in dividing cells and upon expression of the progeric variant of Lamin A, progerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morlot et al., 2019</xref>). The protein TPR (Mlp1 and Mlp2 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) is the main structural component of the nuclear basket in mammals. The nuclear basket serves as a critical processing hub for mRNA export and nuclear retention of pre-mRNA, protein quality control, and gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Møller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bitterman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boveri, 2008</xref>). Altering the structure or function of the NPC or its nuclear basket could have diverse and wide-ranging effects on cellular function, given the NPC’s broad range of functions and central position in eukaryotic cellular information flow. Despite this and the fact that the reorganization of NPC architecture with age is prominent in a wide range of organisms, little is known about whether and how NPC remodelling contributes to aging.</p><p>The unicellular fungus <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, budding yeast, is a remarkably useful system for studying the role of NPCs in cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janssens and Veenhoff, 2016</xref>). Budding yeast undergoes replicative aging, during which the mother cell produces a finite number of daughter cells before dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacobs et al., 1961</xref>). After the mother cell enters senescence, the rate of cell division slows. Importantly, several studies have emphasized that the yeast NPC is remodelled during replicative aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rempel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rempel et al., 2019</xref>), but the exact consequences of its reorganization are not fully understood.</p><p>Extrachromosomal DNA circles (also called eccDNAs) accumulate in the mother cell nucleus and are one of the key drivers of aging in the budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morlot et al., 2019</xref>). These DNA circles form during the cell’s lifetime through excision of genomic segments, generally by recombination between repeated sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Møller et al., 2018</xref>). The vast majority of these circles (&gt;99%) stems from the highly repetitive rDNA locus and are referred to as extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>). As the cell ages, these circles accumulate exponentially because they are replicated in S-phase and retained in the mother cell at mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bitterman et al., 2003</xref>). By the end of their life, yeast cells contain about 1000 ERCs, which represents roughly the same amount of DNA as the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bitterman et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, their retention in the mother cell relies on their anchorage to NPCs via the acetyltransferase complex SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). These NPC-ERC units are then confined to the mother part of the dividing nucleus by a lateral diffusion barrier forming in the nuclear envelope in the future plane of cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldi et al., 2017</xref>). Yeast cells undergo a closed mitosis, meaning that they keep their nuclear envelope intact throughout mitosis. Remarkably, anchorage of ERCs to NPCs results in the dissociation of their nuclear basket, which is a direct result of SAGA-driven acetylation of nucleoporins on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, including Nup60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, most of the NPCs of old yeast cells lack a nuclear basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is unknown whether nuclear basket displacement has consequences for the physiology and survival of the cell or contributes to the aging process.</p><p>One way to approach the question of whether nuclear basket displacement from the NPCs contributes to the aging process is to determine whether other aging phenotypes depend on basket displacement and if so, how. In this study, we focused on chromosome instability in old yeast cells as a case study of an aging phenotype. In many metazoans, including humans, aging results in an increasing frequency of chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy, correlating with increasing risk of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boveri, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacobs et al., 1961</xref>). Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of chromosome segregation errors in old cells remains rudimentary. Here, we report evidence that NPC remodelling during yeast aging leads to chromosome loss from old mother cells and characterize the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aging yeast cells lose chromosomes</title><p>To examine whether aging affects the karyotype of yeast cells, we visualized and followed the fate of individual chromosomes in replicatively aging mother cells, using either TetO-labeled chromosome II or chromosome IV as reporters. Chromosome IV is the second-longest chromosome, while chromosome II is of average size. Both chromosomes were labeled with an array of 256 TetO repeats in the vicinity of their centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kruitwagen et al., 2018</xref>). These chromosomes were visualized by expressing fluorescently tagged versions of the TetR protein, which binds to TetO repeats (TetR-GFP or TetR-mCherry; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). We then monitored budding yeast mother cells throughout their entire replicative lifespan using live-imaging microscopy combined with a microfluidics platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jo et al., 2015</xref>). The replicative age of each mother cell was measured by counting the number of daughters that it budded off over time, defining how many budding events they have already completed at a given time point (completed budding events, CBE). Bud size and the number and position of the spindle pole bodies (SPBs, labeled with mCherry) were used to identify the cell cycle stages at which the cells were imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Old cells lose chromosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells carrying labeled chromosome II (Chr II) and imaged at different ages on the microfluidic chip.

However, when reaching the age of 18–22 CBE (t=24 hr), 10–15% of these now old mother cells had lost their dot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). This was observed irrespective of which chromosome was labeled, and which fluorescent tag was used. Fluorescence of the labeled SPB was not affected, indicating that dot loss was not caused by fluorophore instability in old cells. A chromosome dot could be lost from aging mother cells in three possible ways: (1) Chromosome missegregation during anaphase (2) Migration of the entire nucleus into the daughter cell (3) Through the loss of a TetO array. The SPB is located in the nuclear envelope, so the presence of the SPB but the absence of the chromosome points to chromosome loss during anaphase, rather than the missegregation of the entire nucleus into the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Nuclear missegregation into the daughter cells was previously reported during replicative aging and is marked by the segregation of both SPBs to the daughter compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crane et al., 2019</xref>). While we do observe whole nuclei missegregation in ~3% of the cells, this is a distinct event from chromosome loss, which occurs in ~10–15% of final replicative divisions.</p><p>To test if the loss of fluorescent chromosomal foci was due to the loss of the TetO array specifically or of the entire chromosome, we included a second label (an array of 256 repeats of the LacO sequence) in the middle of the long arm of chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and asked whether the cells that lost the TetO array lost the LacO repeats as well. Analysis of these images showed that 85% of the cells lacking the TetO array had indeed lost the LacO array (50/59). Thus, these cells had probably lost the entire chromosome. Supporting this notion, loss of the TetO array was fatal to the cells. More than 99% (145/146 chromosome II loss events) of the dot-less cells failed to divide further, as expected for a haploid cell losing an entire chromosome. Thus, chromosome loss took place specifically in the last division of old mother cells and likely caused their death.</p><p>Finally, we examined whether the loss of a reporter chromosome points to general chromosome instability in old cells. To assess this possibility, we quantified how often aging cells simultaneously lost both chromosome II and chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). As expected, the co-loss rate (~5%) was lower than the individual loss rates (~10–15%), but notably higher than the ~1% expected by chance alone. Therefore, the loss of a single chromosome does not necessarily accompany the loss of another, but the high rate of simultaneous missegregation points to general chromosome instability in old cells. Considering that the budding yeast haploid genome has 16 chromosomes, the high loss frequency of a single chromosome and the fact that individual chromosomes are lost in not fully independent manners, we estimate that 35–70% of aging mother cells likely lose several chromosomes in their final division, whereas the other cells die with an intact karyotype. We concluded that, much like many other organisms, yeast undergoes a burst of chromosome instability in old age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to chromosomes, extra-chromosomal DNA circles accumulate in the yeast mother cell with age rather than being lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, deleting the centromere from a chromosome causes the retention of both sister chromatids in the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kruitwagen et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we wondered whether centromeres drive chromosome loss in old mother cells. DNA circles containing a centromeric sequence (<italic>CEN</italic>) were lost from aged mother cells at a similar rate to full-size chromosomes (~20% of old cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Removing the centromere of the exact same circle was shown in previous work to cause its retention in the mother cell rather than its loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, centromeres are necessary and sufficient for chromosomes and mini chromosomes to be lost from aging mother cells. To exclude the possibility that the TetO array used to label them is the cause of chromosome and mini-chromosome loss in aging, we also characterized the stability of a circular mini-chromosome expressing short-lived GFP as a marker instead of TetO repeats. Scoring of the GFP signal demonstrated that old mother cells lost these mini-chromosomes at essentially the same frequency as they lost the TetO-labeled one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). We concluded that centromeres drive chromosome loss in old cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Aged cells asymmetrically partition both sister chromatids to the bud</title><p>Given the prominent role of the centromere in chromosome loss, we rationalized that the loss of chromosomes in old mother cells could be due to mitotic missegregation events. To determine whether it was the case, we next focused our analysis on cells imaged during mitosis in time-lapse recordings of aging cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Analysis of anaphases in old mother cells revealed a striking increase in the frequency of chromosome missegregation, using labeled chromosome II, IV, and minichromosome as reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In 600 total anaphase events captured in our movies, we found that 66 (11%) of them co-segregated the labeled sister chromatids to a single pole with 54/66 (82%) of the missegregation events resulting in asymmetric partition of the chromatids to the bud of these old mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This was virtually never observed in young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Remarkably, the frequency of chromosome loss in the old mother cells and of sister chromatids segregating asymmetrically to the bud were in the same size order, irrespective of whether chromosome II or chromosome IV was labeled. Therefore, chromosome loss from old mother cells seems fully explained by a rise in sister chromatid non-disjunction with age, resulting in co-segregation of the sister chromatids asymmetrically to the bud. Next, we examined the mechanism behind this peculiar mode of directed chromosome missegregation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Old cells lose chromosomes by asymmetric sister chromatid partitioning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Images of anaphase cells carrying the labeled chromosome II as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

Consequently, labeling of stable SPB components, such as the core SPB protein Spc42, with mCherry causes the pre-existing SPB to shine bright and segregate in 95% of mitoses to the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, red arrowhead), while the new one is dim and remains in accordance with proportions in the mother cell. This useful effect is a result of the folding kinetics of mCherry. In short, mCherry matures slowly (~45 min half-time) relative to the duration of yeast mitosis (~50 min from spindle assembly to completion of cytokinesis), and therefore the new mCherry-labeled SPB is dimmer than the old one. Given the mother-daughter bias of SPB inheritance and sister chromatid missegregation with age, we wondered whether the non-disjoining sister chromatids of old cells attach to and co-segregate with the old SPB. Thus, we examined the partition of the labeled chromosomes relative to the pre-existing and new SPBs in old mother cells (t=24 hr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). In about 10% of old cells, SPB inheritance is inverted, meaning that the old SPB goes to the mother cell instead of the daughter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lengefeld et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>). In a strong majority of these cases (80%), the non-disjoining sister chromatids followed the old SPB to the mother cell, instead of going to the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). We conclude that non-disjoining sister chromatids of old mother cells remained attached to the pre-existing SPB and partitioned with it to the bud, causing them to lose these chromosomes. In other words, SPB identity mattered more than mother-daughter identity in determining which cell inherited the mis-segregated chromosomes.</p><p>In budding yeast, sister chromatids both initially attach to the pre-existing SPB, which is available first. These syntelic attachments are then dissolved by the aurora B kinase, allowing sister chromatids to reorient, reach bi-orientation, and partition symmetrically in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biggins et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheeseman et al., 2002</xref>). Failure to correct these initial attachment errors causes sister chromatids to co-segregate with the old SPB to the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2002</xref>). The similarity between this phenotype and the mechanism of chromosome loss in old mother cells suggested, therefore, that the error correction pathway might be impaired in old yeast cells. To test this possibility, we analysed the effects of dampening the function of aurora B (called Ipl1 in budding yeast) during aging. Young cells carrying the temperature-sensitive <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutant allele and grown at a permissive temperature (27 °C) showed no detectable chromosome loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). However, they started losing chromosomes early in age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), resulting in a shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Strikingly, the chromosome loss frequency of the old <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutant cells (t=24 h) was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type cells, indicating that the effects of age and reducing Ipl1 activity were not additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that age and the <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutation affect the same pathway. We concluded that old cells lose chromosomes due to defects in correcting chromosome attachment errors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ERC accumulation drives chromosome loss in aging</title><p>To identify mechanisms behind the deterioration of mitotic error correction with age, we investigated whether chromosome loss is causally linked to other aging events, particularly to the displacement of the basket from NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>). Given that basket displacement is triggered by accumulating ERCs and their SAGA-dependent anchorage to NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>), we first investigated whether ERC accumulation promotes chromosome loss. Mutant cells lacking the deacetylase Sir2, which inhibits recombination in the rDNA locus, form ERCs at an increased rate, accumulate them quicker, and their replicative lifespan is shorter than that of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</xref>). Supporting the notion that ERC accumulation might promote chromosome loss, these mutant cells also showed a strong and premature loss of the reporter chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To further test the effect of ERC accumulation, we asked whether reducing their formation rate delays chromosome loss. Recombination in the rDNA locus is stimulated by the presence of a replication fork barrier between rDNA units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Defossez et al., 1999</xref>). While these barriers prevent the transcription machinery to collide with replication forks coming from neighbouring rDNA units, the stalling forks are fragile, causing high rates of double-strand breaks. Therefore, removing these fork barriers, for example, by inactivating the fork barrier protein Fob1, drastically decreases the rate at which ERCs form and accumulate, stabilizes the nuclear baskets of NPCs, and prolongs the life span of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Defossez et al., 1999</xref>). Strikingly, the <italic>fob1∆</italic> mutant cells trapped in our microfluidics platform lost chromosome II at a substantially reduced frequency compared to wild-type cells, even after dividing 20 times or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Introducing an artificial replicative DNA circle with a different sequence than an ERC into wild-type cells also promoted chromosome loss, supporting the idea that DNA circles promote chromosome loss with age independently of their sequence (see below). Taken together, the chromosome loss rates seen in cells with artificial DNA circles, along with those in <italic>sir2∆</italic> and <italic>fob1∆</italic> cells, show that chromosome loss correlates well with the accumulation of extrachromosomal DNA circles. Since the primary known effect of DNA circle accumulation is to cause the displacement of the nuclear basket from NPCs, we wondered next whether this event was causally linked to chromosome loss. Supporting this notion, removal of the SAGA subunit Sgf73, which mediates ERC attachment to NPCs and the subsequent displacement of their nuclear basket, phenocopied the effect of the <italic>fob1∆</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>): the <italic>sgf73∆</italic> mutant cells failed to show any significant increase in chromosome loss frequency at any age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This impaired ability to correct erroneous chromosome attachments, in turn, caused old mother cells to lose chromosomes to their buds. To test this hypothesis, we next investigated how basket displacement could lead to asymmetric chromosome partitioning.

Surprisingly, these three genes all function with Ipl1/aurora B in preventing syntelic chromosome attachment. Nbl1/borealin is a component of the chromosome passenger complex of which aurora B/Ipl1 is the catalytic subunit. Mcm21/CENP-O is a docking receptor for Ipl1/aurora B at kinetochores. Glc7/PP1A is the protein phosphatase 1, which counteracts aurora B by dephosphorylating its targets at the outer-kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pinsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poddar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakajima et al., 2009</xref>).

This idea gained in traction as we progressed, because ERC attachment, and the attachment of any DNA circle, to NPCs is known to mediate nuclear basket displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, we further investigated the relationships between DNA circle accumulation and chromosome loss by investigating how the removal of <italic>NBL1</italic>, <italic>MCM21,</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic> introns affected chromosome loss observed upon DNA circle accumulation. For this, we followed two parallel approaches. First, we tested whether introducing a replicative DNA circle into the cells is sufficient to drive chromosome loss during aging, and if so, whether this event required the presence of the introns of <italic>NBL1</italic>, <italic>MCM21,</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic>. Thus, we transformed the wild-type and the <italic>3 x∆i</italic> mutant strains carrying the labeled chromosome II as reporter with the yeast replicative plasmid YRp17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mann and Davis, 1983</xref>). We then monitored the frequency at which these transformed cells lost the reporter chromosome as they underwent aging. YRp17 contains a replication origin (<italic>ARS1</italic>) but no centromere, such that it accumulates in the mother cells with each replicative cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>), the cells carrying YRp17 showed a much shorter lifespan (10 CBE median RLS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Remarkably, however, the effect of YRp17 on longevity was substantially suppressed by the 3 x∆i mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Analysis of chromosome loss indicated that introducing this DNA circle promoted chromosome loss, starting early in life and increasing rapidly with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, removal of the introns of <italic>NBL1</italic>, <italic>MCM21,</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic> (<italic>3 x∆i</italic> cells) largely suppressed the effect of YRp17 on chromosome loss.

As for YRp17, the effect of the 3 x∆i was substantial and significant, but partial. Thus, we concluded that the accumulation of DNA circles, such as ERCs and others, which promote the dissociation of the basket from NPCs and thereby drive chromosome loss at least in part through the introns of <italic>NBL1</italic>, <italic>MCM21,</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic>.

Furthermore, the effect of nuclear basket removal from NPCs was primarily mediated by three introns. This suggested that the nuclear basket of NPCs enforces proper chromosome segregation through its function in pre-mRNA processing or quality control. To test this possibility, we next investigated whether old mother cells show defects in pre-mRNA quality control. Since basket mutant cells fail to retain unspliced pre-mRNAs in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnet and Palancade, 2015</xref>), we reasoned that old yeast mother cells also might leak pre-mRNAs to the cytoplasm.</p><p>As a first proof of principle, we characterized the localization of intronic RNA sequences in young and old cells, using single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA FISH). Most yeast introns are short (50–150 nucleotides) and well below the minimal size detectable by smRNA FISH (&gt;500 nts, ideally &gt;1 kb). In the yeast genome, only 20 introns are longer than 500 nucleotides. Thus, we created probes for the longest introns, namely those of <italic>DBP2</italic> (766 nts) and <italic>YRA1</italic> (1002 nts), and of <italic>GLC7</italic> because of its role in chromosome segregation (525 nts). The introns of <italic>NBL1</italic> (66 nts) and <italic>MCM21</italic> (88 nts) are too short for smRNA FISH. Cohorts of old cells were collected using the mother enrichment program (MEP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref> followed by FACS sorting to reach high homogeneity (see methods). By inducing cell death in the daughter cells specifically, the MEP ensures that aging mother cells are diluted linearly instead of exponentially in the population, greatly facilitating the isolation of very old cells. FACS sorting ensured that the cohorts were free of young cells and young cell debris. With each of these three series of smRNA FISH probes, we detected one or two nuclear foci in young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Only very few cells (&lt;3%) showed a focus in the cytoplasm. No foci were detected upon deleting the corresponding introns (∆i), demonstrating probe specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). In contrast, for each of the three introns tested, smRNA FISH detected intronic RNA sequences in the cytoplasm of most old cells. This was not due to an increase in overall smRNA FISH foci number during aging (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but due to the change in foci distribution between nucleus and the cytoplasm. For example, in the case of <italic>GLC7,</italic> ~70% of smRNA FISH foci were found in the cytoplasm of old mother cells, compared to ~3% in young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Thus, 3 out of 3 tested introns showed a strong tendency to leak to the cytoplasm in old mother cells.

Thus, we asked whether inducing pre-mRNA leakage in young cells would trigger chromosome loss. The two yeast SR-proteins Gbp2 and Hrb1 have been implicated in the retention of pre-mRNAs in the nucleus by binding intron-containing transcripts and delaying their export until they are properly spliced or degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hackmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hurt et al., 2004</xref>).

This results in asymmetric partitioning of sister chromatids and age-associated chromosome loss.

In this study, we investigated whether NPC remodelling in old yeast cells contributed to the emergence of other aging phenotypes, using chromosome loss as a case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>). We showed that NPC remodelling is both necessary and sufficient to drive the age-associated increase in chromosome loss and we identified the mechanisms involved. Specifically, interventions that promoted displacement of the NPC basket, or basket defects more broadly, enhanced non-disjunction and missegregation of sister chromatids to the bud, thereby promoting chromosome loss in old yeast cells. These interventions included mutations that stimulated ERC formation and removed the main yeast TPR isoform, Mlp1. Conversely, interventions that prevented NPC remodelling, such as delaying ERC accumulation or preventing their anchorage and the recruitment of SAGA to NPCs, restored proper chromosome segregation in old cells and suppressed chromosome loss. Thus, NPC remodeling appeared to be the pivotal point for triggering chromosome loss in old cells.</p><p>Two potential caveats should be considered. First, the <italic>sir2∆</italic> and <italic>fob1∆</italic> mutations each have effects beyond influencing ERC formation rates. The <italic>sir2∆</italic> mutant cells lose silencing of the hidden mating type loci, genetically behaving as diploids. They fail to silence subtelomeric regions and act through some as-yet unknown mechanism on the maintenance of proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rine and Herskowitz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gottschling et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith and Boeke, 1997</xref>). Likewise, the <italic>fob1∆</italic> mutation renders the rDNA locus unstable, which might interfere with rRNA transcription and ribosome biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kobayashi et al., 1998</xref>). However, their only clear common denominator is that they both affect ERC formation, and hence NPC remodelling, even if in opposite manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Defossez et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>sgf73∆</italic> mutation phenocopies the effects of the <italic>fob1∆</italic> mutation. Here again, the only known functional overlap between Fob1 and Sgf73 is that they promote ERC accumulation in the mother cell indirectly (Fob1) or directly (Sgf73), ERC anchorage to NPCs, and the consequent displacement of NPC basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, introducing another DNA circle in the form of a non-centromeric replicative plasmid, a process that also causes basket displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>), promoted chromosome loss as well. Thus, our data establish that DNA circle accumulation and attachment to NPCs trigger chromosome loss. Destabilizing the basket independently of DNA circle accumulation also promotes the premature onset of chromosome loss, indicating that it is the basket displacement from NPCs that triggers chromosome loss upon DNA circle accumulation.</p><p>A second possible caveat is that chromosome loss could be linked to aging in some other manner. To address this possibility, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that link basket displacement and chromosome loss. Our data reveal that chromosome loss is due to the non-correction of syntelic chromosome attachments in old cells. In young cells, the kinase aurora B and its accessory factors enforce such corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biggins et al., 1999</xref>). Our data also show that the inhibition of error correction in old cells requires the presence of three introns, those of the genes <italic>NBL1</italic>, <italic>MCM21,</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic>. These three genes are the only chromosome segregation machinery genes that contain an intron. Strikingly, the proteins Nbl1, Mcm21, and Glc7 are all involved in the error correction pathway, together with aurora B/Ipl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pinsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poddar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakajima et al., 2009</xref>). Removing their introns restored proper attachment correction and chromosome segregation in old cells and suppressed the premature chromosome loss phenotype of the <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutant cells grown at semi-permissive temperature. Intron removal delays cell death but does not abrogate aging. Furthermore, removing these introns not only suppresses chromosome missegregation in old wild-type cells, but also in young <italic>mlp1∆</italic> mutant cells. Thus, intron removal separates aging and chromosome loss, indicating that these introns are part of the proximal cause of chromosome loss and act independently of age. Therefore, our data indicate that there is a direct, intron-dependent link between basket displacement from NPCs and chromosome loss. Our data indicate that this link involves the leakage of unspliced pre-mRNAs out of the nucleus upon basket removal and affects the basket’s function in mRNA quality control. The fact that another independent set of mutations that also interfere with pre-mRNA retention in the nucleus, such as the <italic>gbp2∆ hrb1∆</italic> double mutant cells, also increases the frequency of chromosome loss through the same three introns strengthens this conclusion. Thus, together our data establish that displacement of the nuclear basket from NPCs in old mother cells directly triggers chromosome non-disjunction and loss through causing the leakage of the pre-mRNAs of the intron-containing genes <italic>NBL1</italic>, <italic>MCM21,</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic>.</p><p>This conclusion has several consequences and opens new questions. The key question stems from our observation that releasing pre-mRNA from the nucleus relaxes the control that cells impose on chromosome attachment. The question is, how does this work? Does it involve the translation of the pre-mRNAs in the cytoplasm? Does it come about through the correlated loss of properly mature mRNAs and hence, the reduced expression of their products? Two arguments speak against these interpretations. First, if any of these two options were to account for the effect of pre-mRNA leakage, mutations affecting splicing efficiency would lead to the same effects. However, tempering with the spliceosome does not affect the correction of chromosome attachment errors to any extent and specificity close to the effects of pre-mRNA leakage. Second, since Mcm21 and Glc7 have opposite effects on chromosome correction, it is unclear how impairing the expression of both would lead to the synergistic effects that we observe between them. Finally, analysis of RNA-seq data from replicatively aged cells indicates that if aging indeed impairs the splicing of some transcripts, such as those encoding ribosomal proteins, it stimulates that of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gómez-Montalvo et al., 2024</xref>). This suggests that aging has a non-linear effect on intron-containing transcripts. It will be important to determine whether basket displacement contributes to these effects, how it does so, and whether this could explain the effect it has on the error correction pathway.</p><p>Our observation that basket displacement has such profound and highly specific impacts on processes functionally very distant from that of the NPC, such as chromosome segregation, has several consequences as well. First, it means that NPC remodelling could affect many more cellular functions than only chromosome segregation. Interestingly, beyond mRNA quality control, the basket of the NPC is also involved in protein quality control and the activation of environmentally regulated genes, two processes that are impaired in old cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">López-Otín et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, basket displacement might contribute to these phenotypes in aging cells. It is also very likely that the role of the basket in mRNA quality control could affect more than only chromosome segregation. Curiously, while budding yeasts have kept only a subset of the introns of their ancestors, these introns are not distributed randomly and seem to be enriched in very specific processes, such as genes coding for ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and proteasome subunits, components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lim et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, decay of the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ribosome assembly are classical and ubiquitous hallmarks of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">López-Otín et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janssens and Veenhoff, 2016</xref>). Thus, it is possible that basket displacement in old cells contributes to the emergence of these aging phenotypes as well.</p><p>A second type of consequences emerging from our observations stems from the fact that displacement of the NPCs’ basket is also observed in stressed cells and not solely in the context of aging. For example, heat shock also causes basket displacement in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carmody et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the downstream effects we observe in old cells also take place during stress response. In this respect, it is interesting to note that heat shock has been associated with a strong rise in aneuploidy in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shen et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, aneuploidy is a common response to environmental stress and a primary mechanism for the emergence of stress-resistant clones in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilchrist and Stelkens, 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the chromosome missegregation resulting from basket displacement might be a selected response to stress. It might be selectively advantageous for cells to actively promote karyotype variations when their survival is in question. It is therefore worth considering that a similar process, perhaps using similar mechanisms, underlies the aneuploidy of cancer cells.</p><p>Third, the role of basket displacement in the emergence of aging phenotypes is likely not a peculiarity of yeast. Using proteomics, basket displacement has been inferred to take place in aging cells such as the hepatocytes of old mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malik et al., 2023</xref>). Little is known about whether the nuclear basket of metazoans plays a similar role in pre-mRNA retention in the nucleus as that of yeast, but it is striking that intron retention is one of the hallmarks of aging on the metazoan transcriptome, and that pre-mRNA processing genes are important for mitotic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mariotti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adusumalli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funk et al., 2022</xref>). Intron retention would be expected if some transcripts escaped the nucleus prematurely. More strikingly, perhaps the most ubiquitous effect of the expression of the progeric variant of lamin A, progerin, across cell types is the displacement of the nuclear basket protein TPR from NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larrieu et al., 2018</xref>). We know still very little about the impact of basket displacement in the aetiology of the Gilford-Hutchinson Progeria Syndrome, but our study suggests that it might be relevant. If so, investigating the potential effects of progerin on pre-mRNA leakage might become an essential step towards understanding how progerin expression causes premature aging.</p><p>In a broader sense, our findings might bring fundamental insights towards our understanding of aging. For decades, the role of ERCs in aging has been perceived as a yeast peculiarity. However, the effect it has on NPCs may close the gap. On one hand, it seems to illuminate what might be the commonality between ERC-driven aging in yeast and other aging processes in other eukaryotes. Indeed, the basket-centric view of aging that we propose here would explain how ERCs actually cause aging in yeast and indicate that while ERC accumulation might be a yeast idiosyncrasy, its downstream effects are not. On the other hand, this idea opens two corollary questions. (1) What is the biological significance of eccDNAs promoting basket displacement in yeast? (2) What causes basket displacement in other aging systems? We are intrigued by the idea that ERCs and any replicating eccDNA for that matter are the closest mimics that laboratory yeast strain may encounter of pathogenic DNA of exogenous origin. In that perspective, basket displacement and the ensuing effects might have first appeared as a response to infections. In other words, yeast aging might reflect the activity of a death pathway that normally functions in pathogen control. It might represent a fungal version of the inflammatory or auto-immune response in metazoans. Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate whether exogenous or non-chromosomal DNA, such as that of viruses, also triggers the displacement of the nuclear basket from NPCs in yeast and other systems, and whether this contributes to either or both of anti-viral defence and aging. If so, aging might have emerged as an anti-viral defence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YYB strains</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YYB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Full list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CEN TetO-plasmid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YYB 16094 strain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CEN Ubi-GFP plasmid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PYB2665</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YRp17</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mann and Davis, 1983</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PYB546</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MM Primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MM primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Full list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">smRNA FISH probes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>GLC7, DBP2, YRA1</italic> smRNA FISH probes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Full list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay, kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">QIAGEN gel extraction kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">QIAGEN</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ref:28604</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay, kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MACHEREY-NAGEL plasmid extraction kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MACHEREY-NAGEL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ref:740588.250</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Graphpad Prism 10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dotmatics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 10.4.0 (621)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ-FIJI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ-FIJI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">v1.54q</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Microsoft Excel</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Microsoft</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Microsoft Word</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Microsoft</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adobe Illustrator</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adobe</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SWITCH - ETH ZURICH</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Lead contact</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Yves Barral (yves.barral@bc.biol.ethz.ch).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Materials availability</title><p>This study generated ~50 novel yeast strains, derived either by crossing or transformation.

The PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) microchannel is made by soft-lithography and bonded on the 30 mm micro-well cover glass in the 55 mm glass bottom dish (Cellvis, CA, USA). For lifespan analyses, a chip with a new cell trapping design was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2022</xref>) to ensure excellent retention of old cells.</p><p>To start the aging experiment, yeast cells were pre-cultured for 24 hr in SD-full media supplemented with 0.1% Albumin Bovine Serum (protease-free BSA; Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium). Young cells from an exponentially growing culture were captured in the traps of the microfluidic chip; the chip was continuously flushed with fresh medium at a constant flow of 10 μl/min, using a Harvard PHD Ultra syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holiston, MA, USA) with 60 ml syringe per lane, with inner diameter 26.7 mm (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Bright field images in a single z focal plane were recorded every 15 min throughout the duration of the entire experiment to measure replicative age of cells. To record fluorescent signals, images with a fluorescent lamp and at least 13 x z-stacks (0.5 μm step) were acquired in 12 hr intervals. For imaging, we used an epi-fluorescent microscope (TiE, Nikon Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) controlled by Micro-Manager 1.4.23 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>), with a Plan Apo 60×1.4 NA objective. For fluorescence illumination of the GFP and mCherry-labeled proteins, a Lumencor Spectra-X LED Light Engine was used. Z stacks of &gt;13 slices with 0.5 μm spacing were recorded for fluorescent imaging every 12 hr to cover the entire volume of the nucleus during the aging process. Transmitted light imaging was done in a single Z plane to minimize the light exposure of the cells. The age of the cell was defined by the number of daughter cells that emerged during the budding cycles (CBE).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Chromosome loss assessment</title><p>For the assessment of chromosome and mini-chromosome loss and missegregation in aging, trapped cells in the chip that had the labeled chromosomes at the initial time point of 0 hr (~virtually all cells) were followed in transmitted light channel and fluorescent images were acquired every 12 hr. Only cells where the entire volume of the nucleus was in focus and imaged, and where SPB was clearly visible were considered in the analysis. The background fluorescence was subtracted in FIJI using a subtract background function. The aged nuclei were examined by scrolling through the z stack (&gt;13 stacks, 0,5 μm step) in both channels to validate the presence of the SPBs and TetR foci in the mother or the daughter cell. ‘Chromosome loss’ refers to two quantified events: (1) The absence of the chromosome from a mother or a daughter cell compartment during anaphase (2) A G1 mother cell that just underwent its final division and is clearly viable, with a present SPB dot, but no chromosome dot. When ‘Chromosome loss’ is listed, it pertains to the sum of these two events. When ‘chromosome loss in anaphase’ is listed, it only pertains to the loss frequency observed during anaphase. Cells which lost chromosomes due to abnormal mitotic events in the last replicative division, such as SPB overamplification or full nuclei migration into the bud (Combined ~10% of all cells in the final replicative division) were discarded from the quantifications. All cells were examined in the DIC channel for signs of disrupted morphology indicating cell death and followed up in DIC to confirm cell death after chromosome loss. For the assessment of minichromosome loss in aging (TetO array or ubi-GFP minichromosome), the yeast cultures were grown in SD-LEU or SD-URA selective media enabling minichromosome maintenance in all starting young cells. When loaded onto an aging chip cell were transferred to SD complete media, allowing them to lose the minichromosome during aging without inducing cell death. As the cells were grown in selective media, the minichromosome loss rate at 0 hr is N/A. In general, aging chips are not suitable for measurement of chromosome loss frequency in young cells, as cells within the young population that are missegregating chromosomes are usually stressed and enlarged, and thus cannot be loaded into the microfluidic traps intended for normal young cells. For chromosome missegregation frequency in young cells, we have used classical confocal imaging on a patch of SD agar, as described in the Microscopy section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Measurements of chromosome loss per CBE</title><p>To measure chromosome loss probability per Completed Budding Event (CBE), we utilized at least 150 cells per genotype and quantified the number of cells that lost the reporter chromosome during a specific replicative division.

This paper provides a compelling insight into the basis of chromosome missegregation in aged cells, tying this phenomenon to the established Nuclear Pore Complex architecture remodeling that occurs with aging across a large span of diverse organisms. The authors first establish that aged mother cells exhibit aberrant error correction during mitosis. As extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) are known to increase with age and lead to NPC dysfunction that can result in leakage of unspliced pre-mRNAs, Mirkovic et al search for intron-containing genes in yeast that may be underlying chromosome missegregation, identifying three genes in the aurora B-dependent error correction pathway: MCM21, NBL1, and GLC7. Interestingly, intron-less mutants in these genes suppress chromosome loss in aged cells, with a significant impact observed when all three introns were deleted (3x∆i). The 3x∆i mutant also suppresses the increased chromosome loss resulting from nuclear basket destabilization in a mlp1∆ mutant. The authors then directly test if aged cells do exhibit aberrant mRNA export, using RNA FISH to identify that old cells indeed leak intron-containing pre-mRNA into the cytoplasm, as well as a reporter assay to demonstrate translation of leaked pre-mRNA, and that this is suppressed in cells producing less ERCs. Mutants causing increased pre-mRNA leakage are sufficient to induce chromosome missegregation, which is suppressed by the 3x∆i.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The finding that deleting the introns of 3 genes in the Aurora B pathway can suppress age-related chromosome missegregation is highly compelling. Additionally, the rationale behind the various experiments in this paper is well-reasoned and clearly explained.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>My main concerns have been thoroughly addressed by the authors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104530.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mirkovic</surname><given-names>Mihailo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05a28rw58</institution-id><institution>Department of Biology, ETH Zurich</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zürich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McCarthy</surname><given-names>Jordan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05a28rw58</institution-id><institution>Department of Biology, ETH Zurich</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zürich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Meinema</surname><given-names>Anne Cornelis</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05a28rw58</institution-id><institution>Department of Biology, ETH Zurich</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zürich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Partenau</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Sherbrooke</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Sherbrooke</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sung Sik</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05a28rw58</institution-id><institution>Department of Biology, ETH Zurich</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zürich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05a28rw58</institution-id><institution>SCOPE-M (Scientific Center for Optical and Electron Microscopy), ETH Zurich</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zürich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Elela</surname><given-names>Sherif Abou</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Université de Sherbrooke</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Sherbrooke</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Barral</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05a28rw58</institution-id><institution>Department of Biology, ETH Zurich</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zürich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors explore a novel mechanism linking aging to chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy in yeast cells.

In short, chromosome loss is an abrupt, late event in the lifespan of the cells. To examine its prevalence, we have quantified the combined loss frequency of two chromosomes when both are labelled in the same cell. Whereas single chromosomes are lost at a frequency of 10-15% per cell, less than 5% of the cells lose both at the same time. Thus, the different chromosomes are lost largely but not fully independently from each other. Based on these data, and on the fact that yeast cells have 16 chromosomes, we evaluate that about half of the cells lose at least one chromosome in their final cell cycle.</p><p>We also tried to estimate the prevalence of the pre-mRNA leakage phenotype, based on the increased mCherry to GFP ratio observed between 0h and 24 hours of aging for 146 individual cells. For this analysis, we compared the mCherry/GFP ratio at 0 and 24h for the same individual cell. This analysis indicates that 81% of the cells show a fold change strictly above 1 as they age. Furthermore, the data appears to be unimodal. Thus, we can conservatively conclude that a majority of the cells show premRNA leakage at 24 hours. Since not all cells are at the end of their life at that time, this is possibly an underestimate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, a discussion would be needed to clarify the relationship between &quot;chromosome loss&quot; in this study and &quot;genomic missegregation&quot; reported previously in yeast aging.</p></disp-quote><p>Genomic mis-segregation is characterized by the entry of both SPBs and all the chromosomes into the daughter cell compartment (PMID: 31714209). We have observed these events in our movies as well. However, the chromosome loss phenotype that we are focusing on affects only some chromosomes (as discussed above) and takes place under proper elongation of the spindle, with one SPB remaining in the mother cell whereas the other one goes to the bud, as shown in the manuscript’s Figure 2. In our movies, chromosome loss is at least three-fold more frequent (for a single chromosome) than full genome mis-segregation (Sup Fig 1A-B). Furthermore, whereas chromosome loss is alleviated by the removal of the introns of MCM21, NBL1 and GLC7, genomic mis-segregation is not (Sup Fig 1B). Thus, genomic mis-segregation mentioned by the reviewer is a process distinct from the chromosome loss that we report. This discussion and the relevant data have been added to the manuscript.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up the possible confusion between these two phenotypes, allowing us to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors make the interesting discovery of increased chromosome non-dysjunction in aging yeast mother cells.

The authors then work to tie this phenotype to other age-associated phenotypes that have been previously characterized: accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles that then correlate with compromised nuclear pore export functions, which correlates with &quot;leaky&quot; pores that permit unspliced mRNA messages to be inappropriately exported to the cytoplasm. They then infer that three intron containing mRNAs that encode portions in resolving sister chromatid separation during mitosis, are unspliced in this age-associated defect and thus lead to the non-dysjunction problem.</p><p>Strengths: The discovery of age-associated chromosome non-dysjunction is an interesting discovery, and it is demonstrated in a convincing fashion with &quot;classic&quot; microscopy-based single cell fluorescent chromosome assays that are appropriate and seem robust. The correlation of this phenotype with other age-associated phenotypes - specifically extrachromosomal rDNA circles and nuclear pore dysfunction - is supported by in vivo genetic manipulations that have been well-characterized in the past.</p><p>In addition, the application of the single cell mRNA splicing defect reporter showed very convincingly that general mRNA splicing is compromised in aged cells. Such a pleiotropic event certainly has big implications.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this assessment of our work. To avoid confusion, we would like to stress out, however, that our data do not show that splicing per se is defective in old cells. Actually, we specifically show that the cells are unlikely to show splicing defect (last figure of the original and the revised version of the manuscript). Our data specifically show that unspliced mRNAs tend to leak out of the nucleus of old cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The biggest weakness is &quot;connecting all the dots&quot; of causality and linking the splicing defect to chromosome disjunction. I commend the authors for making a valiant effort in this regard, but there are many caveats to this interpretation. While the &quot;triple intron&quot; removal suppressed the non-dysjunction defect in aged cells, this could simply be a kinetic fix, where a slowdown in the relevant aspects of mitosis, could give the cell time to resolve the syntelic attachment of the chromatids.</p></disp-quote><p>The possibility that intron-removal leads to a kinetic fix is an interesting idea that we have now considered. In the revised manuscript, we now provide measurements of mitotic duration in the “triple intron” mutant compared to wild type cells and the duration of their last cell cycle (See supplementary figure 3A-D). There is no evidence that removing these introns slows down mitosis. Thus, the kinetic fix hypothesis is unlikely to explain our observation about the effect of intron removal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To this point, I note that the intron-less version of GLC7, which affects the most dramatic suppression of the three genes, is reported by one of the authors to have a slow growth rate (Parenteau et al, 2008 - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e07-12-1254">https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e07-12-1254</ext-link>)</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, removing the intron of GLC7 reduces the expression levels of the gene product (PMID: 16816425) to about 50% of the original value and causes a slow growth phenotype. However, the cells revert fairly rapidly through duplication of the GLC7-∆i gene (see supplementary Figure 3EF). As a consequence, neither the GLC7-∆i nor the 3x∆i mutant strains show noticeable growth phenotypes by spot assays. We now document these findings in supplementary figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the Herculean effort to perform FISH of the introns in the cytoplasm is quite literally at the statistical limit of this assay. The data were not as robust as the other assays employed through this study. The data show either &quot;no&quot; signal for the young cells or a signal of 0, 1, or 2 FISH foci in the aged cells. In a Poisson distribution, which this follows, it is improbable to distinguish between these differences.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct, this experiment was not the easiest of the manuscript... However, despite the limitations of the assay, the data presented in figure 7B are very clear. 300 cells aged by MEP were analysed, divided in the cohorts of 100 each, and the distribution of foci (nuclear vs cytoplasmic) in these aged cells were compared to the distribution in three cohorts of young cells. For all 3 aged cohorts, over 70% of the visible foci were cytoplasmic, while in the young cells, this figure was around 3%. A t-test was conducted to compare these frequencies between young and old cells (Figure 7B). The difference is highly significant. Therefore, we are clearly not at the statistical limit.</p><p>What the reviewer refers to is the supplementary Figure 4, where we were simply asking (i) is the signal lost in cells lacking the intron of GLC7 (the response is unambiguously yes) and (ii) what is the general number of dots per cell between young and old wild type cells (without distinguishing between nuclear and cytoplasmic) and the information to be taken from this last quantification is indeed that there is no clearly distinguishable difference between these two population of cells, as the reviewer rightly concludes. In other word, the reason why there are more dots in the cytoplasm of the old cells in the Figure 7B is not because the old cells have much more dots in general (see supplementary Figure 4C). We hope that these clarifications help understand the data better. We have edited the manuscript to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mirkovic et al explore the cause underlying development of aneuploidy during aging. This paper provides a compelling insight into the basis of chromosome missegregation in aged cells, tying this phenomenon to the established Nuclear Pore Complex architecture remodelling that occurs with aging across a large span of diverse organisms. The authors first establish that aged mother cells exhibit aberrant error correction during mitosis. As extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) are known to increase with age and lead to NPC dysfunction that can result in leakage of unspliced pre-mRNAs, Mirkovic et al search for intron-containing genes in yeast that may be underlying chromosome missegregation, identifying three genes in the aurora B-dependent error correction pathway: MCM21, NBL1, and GLC7. Interestingly, intron-less mutants in these genes suppress chromosome loss in aged cells, with a significant impact observed when all three introns were deleted (3x∆i). The 3x∆i mutant also suppresses the increased chromosome loss resulting from nuclear basket destabilization in a mlp1∆ mutant. The authors then directly test if aged cells do exhibit aberrant mRNA export, using RNA FISH to identify that old cells indeed leak intron-containing pre-mRNA into the cytoplasm, as well as a reporter assay to demonstrate translation of leaked pre-mRNA, and that this is suppressed in cells producing less ERCs. Mutants causing increased pre-mRNA leakage are sufficient to induce chromosome missegregation, which is suppressed by the 3x∆i.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The finding that deleting the introns of 3 genes in the Aurora B pathway can suppress age-related chromosome missegregation is highly compelling. Additionally, the rationale behind the various experiments in this paper is well-reasoned and clearly explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their very positive assessment of our work</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In some cases, controls for experiments were not presented or were depicted in other figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry about this confusion. We have improved our presentation of the controls, bringing them back each time they are relevant. We have also added those that were missing (such as those mentioned by reviewer 2, see above). Note that the frequencies of centromeric plasmid loss at 0h in Figure 1C is not meaningful and therefore not presented. Since the cells were grown on selective medium before loading on to the ageing chip, we cannot report a plasmid loss frequency here. The ageing experiments themselves were subsequently conducted in full medium, to allow for centromeric plasmid loss without killing the cell. We explain this in the materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>High variability was seen in chromosome loss data, leading to large error bars.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The variance in those two figures (3A and 5D) comes from the suboptimal plotting of this data. This is now corrected as follows. We divided the available data into 4 cohorts and then plotted the average loss frequency across these cohorts for the indicated age groups. This filters out much of the noise and improves the statistical resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The text could have been more polished.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have gone through the manuscript again in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors)</bold>:</p><p>(1) A previous study (PMID: 31714209). showed that aging yeast cells undergo genomic missegregation in which material was abnormally segregated to the daughter cells, leading to cell cycle arrest. After that, the missegregation is either corrected by returning aberrantly segregated genetic material to the mother cells so that they can resume cell cycles, or if not corrected, the mother cells will terminally exist the cell cycle and eventually die. That paper also showed that this agedependent genomic missegregation is related to rDNA instability. Is the chromosome loss in this work related to the genomic missegregation reported before? Is it partially reversible like genomic missegregation? Are all the chromosomes lost in one cell division, like in the case of genomic missegregation? Some additional characterization and a discussion would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, indeed the phenotype of full genome mis-segregation described by Crane et al. (2019) is observable in our data as well. At 24h ~3% of the cells segregate both SPBs to the bud, as they previously described (Supp Figure 1A and B). This phenomenon is clearly distinct from asymmetric chromosome partition, where cells undergo anaphase, separate the SPBs and segregate one to the mother cell and one to the bud (Figure 2A). Also, asymmetric chromosome partitioning affects only a subset of the chromosomes (see below), not the entire genome. Finally, unlike asymmetric chromosome partitioning, the frequency of genome mis-segregation in ageing was not alleviated by intron removal (Supp Figure 1B). Thus, these two processes are clearly distinct and driven by different mechanisms. Note that asymmetric chromosome partitioning appears 3 to 5 times more frequently than genomic mis-segregation.</p><p>Supporting further the notion that these two processes are distinct, chromosome loss seals the end of the life of the cell, as we reported, indicating that this is not a reversible event. Also, it does not involve all chromosomes at once. Cells that contain the labelled versions of both chromosome II and IV at the same time, the loss frequency of both chromosomes is less than 5%, whereas each chromosome is lost in 10-15% of the cells (Figure 1C). Thus, most cells lose one and keep the other. Furthermore, this indicates that there are many more cells losing at least one chromosome than the 15% that lose chromosome IV for example, probably 50% or more. Thus, chromosome loss by asymmetric segregation is much more frequent than the partly transient transfer of the entire nucleus to the bud.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) What percentage of aging WT cells undergo pre-mRNA leakage (using the GFP/mCherry reporter) during their entire lifespan? Is it a sporadic, reversible process or an accumulative, one-way deterioration? Previous studies (PMID: 32675375; PMID: 24332850; PMID: 36194205; PMID: 31291577) showed that only a fraction of yeast cells age with rDNA instability and ERC accumulation, as indicated by excessive rRNA transcription and nucleolar enlargement. Are they the same fraction of aging cells that undergo pre-mRNA leakage and chromosome loss? This information will indicate the prevalence of the key aging phenotypes reported in this work and should be readily obtainable from microfluidic experiments. In addition, a careful discussion would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Pre-mRNA leakage is relatively widespread in the population, but it is difficult to put a precise number on it. Analysis of how the mCherry/GFP ratio changes in 146 individual cells between 0 and 24 hours and imaging in our microfluidics platform indicates that ~80% show an increase and 50% of the cells show an increase above 1.5-fold. Therefore, the frequencies of pre-mRNA leakage and chromosome loss are probably similar. We have modified the discussion to account for these considerations. This would be in the same range as the frequency of aging by ERC accumulation (mode 1) estimated by PMID: 32675375.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors)</bold></p><p>The manuscript could use a bit of editing in places - please go through it once more.</p><p>Editing suggestions:</p><p>Line 80 – irrespective</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 97 - these are not &quot;rates&quot; but frequencies.

Specifically, although mutants impacting ERC levels were tested for missegregation, it was not directly tested if increased missegregation levels occurred due to ERC tethering to the NPC and subsequent nuclear basket removal. It is possible that the increased ERCs may be driving missegregation via a different pathway. Authors should consider experiments to strengthen this idea, such as looking at chromosome loss frequency in a sir2∆ 3x∆i double mutant, or a sir2∆ sgf73∆ double mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>This connection is addressed in the original version of the manuscript, where we show that preventing attachment of ERCs to the NPC, by removing the linker protein Sgf73, alleviates chromosome loss. The link is further substantiated by the fact that removing the basket on its own promote chromosome loss and that in both cases, namely during normal aging, i.e., upon ERC accumulation, and upon basket removal the mechanism of chromosome loss is the same. In both cases, it depends on the introns of the GLC7, MCM21 and NBL1 genes.</p><p>However, we acknowledge that the mutants tested have pleiotropic effects, making interpretation somewhat difficult, even when examining chromosome loss in multiple mutants that affect ERC formation and NPC remodelling, as we have done. As recommended by the reviewer, we have characterized the phenotype of the sir2∆ 3x∆i mutant strain. Intron removal in the sir2∆ mutant cells largely rescued the elevated chromosome loss frequency of these cells and slightly extended their replicative lifespan (Figure 6D-E). We conclude that intron removal can remedy the chromosome loss phenotype of the sir2∆. Although clearly significant, the effect on the replicative lifespan was not very strong, likely due to the sir2∆ affecting other ageing processes.</p><p>Touching on this question, we added a new set of experiments asking whether any accumulating DNA circle causes chromosome loss in an intron-dependent manner. Thus, we have introduced a noncentromeric replicative plasmid in wild type and 3x∆i mutant strains carrying the labelled version of chromosome II (Figure 6A-C). These studies show that these cells age much faster than wild type cells, as expected, and lose chromosomes at a higher frequency than non-transformed cells. Finally, the effect is at least in part alleviated by removing the introns of NBL1, MCM21 and GLC7.</p><p>Therefore, after adding this new and more direct test of the role of DNA circles in chromosome loss, we are confidently concluding that ERC-mediated basket removal is the trigger of chromosome loss in old cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Minor Points</p><p>(i) In Figure 1C, the text (lines 91-92) argues that chromosome loss happens abruptly as cells age; however the data only show loss at young and old time points, not an intermediate, which leaves open the possibility that chromosome loss is occurring gradually. While cells that lost chromosomes should fail to divide further, we don't know if these events happened and were simply excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that formally the conclusion drawn in the lines 91-92 (of the original manuscript), namely that chromosome loss takes place abruptly as cells age, cannot be drawn from the Figure 1C alone but only from subsequent observations. However, since chromosome loss is lethal in haploid, as we mention in the text and the reviewer notes as well, it is difficult to envision how cells could lose chromosomes before the end of their lifespan and must therefore increase abruptly as the cells reach that point. This is now underlined in the revised version of the manuscript. Accordingly, the frequency of chromosome loss per age group, which is depicted in Figure 3A, shows that the wild type cells that have budded less than 10 times show no chromosome loss. The chromosome loss frequency starts to ramp up only pass that point. Therefore, chromosome loss does not increase linearly with age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, cells that lost minichromosome should not arrest. We suggest that the interpretation of these data should be softened in the text, or that chromosome loss fraction could be more effectively portrayed as a Kaplan-Meier survival curve depicting cells that have not lost chromosomes, if these data are easily available. Or, chromosome loss at an intermediate time point could be depicted.</p></disp-quote><p>Since we cannot visualize more than 2 chromosomes at a time, it is not possible to plot the KaplanMeier curve of cells that have not lost chromosomes. However, as mentioned above, the chromosome loss frequencies at intermediate time points are depicted in Figure 3A and Figure 4B and shows that it increases with age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) Also regarding Figure 1, it would be helpful to expound on the purpose of the minichromosomes, as well as how the Ubi-GFP minichromosome is constructed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now explained why we tested the loss of minichromosome, namely, as a mean to test whether the centromere is necessary and sufficient to drive the loss of the genetic material linked to it, i.e., chromosomes, in old cells. Concerning the Ubi-GFP minichromosome, the Materials and methods section is now updated and reports plasmid construction, backbone used, primers as well as the plasmid sequence being available in the supplementary data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The purpose of the minichromosome initially appears to be the engineering of an eccDNA (ERC) with a CEN to demonstrate distinct behaviour, but it is unclear whether this was actually conducted or if the minichromosome are simply CEN plasmids and/or if this was the intended goal. Furthermore, lines 102-103 state that the presence of a centromere was necessary and sufficient for minichromosome loss. However, since no constructs lacking a centromere were tested, necessity cannot be concluded. Please clarify this in the text and include experimental details to help readers understand what was tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for having been too short here. The behaviour of the CEN-less version of this plasmid has been characterized in detail in previous studies (Shcheprova et al., 2008; Denoth-Lippuner 2014, Meinema et al 2022). Here we focused on the behaviour of the CEN+ version of an otherwise Identical plasmid. We now clarify in the text that this plasmid is retained in the mother cell when CEN-less and cite the relevant literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iii) It is unclear how cells at 0-3 budding events were identified in assays using the microfluidics platform. Can the authors clarify the known &quot;age&quot; of the cells once captured, i.e. how do the authors know how many divisions a cell has undergone prior to capture?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right; we do not know the exact age of these cells. However, in any asynchronous population of yeast cells, which is what we start from, 50% of the cells are newborn daughters, 25% have budded once, 12.5 have budded twice, 6.25 % have budded three times… Therefore, at the time of loading, 93% of the cells have budded between 0 and 3 times. For this reason, we report to this population as cells age 0-3 CBE. We acknowledge that this is an approximation, but it remains a relatively safe one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) While the schematic in Figure 2D is generally helpful, a different depiction of the old and new SPBs would be beneficial in cases where the new SPB and TetR-GFP are depicted as colocalized, it is difficult to see that the red is fainter for the new SPB.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this issue by completely separating the SPB and the Chromosome signals in the Figure 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(v) In Figure 2F, the grey colour of the 12h Ipl1-321 data bar did not have high enough contrast when the manuscript was printed-would recommend changing this to a darker shade.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this issue by using a darker shade of grey.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(vi) In Figure 3A, 'Budding' is misspelled on X-axis label</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(vii) In Figure 4, the authors should clarify the differences between the analyses in panels B and C.

Additionally, it is unclear why there is so much signal observed in the Merge image for the old wild-type cell, especially regarding the apparent bright spot. Is that nuclear signal? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The pre-mRNA processing reporter is not very efficiently spliced. It was selected as such during design (Sorenson et al 2014; DOI: 10.1261/rna.042663.113) to provide sensitivity. As for the bright spot occurring, translation of the unspliced reporter produces the N-terminal part of a ribosomal protein, a fraction of which forms some sort of nuclear aggregate in a fraction of the population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(x) In Figure 6E, why does the sir2∆ exhibit higher mCherry/GFP than the wild-type and fob1∆ at &quot;young age&quot;? Is this due to disrupted proteostasis in the sir2∆, or a different pleiotropic effect of sir2∆? Please comment on this observation in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, as we have stated in the text the sir2∆ mutation already perturbs pre-mRNA processing in young cells. We do not know the reason of this but indeed it is most probably reflective of its pleiotropic function. Following the reviewer’s request, we now state this in the text. For example, Sir2 may regulate the acetylation state of the basket itself. The genetic interactions observed between sir2∆ and quite a few nucleoporin mutations seem to support this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(xi) Throughout, the authors switch between depicting aging in Completed Budding Events versus hours, which made it difficult to compare data across figures</p></disp-quote><p>Ideally, all the data in this manuscript should be plotted according to the CBE age of the cell. To ensure that the major findings are plotted in such a way, we have done so for over ~3000 combined cells and thousands of replicative divisions in Figures 3,5-7. All the measurements of chromosome loss at a specific CBE had to be done manually, due to the absence of algorithms that would be able to accurately detect chromosome loss and replicative age. Therefore, doing this for the entirety of our dataset, encompassing well over 50 ageing chips and tens of thousands of cells is not easily doable at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(xii) Typo on line 12 (Sindle Pole Body)</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(xiii) The phrase should be 'chromosome partitioning' rather than 'chromosome partition', throughoutfor example, line 17</p></disp-quote><p>Replaced “chromosome partition” with “chromosome partitioning” throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(xiv) There are inconsistencies between plural and singular references throughout sentences-example, lines 35-37, and lines 44-45.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully combed through the manuscript again and hope that we caught all inconsistencies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
