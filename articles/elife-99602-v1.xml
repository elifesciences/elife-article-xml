driven by genes with sex-biased expression, spanning from key regulators to numerous organ-specific effectors. Current understanding is limited regarding the evolutionary dynamics of these genes in somatic tissues that generate the adult phenotype versus gonadal organs that are required for reproduction. Here, we investigate sex-biased gene expression and micro-evolutionary patterns of these genes in populations of subspecies and species of wild mice (genus <italic>Mus</italic>) that were raised under controlled conditions. We find a faster evolutionary turnover of sex-biased gene expression in somatic tissues, but not in the gonads, when compared to the turnover of non-sex-biased genes. We introduce a sex-biased gene expression index (SBI) to quantify individual variances. We find a range from binary to overlapping SBI patterns across individuals. SBI values do not correlate between organs of the same individuals, thus supporting a mosaic model of somatic sex determination. Comparison with data from humans shows mostly fewer sex-biased genes compared to mice and strongly overlapping SBI distributions between the somatic organs of the sexes. We conclude that adult individuals are composed of a mosaic spectrum of sex characteristics in their somatic tissues that should not be cumulated into a simple binary classification.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mus</italic></kwd><kwd>sex-biased gene expression</kwd><kwd>mosaic model of sex characteristics</kwd><kwd>gene expression turnover</kwd><kwd>regulatory modules</kwd><kwd>sex-biased gene expression index</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name><name><surname>Künzel</surname><given-names>Sven</given-names></name><name><surname>Tautz</surname><given-names>Diethard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Such a binary distinction is a hallmark of most sexually reproducing species, and it is therefore often considered a cornerstone of evolutionary conservation. However, Darwin has already pointed out that the phenotypes of the sexes can evolve fast when they are subject to sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darwin, 1871</xref>). The different interests of males and females lead to sexual conflict, characterized by opposing evolutionary constraints on the genes that mediate sex differences. Sexual conflict can have many forms but can be broadly categorized into interlocus and intralocus sexual conflict, with distinct implications for evolutionary biology and species fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schenkel et al., 2018</xref>). Each is also expected to have an effect on the evolution of the underlying genes and their regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ingleby et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mank, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tosto et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The sexual phenotypes of adult individuals are generated by hundreds to thousands of genes with sex-biased expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mank and Rideout, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parsch and Ellegren, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tosto et al., 2023</xref>). The combination of variants of these genes is expected to determine the range of somatic individual phenotypes of males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tosto et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van der Bijl and Mank, 2021</xref>). For example, human height is partially determined by genes with sex-biased expression, resulting in overall smaller females than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>). However, height distributions of males and females are highly overlapping, such that knowledge of the height of a given individual would not be sufficient to classify it as either female or male. In fact, such overlapping distributions are characteristic of somatic sex-related phenotypic characters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maney, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The studies of morphological sex differentiation of the human brain have revealed mosaic patterns where different brain parts of the same individual can show more female or more male characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joel et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, a binary narrative that is based on gametic sex is not applicable at this somatic level and could be replaced by relative degrees of maleness versus femaleness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joel et al., 2020</xref>). Different organs are known to be shaped by different sets of sex-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodríguez-Montes et al., 2023</xref>), making the degrees of somatic sex-specific variation between individuals even larger.</p><p>Sex-biased gene expression is known to evolve fast, supporting the notions of sexual conflict theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tosto et al., 2023</xref>). However, the evolutionary comparisons of sex-biased gene expression have so far focused on comparisons between relatively distant species and relatively few individuals per species only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodríguez-Montes et al., 2023</xref>), making it difficult to gauge the true evolutionary rates. A dedicated study exploring the micro-evolutionary context of sex-biased gene expression in animals is missing so far.</p><p>Here, we use the house mouse radiation to address the evolution of sex-biased genes and their expression. The system is an excellent model to study micro-evolutionary turnover patterns at a shallow evolutionary population level, as well as between subspecies and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). For our study, we use outbred individuals derived from natural populations from two <italic>Mus musculus</italic> subspecies, <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> (DOM) and <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> (MUS), as well as two sister species, <italic>M. spretus</italic> (SPR) and <italic>M. spicilegus</italic> (SPI). To avoid confusion with species status, we designate all four with the neutral term ‘taxon’ and use only the three-letter abbreviations. The taxa cover an evolutionary distance of about 2 million years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Given the short reproduction cycles and the fast molecular evolution in rodents, this time corresponds, in terms of molecular divergence, approximately to the equivalent of the evolutionary split between gibbons and humans. Hence, the system allows for studying the continuum from micro-evolutionary to macro-evolutionary patterns. We use individuals derived from natural populations but kept under common environmental conditions and in an outbreeding regime to retain the natural variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harr et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Relationship of the mouse taxa and numbers of sex-biased genes for each organ comparison.</title><p>The top left of the plot shows the phylogenetic relationships of the taxa in the study.

In contrast, our study is mostly focused on somatic tissues that occur in both sexes, but we complement it with comparisons to gonadal tissues that are specific for each sex. Since the gonadal tissues are composed of different cell types for each sex, a comparison of expression patterns is always a composite between gene expression and cell-type composition. This is different for somatic organs, where one can expect that the cell types are much more similar between the sexes.</p><p>It has recently been shown that the major onset of sex-biased gene expression is at the developmental transition to sexual maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodríguez-Montes et al., 2023</xref>), and we are therefore focusing on sexually mature stages. We use sets of 18 individuals from each taxon, which allows us to compare within-group variation with divergence between groups, a contrast that has been lacking so far in most studies on sex-biased gene expression, except for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khodursky et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We find thousands of sex-biased genes in the somatic organs, but with marked differences in numbers between the organs in the different evolutionary lineages. As it was previously found, most sex-biased genes are organ-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodríguez-Montes et al., 2023</xref>), and we show here that they are expressed in organ-specific modules. Only a small percentage of genes shows conserved sex-biased expression patterns among all lineages, and the variances of expression between individuals are higher than for non-sex-biased genes.</p><p>To represent the individual variation in expression of sex-biased genes, we have developed a sex-biased gene expression index (SBI) that combines the sex-biased gene expression for each individual to reflect its overall femaleness or maleness in each organ. In the somatic organs, we find variable patterns of distinction and overlap between the sexes, while there is a strict binary pattern for the gonadal comparisons. We apply the SBI also to human data from the GTEx resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguet et al., 2020</xref>) and find overall much fewer sex-biased genes when applying the same criteria as for the mouse data, and stronger overlaps between the sexes than in mice. The SBI can also be used to assess mosaicism of sex-biased gene expression between individuals analogous to brain sex-specific brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joel et al., 2015</xref>). We show that individuals are characterized by different degrees of mosaicism in different organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Gene expression data were collected from taxa and organs depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Nine age-matched adult females and males each were chosen as biological replicates among the outbred individuals from each of the four taxa, and the same set of organs was retrieved for each of them for RNA-Seq analysis. We used five somatic organs and three gonadal organ parts for each of the sexes, yielding a total of 576 samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>To identify sex-biased expression, based on normalized transcript fragment count data (transcripts per million [TPM]), we use the ratio of the medians of female (F) and male (M) expression (F/M) with a 1.25-fold ratio cutoff, combined with a Wilcoxon rank sum test and false discovery rate (FDR) correction &lt;0.1. These criteria are more stringent than other studies that have focused on somatic sex-expression differences (see Methods for a discussion of these parameters). Note that the use of a Wilcoxon significance test acts as an additional filter to exclude genes with neutrally fluctuating variances between the sexes. The absolute fold differences between male and female expression are continuously distributed, at least for the organs with many sex-biased genes (see distribution histograms in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3 fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 3 and 4</xref>). On the other hand, absolute fold differences should not necessarily be taken as an indicator of relative importance of the respective sex-biased genes, since absolute dosage differences can have different effects in different parts of the regulatory networks.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> provides a graphical overview of the numbers of sex-biased genes identified in the different organs of the mouse taxa; detailed numbers are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, the corresponding gene lists and expression values are provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17617/3.IMARWT">Supplementary Data D1</ext-link>. The numbers range between 13 and 5645 for the somatic organs and 3444 and 13,383 for the gonadal pairwise comparisons. As discussed above, the gonadal comparisons are inherently very different from the somatic comparisons, since they are based on comparing morphologically different structures (see Methods for the scheme of pairwise comparisons). Still, we include them as reference comparisons here, but the main focus of our study is on the somatic comparisons.</p><p>Variable numbers of sex-biased genes are shared between pairwise organ comparisons within the different taxa, but only very few genes are sex-biased in all organs in a given taxon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref>). These include female-biased genes such as the X-chromosomally encoded gene <italic>Xist</italic>, which codes for an lncRNA required for the dosage compensation of the X-chromosome in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loda and Heard, 2019</xref>), and <italic>Eif2s3x</italic>, which encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). Most other genes that share a sex-bias between all tissues in each taxon are also encoded on the X-chromosome, and most are known to escape the dosage compensation of the X-chromosome in tissue-specific patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berletch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref>). Given that we find different sets of these genes in the different mouse taxa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref>), we can conclude that even these general function genes show some degree of evolutionary turnover in their regulation.</p><p>It has previously been reported that the X-chromosome harbors more female-biased than male-biased genes for the mouse somatic organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reinius et al., 2012</xref>). Our data confirm this general observation (numbers and percentages included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). When averaged across all five somatic tissues, the X-chromosome has a higher percentage of female-biased genes (4.3% female-biased versus 2.3% male-biased), but given that the overall fraction of genes on the X-chromosome is 4.7%, this reflects a relative deficiency of male-biased genes on the X, rather than an excess of female-biased ones. The sex-biased genes of the gonadal organs show the opposite trend (3.7% female-biased versus 4.2% male-biased). However, there are substantial differences between the different organs and taxa in this respect, implying that there is no simple explanation for the evolution of sex-biased genes on the X-chromosome.</p><p>Female-biased genes outnumber male-biased genes in all comparisons, which could hint toward stronger intrasexual selection in females (see Discussion).</p><p>Among the somatic organs, brain has the lowest numbers of genes with sex-biased expression, and kidney has the highest. Most notably, the numbers of sex-biased genes are subject to fast turnover between the taxa for the somatic organs. For example, DOM has an unusually high number of sex-biased genes in the heart, compared to the other taxa. On the other hand, the kidney bias is much stronger in DOM and MUS than in SPR and SPI, and liver has the highest number of female-biased genes in SPI. For the gonadal organs, the overall numbers remain more similar between the taxa.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fast evolutionary turnover of sex-biased gene expression</title><p>The evolutionary turnover of genes that become subject to sex-biased expression in any given taxon is very high, even between the closely related taxa that are studied here. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows which fractions of genes with sex-biased expression are shared between the taxa for each organ in any pairwise comparison. The turnover is particularly high for the somatic tissues. In brain and heart, fewer than 10% of the genes occur in more than one taxon; for the other organs, fewer than half occur in more than one taxon. Note that two of the taxa (DOM and MUS) have a subspecies-level status (<italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> and <italic>M. m. musculus</italic>), yet the majority of somatic sex-biased genes changed their sex-biased expression between them. When compared between all four taxa, only between 0.3% and 5.3% of genes have a conserved sex-biased expression in all four of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Turnover of sex-biased gene expression between the taxa.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plots of percentages of genes shared as sex-biased across the four taxa for each organ comparison (including the Y-chromosomal genes for the male-biased gene sets).

Interestingly, many of the sex-biased genes reverse their state in at least one taxon from female-bias to male-bias or vice versa. This includes 596 genes for somatic organs and 3895 for the gonadal organs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Hence, although the overall numbers of sex-biased genes do not change much between the taxa for the gonadal organs, the actual composition of the gene sets evolves substantially.</p><p>To compare the rates of this turnover of sex-biased gene regulation with non-sex-biased regulatory turnover, we use the same statistical approach for the latter group of genes, but instead of comparing males with females, we use a comparison between the same sex datasets between the taxa. For example, for a turnover comparison between DOM and MUS, we swapped the DOM males with the MUS females in the same statistical algorithm that we use for the sex-bias analysis. We did this also for the SPR-SPI and the MUS-SPR pairs, as well as the reverse sex groups, i.e., a dataset with comparison among females only (‘Female Swaps’) and a dataset with comparisons among males only (‘Male Swaps’). From the resulting genes lists, we resampled 1000 times 1000 genes each and calculated averages and standard deviations. The corresponding data and statistics tables are provided as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17617/3.IMARWT">Supplementary Data D2</ext-link>. The percentages of sex-biased genes that show a regulatory change were then subtracted from the average percentages of the equivalent all-genes comparisons in the same taxa groupings. Hence, when sex-biased gene expression turnover is higher than the all-genes expression turnover, one should find negative values. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Except for the kidney in the DOM-MUS comparison, all somatic organs in all comparisons show negative values, while the gonadal organs in all comparisons mostly show positive values.</p><p>This analysis shows that somatic sex-biased gene expression changes occur much more frequently than for the whole gene set. Only the kidney in the DOM-MUS comparison is very different in this comparison, possibly since they have been subject to other rapid evolutionary processes that are currently unknown. The positive value for kidney in the DOM-MUS comparison is mostly due to a relatively high number of sex-biased genes that are conserved between these two taxa, for as yet unknown reasons. This pattern is different for the two other taxa comparisons, where sex-biased expression evolves also faster.</p><p>The gonadal turnover of sex-biased gene expression, on the other hand, is not faster than the gene expression levels of the non-sex-biased genes in most comparisons. This implies also that the sex-biased status in the gonads has a more conserved function, most likely since it is linked to different cell types in these tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Variance patterns</title><p>The fast turnover of genes with sex-biased expression implies that they are continuously subject to intra- or inter-sexual selection processes. This should also be reflected in the variance patterns within the populations of each taxon, since at least a subset of them would be subject to ongoing selection processes that would create a higher allelic diversity until new equilibria are reached. We have therefore analyzed the variance patterns both at the gene expression level and at the protein divergence level.</p><p>As a measure of variance for the gene expression, we used the interquartile range (IQR) (difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data) divided by the median of the data range (representing the nonparametric version of the coefficient of variation). This measure buffers against outlier values that can frequently be observed in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xie et al., 2025</xref>). For these comparisons, we also used a set of non-sex-biased genes, defined as genes having an F/M ratio of &lt;1.05-fold.</p><p>We find that sex-biased genes show in most cases higher variances than non-biased genes, but to different extents in the two sexes and in the different organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

These show variance levels more comparable to those found among the sex-biased genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), implying that their generally higher variation might help them to become more easily sex-biased, as it has also been suggested for plant sex-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scharmann et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies on protein sequence divergence patterns of sex-biased genes have suggested that the sequences of male-biased genes are particularly fast evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grath and Parsch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>), while the opposite pattern was found for the avian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mank et al., 2007</xref>). Sex-biased genes in sex-dimorphic plant leaves, on the other hand, did not show increased divergence compared to non-sex-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scharmann et al., 2021</xref>). However, all the previous tests on this question were somewhat limited by not taking possibly confounding population demographic factors into account. We have therefore included the population-level information in our data to address this question.</p><p>A frequently used test for testing for protein-level divergence in population data is the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test. It compares the level of polymorphism versus fixation of coding and noncoding sites to infer the frequency of positive selection events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McDonald and Kreitman, 1991</xref>). It calculates an alpha value that is a measure of the proportion of amino acid substitutions that were driven by positive selection rather than genetic drift. However, its results can be influenced by confounding factors, such as the level of segregation of slightly deleterious variants, as well as population demography. We have therefore used here the asymptotic MK test that takes care of these problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haller and Messer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Messer and Petrov, 2013</xref>), but requires the testing across a large number of loci to become reasonably robust. We have therefore combined the whole set of sex-biased genes of the somatic organs for a given taxon in the test. We restrict the comparison to the DOM and MUS samples, since these are closest to the reference sequence to ensure appropriate alignments of the coding regions to correctly assign coding and noncoding sites. The polymorphism data were taken from previous whole-genome sequencing studies of these populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harr et al., 2016</xref>). Classification of fixed versus polymorphic variants was done by comparing to SPR as an outgroup. Statistical estimates are based on 1000 bootstrap replications.</p><p>The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Both female-biased and male-biased genes show higher alpha values compared to non-biased genes. Interestingly, female-biased rates are higher than male-biased rates, corroborating the observation in brain-expressed genes in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mank et al., 2007</xref>). Similar to the expression variance comparisons, we also generated reciprocal gene sets, i.e., sex-biased in either DOM or MUS, but not sex-biased in the respective other taxon. The alpha values for the non-sex-biased reciprocal orthologs are significantly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) than those for the sex-biased genes. This comparison suggests that the evolution to a sex-biased expression state is often accompanied by an enhanced adaptive substitution rate at coding positions of the respective genes.</p><p>To assess whether we can also trace lineage-specific effects with this test, we asked whether the genes that are exclusively sex-biased in either DOM or MUS also show higher alpha values. However, for this test, we needed to combine female- and male-biased genes to have a sufficiently large number of genes to render the test meaningful. We find that the genes that are sex-biased only in DOM have an alpha value of 0.22, while the non-sex-biased orthologs of these genes in MUS (the ‘reciprocal’ gene set) have an alpha value of 0.12. The corresponding numbers for MUS are 0.14 and 0.11 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). This contrasts with alpha values of 0.35 and 0.37 for genes that are sex-biased in both taxa. Hence, we can indeed trace signs of a lineage-specific elevation of adaptive substitutions in genes that become sex-biased, although the effect is stronger when they were sex-biased for a longer evolutionary time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Module analysis of sex-biased genes</title><p>We were interested to assess whether sex-biased genes represent a subset of all genes expressed in a given organ or whether they are derived from particular co-regulated modules.

A subset of the data is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. This subset is restricted to four somatic organs, since brain has too few sex-biased genes overall. Further, we did not include higher-numbered modules with few genes only, unless the differences to the fractions of all genes are more than 3% in the sex-biased genes.</p><p>The results suggest that the module classes for the sex-biased genes tend to be retained between the taxa, despite the turnover of genes. This is further detailed below for each organ.</p><p>For heart, there is an excess of genes in module 1 for DOM, MUS, and SPR. Module 1 includes 3010 genes associated with multiple physiological processes in a GO analysis. DOM includes 1247 of these among the total of 2405 sex-biased genes (=52%). MUS includes 171 out of 337 (=51 %) and SPR 30 out of 76 (=39%). In MUS, 54 out of the 171 sex-biased genes in module 1 are not sex-biased in DOM, and in SPR, there are 6 sex-biased genes in module 1 that are neither present in DOM nor in MUS. Hence, there is a substantial turnover of sex-biased genes within module 1 between the taxa. In SPI, on the other hand, there is mostly a relative loss of sex-biased genes in module 1 (it retains only 6 such genes), but a relative major gain in a new module. This is module 26 with a total of 20 genes, 7 of which occur in SPI as sex-biased genes (4 are transcription factors involved in circadian clock entrainment). The profiles for the taxon-specific sex-biased genes (blue) are very similar to all sex-biased genes (red) in each comparison, implying that both are parts of the same modules in each taxon.</p><p>For kidney, the patterns are more heterogeneous, with little commonality between the taxa. Also, the patterns between all sex-biased genes and that taxon-specific sex-biased genes differ for some of the modules.</p><p>For liver, it is mostly module 2 that is enriched for sex-biased genes. The module has a total of 389 genes, which are enriched for innate immunity regulation GO terms. Here, MUS and SPI have 47% and 52% the largest fractions of sex-biased genes in this module. The patterns of the recruitment of taxon-specific sex-biased genes are somewhat heterogeneous, and module 2 is not specifically notable.</p><p>For mammary, it is module 6 that is most strongly enriched for sex-biased genes. The module has 540 genes, which relate mostly to epithelial cell morphology and tubule formation. MUS and DOM have the largest fractions of sex-biased genes in this class, with 83% and 73%, respectively. Again, the patterns for the taxon-specific sex-biased genes are somewhat heterogeneous; module 6 is not specifically notable. But the changed overall pattern in SPI is evidently driven by genes newly recruited to become sex-biased in a subset of modules in this taxon.</p><p>We conclude from this analysis that sex-biased genes tend to be expressed in a subset of modules and that evolutionary turnover may sometimes occur by recruiting previously not sex-biased genes from the same module to become sex-biased. However, this pattern is clearly heterogeneous between organs and taxa. It applies to some comparisons, but not to all.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A sex-biased gene-expression index (SBI)</title><p>Given that the sex-biased expression of genes is thought to be the basis for the generation of the sex-specific phenotypes, we were interested in assessing the individual variation in the cumulative expression of sex-biased genes for each organ. To do this with a single factor for every individual, we have developed an SBI based on the normalized expression values of the genes.

The MEDIANs are used to reduce the influence of outlier values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xie and Tautz, 2025</xref>).</p><p>When the sexes are well separated, one would expect two different distributions for each sex. The centers of the distribution can move along the X-axis, depending on the relative expression levels on males and females. While this provides a measure of the overall expression levels of sex-biased genes in the organs, this may in itself be of less relevance. For example, in plants, it was shown that the sex-biased morphological variation of the leaves does not correlate with the numbers and expression of sex-biased genes in these leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scharmann et al., 2021</xref>). But independent of considering the numbers and absolute expression levels of the genes, one can look at the variance of expression between the individuals for each organ and how this variance evolves between the taxa. Such a comparison has not been done before in any dataset, and the SBI is uniquely suitable to visualize such comparisons (see also Discussion).</p><p>To focus on the variance aspect of the SBI, we normalize the values to center the distributions around 0. In this display, the females should show a range of positive values representing their individual variation, and the males should show an analogous range of negative values. But the variation ranges could also overlap, which would indicate that the phenotypes generated by the set of sex-biased genes are not completely sex-specific, similar to most somatic phenotypes, such as height measures or brain structures are not completely sex-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joel, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maney, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The normalized distributions of individual sex-bias indices are plotted as density functions across all mouse organs and taxa in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We find indeed overlapping patterns in most comparisons of the somatic organs. However, the organs differ with respect to their overlap patterns, and these differences evolve fast between the taxa. This is particularly evident for kidney and liver. Kidney shows nonoverlapping distributions in DOM and MUS, while in SPR and SPI, the male-biased genes show a very broad distribution that overlaps with the distributions of female-biased genes. Strong sexual dimorphism in mouse kidneys and livers was previously described and is linked to hormonal signaling pathways, especially in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clodfelter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laulhé et al., 2021</xref>). In liver, DOM and MUS are also well separated, while SPR and SPI are overlapping. For mammary, the overlaps are also substantial in all four taxa, although one might have predicted that they could be more distinct. Such a distinctness is evident for all comparisons between gonadal organs, but these also generate very different morphological structures, i.e., an overlap is not expected.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Density plots of individual variation values of the sex-biased gene expression index (SBI) for mouse organs.</title><p>Plots for all organs are grouped according to organ for each taxon.

It has actually been shown that only a subset of cells in a given tissue may express the sex-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodríguez-Montes et al., 2023</xref>). In complex organs with many cell types, such as the brain, it is therefore possible that the sex-bias signal is blurred by different sets of genes expressed in different cell types. Unfortunately, suitable datasets from single-cell studies that include sufficient numbers of individuals where one could approach this question are still rare. We have analyzed here data from a study with patients that have developed Alzheimer’s disease. This study also included non-disease control individuals, and we have used the datasets from these individuals, yielding comparisons between six individuals of each sex for single cells from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) samples and seven individuals of each sex for single cells from middle temporal gyrus (MTG) samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gabitto et al., 2024</xref>). There are 15 different cell types with sufficient coverage for an analysis in the DLPFC data and 13 in MTG data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref>).

Sex-biased expression is still at a low level in these data, similar to what was found for brain tissues in general and too low to generate meaningful SBI distribution plots.

id="s2-8"><title>Conserved genes with sex-biased expression</title><p>While most studies on sex-biased genes have reported that only a subset of them is conserved across larger evolutionary distances, they still report sometimes substantial numbers of genes with conserved sex-biased expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khodursky et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodríguez-Montes et al., 2023</xref>, found much fewer conserved sex-biased genes between mammalian taxa but a conservation of cell types with sex-biased expression in each tissue. Given the high turnover of genes that we observe already within mouse lineages that are only at most 2 million years apart, it seems well possible that the seeming conservation of genes with sex-biased expression between lineages with larger evolutionary distances is due to convergence, i.e., independent recruitment of genes into sex-biased expression in different lineages. This has also been suggested in a phylogenetic study on sex-biased genes in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scharmann et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We have therefore sought to generate a set of genes with conserved sex-biased expression using stringent criteria. First, we retrieved all genes that show a consistent sex-biased expression in all four mouse taxa. We then focused on those genes that occur in at least two of the analyzed tissues. This filters for genes that can be expected to have a more general function in regulating sex-biased expression. Based on this set, we asked which orthologs of the genes also show sex-biased expression in any of the human tissues. Interestingly, only very few genes are left when applying these filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). There are eight orthologous genes that are female-biased in two or more tissues and three that are male-biased. Note, however, that the latter are all genes that are encoded on the Y-chromosome. The only two genes with consistent sex-biased expression across all organs and species are the female-biased gene <italic>Xist</italic> and the male-biased gene <italic>Ddx3y</italic>.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Genes with conserved sex-biased gene expression between mice and humans.</title><p>The different organs analyzed are listed to the left.

Hence, the balancing of the interplay between these epigenetic regulators may well contribute to the fast evolution of sex-biased gene expression in their target genes. However, while all four are broadly expressed in adult tissues, they are themselves subject to differential sex-biased expression in a subset of the tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), implying that they also depend on sex-bias controlling expression networks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study is the first micro-evolutionary study on the evolution of sex-biased gene expression in outbred animals that includes sufficient data to allow within-population comparisons in parallel to phylogenetic comparisons between closely related taxa. Further, its focus is on somatic sex-biased expression of genes, which is of special relevance for understanding the variances of sex-related phenotypes of adult individuals in populations. The data show that somatic sex-biased gene expression evolves very fast, even between the closely related taxa studied here. Moreover, many genes reverse their role by switching between their sex-bias to the other sex. Similar results were found for the evolution of sex-biased genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khodursky et al., 2020</xref>) and in sex-biased genes expressed in sexually dimorphic leaves of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scharmann et al., 2021</xref>). Variances of sex-biased gene expression between individuals are often overlapping between the sexes, which can be shown by plotting SBI values.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neutral or adaptive?</title><p>Patterns of fast evolution of molecular characters such as gene expression or substitution rates always raise the question of which fraction could be due to neutral divergence versus adaptive processes, i.e., positive selection for new variants. This question has previously been studied in the same system of mouse populations and taxa that are used here. These studies showed that the overall patterns of gene expression changes between these populations are mostly compatible with neutral divergence models, based on tests of intra-group variability with between-group divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Staubach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Voolstra et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>However, in contrast to the gene expression differences between the taxa, the sex-biased gene expression differences are a priori not caused by neutral fluctuations, as tested by the Wilcoxon significance test. This test compares the distribution of variances between the individuals of each sex for each gene to assess whether they could be part of one variance distribution or two significantly different variance distributions. The former would imply neutral processes in variance generation, while the latter must be considered to reflect selective forces to maintain their separate variance distributions.</p><p>For the somatic organs, the turnover of sex-biased gene expression is faster than the corresponding non-sex-biased gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). If one assumes that most non-sex-biased gene expression evolves neutrally, this also suggests that sex-biased gene expression turnover is driven by adaptive selection processes.</p><p>Further, under a neutral divergence scenario, one would expect that different organs and different taxa show similar overall numbers of sex-biased genes and that these should be randomly recruited from the different gene expression modules. Both of these patterns are clearly not the case (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). For example, with a neutral mechanism, it may be difficult to explain why DOM has such a large number of sex-biased genes in the heart, most of which belong to only one module of gene expression. Similarly, the other module-based patterns in other organs may not be readily explained by such a mechanism.</p><p>The alternative for explaining the module patterns would be that transcription factors that regulate these modules become sex-biased through neutral mechanisms, with the consequence that they drag with them a number of genes from within the respective modules to make them sex-biased. Such an influence of sex-biased transcription factors on their target genes was suggested by the analyses in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>. However, this would not explain why we see a faster adaptive protein evolution among the sex-biased genes. If their sex-bias status is passively driven by neutrally evolving transcription factors, one would not expect a differential selection pressure acting on their protein sequences.</p><p>In the combination of these considerations, we favor an interpretation where positive selection may drive sex-biased gene expression, probably including transacting regulatory genes to explain the module patterns. It is generally known from selective sweep studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ihle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Staubach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Teschke et al., 2008</xref>) and amino acid substitution comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halligan et al., 2010</xref>) that the mouse populations are subject to massive positive selection. The high propensity for positive selection in mice is likely due to their short generation times and large effective population sizes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of sexual selection</title><p>The sexual selection theory assumes that males and females have different interests in their reproductive strategies, which results in a continuous evolutionary conflict due to divergent trait optima expressed in adults of either sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darwin, 1871</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamilton, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mank, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parsch and Ellegren, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Price et al., 2023</xref>). The resulting sexual dimorphisms can occur at many levels, not only as prominent major phenotypic differences, but also as very many cryptic differences, as has, e.g., been shown in a systematic survey of the phenotypes of mouse knockout strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van der Bijl and Mank, 2021</xref>). Many of these cryptic differences are expected to be caused by the sex-biased expression of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grath and Parsch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mank, 2017b</xref>). Hence, there is much room for the adaptive evolution of sex-biased gene expression due to the existence of continuous sexual conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox and Calsbeek, 2009</xref>) or sex-specific selection, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oliver and Monteiro, 2011</xref>.</p><p>Sexual selection processes include intrasexual selection (competition within a sex, e.g. male-male competition) and intersexual selection (mate choice, e.g. female preference for specific male traits). There could also be sexually antagonistic selection, where a trait benefits one sex but harms the other. Either of these processes can be linked to sex-biased gene expression patterns. While our data do not allow us to distinguish between these different processes, we note that in mice the number of female-biased genes is consistently larger than male-biased genes, both across organs and across taxa. This could argue for stronger intrasexual selection processes in females, which would be in contrast to the often-assumed stronger effects in males. Mice show only little overt sexual dimorphism, although males are on average larger, in line with a stronger physical male-male competition for access to mates. However, mice are cooperative breeders, and for such breeding systems, it was suggested that there could also be intense intrasexual competition among females, e.g., for resources or higher social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rosvall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rubenstein and Lovette, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tobias et al., 2012</xref>). Although it remains open whether the relative number of sex-biased genes is an appropriate measure for the strength of intrasexual selection, the observed larger numbers in females could suggest that strong intrasexual selection may also occur among females.</p><p>Many previous studies on sex-specific expression have focused on differences between gonads. But gonads are composed of very different cell types and tissues in males versus females. Hence, many of the sex-biased genes in gonads may simply be sex-biased because of the different cell types that generate these different tissues. Our data allow a direct comparison of evolutionary patterns in gonads versus somatic tissues, since they were taken from the same individuals. We find that the patterns are indeed different. Gonadal sex-biased genes are more conserved between the taxa, and the turnover of sex-biased gene expression is not faster than that of non-biased genes in these tissues.</p><p>Yet, gonads also produce the hormones that are required for the sex-specific differentiation of the tissues, including the gonads themselves. Hence, in populations where individuals assume intermediate reproductive tactics between males and females, it was also possible to correlate this intermediacy with corresponding patterns of sex-biased gene expression in the gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dean et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pointer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Todd et al., 2018</xref>). In a study in fish that show individuals with female mimicry, it was also possible to find differences in brain expression patterns and modules according to reproductive tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardoso et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, there is an interplay between gonadal and sex-biased gene expression patterns, but gonadal molecular evolutionary patterns cannot be directly compared to somatic patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Intragroup variation and the SBI</title><p>Our results show that somatic sex-biased genes do not only evolve fast between lineages, but they also represent the fraction of genes that are more variable within lineages. This implies that they contribute more to individual variation than non-sex-biased genes. Interestingly, in humans, environmentally responsive genes also show higher variances than genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wolf et al., 2023</xref>), and a subset of genes shows differential variability depending on which sex expresses them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khodursky et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The SBI constitutes a cumulative index to compare the variances in sex-biased gene expression in individuals. It has some intrinsic features that make it particularly suitable to reflect the individual variances. In contrast to measures that would focus on either male-biased or female-biased genes, it puts both into relation to each other by subtracting the respective median expressions of male sex-biased genes from those of female sex-biased genes. The use of the medians, rather than the averages, reduces the impact of genes with extremely high sex-bias because of specific molecular functions, e.g., the gene <italic>Xist</italic> that is required in every cell for the dosage compensation of the X-chromosomes in females. However, note that even this gene shows a rather variable expression between females (values included in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17617/3.IMARWT">Supplementary Data D1</ext-link>).</p><p>The distribution of overall transcriptional variances between individuals is usually done by principal component analyses (PCAs). This statistical approach tries inherently to find the components that distinguish two groups of samples. It calculates principal components (PCs) as eigenvectors of a covariance matrix, assuming linear combinations of the variables. The first principal component (PC1) captures the highest variance with the subsequent PCs reflecting additional variance components in descending order. When we apply a PCA to our data, we find that usually around 50–60% of the variance is reflected in PC1, which separates the sexes. However, all further PCs do not separate the sexes, implying that 40–50% of the variances are overlapping. Hence, the PCA supports a spectrum of overlapping variances between the sexes, but displays these in separate axes that need to be plotted separately. Further, by using linear correlation, it does not correct for outlier expression values. Hence, we consider the SBI as more suitable for visualizing variance distributions between the sexes since it captures them as a distribution of single values per individual, with correction for overexpression.</p><p>The use of the SBI as a single value also follows the general concepts of ‘genomic prediction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meuwissen et al., 2001</xref>) which are based on summarizing values, reflecting the polygenic mechanism of the generation of the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tautz et al., 2023</xref>). Such a cumulative index across the effects of all expressed genes in a tissue is now also being developed for understanding human genetic diseases, summarized as a polygenic risk score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crouch and Bodmer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson, 2019</xref>). The SBI represents a similar approach, but specifically for studying sex-specific differences.</p><p>The use of a subtraction rather than a ratio between each of the sex-biased medians has the advantage of implicitly retaining the information on the relative expression levels, as well as allowing a simple comparison on a linear scale. Linear scales are also usually used to compare distributions of morphological measures, especially in the context of visualizing overlapping sex-specific patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maney, 2016</xref>). Normalized SBI values can also be used in a heatmap visualization to represent a mosaic pattern of sex-biased differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joel et al., 2015</xref>), as we have done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>The SBI distribution comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> show for many tissues overlapping distributions, especially in humans. This implies that any individual that falls within the overlapping distributions would not be readily classifiable as belonging to either sex based on this information alone. The gonadal distributions are always very distinct and nonoverlapping, but this can be explained by the different tissue and cell types, as discussed above. Interestingly, however, we also find a distinct distribution of SBI variances for kidney and liver in DOM and MUS mouse populations. This shows that even somatic organs that do not differ in their cell types can show very distinct SBI variances. Interestingly, the two other taxa, SPR and SPI, show overlapping distributions for these organs, implying that the very distinct patterns in DOM and MUS are based on adaptive differences between the sexes. Note that it is known that the gene expression differences in these organs are directly regulated by hormone action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clodfelter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laulhé et al., 2021</xref>), but this does not explain why the strong differences exist in the first place, especially when a similarly strong differentiation is not seen in the other mouse taxa or humans.</p><p>There is a general tissue specificity of sex-biased gene expression in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oliva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodríguez-Montes et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yang et al., 2006</xref>), and we find a lack of correlation of SBIs between organs of the same individual. This implies that individual males or females are actually composites with respect to displaying more female or more male characters throughout their body and brain. Hence, while hormones are undoubtedly the drivers of dimorphic sex differentiation, they act via different sets of transcription factors in the different organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Williams and Carroll, 2009</xref>). This allows for generating independent variances with respect to sex-biased gene expression in different cell types and different organs, which are reflected in the SBI distributions.</p><p>The generally broader overlaps in somatic SBI distribution in humans compared to mice can be ascribed to two factors. First, there are fewer sex-biased genes in humans, possibly because the relatively lower population size in humans cannot maintain so many adaptive differences as in mice (see above). Second, the human samples are much more heterogeneous with respect to age and environmental exposure, compared to the mice that were collected at very similar ages and grew up under controlled environmental conditions. However, this implies that humans reflect the more natural conditions, while the mouse data represent a somewhat more artificial accentuation of the genetic differences. Evidently, both for the action of adaptive processes and for our own thinking about sex differences, the natural conditions are more relevant - and they seem to favor larger overlapping variances.</p><p>Our results show that most of the transcriptional underpinnings of somatic sex differences show little long-term evolutionary stability. This fast evolution is accompanied by high individual variability of sex-biased gene expression with overlapping distributions and different sex-biases in different organs. This parallels the general observation that sex-dimorphic character distributions, e.g., body height, are overlapping between the sexes. Adult individuals are therefore composed, in many somatic tissues, of a spectrum of sex characteristics that are not always captured by a simple binary classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ainsworth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maney, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sharpe et al., 2023</xref>). This is also relevant for the consideration of sex-specific medical treatments. While average differences in disease etiology between sexes are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2020</xref>), the decision on where a given individual falls into the spectrum of maleness/femaleness differences becomes more difficult, the more the variances overlap. The fast evolution of sex-biased expression is also a warning sign that mouse models may not be suitable for developing gender-specific medicinal treatments for humans, especially in view of the fact that humans have a much less sex-biased transcriptome than mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study reports the largest systematic dataset so far on the micro-evolutionary patterns of sex-biased gene expression in outbred animals. It is also the first that explores the patterns of individual variation in sex-biased gene expression, and the SBI is a new procedure to directly visualize these variance patterns in an intuitive way. Previous papers on the evolution of sex-biased gene expression in animals have mostly concentrated on gonadal organs and have suggested that the turnover of sex-biased expression is fast. Interestingly, at least at the micro-evolutionary level that we study here, the turnover of gonadal sex-biased expression of the genes is not faster than the corresponding non-sex-biased expression in the same organs. This is different for the somatic patterns, most of which evolve much faster for the sex-biased genes than for the corresponding non-sex-biased genes. This suggests that the effects of sexual selection are stronger in the somatic tissues than in the gonadal tissues. Since many genes are involved in this, this implies that evolutionary changes driven by sexual selection on somatic characters are continuously acting, even in taxa that show no strong overt sexual dimorphism. Our data also show that the turnover of many genes involved in sex-biased expression occurs within regulatory modules. We find that the very few genes that have a conserved sex-biased expression between mice and humans in more than one organ are general epigenetic regulator genes. It will therefore be interesting in the future to focus on their roles in generating the differences between the somatic sexual phenotypes in given species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Somatic and gonadal organs</td><td align="left" valign="top">MPI for Evolutionary Biology, Plön</td><td align="left" valign="top">FRA</td><td align="left" valign="top">Freshly dissected from animals</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Somatic and gonadal organs</td><td align="left" valign="top">MPI for Evolutionary Biology, Plön</td><td align="left" valign="top">KAZ</td><td align="left" valign="top">Freshly dissected from animals</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Mus spretus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Somatic and gonadal organs</td><td align="left" valign="top">MPI for Evolutionary Biology, Plön</td><td align="left" valign="top">SPR</td><td align="left" valign="top">Freshly dissected from animals</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Mus spicilegus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Somatic and gonadal organs</td><td align="left" valign="top">MPI for Evolutionary Biology, Plön</td><td align="left" valign="top">SPI</td><td align="left" valign="top">Freshly dissected from animals</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">RNeasy 96 Universal Tissue Kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">QIAGEN</td><td align="left" valign="top">Catalog no. 74881</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">TruSeq Stranded mRNA Kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Illumina</td><td align="left" valign="top">2×150 bp</td><td align="left" valign="top">Used in sequencing center Kiel</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software/algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">asymptoticMK (downloaded on 2023-2-20)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haller and Messer, 2017</xref>;

Most of these methods apply some form of parametric statistics, such as a negative binomial distribution, which is necessary when only few samples are available per group. However, this is problematic in two ways. First, transcriptome data are well known for showing outliers, and second, the variances of expression can be different among different genes with similar expression level, and between males and females. Thus, these parametric methods usually lead to exaggerated false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2022</xref>). We used here at least nine individuals per sex, which allows us to perform nonparametric statistics, combined with setting cutoff criteria with an FDR correction. For each organ and each taxon, we normalized the fragment counts to TPM values and added one to all TPM values (‘TPM +1’) to avoid dealing with zeros in ratio calculations. Only genes with a median of ‘TPM+1’ in at least one sex &gt;2 were kept for analysis. The sex-bias ratio for each gene is calculated as ‘MEDIAN of females/MEDIAN of males’. We have explored a range of cutoffs and found that a sex-bias ratio of 1.25-fold difference of MEDIAN expression values combined with a Wilcoxon rank sum test and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction (using FDR&lt;0.1 as cutoff) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) yields the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity. This was assessed by comparing sex-randomized datasets with the actual data. In these pre-tests, we found that the inclusion of the Wilcoxon test with FDR correction was most effective in increasing the contrast between randomized scores and actual scores to at least 20-fold difference. For controls with non-biased genes, we chose a cutoff of a &lt;1.05-fold ratio without Wilcoxon test.</p><p>For the somatic organs, we used the comparison between nine females and males each to identify genes with sex-biased expression. For the gonadal organs, we chose ovary versus testis (OvaTes), oviduct versus epididymis (OviEpi), and uterus versus vas deferens (UteVas) for the pairwise comparisons. Except for ovary versus testis, the other two pairs are not really considered to be homologous, but they serve very roughly comparable general functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>SBI calculation</title><p>The calculation of the SBI is based on the following principles:</p><list list-type="order" id="list1"><list-item><p>Create a single value for each individual that summarizes its relative sex-bias.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Summarize across all genes except the ones on the Y-chromosome, since these cannot be expressed in females.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use a statistic that reduces the influence of outlier expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xie et al., 2025</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>This is achieved by using the following overall formula:<disp-formula id="equ2"><alternatives><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>SBI</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>(MEDIAN of all female-biased TPM)</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>(MEDIAN of all male-biased TPM)</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="t2">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle \text{SBI} = \text{(MEDIAN of all female-biased TPM)} {-} \text{(MEDIAN of all male-biased TPM)}$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula></p><p>Since the SBI is meant to visualize only the variances between the individuals, we normalize the values to center the distributions around 0, applying the following transformation: normalized value = ((2 × ([original value] – [smallest value in data range]))/([largest value in the data range] – [smallest value in the data range])) – 1.</p><p>The individual normalized SBI values can be plotted as density plots that reflect the spectrum of variances.

Note that in contrast to the mouse data, the different organ data come from different sets of individuals.</p><p>The human single-nucleus RNA-Seq data were retrieved from the SEA-AD project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gabitto et al., 2024</xref>). ‘h5ad’ format files, including the normalized read counts using a log transformation of pseudocounts per 10,000 reads, ln(CPTT+1), were downloaded from CZ CELLxGENE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulla et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Megill et al., 2021</xref>). Cells in two brain regions were included: MTG and DLPFC. Considering that it is a study of Alzheimer’s disease, we specifically chose ‘control’ samples from individuals without dementia, and with race as ‘white’ for analysis. We only used the data sequenced by the ‘10x3’ v3’ assay. These criteria lead to seven females and seven males for MTG and six of them each for DLPFC. Only cell types (‘subclass’) having at least 100 cells for each of all individuals were kept. The full list of cell types and individuals included is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref>. The expression level of a gene in a cell type of a brain region from an individual was calculated as the mean of the pseudocounts per 10,000 reads of all the cells belonging to the cell type, mean(CPTT+1).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Maintenance and handling of the animals were conducted in accordance with German Animal Welfare Act and FELASA guidelines.

The study introduces a new metric, the Sex-Bias Index (SBI), to quantify individual-level variation in sex-biased gene expression, and explores the evolutionary turnover, variance, and adaptive evolution of these genes.</p><p>These strengths of the paper are not in dispute:</p><p>Novelty: The study is among the first to systematically analyze sex-biased gene expression at a micro-evolutionary scale in outbred animals, using closely related mouse taxa. This contrasts with most previous work, which focused on macro-evolutionary comparisons between distant species.</p><p>Controlled Sampling: The use of age-matched, outbred individuals raised under standardized conditions minimizes environmental confounders, allowing for robust within- and between-taxon comparisons.</p><p>Somatic vs. Gonadal Focus: Unlike many earlier studies that emphasized gonadal tissues, this work provides a detailed analysis of somatic organs, revealing rapid evolutionary turnover and mosaicism in sex-biased gene expression.</p><p>Sex-Bias Index (SBI): The SBI offers a cumulative, individual-level measure of sex-biased gene expression, facilitating visualization of variance and overlap between sexes within tissues. While one can argue about whether a new metric is necessary (as the authors argue), the combination of fold-change cutoffs, non-parametric Wilcoxon tests, and FDR correction reduces false positives, addressing concerns raised in the field about inflated detection of sex-biased genes.</p><p>Evolutionary implications: The study demonstrates that sex-biased gene expression in somatic tissues evolves more rapidly than in gonads, and that this turnover is often accompanied by signatures of adaptive protein evolution. The lack of correlation in SBI across tissues within individuals supports a mosaic model of sex-biased gene expression, challenging binary models of sexual differentiation.</p><p>The weaknesses are already listed by previous rounds of review but I will add one more: in an attempt to be comprehensive, the writing is quite dry and the main conclusions sort of get hidden within the less important observations.</p><p>Since the debate is mostly about what words to use to describe the importance and the strength of evidence, I thought it would be useful to directly compare this study to other studies that address the same topic:</p><p>Naqvi et al. Science 2019 (David Page lab): Conservation, acquisition, and functional impact of sex-biased gene expression in mammals</p><p>Oliva et al. Science 2020 (Stranger lab): The impact of sex on gene expression across human tissues</p><p>Rodríguez-Montes et al. Science 2023 (Kaessman, Cardoso-Moreira labs)</p><p>Let's start with the fact that all three peer studies have had a major impact. Second, although Naqvi et al. (2019) and Oliva et al. (2020) provided foundational cross-species and cross-tissue analyses of sex-biased gene expression, but did not address micro-evolutionary turnover or individual-level variance. Third, Rodríguez-Montes et al. (2023) focused on developmental and evolutionary patterns of sex-biased expression, but at a broader phylogenetic scale and without the individual-level or module-based analyses presented here. None of the peer studies addressed the possibility of mosaicism within individuals, none of them addressed the relations between expression bias and adaptive evolution. So the comparison is really a bit of an apples to oranges comparison: the peer studies are about patterns in deep phylogeny, whereas the present study is an amazing (to me) analysis of inter-individual mosaicism, which is at the heart of this kind of variation, which would totally be missed or worse misinterpreted in deep phylogenetic analyses. Having said that, in my subjective opinion, all three related papers are better written than the present one, but to me there is no question this belongs in the same pedestal as all of them.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99602.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #5 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Xie et al. present a data set of impressive size to study changes in sex-biased gene expression. A clear strength that sets the study apart from previous work is the use of age-matched outbred individuals raised in the same environment, which minimizes non-genetic variance, and the comparison of closely related taxa. Also in contrast to many previous studies, while gonads, which have often been the focus of sex-biased gene expression studies, are not ignored, multiple gonadal tissues are being compared to an array of somatic tissues. The study design therefore can offer a particularly rich and nuanced view of how sex differences change across tissues and over short evolutionary times.</p><p>I liked the idea of summarizing over the mean expression of gene sets, instead of just using numbers of DEGs for comparisons, even though the introduction of the term &quot;Sex-Biased Index (SBI)&quot; seems somewhat of an overkill. The summary analyses are definitely useful to visualize variability in sex-biased gene expression programs. The authors find that the expression patterns of sex-biased genes change faster than those of non-sex-biased genes - but only in somatic tissues. They also provide some evidence that this correlates with higher rates of potentially adaptive coding sequence changes in the taxa where expression is sex-biased, with the proviso that a stronger modeling framework would have made these inferences more robust.</p><p>I was most surprised by the finding that the fast change in expression patterns is linked to different gene expression modules becoming sex-biased in the different taxa studied. This is in my eyes a remarkable observation that could not have been predicted from previous knowledge.</p><p>The use of human GTEx and patient scRNA-seq data is a nice addition, although there are known confounding issues with these resources, given that these are not random samples and environmental conditions are uncontrolled. Nevertheless, as the human data echo the trends seen with the much more rigorous mouse data set, I do not have principal objections to this addition. Furthermore, the human data do allow the authors to conclude that only very few genes with sex-biased expression are shared in the soma of mice and humans.</p><p>In summary, I believe that this contribution has the potential to fundamentally change how we see sex-biased gene expression differences in vertebrates, given that the author's conclusions are grounded in a data set of compelling quality and size.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99602.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Künzel</surname><given-names>Sven</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Plön</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tautz</surname><given-names>Diethard</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Plön</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Xie and colleagues presents transcriptomic experiments that measure gene expression in eight different tissues taken from adult female and male mice from four species. These data are used to make inferences regarding the evolution of sex-biased gene expression across these taxa.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The experimental methods and data analysis appear appropriate. The authors promote their study as unprecedented in its size and technical precision.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not understand the statement &quot;the authors promote&quot; as if there was a doubt about this. If there is a doubt, we welcome to see it specified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript does not present a clear set of novel evolutionary conclusions. The major findings recapitulate many previous comparative transcriptomics studies - gene expression variation is prevalent between individuals, sexes, and species; and genes with sex-biased expression evolve more rapidly than genes with unbiased expression - but it is not clear how the study extends our understanding of gene expression or its evolution.</p></disp-quote><p>There have been no &quot;previous comparative transcriptomics studies&quot; at a micro- evolutionary scale in animals, hence, we do not &quot;replicate&quot; these. And our contrast between somatic and gonadal patterns reveals insights that have not been recognized before, namely that gonadal sex-specific expression turnover is actually not faster that the corresponding non-sex-specific truover. We have now further clarified this distinction throughout the text and have also adapted the title of the paper accordingly.</p><p>We agree with the overall statement that &quot;gene expression variation is prevalent between individuals, sexes, and species&quot; but the aspect of &quot;sex-biased gene expression between individuals&quot; has not been systematically analysed before in such a context.</p><p>Concerning the statement that &quot;genes with sex-biased expression evolve more rapidly than genes with unbiased expression&quot;, we note that this is mostly derived from gonadal data and that there is no study that has quantified this so far at a population level and between subspecies in comparison to somatic data.</p><p>Our results show further that previous assumptions of a substantial set of genes with sex- biased expression conserved between mice and humans are due to underestimating the convergence issues when there is an extremly fast turnover of sex-biased gene expression. This has a major implication for using mice as a model for gender-speficic medicine questions in humans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many gene expression differences between individual animals are selectively neutral, because these differences in mRNA concentration are buffered at the level of translation, or differences in protein abundance have no effect on cellular or organismal function. The hypothesis that sex-biased genes are enriched for selectively neutral expression differences is supported by the excess of inter-individual expression variance and inter-specific expression differences in sex-biased genes.</p></disp-quote><p>This statement repeats a statement from the first round of reviews. We had added new data and extensive discussion on this topic. We do not understand why this has not been taken into account. In fact, a major strength of our paper is that it shows that most sex- biased gene expression differences are not neutral!</p><p>There are two major issues here: to identify sex-biased gene expression in the first place, we (and all other papers in the field) use the neutral model as null-hypothesis. Genes that are not compatible with this null-hypothesis are considered sex-biased. In contrast to most previous papers, we have the possibility to take into account the variances between individuals to add an additional significance test. Hence, we can apply a much more rigorous two-step process: first a ratio-cutoff plus a Wilcoxon rank sum test with correction for multiple testing to identify significant deviations from the null-hypothesis. We have added some additional statements in the Results and Discussion sections to emphasize this.Second, by focusing on the genes that are not following a neutral model, the variance and divergences data support the action of selection, rather than neutral drift.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A higher rate of adaptive coding evolution is inferred among sex-biased genes as a group, but it is not clear whether this signal is driven by many sex-biased genes experiencing a little positive selection, or a few sex-biased genes experiencing a lot of positive selection, so the relationship between expression and protein-coding evolution remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, there are two major issues here. First, the distribution of alpha-values shown in Figure 3B are rather homogeneous, i.e. there is not support for a scenario that the average is driven by only a few genes.</p><p>Second, it seems that the referee wants to see an analysis where dn/ds ratios are broken down for every single gene. This has been done in previous papers, but it is now understood that this procedure is fraught with error because of the demographic contingencies inherent to natural populations that can yield wrong results for individual loci. We have added some statements to the text to clarify this further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is likely that only a subset of the gene expression differences detected here will have phenotypic effects relevant for fitness or medicine, but without some idea of how many or which genes comprise this subset, it is difficult to interpret the results in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>It is the basic underlying assumption for the whole research field that significantly sex- biased genes are phenotypically relevant for fitness, since they would otherwise not be sex- biased in the first place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout the paper the concepts of sexual selection and sexually antagonistic selection are conflated; while both modes of selection can drive the evolution of sexually dimorphic gene expression, the conditions promoting and consequence of both kinds of selection are different, and the manuscript is not clear about the significance of the results for either mode of selection.</p></disp-quote><p>We had explained in our previous response that our data collection was not designed to distinguish between these two processes. But given that the issue is being brought up again, we have now added some discussion on this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript's conclusion that &quot;most of the genetic underpinnings of sex-differences show no long-term evolutionary stability&quot; is not supported by the data, which measured gene expression phenotypes but did not investigate the underlying genetic variation causing these differences between individuals, sexes, or species.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that - under a strict definition - our use of the term &quot;genetic underpinning&quot; in this conclusion sentence can be criticized. The most correct term would be &quot;transcriptional underpinnings&quot;, but of course, given that it is the current practice of the whole field to assume that &quot;transcriptional&quot; is part of the overall genetics, we do not consider our initial statement as incorrect. Still, we have changed the term accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, most of the gene expression differences are observed between sex-specific organs such as testes and ovaries, which are downstream of the sex-determination pathway that is conserved in these four mouse species, so these conclusions are limited to gene expression phenotypes in somatic organs shared by the sexes.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes - correct. But the whole focus of the paper is on somatic expression, i.e. organs that share the same cell compositions. Of course, the comparison between gonadal organs is conflated by being composed of different cell types. We have extended the discussion of this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The differences between sex-biased expression in mice and humans are attributed to differences in the two species effective population sizes; but the human samples have significantly more environmental variation than the mouse samples taken from age-matched animals reared in controlled conditions, which could also explain the observed pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>These are indeed the two alternative explanations that we had discussed (last paragraph of the discussion section, now the penultimate paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The smoothed density plots in Figure 5 are confusing and misleading. Examining the individual SBI values in Table S9 reveals that all of the female and male SBI values for each species and organ are non-overlapping, with the exception of the heart in domesticus and mammary gland in musculus, where one male and one female individual fall within the range of the other sex. The smoothed plots therefore exaggerate the overlap between the sexes;</p></disp-quote><p>Smoothing across discrete values is an entirely standard procedure for continuous variables. It allows to visualize the inherent data trends that cannot easily be glanced from simple inspection of the actual values. This is a mathematical procedure, not an &quot;exaggeration&quot;. We used the same smoothening procedure for all the comparisons, and it is clear that the distributions between females and males of the sex organs and a few somatic organs are well separated (non-overlapping), which serves as a control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>in particular, the extreme variation shown in the SBI in the mammary glands in spretus females and spicilegus males is hard to understand given the normalized values in Table S3. The R code used to generate the smoothed plots is not included in the Github repository, so it is not possible to independently recreate those plots from the underlying data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that there was indeed an error in the Figure - the columns for SPR and SPI were accidentally interchanged. We have corrected this figure. Generally, the smoothened patterns we show are easily verified by looking up the respective primary values. We apologize that the code lines for the plots were accidentally omitted. We have used a standard function from ggplot2: geom_density, with &quot;adjust=3, alpha=0.5&quot; for all plots and included this description in the Methods. We have now added this to the R code in the GitHub repository.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The correlations provided in Table S9 are confusing - most of the reported correlations are 1.0, which are not recovered when using the SBI values in Table S9, and which does not support the manuscript's assertion that sex-biased gene expression can vary between organs within an individual. Indeed, using the SBI values in Table S9, many correlations across organs are negative, which is expected given the description of the result in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a misunderstanding here. The tables do not report correlations, but only p-values for correlations, the raw ones and the ones after corrections for multiple testing. P = 1.0 means no significant correlation. We have adjusted the caption of this table to clarify this further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript reports interesting data on sex differences in expression across several somatic and reproductive tissues among 4 mice species or subspecies. The focus is on sex- biased expression in the somatic tissues, where the authors report high rates of turnover such that the majority of sex-biased genes are only sex-biased in one or two taxa. The authors show sex-biased genes have higher expression variance than unbiased genes but also provide some evidence that sex-bias is likely to evolve from genes with higher expression variance. The authors find that sex-biased genes (both female- and male-biased) experience more adaptive evolution (i.e., higher alpha values) than unbiased genes. The authors develop a summary statistic (Sex-Bias Index, SBI) of each individual's degree of sex- bias for a given tissue. They show that the distribution of SBI values often overlap considerably for somatic (but not reproductive) tissues and that SBI values are not correlated across tissues, which they interpret as indicating an individual can be relatively &quot;male-like&quot; in one tissue and relatively &quot;female-like&quot; in another tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good summary of the data, but we are puzzled that it does not include the completely new module analysis and the finding of extremely fast evolution of sex-biased somatic gene expression compared to the gonadal one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Though the data are interesting, there are some disappointing aspects to how the authors have chosen to present the work. For example, their criteria for sex-bias requires an expression ratio of one sex to the other of 1.25. A reasonably large fraction of the &quot;sex- biased genes&quot; have ratios just beyond this cut-off (Fig. S1). A gene which has a ratio of 1.27 in taxa 1 can be declared as &quot;sex-biased&quot; but which has a ratio of 1.23 in taxa 2 will not be declared as &quot;sex-biased&quot;. It is impossible to know from how the data are presented in the main text the extent to which the supposed very high turnover represents substantial changes in dimorphic expression. A simple plot of the expression sex ratio of taxa 1 vs taxa 2 would be illuminating but the authors declined this suggestion.</p></disp-quote><p>Choosing a cutoff is the standard practice when dealing with continuously distributed data. As we have pointed out, we looked at various cutoff options and decided to use the present one, based on the observed data distributions. Note that some studies have used even lower ones (e.g. 1.1). To visualize the data distribution, we had provided the overall distribution of ratios, because one would have to look at many more plots otherwise. But we have now also added individual plots as Figure 1, Figure supplement 2, as requested. They confirm what is also evident from the overall plots, namely that most ratio changes are larger than the incremental values suggested by the reviewer. Note that the original data are of course also available for inspection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was particularly intrigued by the authors' inference of the proportion of adaptive substitutions (&quot;alpha&quot;) in different gene sets. The show alpha is higher for sex-biased than unbiased genes and nicely shows that the genes that are unbiased in focal taxa but sex- biased in the sister taxa also have low alpha. It would be even stronger that sex-bias is associated with adaptive evolution to estimate alpha for only those genes that are sex- biased in the focal taxa but not in the sister taxa (the current version estimates alpha on all sex-biased genes within the focal taxa, both those that are sex-biased and those that are unbiased in the sister taxa).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the respective values in the results section, but since fewer genes are involved, they are less comparable to the other sets of genes. Still, the tendencies remain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The author's Sex Bias Index is measured in an individual sample as: SBI = median(TPM of female-biased genes) - median(TPM of male-biased genes). This index has some strange properties when one works through some toy examples (though any summary statistic will have limitations). The authors do little to jointly discuss the merits and limitations of this metric. It would have been interesting to examine their two key points (degree of overlapping distributions between sexes and correlation across tissues) using other individual measures of sex-bias.</p></disp-quote><p>We had responded to this comment before (including the explanation that it has no strange properties when one applies the normalization that is now implemented) and we have added a whole section devoted to the discussion of the merits of the SBI. We do not know which other &quot;individual measures of sex-bias&quot; this should be compared to. Still, we have now added a paragraph in the discussion about using PCA as an alternative to show that this would result in similar conclusions, but is technically less suitable for this purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 shows symmetric gaussian-looking distributions of SBI but it makes me wonder to what extent this is the magic of model fitting software as there are only 9 data points underlying each distribution. Whereas Figure 5 shows many broadly overlapping distributions for SBI, Figure 6 seems to suggest the sexes are quite well separated for SBI (e.g., brain in MUS, heart in DOM).</p></disp-quote><p>We use a standard fitting function in R (see above), which tries to fit a normalized distribution, but this function can also add an additional peak when the data are too heterogeneous (e.g. Mammary in Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. S1 should be shown as the log(F/M) ratio so it is easier to see the symmetry, or lack thereof, of female and male-biased genes.</p></disp-quote><p>The log will work differently for values &lt;1, compared to values &gt;1 when used in a single plot. We have now generated combined plots with symmetric values to allow a better comparability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is important to note that for the variance analysis that IQR/median was calculated for each gene within each sex for each tissue. This is a key piece of information that should be in the methods or legend of the main figure (not buried in Supplemental Table 17).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now moved these descriptions into the Methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
