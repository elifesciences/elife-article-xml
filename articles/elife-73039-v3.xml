In addition, gap junctions may also provide alternative neuronal pathways. However, because they are small and especially difficult to image, gap junctions are often ignored in large-scale 3D reconstructions. Here, we reconstruct gap junctions between photoreceptors in the mouse retina using serial blockface-scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy for the gap junction protein Cx36. An exuberant spray of fine telodendria extends from each cone pedicle (including blue cones) to contact 40–50 nearby rod spherules at sites of Cx36 labeling, with approximately 50 Cx36 clusters per cone pedicle and 2–3 per rod spherule. We were unable to detect rod/rod or cone/cone coupling. Thus, rod/cone coupling accounts for nearly all gap junctions between photoreceptors. We estimate a mean of 86 Cx36 channels per rod/cone pair, which may provide a maximum conductance of ~1200 pS, if all gap junction channels were open. This is comparable to the maximum conductance previously measured between rod/cone pairs in the presence of a dopamine antagonist to activate Cx36, suggesting that the open probability of gap junction channels can approach 100% under certain conditions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons can talk to each other in two ways: they can send chemical messengers across specialized junctions between two cells, or they can directly pass electrical signals to one another. This latter process is made possible by gap junctions, a system of channel-like structures which connect neighbouring cells and let ions move between them. In most neurons, gap junction channels are made from a specialized protein called connexin 36. Gap junctions are small, difficult to observe, and therefore often ignored by researchers studying neural circuits.</p><p>In response, Ishibashi et al. focused on nerve cells in the mouse retina, in particular the cones (which detect color during the day) and the rods (which are essential for night vision). Gap junctions between rods and cones allow them to communicate; for example, they enable rod signals to directly activate cones. This provides an alternative route for rod signaling known as the ‘secondary rod pathway’, which seems to be open at night and switches to closed around dawn.</p><p>Both rods and cones only produce connexin 36, so Ishibashi et al. labeled these proteins with fluorescent tags to pinpoint gap junctions. This showed that each cone makes around 50 gap junctions with nearby rods; however, gap junctions were not detected between cells of the same type.</p><p>In addition, 3D reconstruction helped to establish the length of each gap junction. Further experiments showed that a typical rod was connected to a cone by about 80 connexin 36 channels. Finally, calculations revealed that the gap junction channels would all need to open to account for the level of electrical activity required for the secondary rod pathway. This suggests that gap junctions may be much more active and important than previously thought.</p><p>The work by Ishibashi et al. provides a new understanding of the number, size and activity of gap junctions in the retina, potentially paving the way to prevent diseases where light-sensing cells degenerate and cause blindness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>gap junctions</kwd><kwd>rods</kwd><kwd>cones</kwd><kwd>blue cones</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1MH127343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgans</surname><given-names>Catherine W</given-names></name><name><surname>Aicher</surname><given-names>Sue A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ribelayga</surname><given-names>Christophe P</given-names></name><name><surname>Massey</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY029408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ribelayga</surname><given-names>Christophe P</given-names></name><name><surname>Massey</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY017836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singer</surname><given-names>Joshua H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30NS061800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aicher</surname><given-names>Sue A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30EY028102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Massey</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Each cone terminal is electrically coupled to around 50 nearby rods, forming a switchable circuit, known as the secondary rod pathway, in which all gap junction channels participate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signaling between neurons is served by both chemical synapses and electrical connections known as gap junctions. Chemical transmission is the dominant mode, but electrical synapses can change the properties and routing of local networks and microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marder et al., 2017</xref>). Gap junctions contain clusters of intercellular channels that allow the passage of ions and other small molecules, and so support electrical coupling. At a gap junction, the membranes of two neighboring cells are closely apposed or ‘zippered,’ leaving only a 2–4 nm gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloomfield and Völgyi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller and Pereda, 2017</xref>). Each gap junction channel is formed of two docked hemichannels, or connexons, and each connexon is assembled from six connexin subunits. Connexin expression is required on both sides to form a gap junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). The vertebrate connexin family in mouse includes 20 members, including Cx36, the most common neuronal connexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyer and Berthoud, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Söhl et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The pattern of gap junction connectivity between neurons confers distinct properties on circuit function. Homologous gap junctions between cells of the same type support the lateral spread of signals through coupled networks that can average over a wider area than a single neuron, as would be expected for rod/rod or cone/cone coupling, if they were shown to occur. In addition, heterologous coupling between different cell types can provide the specific connections to form another neuronal pathway or an alternative route for signal flow. For example, rod/cone coupling provides an alternative pathway for rod signals to enter cone-driven circuits, known as the secondary rod pathway. The gap junction connections between AII amacrine cells and ON bipolar cells in the retina, which support the primary rod pathway, are another well-known example of heterologous coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demb and Singer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feigenspan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mills et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Veruki and Hartveit, 2002</xref>).</p><p>While the distribution of gap junctions is widespread in neural tissue and their roles in signal averaging, noise reduction, synchronization, and predictive coding have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connors, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nagy et al., 2018</xref>), they are small, difficult to image, and often ignored. Thus, the role of electrical coupling in neural circuits may be underappreciated and poorly understood. Indeed, it is challenging to reliably identify gap junctions in electron microscopy (EM) material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pallotto et al., 2015</xref>), and gap junctions may be absent from large-scale serial EM reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate an approach for measuring small gap junctions reliably in the mouse retina that can be applied to other parts of the brain.</p><p>In the retina, the synaptic endings of photoreceptors, known as cone pedicles and rod spherules, terminate in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) where they make synapses with second-order neurons: horizontal cells and bipolar cells. Cone pedicles are found in a single layer in the mid-OPL, whereas the smaller rod spherules are found above and between the cone pedicles in the top (distal) half of the OPL. In the mouse retina, rods outnumber cones by about 30-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter-Dawson and LaVail, 1979</xref>), and, numerically, the OPL is dominated by rod spherules. Cone pedicles are the largest structures in the OPL. They contain numerous synaptic ribbons, each marking an active zone, and make synaptic contacts with horizontal cells and 13 types of cone bipolar cell. One of these bipolar cell types, CBC9, contacts short wavelength-sensitive (i.e., ‘blue’) cones selectively, which can be identified on this basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nadal-Nicolás et al., 2020</xref>). Rod spherules contain a single large ribbon and synapse with horizontal cells and a single type of rod bipolar cell.</p><p>The numerous, small gap junctions in the OPL were first described in early ultrastructural studies in cat and primate retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kolb, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 1986</xref>). Basal processes, called telodendria, spread laterally from cone pedicles to make small gap junctions with rod spherules. In freeze-fracture EM, the gap junctions appear as strings of single particles curved around the synaptic invagination of rod spherules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>). The presence of gap junctions at rod/cone contacts is consistent with the electrical transmission of rod signals to cones, forming the secondary rod pathway in which rod signals influence cone-driven circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asteriti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ingram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nelson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ribelayga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ribelayga and Mangel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Rods and cones both express Cx36, but no other connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloomfield and Völgyi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>) with Cx36-mediated rod/cone coupling accounting for most of the gap junctions in the OPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asteriti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ingram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to rod/cone gap junctions, cone/cone coupling has been reported in cat and primate retinae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kolb, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 1986</xref>). Rod/rod gap junctions have been suggested from tracer coupling studies and EM studies of the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>), and, in salamander retina, rods are extensively electrically coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang and Wu, 2004</xref>). However, the evidence for rod/rod gap junctions in the mammalian retina is mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloomfield and Völgyi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>) and will be addressed here.</p><p>In this study, we used a combination of confocal microscopy, serial blockface-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and focused ion beam-SEM (FIB-SEM), to address four major goals: (i) reconstruct the cone telodendrial network, (ii) identify all (both homologous and heterologous) gap junction types in the OPL, (iii) resolve the question of rod/rod coupling, and (iv) make a quantitative estimate of rod/cone coupling.</p><p>We used a publicly available SBF-SEM dataset (e2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>), which contains photoreceptor terminals and the OPL, to map membrane contacts between photoreceptors. Unfortunately, because this dataset was prepared to enhance membrane contrast and facilitate tracing neuronal processes, gap junctions were not identifiable. To work around this problem, we used confocal microscopy to identify the location of Cx36 gap junctions on rod spherules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). Tracing the contacts between cone telodendria and rod spherules in the SBF-SEM dataset revealed numerous potential sites that corresponded with the location of Cx36 immunofluorescence in the confocal dataset. Thus, the combination of confocal microscopy and SBF-SEM is complementary. To confirm the location of rod/cone gap junctions, we used FIB-SEM on new samples processed to preserve ultrastructure, which allowed high-resolution imaging of contacts between cone pedicles and rod spherules.</p><p>We confirmed that heterologous rod/cone gap junctions account for the vast majority of gap junctions in the OPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). The combination of imaging methods enabled us to determine the pattern of connectivity between photoreceptors and make a quantitative estimate of rod/cone coupling, based on gap junction size and number. Finally, we correlated this morphological data with our previously published measurements of gap junction conductance between photoreceptors obtained from paired rod/cone recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). This combination of morphological and physiological data provides a way to estimate some of the fundamental properties of gap junctions and how they may contribute to a neuronal circuit. Our calculations suggest that most connexon channels, up to 100% under certain conditions, can contribute to the wide dynamic range of these small, string-like gap junctions between rods and cones.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Localization of Cx36 in the OPL: Confocal microscopy</title><p>Immunofluorescent labeling for Cx36 revealed small clusters of labeling in the OPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, red).

In the OPL, there are many small Cx36 clusters associated with cone telodendria, often at their tips, relatively high (distal) in the OPL. Staining the rod spherules for a synaptic vesicle marker, such as the vesicular glutamate transporter, shows that Cx36 clusters are contained within the band of vGlut1-labeled rod spherules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). There was almost no Cx36 labeling in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). This is important because it rules out the presence of Cx36 gap junctions between rod somas and/or passing axons in the ONL, where they are packed together at high density. Cx36 clusters are also apparent distinctly underneath each cone pedicle (vertical arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), on processes previously identified as bipolar cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feigenspan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>).

Some rod/cone contacts have multiple Cx36 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, arrow). In these images, rod spherules appear as oval structures (blue) including two unlabeled compartments or holes, separated by the synaptic ribbon, immunolabeled for ribeye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, white). The lower hole in the rod spherule of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> contains the mGluR6-labeled (green) tips of rod bipolar cell dendrites and was thus identified as the postsynaptic compartment. The upper hole contains a single large mitochondrion, labeled for the mitochondrial translocase TOMM20 (red). To quantitatively determine the position of Cx36-labeled points, we captured vGlut1-labeled rod spherules and generated a mean structure by aligning, stacking, and averaging the images from 18 complete rod spherules from a single section. The sites of individual Cx36 elements were marked and found to be located around the base of the mean rod spherule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). A spline curve was fitted to the outline of the mean rod spherule and, after linearizing this curve, the density of Cx36 was plotted.

Plotting convergence (number of rod spherule contacts per cone) against the pedicle area shows a slight trend for the largest cone pedicles to contact more rods spherules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Examining these contacts from the perspective of the rod spherules, we coded the overlying rod spherules in the same color as each cone pedicle. Rod spherules with contacts from two or three of the central 13 cone pedicles are marked black or dark gray, respectively, with noncontacted rod spherules marked as light gray. Viewing the resulting map quickly makes the point that most rods are contacted by two or three cone pedicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Omitting the cone pedicles (except for one example) and all rod spherules in contact with those cones leaves only an annulus of rod spherules outside the field of reconstructed cones and demonstrates the almost total absence of rods with no cone contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We found 3/811 (0.4%) rods without cone contacts within the field of 29 cones, an insignificant fraction. As a precaution, we also checked a sparse patch with a rare hole in the cone mosaic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Even here, more than 95% of rods received cone contacts.</p><p>If each cone contacts every rod spherule within its telodendrial field, then in areas where the cone telodendria overlap, each rod must receive contacts from multiple cones. This is clearly the case, and, in fact, most rods receive contacts from two, three, or, rarely, four cones. A simplified map for two adjacent cones is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, while the contact map for all 29 cones is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>. Of approximately 40 rods in contact with each cone pedicle, only a few have exclusive contacts with a single cone (7.23 ± 3.38, mean ± SD, n = 13 central cone pedicles). Most rods receive contacts from several cone pedicles while adjacent cone pedicles share as many as 23 rod spherules, (mean ± SD = 6.23 ± 4.67, n = 79 cone pairs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). There is a pronounced edge effect because the outermost ring of cone pedicles lacks the overlap from further unanalyzed cones: to avoid this, we analyzed the rod contacts of the central 13 cone pedicles. In this area, rods with multiple cone contacts were the norm; 74% of rod spherules received contacts from two or three cones, yielding a rod to cone divergence of 1.89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This reflects the density of the telodendrial network and the large number of rod/cone gap junctions in the OPL. Clearly, each rod spherule has the potential to make several contacts with close-by cones, in agreement with the confocal data showing the distribution of Cx36.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Blue cone skeletons also contact rod spherules</title><p>The skeleton of a blue cone, defined by its bipolar cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nadal-Nicolás et al., 2020</xref>), is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and the analysis of all five blue cones from the dataset of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2016</xref> is presented for comparison with green cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>).

We also reconstructed all the rod spherules in contact with these cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>). Most of the overlying rod spherules have telodendrial contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>) but a few make direct contacts with the upper surface or roof of the cone pedicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When the contact sites with rods are displayed on the cone pedicles, the appearance is similar to the 3D reconstruction of confocal material showing the distribution of Cx36 clusters on a single-cone pedicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6H</xref>). When the contact sites are displayed on the rod spherule lower surfaces, it is obvious that most telodendrial contacts are very close to the mouth of the synaptic invagination, often forming a curved line or horseshoe around it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>), within 1–2 µm. Neighboring cone pedicles often contact the same rod spherules. At such sites, the contact pads from both cone pedicles can be found, often interspersed around the synaptic mouths of the rod spherule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref> , <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>). The cone contact sites are consistent with the location of Cx36 near the mouth of the synaptic invagination and thus indicate the potential presence of rod/cone gap junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, a contact pad may exceed the extent of a gap junction and therefore does not predict its size (see below).</p><p>Of the cone pedicles that were completely reconstructed, cones 5, 3, and 2 (a blue cone) had 57, 59, and 54 contact pads, respectively. Thus, the number of contact pads is close to the number of Cx36 clusters per cone pedicle (51.4 ± 8.88, mean ± SD), from the confocal analysis, and this suggests that most of the contact pads include gap junction sites. There were a few examples where a cone telodendron contacts a rod spherule far from the synaptic invagination, often in transit to another location, and these can show large areas of contact. But these sites are not associated with Cx36 labeling in the confocal data. In other words, these are incidental contacts of passage, not gap junctions, and they were excluded from our analysis.</p><p>There are a few anomalies in the OPL: some rod spherules sit directly astride a cone pedicle and receive few or no telodendrial contacts. Instead, they make direct contacts with the roof of the cone pedicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the lowest (most proximal) row of rods in the ONL do not have axons or spherules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, the synaptic machinery is included in the lowest crescent of the cell body, adjacent to the OPL. These low rods represent the most distal synaptic structures in the OPL, yet they still receive contacts from cone telodendria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, there are a few rod spherules below (proximal to) the level of the cone pedicles. These are often inverted so the mouth is on top, and this is the site of telodendrial contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, in every case, including these anatomical variations, cone contacts occur close to the rod synaptic opening, coincident with the location of Cx36. These sites very probably contain Cx36 rod/cone gap junctions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>3D reconstruction of a blue cone pedicle also shows contacts with rod spherules</title><p>Based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2016</xref>, who identified the cones in contact with the blue cone bipolar cell (CBC9), we could locate the blue cones in the map of cone pedicles. The telodendrial field of cone 2, a blue cone, contacts 41 rod spherules and overlaps substantially with the surrounding cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This blue cone pedicle made the same types of rod contacts as other cones, including telodendrial contacts, roof contacts, and contacts with the rods in the bottom row of the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Reconstructing in 3D shows typical contact pads around the mouth of the overlying rod spherules with alternating contributions from multiple cones, including this blue cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).

The promise of connectomics, to decode neuronal circuits and function, cannot be fulfilled without the inclusion of gap junctions and electrical coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scheffer and Meinertzhagen, 2021</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Rod/cone gap junctions predominate</title><p>Our results confirm the original work from cat retina, which showed 48 rod contacts per cone with a divergence of one rod to two cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 1986</xref>), very close to the numbers reported here. In the primate retina, freeze-fracture EM showed string-like gap junctions of 400–600 nm in concentric arcs around the rod spherule synaptic opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>). The telodendrial contacts described here have the same curved appearance and coincide with the location of Cx36 on the lower or vitreal surface of each rod spherule. With FIB-SEM, we found string-like rod/cone gap junctions with a mean length of ~480 nm, a tribute to the remarkable freeze-fracture EM work from nearly 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>). Since that time, Cx36 has been identified as the major neuronal connexin and we show that Cx36 labeling signposts rod/cone gap junctions at the confocal level. In summary, the results from mouse, cat, primate, and human retinas all indicate that rod/cone gap junctions are a common feature of the mammalian retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kántor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 1986</xref>). We demonstrate that rod/cone coupling accounts for nearly all gap junctions between photoreceptors.</p><p>The position of rod/cone gap junctions, at the base of the rod spherule, close to the opening of the synaptic cavity, appears to be systematic in that the vast majority of rod/cone gap junctions occur at this site. Our results show a range of 1–6 Cx36 contacts per rod spherule, comparable with 4–6 cone contacts per rod in the cat retina, forming a ring of contacts around the postsynaptic opening of the rod spherule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 1986</xref>). In rod spherules from the mouse retina, two gap junction contacts were described, usually on opposite sides of the synaptic opening, mostly arising from a single cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>). We may speculate that gap junctions are localized with some of the same scaffolding proteins that occur at the rod synaptic terminal, but the functional significance of this repeated motif is unknown. In mutant mouse lines, where Cx36 has been deleted from either rods or cones, cone telodendria are still present and they still reach out to contact nearby rod spherules in the absence of rod/cone gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the specificity of synaptic connections is not determined or maintained by the presence of Cx36 gap junctions.</p><p>Previously, some Cx36-GFP labeling was also found in the ONL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feigenspan et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that some coupling may occur between somas and/or passing axons. However, we did not observe this pattern with Cx36 antibodies and, in our hands, Cx36 labeling of photoreceptors was restricted to the OPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It is possible that the Cx36-GFP construct caused a trafficking defect.</p><p>Rod/cone coupling forms the entry to the secondary rod pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kolb, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloomfield and Dacheux, 2001</xref>). It was previously thought that these gap junctions must be closed at night to preserve the amplitude of single-photon responses of individual rods, which underlie scotopic sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 1986</xref>). However, recent work indicates that rod/cone coupling is high at night and low in daytime due to circadian activity and the influence of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin and Ribelayga, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). This leads to a reduction in the amplitude of the single-photon response at night. While this may appear to be detrimental, we have suggested that noise reduction, a consequence of convergence and coupling in the photoreceptor network, is the major function of rod/cone gap junctions, in addition to driving the secondary rod pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Field et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Rods and cones both express Cx36</title><p>The small number of Cx36 clusters per rod (2–3), compared to more than 50 per cone pedicle, a ratio of approximately 20, may explain early failures to detect rod Cx36 RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feigenspan et al., 2004</xref>).

Cx36 is the most common neuronal connexin, and it does not pair with other connexins, making only homotypic gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koval et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nagy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teubner et al., 2000</xref>). We have recently shown that both rods and cones express Cx36 and that no other connexins are present in either rods or cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, Cx36 is required on both sides to form a rod/cone gap junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the simplest case holds that both rods and cones express Cx36, and rod/cone gap junctions are heterologous but homotypic (meaning between different cell types but both expressing the same connexin).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cx36 numbers for rods and cones are consistent</title><p>We gathered data for both rods and cones independently. Because they are linked by rod/cone gap junctions, they should each serve as a check on the other. From confocal imaging of individual EGFP-labeled cone pedicles, we estimate that each cone pedicle has 51.4 ± 8.88 (mean ± SD, n = 18) Cx36 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), presumed to represent gap junctions, with nearby rod spherules. From the rod perspective, 43 rods contact each cone, and there are 2.48 ± 1.01 (mean ± SD, n = 260 rods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>) Cx36 clusters at the base of each rod spherule. Most rods contact more than one cone, with a mean divergence of 1.89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>); thus, the number of rod/cone gap junctions per cone pedicle can be calculated as 43 × 2.48/1.89 = 56.4, in close agreement with the number of Cx36 gap junctions counted in confocal reconstructions of individual cone pedicles. These numbers are also close to previous calculations of ~45 Cx36 clusters/cone pedicle, based on the density of Cx36 clusters and the number of cone pedicles from wholemount retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The number of gap junctions per rod was calculated by two methods: a confocal analysis of Cx36 clusters and using the FIB-SEM data. Analysis of the FIB-SEM data gave 3.21 gap junctions per rod spherule. The confocal analysis of Cx36 clusters gave 2.48 gap junctions per rod spherule, 25% less. The lower number in the confocal analysis might be expected because small Cx36 clusters could be missed, and two close together could merge and be counted as one due to the lower resolution of light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sigulinsky et al., 2020</xref>). Despite the differences in resolution, both methods showed a similar number of gap junction contacts close to the rod postsynaptic compartment. Although the smallest Cx36 clusters may be less than the confocal detection limit (different from the resolution limit), these data suggest that we accounted for at least 75% of the photoreceptor gap junctions by confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Blue cone pedicles are also coupled to rods</title><p>In the coupled cone networks of primate and ground squirrel retina, there is good evidence that blue cones are not coupled to neighboring red/green (primate) or green cones (ground squirrel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hornstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li and DeVries, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>). In the primate retina, the telodendria of blue cones are few in number and too short to reach the neighboring red/green cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, blue cones appear to be electrically separated from other cones in these two species, perhaps to maintain spectral discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsu et al., 2000</xref>). In the mouse retina, although the blue cones were identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2016</xref>, we were unable to find any cone-to-cone gap junctions, regardless of spectral sensitivity (see below).</p><p>In contrast to the selective connections between cones in some species, rods were coupled to both blue and green cones indiscriminately in the mouse retina (present work) and in primate retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>). Blue cones, identified in confocal work by the presence of S-cone opsin, and in SBF-SEM by their connections with blue cone bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nadal-Nicolás et al., 2020</xref>), and green cones both made telodendrial contacts at Cx36 clusters with all nearby rod spherules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, we find no evidence for color specificity in rod/cone coupling. In fact, a single rod spherule may be coupled to both blue and green cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). Therefore, rod signals can pass via the secondary rod pathway into both blue and green cones and their downstream pathways. Considering blue cone circuits specifically, rod input to blue cone bipolar cells and downstream circuits is predicted via the secondary rod pathway, in addition to the previously reported primary rod pathway inputs from AII amacrine cells to blue cone bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Field et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Whitaker et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Cone/cone gap junctions are rare</title><p>We were unable to confirm the presence of cone/cone gap junctions in the mouse retina despite locating more than 20 examples of cone/cone contacts from six partially reconstructed cone pedicles from one FIB-SEM dataset. In each case, there was no indication of the typical membrane density or chromophilic staining at cone/cone contacts. Nearby rod/cone contacts provided prominent gap junctions for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This result is surprising, given previous reports of cone/cone coupling in several mammalian species, including mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeVries et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kolb, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>). However, close contacts without gap junctions are not unprecedented. In rabbit retina, many bipolar cells are coupled by gap junctions, but some are not, despite contacts and the presence of gap junctions elsewhere in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sigulinsky et al., 2020</xref>). Gap junctions do not determine the specificity of neuronal connections.</p><p>The available data was derived from a limited set of six partially reconstructed cones due to the high-resolution, yet small volume of the FIB-SEM dataset. Thus, while we are confident that rod/cone coupling accounts for the vast majority of photoreceptor gap junctions, the sample size is too small to rule out a minor amount of cone/cone coupling, perhaps too small or too faintly stained to be readily detected by confocal imaging. Our previous electrophysiological studies suggest that there is weak cone-to-cone coupling in the mouse retina, which may indicate that cone/cone gap junctions are smaller than rod/cone gap junctions. Cone/cone coupling persists in the rod-specific Cx36 KO, suggesting it is direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). In the rod-specific Cx36 KO, there was some residual Cx36 labeling, associated with cone telodendria, which was significantly different from the background noise and may represent a small amount of cone/cone coupling, estimated as two gap junctions/cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Cone-to-cone coupling has been reported in other mammals but there may be species variation. In the ground squirrel, a cone-dominated retina, the low number of rods with the resulting adjacency of the cones may promote cone/cone coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeVries et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In the central primate retina, cones are densely packed and often adjacent, which is not the case in mouse retina. In peripheral primate retina, cones are more widely spaced, and they are connected by a sparse array of telodendria, which seem to target neighboring cones, making the pattern of Cx36-labeled gap junctions very obvious, in addition to numerous rod/cone gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, in the rod-less, cone-only mouse, there is a large increase in Cx36 labeling in the OPL, suggesting that cone/cone coupling occurs, at least under these circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang et al., 2004</xref>). The evidence for photoreceptor coupling in our study, including weak cone/cone coupling, is summarized in Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>No rod/rod gap junctions</title><p>Previous work in the mouse retina has suggested that rods form a coupled network based on the appearance in electron micrographs of small contacts between rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>). Most of these rod/rod contacts were characterized as small and with no membrane density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, some of the rod/rod contact sites were between the spherules and passing rod axons, a location where there is no Cx36 labeling. We have searched diligently for rod/rod gap junctions, but we have been unable to confirm their presence. Not only is Cx36 labeling restricted to the base of the rod spherule, around the synaptic opening, but, in the FIB-SEM material, this was almost the only location where we found rod gap junctions. We mapped the gap junctions from 42 rod spherules, and their distribution was in close agreement with the distribution of Cx36 labeling and cone telodendrial contacts. We could not trace every process making a gap junction contact to their cell of origin, but in 112 cases where we could, all were cone telodendria. Even the small number of outlying gap junctions distant from the synaptic opening were traced to cones.</p><p>We did find small contacts between adjacent rod spherules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), but there was no membrane density indicating the presence of a gap junction, and, in this equatorial position, around the midline where the rod spherules are closely packed, there was no Cx36 labeling. Furthermore, apparent rod/rod coupling was eliminated in the cone-specific Cx36 KO, indicating that physiological evidence of rod/rod coupling in wildtype retina is actually due to indirect rod/cone/rod coupling via the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). In the cone-specific Cx36 KO, which should preserve rod/rod gap junctions, Cx36 labeling of photoreceptors was essentially eliminated, providing no evidence for residual rod/rod coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). The loss of most Cx36 coupling in either the rod- or cone-specific KO indicates that rod/cone coupling accounts for the majority of photoreceptor gap junctions and provides no support for direct rod/rod coupling. We are aware of the difficulty in proving the absence of a particular structure, but, based on the weight of the available evidence, we conclude that there are no rod/rod gap junctions in the mouse retina, and that this may be a common feature of the mammalian retina. The comparative evidence for photoreceptor coupling, including the lack of rod/rod coupling, is summarized in Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Calculations of size for rod/cone gap junctions</title><p>Gap junctions are common building blocks of neural circuits throughout the CNS, but to accurately model their effect on circuit function, it is essential to know their size, number of connexon channels, their conductance, and perhaps most importantly, their dynamic range or plasticity. The size of the conductance through a gap junction depends not only on the number of connexons and the unitary conductance, but also on the channel activity, usually characterized as the open probability. These are the fundamental properties required to understand the function of gap junctions in neuronal microcircuits. Here, we have an opportunity to estimate these variables.</p><p>Rod/cone gap junctions appear as low-density strings of single particles in freeze-fracture EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reale et al., 1978</xref>), and this is consistent with the uniform width of rod/cone gap junctions in our 3D FIB-SEM reconstructions, as well as the low intensity of Cx36 labeling compared to the much larger plaque-type gap junctions of the inner retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamasawa et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, in our calculations, we have taken rod/cone gap junctions as strings with a width of one connexon and a length given by the 3D reconstructions of gap junctions from the FIB-SEM datasets.</p><p>To calculate the number of connexons from the length of gap junctions, we need to determine the spacing of Cx36 channels. The mean density of gap junction plaques in freeze-fracture preparations of mouse cerebellum was 12,940 ± 405/μm<sup>2</sup> (mean ± SEM, n = 12), close to the density of Cx36 plaques in the inner retina (12,000/μm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamasawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Szoboszlay et al., 2016</xref>). From this, we calculated the center-to-center spacing as 9.45 ± 0.296 nm (mean ± SEM) for connexons in a Cx36 gap junction plaque. This result is in close agreement with 10 nm spacing reported in freeze-fracture material of rod/cone gap junctions in primate retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>).</p><p>Knowing the spacing, we calculated the number of connexon channels from the mean length of a rod/cone gap junction in the FIB-SEM dataset, 477 ± 19.5 nm (mean ± SEM, n = 135 from 42 rod spherules), yielding 50.5 ± 2.60 (mean ± SEM) connexon channels per rod/cone gap junction. We estimate that there are 3.21 ± 0.190 (mean ± SEM, n = 42, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table3">Appendix 2—table 3</xref>) gap junctions per rod, but these are shared with several nearby cones.

For a unitary conductance of 14.3 ± 0.8 pS (mean ± SEM, n = 92, per Cx36 channel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Srinivas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teubner et al., 2000</xref>), we can calculate the maximal conductance between a rod and a cone, if all gap junction channels were in an open state, as ~1228 ± 120 pS (mean ± SEM, 85.9 connexons × 14.3 pS/connexon). It is important to note that this theoretical maximum was derived from our morphological data.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Possible sources of error</title><p>It is important to note that there are several assumptions and potential sources of error that may affect these calculations. The structure of small gap junctions lies below the resolution of conventional light microscopy and must be inferred. Likewise, in EM material, the identity of the darkly stained chromophilic material is unknown and may include auxiliary proteins in addition to connexins, which may exaggerate the dimensions of a gap junction, particularly in width for string-like gap junctions. For this reason, our estimates of rod/cone gap junction width were guided by freeze-fracture SEM images from primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reale et al., 1978</xref>). Thus, our calculations are based on the length of gap junction strings with a width of one connexon because the freeze-fracture studies show a string of single-gap junction particles on the surface of a rod spherule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reale et al., 1978</xref>). This is consistent with the low intensity of Cx36 labeling in the OPL, which indicates the presence of very small or sparse gap junctions such as strings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mills et al., 2001</xref>). If we failed to detect some gap junctions, this would artificially increase the open probability numbers. However, this is probably a minor concern because we were able to detect gap junctions with a minimum length of approximately 100 nm, or ~10 connexons, in the FIB-SEM material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These issues of gap junction size and string width could perhaps be addressed in the future by super-resolution microscopy for Cx36.</p><p>We are assuming negligible species variation in the size and packing density of rod/cone gap junction channels, and this is supported by the similarity in measurements of rod/cone gap junction length, ~500 nm, from our FIB-SEM data in mouse and the freeze-fracture studies in primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reale et al., 1978</xref>). Tissue shrinkage during EM sample processing is another potential source of error, though our measurements of gap junction position from SEM and confocal microscopy gave comparable results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B and C</xref>). Therefore, the errors introduced by the use of these different microscopy techniques are unlikely to be large and do not materially affect our conclusions.</p><p>Finally, previous work reported that electrical coupling between photoreceptors changes with the time of day, reflecting the influence of light/dark adaptation and circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ribelayga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin and Ribelayga, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, daily changes in photoreceptor coupling reflect changes in Cx36 phosphorylation state and open probability, without significant structural changes in the number or size of Cx36 gap junctions present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, circadian changes are not likely to affect our conclusions concerning the structure of rod/cone gap junctions.</p><p>While we have listed these potential sources of error in the interest of transparency, we note that a combined underestimation of the connexon number by a factor as large as two yields a maximum open probability number of &gt;50% (107%/2). This would still provide a historically high number for the open probability of gap junctions. Thus, we believe our calculations predict that the fraction of connexons that participate in gap junction modulation is greater than previously appreciated. Our results suggest that modulation of gap junction strings may include most connexon channels, perhaps approaching 100% when pharmacologically driven to an extreme.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Dynamic range of rod/cone gap junctions</title><p>Using this detailed structural information, combined with our previous conductance measurements from rod/cone paired recordings, we can calculate the physiological properties of rod/cone gap junctions. Our recently published work shows a mean resting value of 307 ± 2.31 pS (mean ± SEM) for the rod/cone transjunctional conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). Compared to the theoretical maximum above, this indicates a resting open probability in darkness of 25.0% ± 2.45% (mean ± SEM).

But these earlier values may be low because the size of the gap junctions was estimated by immunofluorescence, which provides a high number for gap junction area and connexon number, with a correspondingly low number for the open probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamasawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Szoboszlay et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, when the number of connexons was accurately measured by freeze-fracture EM, the open probability of cerebellar gap junctions was calculated as 18% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Szoboszlay et al., 2016</xref>), close to the value derived here.</p><p>Rod/cone coupling is modulated by dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ribelayga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>).

In the presence of spiperone, a D2 antagonist, the maximum conductance for a rod/cone pair was 1312 ± 22.8 pS (n = 500, bootstrapping from data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). Compared to the theoretical maximum of 1228 ± 120 pS above, derived from morphological data, these values translate to a minimum open probability of 2.89% ± 0.293% and a maximum open probability of 107% ± 10.6% of available Cx36 gap junction channels. Note that details of these calculations with the cumulative errors can be found in Appendix 3. This is a very surprising result because previous measures of open probability have produced such low estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connors, 2017</xref>), but we believe it is consistent with our data. For the first time, it suggests that the range of gap junctions can be modulated from close to 0 to approximately 100% of available Cx36 channels. In other words, all of the channels in these small string-like rod/cone gap junctions are switchable and may contribute to their plasticity.</p><p>The diffusion coefficient through Cx36 gap junctions, a proxy for conductance, was correlated with the phosphorylation of Cx36 as measured using phospho-Cx36 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kothmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O’Brien, 2014</xref>). Pharmacological manipulation using dopamine agonists or antagonists produced phosphorylation-driven changes in tracer coupling between mouse photoreceptors that encompassed a 20-fold range of diffusion coefficients, producing a large dynamic range for gap junction plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In the present experiments, the ratio of minimum to maximum open channels, from 3–100% or 36–1312 pS, was approximately 30, similar to the dynamic range derived from tracer coupling studies with phospho-specific Cx36 antibodies. While these calculations are necessarily approximate, they support the concept that gap junctions provide a versatile component, offering a large range of plasticity in neural circuits. In the retina, rod/cone coupling may reduce transduction noise in the photoreceptor network and the modulation of rod/cone gap junctions also provides a switchable entry to the secondary rod pathway, which varies with light intensity and the circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloomfield and Völgyi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Field et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin and Ribelayga, 2016</xref>). In more general terms, this example from the retina demonstrates that gap junctions may perform a variety of essential functions in neural circuits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Animal Welfare Committee at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (AWC-20-0138), Oregon Health &amp; Science University (IP00000456, A3304-01), and University of Maryland College Park (R-OCT-20-56).

Briefly, a Venus-bGH PolyA-NeoR (flanked by FRT sites) cassette was integrated into the Opn1sw locus on the BAC clone replacing coding region of exon 1 to generate the Venus-bGH-Neo knockin version of the BAC clone. Recombination was verified by PCR reactions specifically designed to detect recombination junctions by ET recombination (or homologous recombination). This BAC clone carrying the reporter cassette was further trimmed, through ET recombination, to retain a 15 kb fragment, including upstream regulatory sequence (10 kb upstream of the coding region), the KI cassette, and the ~2 kb sequence downstream of exon 2 of the Opn1sw gene. The intended transgenic construct was verified by overlapping PCR and Sanger sequencing. Transgenic F0 founders were created by microinjecting the transgenic construct (1 ng/µl) into fertilized eggs from C57bl6/j donors followed by genomic PCR screening amplifying the reporter insert.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Confocal microscopy image acquisition</title><p>A Zeiss LSM-800 confocal microscope with Airyscan was used for four-channel imaging of retinal whole mounts and sections with a ×63 (N.A. 1.4) oil-immersion objectives.

Due to lack of clear colocalization between Cx36 and the rod marker (vGlut1), the number of Cx36 clusters per rod was counted manually. Some rod spherules were excluded from analysis if they were too close to link a Cx36 cluster to a specific rod. A total of 260 well-isolated rod spherules in seven retinal sections from three retinae were chosen to analyze the number of Cx36 clusters. To analyze the position, a mini-stack of 6 × 0.15 μm optical sections from 18 rod spherules wase extracted, aligned, and averaged (ImageJ). A spline curve 8 pixels (272 nm) wide was applied to the perimeter, and the intensity profile for Cx36 was plotted linearly around the synaptic opening.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Connectivity analysis: SBF-SEM (e2006)</title><p>A region in the OPL from a publicly available serial block-face scanning EM (SBF-SEM) dataset e2006, voxel size 16.5 × 16.5 × 25 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>), including 164 cone pedicles, was analyzed using KNOSSOS software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helmstaedter et al., 2011</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://knossos.app/">https://knossos.app/</ext-link>).

The whole e2006 dataset included a total of six blue cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2016</xref>) but one was located at the edge of the dataset and was truncated.

A wash in three changes of distilled water followed the reduced osmium fixation and preceded an en bloc fix in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. Dehydration in a graded series of ethanol (35–100%) and infiltration in a propylene oxide:epoxy resin series was followed by embedding and polymerization in epoxy resin. Imaging by SBF-SEM was performed under contract with Renovo Neural (Cleveland, OH) using a FEI Teneo Volume Scope. Beam current was 50 pA, and the face was imaged with 7 × 7 × 40 nm resolution. Each face image spanned the width of the retina from the first layer of photoreceptor cell bodies in the ONL to the ganglion cell bodies in the GCL and comprised two stitched fields of 8192 × 8192 pixels for a dimension of 8192 × 16,384 pixels or 57.34 × ~114.68 µm.

The resulting resin blocks were trimmed to contain the OPL within 25 μm of the top edge of the block, cut and mounted to a 45° pre-tilted stub, and coated with 8 nm of carbon. Three-dimensional data were acquired using the Helios G3 NanoLab DualBeam FIB-SEM. In brief, a focused beam of gallium atoms ablated 4 nm off the surface of the sample (FIB conditions: 30 keV accelerating voltage, 790 pA beam current), comprising the scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging area, with a field of view around 25 μm. The freshly ablated surface was then imaged by backscattered electrons using the In-Column Detector (SEM conditions: 400 pA beam current, 3 keV accelerating voltage, 4 nm per pixel, and 3 μs dwell time; image resolution: 6144 × 4086, 4 nm isotropic). Around 1149 (FIB-SEM 1 dataset; 1342 for FIB-SEM 2 dataset) ablation and imaging cycles were run over a 3-day period, resulting in a sample depth of roughly 4.6 μm.

The distance from a gap junction to the synaptic opening center of a rod spherule was calculated using the oblique slicer tool in Imaris to align the center of the mitochondria and the postsynaptic opening in a single plane. Gap junction length was visualized using the oblique slicer to create an en face view. Some gap junctions showed belt-like structures with curvature and torsion. Due to the complexity of the structure, the size of these gap junctions was estimated as a simplified rectangular shape by measuring the length of the longer axis and average width of the belt.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Fred Rieke as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joshua Morgan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers all appreciated the quality of the data in the paper, and felt that the main conclusions were well supported by the data. Two areas need improvement:</p><p>1. Additional quantification is needed for several conclusions (see reviewer #2 comments especially).</p><p>2. The motivation for the paper and relevance of the conclusions for an audience beyond the retina need to be strengthened considerably. One possible direction that came up in discussions among the reviewers was the technical strength of the combination of EM and confocal microscopy, and whether similar approaches could be used in other circuits.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figures:</p><p>- Some identifying labels would be helpful. For example, pointing to a few telodendria in Figure 1 would be useful.</p><p>- Figure 1G looks like a different perspective from Figure 1D. It would help to clarify when you are showing things in cross section and when from above/below – perhaps with a little icon of a cone?</p><p>Correlating the figures and figure legends was difficult. Some of the figures (e.g. Figure 1) were cut off, and the figures did not have any identifying labels (so I had to count from the start each time I wanted to be sure I was looking at the right one). Ideally the legends would appear with the figure to ease reviewing!</p><p>Lines 77 and 99 make the same point</p><p>Lines 94-96 introduce rod-rod coupling, but then that comes up again in the next paragraph.</p><p>Line 134: should this refer to Figure 1C?</p><p>Line 200: very nice analysis!</p><p>Line 254: can you label cones in Figure so the reader knows which is cone 5?</p><p>Line 317: can you clarify what &quot;merged&quot; means here – as worded it sounds like they become one (like a synaptic vesicle merging or fusing with the cell membrane).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 85: &quot;In lower vertebrates&quot; is outdated terminology (&quot;In non-mammalian vertebrates&quot;?) and may also be overly broad for the reference ( &quot;In salamanders..&quot;?).</p><p>Figure 1: Please include visible background in all fluorescence images.

However, the images also look heavily processed, especially the ribeye. Please describe the processing. If possible, provide a supplement of raw images where background signal, noise, unprocessed shapes are visible.</p><p>Line 306: You absolutely cannot say things like &quot;X is smaller than Y, but the difference is not significant due to small sample size&quot;. Sample size is where you derive confidence to make scientific claims. In your sample, X was smaller than Y, but your sample size is too small to be confident that this difference represents the population of X and Y. You absolutely cannot say that you know what the answer would be if you sampled more.</p><p>Line 308: The indistinguishable sentence is too strong. By all other measures Blue cones are indistinguishable…. That suggests a conclusion about the population for &quot;all other&quot; measures. What you have is a limited set of measures for 5 cones. It is accurate to say the 5 Blue cones we measured were within the range we observed for green cones in terms of convergence (Blue X+-X, Green X+-X), blank () and blank(). To make a strong statistical argument about similarity you would have to do something along the lines of a power test and your sample size is too small to make that meaningful.</p><p>Line 623: The EM evidence for the absence of Cone/Cone gap junctions in mice is weak. Only 6 cells from one patch of one retina were used. Mentioning the 20 examples of cone/cone contacts is useful but can be a little misleading without context. You can readily say that the vast majority of gap junctions in your tissue are cone/rod. However, you can't rule out the possibility of some cone/cone gap junctions in other photoreceptors in other parts of other retinas or that something in the prep made cone/cone gap junctions difficult to detect. Given that the prior prediction was that cone/cone would be much less than rod/cone I don't consider the results presented here to be far out of line of the expected. The result could certainly be strengthened by checking other retinas. Alternatively, a discussion of the limits of the small sample could be included in the Discussion section.</p><p>Line 714: There are no error bars on your estimate of 89% open. Given the number of inferences, it seems plausible that the estimate of channel number could be off by several fold. Any underestimate of gap junction length could push the open fraction to the &quot; very surprising&quot; large number. My understanding is that the 10nm center to center number is a single measure (no population numbers) from the IPL. That number is combined with the observation that single string gap junctions are found between rods and cones in primates.</p><p>Possible sources of error</p><p>– Variation in population center to center spacing</p><p>– Doubling in channel packing</p><p>– Tissue shrinkage from aldehyde fixation and solvent dehydration vs frozen tissue.</p><p>– Failure to detect some gap junctions</p><p>– Species differences</p><p>– Multiple chains interpreted as single chains.</p><p>Possible Circadian Issue: I don't believe any mention is made of the time of day the animals were sacrificed or whether circadian regulation of coupling might have a structural component. If possible, provide this data or include in discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Abstract: I think you could make the abstract more engaging by adding a motivational sentence or two and a strong summary sentence with the main results</p><p>– Overall manuscript: As presented here, the manuscript reads like a concatenation of datasets and their analysis which would benefit from more emphasis on a common thread throughout the sections</p><p>– The end of the discussion is quite abrupt. A closing paragraph that sums up the results is missing</p><p>– As it currently is, I'm missing a discussion of the implications of your finding for the field and possible relevance for future research or emerging research questions</p><p>– The source data is not really source data, merely the counts in excel files. From an open-source point of view, it would be nice to at least have it as csv file so that everyone can open it including via python etc.</p><p>– L. 61: I don't see and know any evidence that rod spherules are structured in layers</p><p>– Figure 1 supp 2C: I can't see any cyan labeling, only magenta next to some green labeling, is it that what you mean? (L. 1282)</p><p>– Figure 3: What do the black arrows mean, it is nowhere mentioned what they should highlight.</p><p>– L. 493: Something like &quot;Higher resolution FIB-SEM of a smaller volume.…&quot; would be clearer</p><p>– L. 496: Where does that conductance value come from? This is/could be one of the more important statements of the paper and it should appear in the Results section. I suggest moving ll. 700 further up so that the calculation comes earlier in the manuscript.</p><p>– Ll. 919: I'm not sure I understand how you measured the length of the GJ as a rectangular shape. How big is the deviation from the true length given a structure that looks more like three quarters of a circle as shown in Figure 7G,H? Could you clarify this with a sketch of how you measured gap junction size?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Analysis of Rod/Cone Gap Junctions from the Reconstruction of Mouse Photoreceptor Terminals&quot; for further consideration by eLife. Your revised article has been evaluated by Claude Desplan (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is a remaining suggestion that we would like you to consider: You need to rewrite the abstract, introduction and discussion in order to much better integrate the new results/text rather than patching them onto the previous version. These editorial changes, which could be done in a few days, would allow the readers to much better understand the significance of the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper has improved in revision, but more work could be done to integrate the changes into the paper. The text added to the Introduction does a better job highlighting the importance of gap junctions, but the introduction now has two parts that could be integrated much more smoothly. For example, it could be clearer which outer retina gap junctions could contribute to signal averaging and which to a separate pathway. Related to this point, there is some repetition between the first few (new) paragraphs of the introduction and the text about the outer plexiform layer.</p><p>Related to this point, the Discussion is still relatively focused on the retina. I think it would strengthen the paper if you can come back to the general issues that are not described early in the introduction and summarize your findings in the context of those issues.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73039.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.

If indeed rods express Cx36, then it raises the possibility that they could also be coupled via Cx36 gap junctions.

Therefore, we have calculated the cumulative errors in presenting the open probability of rod/cone gap junction channels, which is a ratio of the mean conductance under different conditions (from our previously published physiological work Jin et al., 2020), over the maximum potential conductance, derived from the morphological data in this paper, interpreted with reference to earlier work on photoreceptor gap junctions. The new numbers are slightly different from the previous calculations because we used the means rather than the medians in our calculations, consistent with statistical practice. However, it should be noted that they are not qualitatively different. All numbers for open probability in the text are now expressed as a percentage with the SEM. Appendix 3 showing our calculations is now attached.</p><p>We recognize that there are several assumptions and potential sources of error in these calculations and we agree that it is appropriate to disclose them. Therefore, in the interests of transparency, we have added a section to the discussion detailing possible sources of error. In this text, we have addressed all issues raised by reviewer 2.</p><p>Added to Discussion:</p><p>“Possible Sources of Error</p><p>It is important to note that there are several assumptions and potential sources of error which may affect these calculations. The structure of small gap junctions lies below the resolution of conventional light microscopy and must be inferred. Likewise, in EM material, the identity of the darkly stained chromophilic material is unknown and may include auxiliary proteins in addition to connexins which may exaggerate the dimensions of a gap junction, particularly in width. First, our calculations are based on the length of gap junction strings with a width of 1 connexon because the freeze-fracture studies show a string of single gap junction particles on the surface of a rod spherule (Raviola and Gilula, 1976; Reale et al., 1978). This is consistent with the low intensity of Cx36 labeling in the OPL, which indicates the presence of very small or sparse gap junctions such as strings (Dang et al., 2004; Mills et al., 2001). If in fact the string width were two connexons, it would double the channel number and thus halve the open probability when compared with our previous conductance measurements from paired recordings (Jin et al., 2020). Double strings, two particles wide were occasionally observed but they were not the predominant form (Raviola and Gilula, 1976). Both freeze-fracture studies were from primate, one macaque and one human, so it is also possible there is a species difference for the mouse, which could perhaps be addressed in the future by super resolution microscopy.</p><p>Secondly, species variation in the packing density of gap junction channels may also affect our calculations. Here, we are on safer ground. The connexon channel density was derived from two freeze fracture studies in mouse which are in good agreement with a value around 12,000 connexons/μm<sup>2</sup> for Cx36 plaques (Kamasawa et al., 2006; Szoboszlay et al., 2016). We simply calculated the center-to-center spacing based on these numbers (Appendix 3) and it closely agrees with the 10 nm particle spacing of gap junction strings in photoreceptors (Raviola and Gilula, 1976). A third source of error could be that we have failed to detect some rod/cone gap junctions artificially increasing the open probability numbers. However, this is probably a minor issue because we were able to detect gap junctions with a minimum length of approximately 100nm, or ~ 10 connexons (Figure 8). Fourthly, we have made no attempt to correct our numbers for shrinkage due to tissue fixation or to compensate for the specific processing required by different techniques. Some measurements of gap junction position relied on both confocal microscopy and SEM, and these techniques gave comparable results (Figures 3E and 8B, C). Furthermore, both freeze fracture and FIB-SEM gave similar results for rod/cone gap junction length, ~500nm, albeit from different species, primate and mouse respectively. Therefore, the errors introduced by the use of these different techniques are not large and do not materially affect our conclusions.</p><p>Finally, previous work reported that electrical coupling between photoreceptors changes with the time of day, reflecting the influence of light/dark adaptation and circadian clocks (Ribelayga et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009; Li et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2020). In addition, circadian changes in photoreceptor coupling are found in mouse lines that are proficient in melatonin synthesis, such as the CBA/CaJ line (Jin et al., 2016). Yet, daily changes in photoreceptor coupling reflect changes in Cx36 phosphorylation state and open probability, without significant structural changes in the number or size of Cx36 gap junctions present (Li et al., 2009; Li et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). Thus, circadian changes are not likely to affect our conclusions concerning the structure of rod/cone gap junctions.</p><p>While we have listed these potential sources of error in the interest of transparency, we note that a combined under-estimation of the connexon number by a factor as large as two yields a maximum open probability number of &gt;50% (107%/2). This would still provide a historically high number for the open probability of gap junctions. Thus, we believe our calculations predict that the fraction of connexons which participate in gap junction modulation is greater than previously appreciated. Our results suggest that modulation of gap junction strings may include most connexon channels, perhaps approaching 100% when pharmacologically driven to an extreme.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Possible Circadian Issue: I don't believe any mention is made of the time of day the animals were sacrificed or whether circadian regulation of coupling might have a structural component. If possible, provide this data or include in discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe that circadian changes are reflected in gap junction structural changes. This is now included in the discussion of potential sources of error (see above).

We have shown that rod/cone coupling is the predominant form of photoreceptor coupling in the mouse retina. In contrast to the primate and ground squirrel, there is little or no cone coupling in the mouse retina. The use of confocal microscopy to locate Cx36 gap junctions, combined with SBF-SEM and FIB-SEM was extremely valuable because we knew where to look to find gap junctions in the SEM material. This was aided in part by the simple and stereotyped morphology of the OPL. A similar approach could be used in other systems but if the gap junctions are distributed over a dendritic tree or along an axon, as opposed to a small rod terminal, they may be more difficult to find and image. It will be important to extend this approach to the inner retina, where the circuitry is more complex, and the number of neuronal types is much greater. More generally, our study demonstrates the utility of targeted, small-scale ‘connectomic’ analysis for the identification of neural circuit components.</p><p>However, all serial EM datasets are not equal. Some have reported the signature of gap junctions, notably for RC1, a transmission EM (TEM) dataset from rabbit retina (Marc et al., 2018; Sigulinsky, et al., 2020). TEM also has the advantage that sections can be resampled at higher resolution to confirm the pentalaminar structure of gap junctions, though this is impractical for every example. However, in other large datasets gap junctions are missing and their potential contributions have been overlooked (Kasthuri et al., 2015; Scheffer et al., 2020). The promise of connectomics, to decode neuronal circuits and function, cannot be fulfilled without the inclusion of gap junctions and electrical coupling (Scheffer and Meinertzhagen, 2021).</p><p>The calculations of connexon number and open probability, based on the combination of morphological data, cellular geometry and previous conductance measurements were revealing. Rod/cone gap junctions form a switchable pathway, known as the secondary rod pathway, controlled via D2 dopamine receptors with a mean of approximately 80 gap junction channels and a mean maximal conductance of ~1200pS per rod/cone pair. We estimate that a large proportion of connexon channels in these small string-like gap junctions may be active rather than passive. As we learn their basic properties, it may be possible to understand the contribution of gap junctions as circuit elements in specific neuronal pathways.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The source data is not really source data, merely the counts in excel files.
