For example, quantifying cell numbers, and the interplay of sex, strain, and individual variability in cell density and volume is out of reach for many regions. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity project produces high-resolution full brain images of hundreds of brains. Although these were created for a different purpose, they reveal details of neuroanatomy and cytoarchitecture. Here, we used this population to systematically characterize cell density and volume for each anatomical unit in the mouse brain. We developed a DNN-based segmentation pipeline that uses the autofluorescence intensities of images to segment cell nuclei even within the densest regions, such as the dentate gyrus. We applied our pipeline to 507 brains of males and females from C57BL/6J and FVB.CD1 strains. Globally, we found that increased overall brain volume does not result in uniform expansion across all regions. Moreover, region-specific density changes are often negatively correlated with the volume of the region; therefore, cell count does not scale linearly with volume. Many regions, including layer 2/3 across several cortical areas, showed distinct lateral bias. We identified strain-specific or sex-specific differences. For example, males tended to have more cells in extended amygdala and hypothalamic regions (MEA, BST, BLA, BMA, and LPO, AHN) while females had more cells in the orbital cortex (ORB). Yet, inter-individual variability was always greater than the effect size of a single qualifier. We provide the results of this analysis as an accessible resource for the community.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse brain</kwd><kwd>neuroanatomy</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TYPEWIRE-852786</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochgerner</surname><given-names>Hannah</given-names></name><name><surname>Aloni</surname><given-names>Etay</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeisel</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA-0039/2019-C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochgerner</surname><given-names>Hannah</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeisel</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2028912</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochgerner</surname><given-names>Hannah</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeisel</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swedish Brain Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochgerner</surname><given-names>Hannah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Israel ministry of science, technology &amp; space</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3-16033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shental</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Across individuals of a mouse population, brain regions volumes scaled to accommodate the same amount of cells, but left hemisphere cortical regions were denser than right, and several regions of the limbic system were more pronounced in either sex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian brain can be divided into neuroanatomical units (i.e., brain regions) characterized by a shared function, connectivity, developmental origin, and/or cytoarchitecture (i.e., number and density of cells it contains). The mouse brain is the most extensively studied in mammals and its regions are well characterized. Although cytoarchitecture is one of the most prominent features of a brain region, few studies have systematically mapped cell bodies or quantified cell densities in mouse brains, compared to the early, detailed cell mapping of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">White et al., 1986</xref>). On the other hand, extensive literature explored scaling of cell numbers and densities among mammalian brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herculano-Houzel and Lent, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo et al., 2009</xref>). This however was performed by counting dissociated nuclei at the loss of deeper region-specific resolution. Obtaining an accurate cell count for a brain region is technically challenging. Previous estimates relied heavily on extrapolation from manual counting of 2D sections (stereology), making cell-resolved data for subcortical regions sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keller et al., 2018</xref>). Analyzing complete brains using 2D histological sections remains labor-intensive because it requires sectioning, mounting, and accurate alignment with a reference atlas. Furthermore, automated cell counting proved particularly difficult in dense regions, such as the hippocampal formation (HPF) and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attili et al., 2019</xref>). Automated block-face imaging methods solved several of these issues and drastically improved throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ueda et al., 2020</xref>), For instance, serial two-photon tomography (STPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ragan et al., 2012</xref>) was a technological breakthrough that integrated tissue sectioning with top-view light microscopy. STPT provided high-quality imaging in an optical plane below the sectioning surface and solved many problems of section distortion and atlas alignment, further easing downstream analysis. Yet, STPT typically represents a subsample of the complete volume, and some interpolation is needed.</p><p>Because of their limited throughput, histological studies cannot supply the number of analyzed brains needed to uncover potential variability between individuals, experimental conditions, and populations. Complementary approaches aimed at evaluating variability, for example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can measure some features, such as the volume of given brain regions, and can even track individuals over time in a noninvasive manner. Yet, MRI lacks the accuracy needed for counting cells or assessing cell densities, and it remains difficult to simultaneously analyze regional volume <italic>and</italic> cell density with high accuracy brain-wide, especially in the large throughput required for comparing two experimental populations (such as two strains, or males vs. females). Therefore, there is a need for systematic measurement of all cells over hundreds of brains from multiple experimental groups.</p><p>To address this knowledge gap, we harnessed the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Project (AMBCA) dataset, which is largest existing cohort of whole-brain STPT images, produced by the Allen Institute for the different purpose of mapping mouse regional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://help.brain-map.org/display/api/Allen%2BBrain%2BAtlas%2BAPI">http://help.brain-map.org/display/api/Allen%2BBrain%2BAtlas%2BAPI</ext-link>). We applied a deep neural network (DNN) to discern cell nuclei using the AMBCA background autofluorescence channel. This enabled us to perform a systematic brain-wide cell density estimation across hundreds of mouse brains. Based on the alignment with the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (AMBA), we were able to simultaneously measure volume <italic>and</italic> density for each brain, for each region, over a large population. We constructed a comprehensive database that aggregates these results and provides them as an accessible resource to the community. We also discovered nontrivial relationships between densities and volumes, and gained insights into strain- and sex-dependent characteristics across various brain regions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Graphical abstract.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis is based on a cohort of 507 mouse brains from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (AMBCA), males and females, of C57BL/6J and FVB.CD1 strains.

The project has systematically imaged 2992 full brains, using serial two-photon tomography, for the purpose of tracing neuronal projections and mapping regional (mesoscale) connectivity with GFP-labeled viral tracers. Each brain in the dataset is covered by 130â140 (median 137) serial coronal sections, with a gap of 100 Î¼m, as reported in the AMBCA study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). We noticed that the red (background) channel of STPT images, taken for the purpose of atlas alignment, typically features dark, round-like objects resembling cell nuclei. This phenomenon was described in previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Costantini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DaCosta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kretschmer et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zipfel et al., 2003</xref> characterized the use of multiphoton-excited native florescence and second harmonic generation for the purpose of staining-free tissue imaging. To confirm that these dark objects indeed represent cell nuclei with lower autofluorescence intensity than the surrounding lipid-rich brain tissue, we performed a standard 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) perfusion-fixation followed by cryosectioning and nucleus (DAPI) counterstaining. In these sections, we observed the same low-autofluorescent objects using epifluorescence microscopy. 91â98% of detected objects were also marked by DAPI, confirming that dark objects in STPT indeed represent cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). About 2â9% of detected low-autofluorescent objects were additional âfalse positiveâ detections that were not obvious in the DAPI image. On the other hand, 26â45% of DAPI-detected nuclei were not observed in the autofluorescent images (false negatives), pointing to an underestimate of cell counts based on low-autofluorescence objects, compared to nuclear staining. A more systematic comparison between autofluorescence images and nuclear staining appears in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Population-wide, regionally resolved exploration of neuroanatomical features</title><p>To automatically collect cytoarchitecture data for each brain, we trained a DNN model to detect and segment the nuclei (low-autofluorescent objects) in all brain regions, including those of the highest density, such as the dentate gyrus (DG). Because of computing constraints, we applied the model systematically to segment a subset of the AMBCA dataset comprising 507 brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> and âMethodsâ). The model performed with an estimated 97% cell detection accuracy on a test set, with a false positive rate of &lt;0.01 (see âMethodsâ) whenever image quality was sufficient (for exclusion criteria of whole brains or certain regions within sections, see âMethodsâ). Using detected cells in each section, we obtained a local estimate of the volumetric cell density (see âMethodsâ), which, combined with the pixel-wise registration of brain regions provided by the AMBA, allowed us to estimate the average cell density per region for each brain. Similarly, we evaluated the per-region volume of each brain by linear interpolation across all sections (see âMethodsâ). The anterior-most olfactory bulb (MOB) and posterior-most cerebellum (CB) were truncated in imaging, which likely led to an underestimate in their quantifications, and slightly higher variance compared to other regions of similar volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>). We further corrected a batch effect in the AMBCA dataset showing a small difference in overall brain volume across experimental batches (see âMethods,â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>). In sum, we simultaneously estimated the 3D cell density (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and volume (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) of each region for each brain (see âMethodsâ).

We compared distributions of volume, cell density, and cell count at the coarsest hierarchical atlas level, that is, across gray matter cell groups in the brains of male C57BL/6J vs. male FVB.CD1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Median cell density was similar for the two strains, with considerably larger variance in FVB.CD1 males. FVB.CD1, however, had a 7.6% larger gray matter volume (GMV) than C57BL/6J. Combining these two features revealed an ~10% increase in the median cell count in FVB.CD1 vs. C57BL/6J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, right panel). These results suggest that (1) there is no simple relationship between volume and density, therefore, both properties should be measured simultaneously; and (2) a large cohort enables detection of relatively small differences.</p><p>To expand on our technical comparison between quantification based on autofluorescence vs. staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we performed nuclear staining (Hoechst 33342) and whole-brain STPT imaging on nine brains of female C57BL/6J mice. We trained a DNN of the same topology using tiles from the resulting Hoechst images, registered with the AMBA coordinates, and repeated our per-region estimates of volume, density, and cell count (see âMethodsâ). As expected, correlation between this in-house dataset and the AMBCA analysis was very high when comparing the volume across regions (Ï = 0.99, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, cell count correlations were also high (Ï = 0.99, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), but median cell count in Hoechst was 65% higher; recapitulating the trend toward false negatives observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> (epifluorescence microscopy). However, agreement in cell density varied by region. The correlations in density were fair across cortical regions of layers 2/3, 4, 5, and 6a (Ï = 0.78, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C1</xref>): they displayed comparable densities between the methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D1</xref>). The correlation value across cortical regions 1 and 6b was similar (Ï = 0.79), yet the error in absolute values was significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C2</xref>), at about twofold higher density using Hoechst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D1</xref>). The correlation across brain stem regions was also lower (Ï = 0.56, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C3</xref>), yet rank order across regions was similar to cortical regions 1 and 6b. Cerebellar regions, which are significantly denser, displayed a twofold density difference (Ï = 0.65, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C4</xref>). This detection bias may therefore stem from several underlying causes; (1) inaccurate registration of border regions (CTX L1 and 6b); (2) physical detection limits of the low-autofluorescent objects compared to stained objects; and (3) region or cell type-inherent differences in autofluorescence, resulting in lower detection of cells in glial-rich (e.g., CTX L1, brainstem), compared to neuron-rich (e.g., other cortex layers) regions.</p><p>To test the power of our model, we explored the densities and nucleus diameter of cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). First, we considered the HPF because imaging-based quantification of its denser regions (pyramidal layers of Ammonâs horn and the granule layer of the dentate gyrus) has been difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attili et al., 2019</xref>) and was achieved only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murakami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seiriki et al., 2017</xref>). Analyzing 195 C57BL/6J male brains, we found that the pyramidal layer of CA1 was denser than that of CA3 and CA2, whereas nucleus size was larger in CA3. In the dentate gyrus, the granule layer had the highest density of all regions, with &gt;6.5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and nuclei were largest in the polymorph layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>, upper panels). In the isocortex, we examined the extent to which the cortical layers across cortical divisions differed in density and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>, lower panels). Layer 1 was consistently underpopulated, having a density of about 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The overall rank order from densest to sparsest was maintained, with layer 4 &gt; layer 6a &gt; layer 5 &gt; layer 2/3 &gt; layer 1, suggesting a similarity in cytoarchitecture between cortical regions. Layer 4 of the primary visual and somatosensory cortices had higher density than did the auditory and visceral cortices. Nucleus diameters showed less distinct distributions between layers, although layer 2/3 and layer 5 tended to have larger nuclei than did layers 4 and 6a.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Density differences between left and right hemispheres</title><p>Brain laterality has been discussed in the literature since Broca and Wernike found language dominance on the left side of the brain. Although evidence for brain laterality in mice is more scarce, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levy et al., 2019</xref> have suggested functional and circuit differences in the auditory cortex. We performed a systematic comparison of the left and right hemispheres seeking differences in region-wise volume and/or cell density. In C57BL/6J (n = 369), we found 229 regions with lateral cell density bias of over 5%, and up to 30%. Both sides showed similar numbers of biased regions in density (left, 100; right, 129, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Neighboring regions in prefrontal cortex ACAv2/3, ACAd2/3, ORBl2/3, and PL/23 were up to 30% denser in the right hemisphere. In addition, a more posterior part of the HPF, the parasubiculum (PAR) also showed a consistent per-brain higher cell density in the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, cortical areas GU2/3, RSPv6a, VISC2/3, and AUDv2/3 showed more than 20% higher density in the left hemisphere. Strikingly, we found consistent density bias in left hemisphere cortical regions, specifically in layers 2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, upper inset). This bias was both most consistent and pronounced in a group of neighboring ventrolateral areas: visceral, gustatory, temporal association, and auditory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), where the latter may be consistent with the Levy et al. findings. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> we show higher density in the right hemisphere visceral cortex layer 2/3, while corresponding layers 4, 5, and 6a were not biased.

Differences between males and females in regional neuroanatomy have been extensively described, including dimorphic volume and cell count in the medial amygdala (MEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morris et al., 2005</xref>) and in the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garcia-Falgueras et al., 2005</xref>). We first compared C57BL/6J males (n = 152) with females (n = 140). Although at the global level (whole-brain gray matter), males and females had similar volume (380 Â± 17 mm<sup>3</sup> and 380 Â± 14 mm<sup>3</sup>, for females and males, respectively), in density (1.97 Â± 0.28 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and 1.97 Â± 0.28 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mm<sup>3</sup> for females and males, respectively) and total numbers of cells (75 Â± 10 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> and 77 Â± 9 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> for females and males, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), certain regions displayed sexual dimorphism in one or more property. We conducted rank-sum testing on each region that passed QC (see âMethodsâ) for sex differences, in volume, density, or count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Most regions were consistent with the overall trend of equal volume, yet MEA and BST, but also the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCO), taenia tecta ventral (TTv), and the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) were &gt;5% larger in males. A handful of regions, for example, ventrolateral orbital area layer 2/3 (ORBvl2/3), displayed the opposite effect and had larger volume in females. ORBvl2/3 was the only region to also display significantly higher density and cell count in females. In contrast, many regions were 5â20% denser in males, which also resulted in higher cell counts.

For example, ORBvl2/3 showed both larger volumes and slightly higher density in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left), resulting in significantly more cells in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The opposite was the case for BST, where males had larger volume yet similar density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, middle). As a third example, we showed the case of AUDv2/3, which displayed no difference in region volume, yet density in the male brains was higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right). In an independent AMBCA cohort of additional 663 males and 166 females, we could robustly replicate our findings regarding region-specific sexual dimorphism: volumes of MEA, BST, and ORBvl2/3 displayed sex differences of consistent effect size and variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1AâE</xref>).</p><p>In sum, the population-wide survey revealed a number of sexually dimorphic areas; Yet, to what extent were region volumes or densities predictors of the individualâs sex? To answer this question, we trained linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. In brief, we randomly selected 2/3 of the C57BL/6J brains (n = 184), where each brain was represented by a 532-dimensional vector of either volume or density across regions, and trained the SVM. We then tested its performance on the remaining 1/3 of brains (n = 97). This process was repeated 100 times and resulted in an average accuracy of 78 and 90% for density and volume, respectively. From this, we identified the regions that had the highest contribution to the separating hyperplane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1F and H</xref>) and trained new classifiers based on these top regions, adding one region at a time. Using volume data, MEA and BST alone performed classification to &gt;78% accuracy. Adding the postpiriform transitional area (TR) and the rostral lateral septal nucleus (LSr), the classifierâs performance saturated to about 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1J</xref> shows the SVM separating line based on four pairs of regions (e.g., BST and LSr) yielding an accuracy of 79â86%. In contrast, the density-based classifier showed only incremental improvements when adding almost any of the top 10 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1I</xref>). Together, these results suggest that although many brain regions show significant differences between males and females both in volume and density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the considerable overlap between the male and female population distributions in each of these regions hampers classification. Apart from MEA and BST, the classifier revealed TR, LSr, MPN, and ORBl2/3 as predictors for sex based on volume, while density-based classification was based on amygdala-related regions (COApl, BMAp) and frontal cortical regions (ILA and ORB).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Strain differences in volume and density</title><p>We next investigated the relation between recorded body weight and GMV.

Briefly, each region is characterized by a vector of 204 components, each representing its density across one brain. 2D embedding aims to preserve the local similarity between regions. The density-based tSNE embedding map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> reveals clear 2D âclusters,â largely consistent with neuroanatomical classification. Cortical regions appear in the upper part of the map (colored green), and cerebellum (yellow), midbrain, and hindbrain in the lower part.

To demonstrate that the tSNE map is indeed based on true variations in region-to-region correlations, we compared density-based and volume-based correlations. First, for each region we identified its 10 most correlated regions based on either density or volume. These correlation values were higher for density-based correlations across almost all regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), supporting the observed density-based âorder.â Second, we selected 10 representative regions across the brain and calculated all their pairwise correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), showing that even for distant regions, density-based correlations remain much higher than volume-based correlations. Thus, similarity in volume across regions is less âpreservedâ brain-wide than similarity in cell density.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We presented an automated, imaging-based, staining-free study of neuroanatomy and cytoarchitecture in the mouse brain. We conducted our measurements on a massive, high-quality dataset of serial two-photon tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oh et al., 2014</xref>), aligned with a well-annotated reference atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This made possible, for the first time, a detailed population-wide analysis of two important neuroanatomical variables simultaneously: cell density and volume, resolved for 532 regions. The data spans an unprecedented cohort of 507 mice of two strains, the inbred C57BL/6J, and the hybrid FVB1.CD-1, each represented by both females and males. Our high-throughput measurements of cell densities were achieved by using a DNN trained to detect low-autofluorescent cell nuclei with high accuracy, even in the most cell-dense regions of the brain.</p><p>The study has several limitations. First, the model is sensitive to the contrast between dark nuclei and autofluorescent surroundings, which can be limited by image quality and tissue composition. In particular, the staining-free approach depends on the presence of intrinsic molecular indicators such as NADH, retinol, or collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zipfel et al., 2003</xref>), which may vary between cell or tissue components, even within the brain. In the hindbrain (pons, medulla), contrast was exceedingly weak, and we expect our quantifications in this region to be 66% of the value estimated by nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Second, AMBA annotations were not always resolved to the most refined level of the atlas hierarchy. For example, density values for the cerebellum appear to be uncharacteristic because the cell-dense granule layer and sparse molecular layer were not distinguished at the deepest level of annotation (e.g., CENT3 included the granular and molecular layers). The same is true for the hippocampus CA1-2-3, where we used cell density-based clustering to distinguish the pyramidal layer (sp) from its surrounding sparse layers (slm, so, sr, see âMethodsâ). Therefore, although the model performed exceedingly well even in these cell-dense regions, the absence of annotations stood occasionally in the way of making biologically meaningful distinctions. Third, regions at the anteriorâposterior edges, that is, olfactory bulb (MOB) and cerebellum (CB), appear partially truncated, and we likely report an underestimate of their parameters. MOB and CB volumes also displayed slightly higher variance than more interior regions with similar volume. Therefore, their population comparisons would appear noisier (although likely not biased), compared to other regions.</p><p>We further attempted to estimate the region-specific accuracy of our cell counting by comparing autofluorescence STPT with brain-wide imaging of nuclear-stained STPT. However, this comparison is technically nontrivial because of the native physical properties of direct staining vs. autofluorescence. For example, stained nuclei located off the focal plane may appear in the image, yet remain undetected by autofluorescence. In addition, tissue composition (e.g., cell types, extracellular matrix) may affect the imaged region. Indeed, in regions rich with non-neuronal cells the error of autofluorescent-based counting was larger compared to nuclear staining. Hence, one may speculate that autofluorescent-based detection is biased for neurons.</p><p>Nevertheless, we provided key statistics that help answer fundamental, recurring questions in neuroanatomy. Although no other study presented simultaneous measurements of volume and cell density, our data correlate well with a wealth of literature in the field. We achieved good region-wise correlation with full 3D volumetric cell counts by expansion microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murakami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

And although the current mouse brain dataset is unique in its scale, we foresee the application of full-brain, staining-free STPT and DNN-led neuroanatomical characterization could benefit the study of disease models, or be applied to other species for comparative neurobiology, as has been done in dissociation-based studies that revealed mammalian brain scaling rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herculano-Houzel and Lent, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>By measuring the largest cohort to date, we provided partial support for the notion that this extreme range in the literature may not stem from variation in strain or sex, but rather from individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murakami et al., 2018</xref>). The median cell counts between sexes and strains differed no more than 13% overall, or ~40% for the most deviant individual structures (MOB and CENT2), while the standard deviation across individuals was ~10 million cells (for C57BL/6J male alone).

For example, our cohort provides the first brain-wide survey of cell architecture laterality, with numerous regions showing density bias to the right or left hemisphere; and some volume bias in favor of the right hemisphere. We describe a remarkable phenomenon of ventrolateral cortical areas increasing cell density in left hemisphere layer 2/3, but no other layers, that may be interesting to follow up functionally.</p><p>We further validated and expanded on the existing literature describing examples of regions that show sex- or strain-based differences. Sexual dimorphism of brain regions was significant, as exemplified by the success of our SVM-classifier, yet the ability to separate males from females was limited due to populationâs interindividual differences. For instance, medial amygdala and bed nuclei of the stria terminalis were both larger and denser in males, but to a lesser extent than reported in smaller studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cooke et al., 2007</xref>) and to a similar extent to what was reported in MRI-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, in females, several prefrontal cortex structures were larger (e.g., ORBvl2/3), which resulted in higher cell counts. We found no evidence of this phenomenon in the literature on mice, but an MRI population study of 2838 human individuals found higher GMV in prefrontal areas in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lotze et al., 2019</xref>). Between the strains, we found considerable differences in the olfactory system, which was larger and denser in C57BL/6J, and in the cerebellum, which was larger in FVB.CD-1. Finally, we provide an accessible, web-based platform for open exploration of the data. The web application allows researchers to freely compute distributions of any measured neuroanatomical features, for any brain region, and across the entire population or specific subsets. This exploratory resource can be of great use for experimental design and lead to more accurate brain modeling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data</title><p>The AMBCA dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oh et al., 2014</xref>) consists of 2992 brains, of which we processed 507 and eventually used 378 in our analysis (the strain and sex breakdown of the brains are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The common denominator of these regions was the presence of a dense and a sparse region that were not separated by the atlas (e.g., the pyramidal and stratum regions of CA1, CA2, and CA3). To provide the coordinates of these subregions, we defined a local measure of density referred to as cell âcoverageâ and used it to cluster the relevant cells into a dense and a sparse region. Briefly, in a window of 64 Ã64 pixels centered around each cell we counted the number of pixels that belong to cells, thus assigning a local âcoverageâ measure (the median cell area was 80 pixels, much smaller than the window around it). We then detected the subregions by clustering the cells according to their âcoverageâ values. For example, we took the âcoverageâ values of all CA1 cells and used K-means clustering to split them into two clusters of high and low âcoverageâ values.

In order to correct this effect, we multiplied each brain volume by a batch-specific factor such that the batch median volume 8 will be 380 mm<sup>3</sup>. These factors were 1.064, 1.032, and 1.008 for batches 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

While I really appreciate their effort and conclusions to resolve some of the fundamental questions in brain science, such as are cell numbers different between males vs females, these data seem rather descriptive rather than mechanistic.

As this manuscript stands, this type of data might find a better outlet in a more brain anatomy-focused journal.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1. I find the figures can be improved.</p><p>- Some of the plots have legends that are illegible (e.g., Figure 1 F, Figure 2 A,B,F, Figure 3 B,C, Figure 4B,C,D,E).</p><p>2. Figure 3: it looks like there are many areas that are sexually dimorphic in either volume or/and density, but in the main text only a handful of areas were featured. Is there a specific trend as to which areas tend to be subject to sex-specific regulation? For example, can authors roughly align this dataset with Allen Brain Atlas to find correlations between the expression of gonadal steroid hormone receptors and the cell numbers?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In Figure S1B (esp. regions III and IV) there seems to be a number of false positive detections, i.e. detections which do not overlap with DAPI. The authors state say that they find an 'overlap of nearly 100% with nuclear staining (DAPI)', but they should quantify specificity and selectivity based on their existing data here.</p><p>2. Figure 1E: What is the number of samples here? It would be better to plot these values as mean +/- SEM.</p><p>3. Figure 1B, C: scale bars missing.</p><p>4. In Figure 1D: the acronyms should be defined in the legend.</p><p>5. Figure 3A and Figure 5B could be removed in my opinion since it does not add any relevant information.</p><p>6. Figure 3D: it is unclear why these particular areas were selected.</p><p>7. Figure 4 is very hard to understand and extremely dense.</p><p>8. Figure 5C: why are AAA and SSs2/3 (highlighted in D, E) not shown in this plot?</p><p>9. The two selected areas in Figure 5D, and E are not present in Figure 5C.</p><p>10. Several figure panels are overplotted to such a degree that it is impossible to decipher brain area acronyms (e.g. Figure 2A, 3C). It might be helpful to highlight the relevant ones mentioned in the text. In Figure 3C, many markers of statistical significance are very hard to distinguish.</p><p>11. On several figure axes, characters do not seem to render (e.g. Âµ): Figure 1C, Figure 3C, Figure S2C, etc.</p><p>12. Figure S1A would benefit from a quantitative legend for the heatmap and S1B from a y-axis.</p><p>13. Figure S2: This figure is confusing since the brain sections on the left do not match the ones displayed on the right. Also, panel A needs a quantitative heatmap. In panels B and C, y axes. are missing. In panels B and C, layer 4 (L4) is missing from the first three cortex distributions.</p><p>14. The Allen Brain Atlas only contains part of the olfactory bulb and part of the cerebellum. As a result, (1) registration accuracy might be lower in these regions, and (2) the cell counts reported here are likely to underestimate the actual numbers. I think this should be more prominently discussed.</p><p>15. For cell numbers, the authors find a striking standard deviation between individual males of ~10 million cells. It would be helpful to report this number for females, too.</p><p>16. An open question is â of course â what fraction of cells are in fact neurons. Have the authors explored whether any features of the detected low autofluorescence objects have distributions that match the distributions of neurons vs glia in areas where their rel. numbers are known?</p><p>17. The authors find that for 'some regions, cell count does not scale simply or linearly with volume' (line 482). Have they explored non-linear models to fit these data?</p><p>18. In line 149, it should be made clearer what 'levels 6-8 of the region hierarchy' refers to.</p><p>19. The abstract states: 'We applied our pipeline to 537 brains [â¦]' but this is slightly misleading since 399 brains were actually part of the analysis according to the methods section.</p><p>20. Line 290: what does &quot;grey&quot; refer to here?</p><p>21. Line 311: the statement 'where most brain regions fell in quadrant IV of the volume-density plane' is somewhat cryptic.</p><p>22. Line 394: missing word? Grey matter.</p><p>23. Line 589: references should be in ascending order here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82376.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In your revision, as you address the Reviewers' points, please consider these essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please clarify what and why some data is discarded from the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We either discarded whole brains or specific regions (across all brains). In summary, 26% of the brains were discarded, mostly due to poor imaging conditions that would have skewed our quantifications. In addition, 50% of the regions were discarded from our analysis due, e.g., to their small volume (we note that these regions still appear in our online tool). We elaborate on this issue in our response to a specific question by Reviewer #1, and we have accordingly revised the manuscriptâs Methods section: âDiscarding whole brains or particular regions of lower technical qualityâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Add some validation data of the main findings by using classical neuroanatomical staining (H&amp;A or immunostaining) of independent mouse brains to quantify volume, cell number, and density in brain regions where sex differences or strain differences were identified.</p></disp-quote><p>In our initial Supplemental Figure 1 (in current version Figure 1âfigure supplement 1) we provide some technical validation of the method, by showing nuclear staining, and autofluorescence side-by-side, using epifluorescence microscopy. As rightfully pointed out by Reviewer 3, in our revision, we now report appropriate statistical measures for this analysis (true positives, false positives, false negatives).</p><p>In addition, we performed the following two sets of validations â</p><p>(i) Technical validation of our staining-free quantification approach, by nuclear staining. We performed nuclear staining (Hoechst 33342) followed by STPT imaging of 9 female brains and trained a new deep neural network (DNN) to segment the resulting images (STPT was performed by TissueVision, using similar technology applied by AMBCA). Unfortunately, in STPT it is not technically possible to analyze nuclear staining and autofluorescence in the very same tissue. Therefore, we compared per-region density, cell count and volume of the nuclei-stained validation brains to our original DNN-based analysis of AMBCA brains. We show a correlation coefficient &gt;0.99 for per-region cell count in AMBCA autofluorescence and our nuclear staining (and a similar correlation coefficient for volume). However, the number of cells in nuclear staining over the whole brain is 56% larger than in autofluorescence. Although we have no technically feasible way to prove this, one likely explanation for this discrepancy is the nature of the detected signals; as âpositiveâ (Hoechst fluorophore) or autofluorescence. Further, discrepancies between the two methods were notably higher in glial-rich tissues (e.g., CTX L1, midbrain, brainstem) â thus one may speculate that low-autofluorescent object counts may be biased to detect neurons, rather than glia.</p><p>(ii) Independent validation of the biological findings. To validate region-specific sex differences in volume, we processed an additional independent cohort of 829 C57BL/6J brains (663 males and 166 females) from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Project. We show, e.g., that sexual dimorphism in MEA, BST and ORBvl2/3 is recapitulated (see Results section âPopulation-wide, regionally resolved exploration of neuroanatomical featuresâ and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be helpful to include figures that summarize the overall main findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a graphical abstract as new Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please include and discuss previous literature, which reports the native fluorescence described by Webb's group.</p></disp-quote><p>We now specifically refer to Webbâs work in the first section of the Results âAutofluorescence of STPT images displays cell nucleiâ and the Discussion, as described in our response to Reviewer #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I suggest submitting the revised article as a &quot;tools and resources&quot; article.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and are happy to submit the revised version as a âtools and resourceâ article.</p><p>We would like to also mention that during the revision we detected a batch effect in the AMBCA experiments, affecting the volume in their first batch of experiments. This batch which included mostly males had, for some reason, lower overall volume. We emphasize that (1) the total number of cells did not show any batch effect; (2) We normalized the volume and repeated the analysis. Results remained mostly unchanged, except for our previous finding regarding the overall larger volume of BL6 females.</p><p>In addition, the Reviewers mentioned graphics issues in many of the figures. We agree with these comments. Many panels were overplotted to a degree that region acronyms were hard to decipher. We went over all panels, deleted region acronyms when overlaying other region names, added arrows or lines pointing to regions that are mentioned in the text, etc. We therefore hope that all panels are now clearer. For completeness, we provide a supplementary table that include data of relevant panels. We hope this will bridge most of the graphical issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My concerns largely focus on:</p><p>1) The native fluorescence and second harmonic generation from multiphoton illumination can accurately be used to quantify cell nuclei because this is not what the signal is generated from.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope our reply in the Public Review section, and our validation experiments included in the revised manuscript sufficiently addressed the Reviewerâs concern on the technical validity of our approach. We hope we also clarified any doubts on correspondence of our data to Murakamiâs results, by reporting the statistical measures the Reviewer asked for.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should validate their findings in an independent dataset generated with adequate labeling methods (e.g. DAPI, NeuN, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed technical validation of our results â with full brain SPTP imaging of 9 Hoechst-stained brains, and compared the results to AMBCA autofluorescence. We added a relevant passage, and Figure 2âfigure supplement 2; see below. As expected, autofluorescence-based cell counting performed better in the e.g., isocortex, compared to more dark regions in the hindbrain.</p><p>Text added to Results section âPopulation-wide, regionally-resolved exploration of neuroanatomical featuresâ:</p><p>âTo expand on our technical comparison between quantification based on autofluorescence vs. staining (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1), we performed nuclear staining (Hoechst 33342) and whole-brain STPT imaging on nine brains of female C57BL/6J mice. We trained a DNN of the same topology using tiles from the resulting Hoechst images, registered with the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas coordinates, and repeated our per-region estimates of volume, density, and cell count (see Methods). As expected, correlation between this in-house dataset, and the AMBCA analysis was very high when comparing the volume across regions (r = 0.99, Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A). In addition, cell count correlations were also high (r = 0.99, Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B), but median cell count in Hoechst was 65% higher; recapitulating the trend toward false negatives observed in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 (epifluorescence microscopy). However, agreement in cell density varied by region. The correlations in density were fair across cortical regions of layers 2/3, 4, 5 and 6a (r = 0.78, Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C1): they displayed comparable densities between the methods (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D1). The correlation value across cortical regions 1 and 6b was similar (r = 0.79), yet the error in absolute values was significantly higher (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C2), at about 2-fold higher density using Hoechst (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D1). The correlation across brain stem regions was also lower (r = 0.56, Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C3), yet rank order across regions was similar to cortical regions 1 and 6b. Cerebellar regions, which are significantly denser, displayed a 2-fold density difference (r = 0.65, Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C4). This detection bias may therefore stem from several underlying causes; (1) inaccurate registration of border regions (CTX L1 and 6b), (2) physical detection limits of the low-autofluorescent objects compared to stained objects, and (3) region-, or cell type-inherent differences in autofluorescence, resulting in lower detection of cells in glial-rich (e.g., CTX L1, brainstem), compared to neuron-rich (e.g., other cortex layers) regions.â</p><p>We entirely agree that this validation was necessary for confidence in our findings. We also hope the Reviewer appreciates the time and financial efforts that were required to perform this validation, including the establishment of a whole-brain Hoechst staining protocol, STPT imaging abroad, and training an entirely new DNN for the analysis of this dataset.</p><p>Since the analyses we present mostly focus on comparisons across brains using a large, unique, consistent cohort, systematic errors have minor effects on the main findings.</p><p>Therefore, in light of the scope of our study, we hope the Reviewer also finds the combination of our technical (experimental) validation, and validation of our central findings on an independent AMBCA cohort â including power analysis â both sufficient to our conclusions, and inviting for further exploration in the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The weakness of this manuscript is the overall message.

We found a tendency of amygdala-related regions to have larger volume or be denser in males, while regions of the prefrontal cortex (mainly in the ORB) were found to be larger and denser in females. We have added the following sentence to the Abstract.</p><p>We also checked whether gonadal receptor genes have higher expression in regions found to be sexually dimorphic. We used a voxel-based expression dataset that is based on quantifications of the Allen mouse brain ISH atlas. To the best of our knowledge these data are based on P56 males only (although some ISH are available for females their quality was not sufficient).</p><p>We used the Allen Mouse Brain ISH Atlas API, that contains P56 males only (http://mouse.brain-map.org), and tested the following genes : <italic>Ghr, Ghrhr, Pgr, Fshr, Ar, Esr1, Esr2, Lhcgr, Ghsr, Gnrhr, Thra, Thrb, Lepr</italic> and <italic>Prlr</italic>. Unfortunately, only five of these genes had sufficiently high ISH data quality. We calculated their average expression per region and present it in the heatmap below. For example, prolactin receptor (<italic>Prlr</italic>) is highly expressed in the hypothalamus and amygdala. Interestingly, Thyroid Hormone Receptor subunits (<italic>Trha, Trhb</italic>) have higher expression in frontal cortical areas. While this can be considered an interesting anecdote, we do not feel that this analysis is sufficiently deep or conclusive to claim that gonadal hormone receptors drive sexual dimorphism in volume or cell density, and did not include this analysis in the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Heatmap of ISH data for five genes across brain regions .</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82376-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

On the other hand, 26%-45% of DAPI-detected nuclei were not observed in the autofluorescent images (false negatives), pointing to an underestimate of cell counts based on low-autofluorescence objects, compared to nuclear staining. A more systematic comparison between autofluorescence images and nuclear staining appears in the next section.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1E: What is the number of samples here? It would be better to plot these values as mean +/- SEM.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the number of samples (195).

Figure 3D: it is unclear why these particular areas were selected.</p></disp-quote><p>We selected examples of regions where malesâ volume was either larger or smaller than in females, while density was either the same (BST) or also different (ORBvl2/3). We also show an example of insignificant volume differences yet a significant difference in density is observed (AUDv2/3). We now justified their presentation in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 4 is very hard to understand and extremely dense.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Figure 4 (now Figure 5) is hard to understand both because it contains several comparisons (across strains and across sex; showing volume and density), and also due to graphics issues. We have tried to ease the graphical burden by (a) increasing the size of problematic panels; and (b) deleting region acronyms when unreadable.</p><p>We also provide a Source data file containing all underlying data. We understand that this is far from ideal, but we believe the combination of a âclearerâ figure that allows zooming in, and a file that contains the same data would provide readers adequate means of exploring the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Several figure panels are overplotted to such a degree that it is impossible to decipher brain area acronyms (e.g. Figure 2A, 3C). It might be helpful to highlight the relevant ones mentioned in the text. In Figure 3C, many markers of statistical significance are very hard to distinguish.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we hope our changes have improved readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

Figure S1A would benefit from a quantitative legend for the heatmap and S1B from a y-axis.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the Reviewer referred to Figure S2 (in current version Figure 2âfigure supplement 3).

Figure S2: This figure is confusing since the brain sections on the left do not match the ones displayed on the right. Also, panel A needs a quantitative heatmap. In panels B and C, y axes. are missing. In panels B and C, layer 4 (L4) is missing from the first three cortex distributions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that brain sections in panel A do not match those in panels B and C. We did not mean to create a linkage between panels A and B+C. We have moved panel A above panel B and C, which we believe creates the appropriate separation and breaks the unwanted linkage. Regarding panel A, we added a quantitative legend. Panel B-C displays a (probability) distribution and therefore y-axis is omitted. As for L4, while visual and somatosensory cortices contain L4, in motor and orbital cortices L4 is lacking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. The Allen Brain Atlas only contains part of the olfactory bulb and part of the cerebellum. As a result, (1) registration accuracy might be lower in these regions, and (2) the cell counts reported here are likely to underestimate the actual numbers. I think this should be more prominently discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this. We agree that the STPT image data analyzed do not cover the whole olfactory bulb and cerebellum, and their cell counts may be lower. We therefore explored whether olfactory bulb and cerebellum data is consistent across brains, and can be fairly included in our systematic analysis. Indeed, MOB and CB data were slightly ânoisierâ than other regions, as demonstrated by how variance in volume in these regions is somewhat higher compared to more interior regions with similar volumes (see figure below; these panels were also added to Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D-E). We now include the following clarification in the Results section âPopulation-wide, regionally-resolved exploration of neuroanatomical featuresâ, and added a statement to the Discussion:</p><p>Results:</p><p>âThe anterior-most olfactory bulb (MOB) and posterior-most cerebellum (CB) were truncated in imaging, which likely led to an underestimate in their quantifications, and slightly higher variance compared to other regions of similar volume (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D-E). â</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>âThe study has several limitations. (â¦) Third, regions at the anterior-posterior edges, i.e., olfactory bulb (MOB) and cerebellum (CB), appear partially truncated, and we likely report an underestimate of their parameters. MOB and CB volumes also displayed slightly higher variance than more interior regions with similar volume. Therefore, their population comparisons would appear noisier (although likely not biased), compared to other regions.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. For cell numbers, the authors find a striking standard deviation between individual males of ~10 million cells. It would be helpful to report this number for females, too.</p></disp-quote><p>Cell count (in millions) for males is 75Â±10, and for females is 77Â±9. We added the STD to Figure 4A for both males and females. Source data file table details the median and STD for volume, density and count per region for males and female, for both C57BL/6J and FVB.CD1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. An open question is â of course â what fraction of cells are in fact neurons. Have the authors explored whether any features of the detected low autofluorescence objects have distributions that match the distributions of neurons vs glia in areas where their rel. numbers are known?</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree, and thank the Reviewer for this question, yet we cannot currently substantiate any of our speculations, as we outlined in the Public Review. The question of the type of cells that are âenrichedâ in STPT remains to be answered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. The authors find that for 'some regions, cell count does not scale simply or linearly with volume' (line 482). Have they explored non-linear models to fit these data?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not explored fitting the data by non-linear models. Our statement was âsofterâ and more âqualitativeâ, trying to state that regions are not scaled in a uniform manner. Hence, it might be that regions scale linearly, yet each has its own scale factor.
