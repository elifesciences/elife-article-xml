However, we lack theory to understand how functional relationships at the molecular level translate into epistasis at the level of whole-organism phenotypes, such as fitness. Here, I derive two rules for how epistasis between mutations with small effects propagates from lower- to higher-level phenotypes in a hierarchical metabolic network with first-order kinetics and how such epistasis depends on topology. Most importantly, weak epistasis at a lower level may be distorted as it propagates to higher levels. Computational analyses show that epistasis in more realistic models likely follows similar, albeit more complex, patterns. These results suggest that pairwise inter-gene epistasis should be common, and it should generically depend on the genetic background and environment. Furthermore, the epistasis coefficients measured for high-level phenotypes may not be sufficient to fully infer the underlying functional relationships.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolic control analysis</kwd><kwd>genetic interactions</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award at Scientific Interface (1010719.01)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kryazhimskiy</surname><given-names>Sergey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

The blueprint for these networks is encoded in the genome. Mutations alter the genome. Some of them, once decoded by the cell, perturb cellular networks and thereby change the phenotypes important for life. Understanding how mutations affect the function of cellular networks is key to solving many practical and fundamental problems, such as finding mechanistic causes of genetic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fang et al., 2019</xref>), deciphering the architecture of complex traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Zuk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mackay, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wei et al., 2014</xref>), building artificial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hutchison et al., 2016</xref>), explaining past, and predicting future evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wiser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Visser and Krug, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harms and Thornton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sailer and Harms, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sohail et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, mutations can help us learn how cellular networks are organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Phillips, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">van Opijnen and Camilli, 2013</xref>).</p><p>To infer the wiring diagram of a cellular network that produces a certain phenotype, one approach in genetics is to measure the pairwise and higher-order genetic interactions (or ‘epistasis’) between mutations that perturb it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Phillips, 2008</xref>). Much effort has been devoted in the past 20 years to a systematic collection of such genetic interaction data for several model organisms and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kelley and Ideker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lehner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jasnos and Korona, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">St Onge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Typas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Roguev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Szappanos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Roguev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">van Leeuwen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Skwark et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Heigwer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Horlbeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Norman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuzmin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">New and Lehner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Celaj et al., 2020</xref>). This approach is particulary powerful when the phenotypic effect of one mutation changes qualitatively depending on the presence or absence of a second mutation in another gene, for example when a mutation has no effect on the phenotype in the wildtype background, but abolishes the phenotype when introduced together with another mutation, such as synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tong et al., 2001</xref>). Such qualitative genetic interactions can often be directly interpreted in terms of a functional relationship between gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davierwala et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Phillips, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Most pairs of mutations do not exhibit qualitative genetic interactions. Instead, the phenotypic effect of a mutation may change measurably but not qualitatively depending on the presence or absence of other mutations in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>). The genetic interactions can in this case be quantified with one of several metrics that are termed ‘epistasis coefficients’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wagner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hansen and Wagner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wagner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Poelwijk et al., 2016</xref>). Although some rules have been proposed for interpreting epistasis coefficients, in particular, their sign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dixon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lehner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baryshnikova et al., 2013</xref>), the validity, and robustness of these rules are unknown because there is no theory for how functional relationships translate into measurable epistasis coefficients in any system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lehner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Domingo et al., 2019</xref>). To avoid this major difficulty, most large-scale empirical studies focus on correlations between epistasis coefficients rather than on their actual values (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Velenich and Gore, 2013</xref>, for a notable exception). Genes with highly correlated epistasis profiles are then interpreted as being functionally related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Segrè et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Horlbeck et al., 2018</xref>). Although this approach successfully groups genes into protein complexes and larger functional modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Michaut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellay et al., 2011</xref>), it does not reveal the functional relationships themselves. As a result, many if not most, genetic interactions between genes and modules still await their biological interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While geneticists measure epistasis to learn the architecture of biological networks, evolutionary biologists face the reverse problem: they need to know how the genetic architecture constrains epistasis at the level of fitness. Epistasis determines the structure of fitness landscapes on which populations evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fragata et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding it would bear on many important evolutionary questions, such as why so many organisms reproduce sexually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kondrashov, 2018</xref>), how novel phenotypes evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Natarajan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harms and Thornton, 2014</xref>), how predictable evolution is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tenaillon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wiser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014</xref>), etc. So far, evolutionary biologists have relied primarily on abstract models of fitness landscapes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Orr, 2005</xref>, for a review), rather than those firmly grounded in organismal biochemistry and physiology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dykhuizen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Das et al., 2020</xref>). For example, Fisher’s geometric model—one of the most widely used fitness landscape models—is explicitly devoid of the physiological and biochemical details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fisher, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Tenaillon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Martin, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A theory of epistasis must address two challenges. First, it must specify how the architecture of a biological network constrains epistasis. Such knowledge is important not only for evolutionary questions, but also for the inference problem in genetics. Consider a biological network module that produces a phenotype of interest but whose internal structure is unknown. By genetically perturbing all genes within the module and measuring the phenotype in all single, double and possibly some higher-order mutants, we can obtain the matrix of epistasis coefficients. In principle, we can then fit a network topology and parameters to these data. However, without knowing what information about the network is contained in the matrix in the first place, we cannot be sure whether the inferred topology and parameters are close to their true values or represent one of many possible solutions consistent with the data.</p><p>The second challenge is that epistasis may arise at a different level of biological organization than where it is measured by the experimentalist or by natural selection. For example, geneticists are often interested in understanding the structures of specific regulatory or metabolic network modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>). However, measuring the peformance of a module directly is often experimentally difficult or impossible. Then epistasis is measured for an experimentally accessible ‘high-level’ phenotype, such as fitness, which depends on the performance of the focal ‘lower-level’ module, but also on other unrelated modules. However, if we do not know how epistasis that originally emerged in one module maps onto epistasis that is measured, it is unclear what we can infer about module’s internal structure.</p><p>Evolutionary biologists encounter a related problem when they wish to learn the evolutionary history of a protein or a larger cellular module. To do so, they would in principle need to know how different mutations in this module affected fitness of the whole organism in its past environment. But such information is rarely available. Instead, it is sometimes possible to reconstruct past mutations and measure their biochemical effects in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lunzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Natarajan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sarkisyan et al., 2016</xref>). When interesting patterns of epistasis are identified at the biochemical level, it is usually assumed that the same patterns manifested themselved at the level of fitness and drove module’s evolution. However, this is not obvious. If interactions with other modules distort epistasis as it propagates from the biochemical level to the level of fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Snitkin and Segrè, 2011</xref>), our ability to infer past evolutionary history from in vitro biochemical measurements could be diminished. Therefore, the second challenge that a theory of epistasis must address is how epistasis propagates from lower-level phenotypes to higher-level phenotypes.</p><p>There is a large body of theoretical and computational literature on epistasis. As early as 1934, Sewall Wright realized that epistasis naturally emerges in molecular networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Wright, 1934</xref>). This was later explicitly demonstrated in many mathematical and computational models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kacser and Burns, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keightley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Szathmáry, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gibson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Keightley, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wagner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Omholt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Peccoud et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gjuvsland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gertz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fiévet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pumir and Shraiman, 2011</xref>). Metabolic control analysis became one of the most successful and general frameworks for understanding epistasis between metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kacser and Burns, 1973</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dean et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dykhuizen et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dean, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lunzer et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">MacLean, 2010</xref> used it to interpret the empirically measured fitness effects of mutations and their interactions in terms of the metabolic relationships between the products of mutated genes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kacser and Burns, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hartl et al., 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keightley, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Keightley, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagheri-Chaichian et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagheri and Wagner, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fiévet et al., 2010</xref> explored the implications of epistasis in metabolism for genetic variation in populations, their response to selection, long-term evolutionary dynamics and outcomes, such as the evolution of dominance. However, most studies analyzed only the linear metabolic pathway (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keightley, 1989</xref>) and assumed that fitness equals flux through the pathway (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Szathmáry, 1993</xref>), thereby bypassing the problem of epistasis propagation.</p><p>There have been few attempts to theoretically relate the molecular architecture of an organism to the types of epistasis that would arise for its high-level phenotypes, such as fitness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Segrè et al., 2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">He et al., 2010</xref> used flux balance analysis (FBA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Orth et al., 2010</xref>) to compute genome-wide distributions of epistasis coefficients in metabolic models of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and arrived at starkly discordant conclusions. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alzoubi et al., 2019</xref> showed that FBA is generally poor in predicting experimentally measured genetic interactions, suggesting that it might be difficult to understand the emergence and propagation of epistasis by relying exclusively on genome-scale computational models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sanjuán and Nebot, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Macía et al., 2012</xref> modeled various abstract metabolic and regulatory networks and found a possible link between epistasis and network complexity. The work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiu et al., 2012</xref> is a more systematic attempt to develop a general theory of epistasis. They established a fundamental connection between epistasis and the curvature of the function that maps lower-level phenotypes onto a higher-level phenotype. However, further progress has been so far hindered by uncertainty in what types of functions map phenotypes onto one another in real biological systems. Previous studies made various idiosyncratic choices with respect to this mapping, leaving us without a clear guidance as to the conditions or systems where they are expected to hold.</p><p>To overcome this problem, here I consider a whole class of hierarchical metabolic networks and obtain the family of all functions that determine how the effective activity of a larger metabolic module can depend on the activities of smaller constituent modules. There are several advantages to this approach. First, it leads to an intuitive understanding of how the structure of the network influences epistasis emergence and propagation. Second, my approach is based on basic biochemical principles, so it should be relevant for many phenotypes. For example, epistasis is often measured at the level of growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jasnos and Korona, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">St Onge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>), and metabolism fuels growth. Moreover, metabolic genes occupy a large fraction of most genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Orth et al., 2011</xref>) and the general organization of metabolism is conserved throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Csete and Doyle, 2004</xref>). Thus, by understanding genetic interactions between metabolic genes, we will gain an understanding of a large fraction of all genetic interactions.</p><p>In my model, I consider a hierarchical network with first-order kinetics but arbitrary topology, and ask two questions related to the two challenges mentioned above. (1) How does an epistasis coefficient that arose at some level of the metabolic hierarchy propagate to higher levels of the hierarchy? (2) How does the network topology constrain the value of an epistasis coefficient between two mutations that affect different enzymes in this network? I obtain answers to these questions analytically in the limiting case when the effects of mutations are vanishingly small. I then computationally probe the validity of the conclusions outside of the domain where they are expected to hold.</p><p>My model is not intended to generate predictions of epistasis for any specific organism. Instead, its main purpose is to provide a baseline expectation for how epistasis that emerges at lower-level phenotypes manifests itself at higher-level whole-organism phenotypes, such as fitness, and what kind of information may be gained from measurements of such higher-level epistasis. One possible outcome of this analysis is that there may be fundamental limitations to what an epistasis measurement at one level of biological organization can tell us about epistasis at another level. On the other hand, if it turns out that there is a general correspondence between epistasis coefficients at different levels in this simple model, then it may be worth developing more sophisticated and general models on which inference from data can be based.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Model</title><sec id="s1-1-1"><title>Hierarchical metabolic network</title><p>Consider a set of metabolites <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">{</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">…</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with concentrations <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">…</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> which can be interconverted by reversible first-order biochemical reactions.

The assumption that modules only have two I/O metabolites is not essential. However, mathematical calculations become unwieldy when the number of I/O metabolites increases. Moreover, modules with just two I/O metabolites already capture two most salient features of metabolism: its directionality, and its complex branched topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Csete and Doyle, 2004</xref>). Such modules are a natural generalization of the linear metabolic pathway which has been extensively studied in the previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kacser and Burns, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Szathmáry, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagheri-Chaichian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">MacLean, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Modules have two important properties. First, for any given concentrations of the two I/O metabolites, all internal metabolites in the module can achieve a unique steady state which depends only on concentrations of these I/O metabolites but not on the concentrations of any other metabolites in the network (see Proposition 1 in Materials and methods). Now consider a module μ whose I/O metabolites are (without loss of generality) labeled 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The second property is that, at steady state, the flux through this module is <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf55"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mn>12</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>is the effective reaction rate constant of module μ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf56"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> depends only on the rate matrix <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf57"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, but not on any other rate constants (see Corollary 2 in Materials and methods), and it can be recursively computed for any module, as described in Materials and methods. In other words, metabolic network <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf58"><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">𝒩</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> can be coarse-grained by replacing module μ at steady state with a single first-order biochemical reaction with rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf59"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. Importantly, such coarse-graining does not alter the dynamics of any metabolites outside of module μ (see Proposition 1 in Materials and methods). This statement is the biochemical analog of the star-mesh transformation (and its generalization, Kron reduction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rao et al., 2014</xref>) well known in the theory of electric circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Versfeld, 1970</xref>). The biological interpretation of these properties is that a module is somewhat isolated from the rest of the metabolic network. And vice versa, the larger network (i.e. the cell) ‘cares’ only about the total rate at which the I/O metabolites are interconverted by the module but ‘does not care’ about the details of how this conversion is enzymatically implemented. In this sense, the effective rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> quantifies the function of module μ (a macroscopic parameter) while the rates <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf61"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> describe the specific biochemical implementation of the module (microscopic parameters).</p><p>The effective rate constant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf62"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> of module μ depends on the entire rate matrix <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf63"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. In general, a single mutation may perturb several rate constants within a module, so that the entire shape of the function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf64"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> may be important. Here, I focus on a special case when each mutation perturbs one reaction (real or effective) within a module, while all others remain constant. To examine epistasis between mutations, I will also consider two different mutations that perturb two separate reactions within a module. In these special cases, we do not need to know the entire function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf65"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

And conversely, if strong positive epistasis is detected at any phenotypic level, the affected reactions cannot be strictly parallel.

This was also true for strictly serial reactions, as long as both mutations had positive effects. When the affected reaction were strictly serial and at least one of the mutations had a negative effect, the epistasis coefficient was always positive, but in some cases it was less than 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), in disagreement with Theorem 2. This indicates that when the effects of mutations are not infinitesimal, even mutations that affect strictly serial reactions can potentially produce negative epistasis for higher-level phenotypes.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that both Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 extend reasonably well, but not perfectly, to mutations with finite effect sizes. The domains of validity of both theorems appear to depend on the sign of mutational effects. The way in which the theorems break down as their assumptions are violated appears to be stereotypical: when the mutational effects increase, more types of mutations produce weak epistasis, and the bias toward negative epistasis increases during propagation from lower to higher levels of the metabolic hierarchy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Beyond first-order kinetics: epistasis in a kinetic model of glycolysis</title><p>The results of previous sections revealed a relationship between network topology and the ensuing epistasis coefficients in an analytically tractable model. However, the assumptions of this model are most certainly violated in many realistic situations. It is therefore important to know whether the same or similar rules of epistasis emergence and propagation hold beyond the scope of this model.

First, in a non-linear model, modules are no longer fully characterized by their effective rate constants, even at steady state. Instead, each module is described by the flux between its I/O metabolites which non-linearly depends on the concentrations of these metabolites. Consequently, the effects of mutations and epistasis coefficients also become functions of the I/O metabolite concentrations. An epistasis coefficient at the level of module ν can still be evaluated according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>, with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf230"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> now representing the flux through module ν evaluated at a particular concentration of the I/O metabolites. For simplicity, I computationally find the steady state of the full glycolysis network and evaluate the epistasis coefficients only at this steady state, that is, for each module, I keep the concentrations of the I/O metabolites fixed at their steady-state values for the full network (see Materials and methods for details).</p><p>The second complication is that some control coefficients are so small that they fall below the threshold of numerical precision. Perturbing such reactions has no detectable effect on flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the analysis that follows, I ignore such reactions because the epistasis coefficient defined by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref> can only be computed for mutations with non-zero effects on flux. In addition, the control coefficients of some reactions are negative, which implies that an increase in the rate of such reaction decreases the flux through the module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). I also ignore such reactions because there is no analog for them in the analytical theory presented above. After excluding seven reactions for these reasons, I examine epistasis in 55 pairs of mutations that affect the remaining 11 reactions.</p><p>The glycolysis network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) can be naturally partitioned into four modules which I name ‘LG’ (lower glycolysis), ‘UGPP’ (upper glycolysis and pentose phosphate), ‘GPP’ (glycolysis and pentose phosophate), and ‘FULL’. Modules LG and UGPP are non-overlappng and both of them are nested in module GPP which in turn is nested in the FULL module. Thus, at least for some reaction pairs it is possible to calculate epistasis coefficients at three levels of metabolic hierarchy. There are three such pairs, and the results for them are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. Epistasis for the remaining pairs of reactions can be evaluated only at one or two levels of the hierarchy because these reactions belong to different modules at the lowest levels or because their individual effects are too small. The results for all reaction pairs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>The strongest qualitative prediction of the analytical theory described above is that negative epistasis for a lower-level phenotype cannot turn into positive epistasis for a higher-level phenotype, while the converse is possible. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> show that the data are consistent with this prediction. Another prediction is that epistasis between strictly parallel reactions should be negative. There is only one pair of reactions that are strictly parallel, those catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (PGI) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGDH), and indeed the epistasis coefficients between mutations affecting these reactions are negative at all levels of the hierarchy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, the analytical theory predicts that mutations affecting strictly serial reactions should exhibit strong positive epistasis. There are 36 reaction pairs that are strictly serial. Epistasis is positive between mutations in 33 of them, and it is strongly positive in 17 of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Three pairs of strictly serial reactions (those where one reaction is catalyzed by PK and the other is catalyzed by PGI, PGDH, or PFK) exhibit negative epistasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggest that, although one may not be able to naively extrapolate the rules of emergence and propagation of epistasis derived in the simple analytical model to more complex networks, some generalized versions of these rules may nevertheless hold more broadly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Genetic interactions are a powerful tool in genetics, and they play an important role in evolution. Yet, how epistasis emerges from the molecular architecture of the cell and how it propagates to higher-level phenotypes, such as fitness, remains largely unknown. Several recent studies made a statistical argument that the structure of the fitness landscape (and, as a consequence, the epistatic interactions between mutations at the level of fitness) may be largely independent of the underlying molecular architecture of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Martin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lyons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Reddy and Desai, 2020</xref>). If mutations are typically highly pleiotropic (i.e. affect many independent phenotypes relevant for fitness) or are engaged in a large number of idiosyncratic epistatic interactions with other mutations in the genome, the resulting fitness landscapes converge to certain limiting shapes, such as the Fisher’s geometric model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Martin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Tenaillon, 2014</xref>). To what extent these arguments indeed apply in practice is unclear. But if they do, most genetic interactions detected at the fitness level may be uninformative about the architecture of the underlying biological networks.</p><p>In this paper, I took a ‘mechanistic’ approach, which is in a sense orthogonal to the statistical one. In my model of a hierarchical metabolic network, mutations are highly pleiotropic (a mutation in any enzyme affects all the fluxes in the module) and highly epistatic (a mutation in any enzyme interacts with mutations in any other enzyme). Yet, these pleiotropic and epistatic effects appear to be sufficiently structured that some information about the topology of the network is preserved through all levels of the hierarchy. Indeed, the emergence and propagation of epistasis follow two simple rules in my model. First, once epistasis emerges at some level of the hierarchy, its propagation through the higher levels of the hierarchy depends weakly on the details of the network. Specifically, negative epistasis at a lower level induces negative epistasis at all higher levels and strong positive epistasis induces strong positive epistasis at all higher levels, irrespectively of the topology or the kinetic parameters of the network. Second, what type of epistasis emerges in the first place depends on the topological relationship between the reactions affected by mutations. In particular, negative epistasis emerges between mutations that affect strictly parallel reactions and positive epistasis emerges between mutations that affect strictly serial reactions. Insofar as my model is relevant to nature, the key conclusion from it is that epistasis at high-level phenotypes carries some, albeit incomplete, information about the underlying topological relationship between the affected reactions.</p><p>These results have implications for the interpretation of empirically measured epistasis coefficients. It is often assumed that a positive epistasis coefficient between mutations that affect distinct genes signals that their gene products act in some sense serially, whereas a negative epistasis coefficient is a signal of genetic redundency, that is, a parallel relationship between gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dixon et al., 2009</xref>). My results suggest that this reasoning is generally correct, but that the relationship between epistasis and topology is more nuanced. In particular, the sign of the epistasis coefficient in my model constrains but does not uniquely specify the topological relationship, such that a negative epistasis coefficient implies that the affected reactions are not strictly serial (but may or may not be strictly parallel) and an epistasis coefficient exceeding unity excludes a strictly parallel relationship (but does not necessarily imply a strictly serial relationship). My model suggests that one should also be careful with inferences going in the other direction, that is, extrapolating the patterns of epistasis measured at the biochemical level to those at the level of fitness. For example, if one wishes to infer the past evolutionary trajectory of an enzyme and finds two amino acid changes that exhibit a positive interaction at the level of enzymatic activity, it does not automatically imply that these mutations will exhibit a positive interaction at the level of fitness.</p><p>The strongest results presented here rely on several assumptions. I proved Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 in the limit of vanishingly small mutational effects. Some results of the metabolic control analysis, notably the summation theorem, are sensitive to this assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagheri-Chaichian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagheri and Wagner, 2004</xref>). To test the sensitivity of my analytical results with respect to this assumption, I used numerical simulations of networks with randomly sampled kinetic parameters and found that the results hold reasonably well when the effects of mutations are not infinitesimal.</p><p>The most restrictive assumption in the present work is that of first-order kinetics. Networks with only first-order kinetics clearly fail to capture some biologically important phenomena, such as sign epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Weinreich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ewald et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kemble et al., 2020</xref>). I discuss possible ways to relax this assumption below. But at present, a major question remains whether the rules of epistasis and propagation described here hold for realistic biological networks and whether they can be directly used to interpret empirical epistasis coefficients. My analysis of a fairly realistic computational model of glycolysis cautions against overinterpreting empirical epistasis coefficients using the rules derived here. But it also suggests that more general rules of propagation and emergence of epistasis may be found for more realistic networks. Thus, the simple rules derived here should probably be thought of as null expectations.</p><p>Relaxing the first-order kinetics assumption is analytically challenging because it is critical for replacing a module with a single effective reaction without altering the dynamics of the rest of the network. Although such lossless replacement is almost certainly not possible in networks with more complex kinetics, advanced network coarse-graining techniques may offer a promising way forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Flux balance analysis (FBA) is an alternative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Orth et al., 2010</xref>). FBA is appealing because it entirely removes the dependence of the model on reaction kinetics. However, this comes at a substantial cost. In FBA models, fitness and other high-level phenotypes become independent of the internal kinetic parameters, which is clearly unrealistic. Nevertheless, FBA is often very good at capturing the effects of mutations that change the topology of metabolic networks, such as reaction additions and deletions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gu et al., 2019</xref>). At the same time, there is no natural way within FBA to model mutations that perturb reaction kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alzoubi et al., 2019</xref>). In short, FBA and my approach are complementary (see Appendix 5 for a more detailed discussion).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Generic properties of epistasis in biological systems</title><p>Simple models help us identify generic phenomena—those that are shared by a large class of systems—which should inform our ‘null’ expectations in empirical studies. Deviations from such null in a given system under examination inform us about potentially interesting peculiarities of this system. The model presented here suggests several generic features of epistasis between genome-wide mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Epistasis has two contributions</title><p>My analysis shows that the value of an epistasis coefficient measured for a higher level phenotype is a result of two contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Domingo et al., 2019</xref>), propagation and emergence, which correspond to two terms in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref> (or the more general <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ51">Equation 49</xref>). The first term, propagation, shows that if two mutations exhibit epistasis for a lower-level phenotype they also generally exhibit epistasis for a higher-level phenotype. The second contribution comes from the fact that lower-level phenotypes map onto higher-level phenotypes via non-linear functions. This is true even in a simple model with linear kinetics considered here. As a result, even if two mutations exhibit no epistasis at the lower-level phenotype, epistasis must emerge for the higher-level phenotype, as previously pointed out by multiple authors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kacser and Burns, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">DePristo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Otwinowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Domingo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Husain and Murugan, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Epistasis depends on the genetic background and environment</title><p>My analysis shows that the value of an epistasis coefficient for a particular pair of mutations is in large part determined by the topological relationship between reactions affected by them. Since the topology of the metabolic network itself depends on the genotype (which genes are present in the genome) and on the environment (which enzymes are active or not), the topological relationship between two specific reactions might change if, for example, a third mutation knocks out another enzyme or if an enzyme is up- or down-regulated due to an environmental change (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, we should generically expect epistasis between mutations to depend on the environment and on the presence or absence of other mutations in the genome.

This fact complicates the interpretation of inter-gene epistasis since mutations in the same pair of genes can exhibit qualitatively different genetic interactions in different strains, organisms and environments, as has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">St Onge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Musso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Tischler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dowell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Heigwer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Li et al., 2019</xref>). However, the situation may not be hopeless because the topological relationship between two reactions cannot change arbitrarily after addition or removal of a single reaction. For example, if two reactions are strictly parallel, removing a third reaction does not alter their relationship (see Proposition 5). Thus, comparing matrices of epistasis coefficients measured in different environments or genetic backgrounds could inform us about how the organism rewires its metabolic network in response to these perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">St Onge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Musso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Heigwer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Skew in the distribution of epistasis coefficients</title><p>Studies that measure epistasis for fitness-related phenotypes among genome-wide mutations usually find both positive and negative epistases, but the preponderance of positive and negative epistasis varies. Some authors reported a skew toward positive interactions among deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jasnos and Korona, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>), whereas others reported a skew toward negative interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Szappanos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>). Beneficial mutations appear to predominantly exhibit negative epistasis, also known as ‘diminishing returns’ epistasis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Khan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schoustra et al., 2016</xref>). The reasons for these patterns are currently unclear. Several recent theoretical papers offer possible statistical explanations for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Martin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lyons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Reddy and Desai, 2020</xref>). On the other hand, mechanistic predictions for the distribution of epistasis coefficients are not yet available (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sanjuán and Nebot, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Macía et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiu et al., 2012</xref>). The present work does not directly address this problem either, but it provides some additional clues.</p><p>First, my model shows that the sign of epistasis at least to some extent reflects the topology of the network. Thus, the distribution of epistasis coefficients at high-level phenotypes in real organisms should ultimately depend on the preponderance of different topological relationships between the edges in biological networks. It then seems a priori unlikely that positive and negative interactions would be exactly balanced. Thus, we should expect the distribution of epistasis coefficients to be skewed in one or another direction.</p><p>The second observation is that in the metabolic model considered here a positive epistasis coefficient at one level of the hierarchy can turn into a negative one at a higher level, but the reverse is not possible. This bias toward negative epistasis at higher-level phenotypes appears to be even stronger in networks with saturating kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The third observation is that epistasis among beneficial and deleterious mutations affecting metabolic genes should be identical at the level where they arise, provided that beneficial and deleterious mutations are identically distributed among metabolic reactions. Thus, a stronger skew toward negative epistasis among beneficial mutations at the level of fitness could arise in my model for two mutually non-exclusive reasons. One possibility is that beneficial mutations tend to affect certain special subsets of genes, those that predominantly give rise to negative epistasis. For example, beneficial mutations may for some reason predominantly arise in enzymes that catalyze strictly parallel reactions. Another possibility is that when epistasis between beneficial mutations propagates through the metabolic hierarchy it tends to exhibit a stronger negative bias compared to epistasis between deleterious mutations. Indeed, this phenomenon arises in my model among mutations with large effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Epistasis is generic</title><p>Perhaps the most important—and also the most intuitive—conclusion of this work is that we should expect epistasis for high-level phenotypes, such as fitness, to be extremely common. Consider first a unicellular organism growing exponentially. Its fitness is fully determined by its growth rate, which can be thought of as the rate constant of an effective biochemical reaction that converts external nutrients into cells (see Appendix 6 for a simple mathematical model of this statement). In other words, growth rate is the most coarse-grained description of a metabolic network and, as such, it depends on the rate constants of all underlying biochemical reactions. Many previous studies have shown that within-protein epistasis is extremely common (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lunzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">DePristo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sailer and Harms, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Husain and Murugan, 2020</xref>). Present work shows that, once epistasis arises at the level of protein activity, it will propagate all the way up the metabolic hierarchy and will manifest itself as epistasis for growth rate. It also suggests that growth rate is a generically non-linear function of the rate constants of the underlying biochemical reactions, such that all mutations that affect growth rate individually would also exhibit pairwise epistasis for growth rate with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kacser and Burns, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">DePristo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Otwinowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Husain and Murugan, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In more complex organisms and/or in certain variable environments, it may be possible to decompose fitness into multiplicative or additive components, for example, plant’s fitness may be equal to the product of the number of seeds it produces and their germination probability, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 2011</xref>. Then, mutations that affect different components of fitness would exhibit no epistasis. However, such situations should be considered exceptional, as they require fitness to be decomposable and mutations to be non-pleiotropic.</p><p>If epistasis is in fact generic for high-level phenotypes, why do we not observe it more frequently? For example, a recent study that tested almost all pairs of gene knock-out mutations in yeast found genetic interactions for fitness for only about 4% of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>). One possibility is that many pairs of mutations exhibit epistasis that is simply too small to detect with current methods. As the precision of fitness measurements improves, we would then expect the fraction of interacting gene pairs to grow. Another possibility is that systematic shifts in the distribution of estimated epistasis coefficients away from zero are taken by researchers as systematic errors rather than real phenomena, and are normalized out. Thus, some epistasis that would otherwise be detectable may be lost during data processing.</p><p>If epistasis is indeed as ubiquituous as the present analysis suggests, it would call into question how observations of inter-gene epistasis are interpreted. In particular, contrary to a common belief, a non-zero epistasis coefficient does not necessarily imply any specific functional relationship between the components affected by mutations beyond the fact that both components somehow contribute to the measured phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). The focus of future research should then be not merely on documenting epistasis but on developing theory and methods for a robust inference of biological relationships from measured epistasis coefficients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key ideas and logic of proofs of Theorems 1 and 2</title><p>Before proceeding to the detailed proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, I informally outline some key ideas and the basic logic.</p><p>The central object of the theory is a metabolic module. Modules have two key properties. First, a module is somewhat isolated from the rest of the metabolic network, in the sense that all metabolites inside it interact with only two metabolites outside, the I/O metabolites. The second property is that the metabolites within the module are sufficiently connected that each of them individually as well as any subset of them collectively can achieve a quasi-steady state (QSS), given the concentrations of the remaining metabolites. This property is proven in Proposition 1.</p><p>When some metabolites are at QSS, they can be effectively removed from the network and replaced with effective reactions among the remaining metabolites. In other words, one can ‘coarse-grain’ the network by removing metabolites. This approach is a standard biochemical-network reduction technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Segel, 1988</xref>); for example, the Briggs-Haldane derivation of the Michaelis-Menten formula is based on this idea. In general, the resulting effective reactions have more complex (non-linear) kinetics than the original reactions. However, when the original reactions are first-order, the effective reactions are also first-order, that is, there is no increase in complexity. In Network coarse graining and an algorithm for evaluating the effective rate constant for an arbitrary module, I formally define the coarse-graining procedure (CGP) that eliminates one or multiple metabolites and replaces them with effective reactions.</p><p>CGP is an essential concept in my theory. I use it to compute the QSS concentrations for internal metabolites within a module (Corollary 1) and thereby prove Proposition 1, mentioned above. Since any module μ can achieve a QSS at any concentrations of its I/O metabolites and since any module has only two I/O metabolites, it can be replaced with a single effective reaction (Corollary 2). CGP provides a way to calculate the rate constant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf233"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> of this reaction. In other words, the CGP is an algorithm for evaluating function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf234"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> for any module μ.</p><p>CGP has an important property: its result does not depend on the order in which metabolites are eliminated. Therefore, in computing the effective rate constant of a module, we can choose any convinient way to eliminate its metabolites. Suppose that one module μ is nested within another module ν as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. A convenient way to compute the effective rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf235"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> of the larger module is to first coarse-grain the smaller module μ, replacing it with an effective rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf236"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, and then eliminate all the remaining metabolites in ν. Since effective rates after coarse-graining do not depend on the order of metabolite elimination, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf237"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> must depend on the rate constants <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf238"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> only indirectly, through <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf239"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. In other words, all the information about the smaller module μ that is relevant for the performance of the larger module ν is contained in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf240"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. Therefore, if a mutation or mutations perturb only reactions inside of the smaller module μ, we only need to know their effects on the effective rate constant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf241"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> to completely understand how they will perturb the performance of the larger module ν. Specifically, if we have two such mutations A and B, all the information about them is contained in three numbers, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf242"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf243"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf244"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Theorem 1 then describes how epistasis at the level of module μ propagates to epistasis at the level of module ν.</p><p>The proof of Theorem 1 proceeds as follows.

No matter what the initial structure of module ν is, such coarse-graining will produce only one of three topologically distinct ‘minimal’ modules, which differ by the location of reaction <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf251"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> with respect to the I/O metabolites of module ν (Figure 7).

This is the essence of Proposition 2. Then Theorem 1 can be easily proven by explicitly evaluating the first- and second-order control coefficients for each of the three functions and showing that the statements of the theorem hold for all of them, irrespectively of the function’s parameters.</p><p>Now consider two reactions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf254"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf255"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> with rate constants ξ and η, and imagine the two mutations A and B that affect these reactions.

To do so, it is convenient to first eliminate all metabolites that do not participate in reactions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf258"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf259"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. No matter what the initial structure of module μ is, such coarse-graining will produce only one of nine topologically distinct minimal modules, which differ by the location of reactions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf260"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf261"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> with respect to the I/O metabolites of module μ and each other (Figure 8). This implies that the function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf262"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> can belong to nine parameteric families. This is the essence of Proposition 3 and Corollary 3.</p><p>How does the topological relationship between reactions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf263"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf264"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> translate into epistasis? First, there are only three types of relationships between any pair of reactions in a module: strictly serial, strictly parallel, or serial-parallel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Second, Proposition 4 and Corollary 4 show that coarse-graining does not alter the strict relationships, that is, if reactions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf265"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf266"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are strictly serial or strictly parallel before coarse-graining they will remain so after coarse-graining. This is important because it implies that to prove Theorem 2 we do not need to consider an infinitely large space of all modules but only a much smaller space of all minimal modules, that is, those that have only those metabolites that participate in the affected reactions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf267"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf268"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. Although the space of all minimal modules is still infinite, the space of their topologies is finite (see Figure 8). For some minimal topologies, the connection between the strictly serial or strictly parallel relationship and epistasis can be established very easily. For example, if reaction <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf269"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and reaction <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf270"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> both share an I/O metabolite as a substrate (see topological class <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf271"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>IO</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> in Figure 8), then they are always strictly parallel, no matter what the rest of the module looks like. Evaluating the first- and second-order control coefficients for the function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf272"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> that corresponds to this topological class reveals that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf273"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for any parameter values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf274"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>Unfortunately, most topological classes are too broad and include modules where reactions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf275"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf276"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are strictly serial as well as modules where they are strictly parallel or serial-parallel (e.g., class <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf277"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>). Consequently, the sign of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf278"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for such modules can change depending on the values of the rate constants. However, since the number of distinct minimal topologies is finite, it is possible to identify all minimal topologies where the reactions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf279"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf280"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are strictly serial or strictly parallel. These topological sub-classes define parametric sub-families of function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf281"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, and we can explicitly calculate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf282"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for all such functions. However, such brute-force approach is extremely cumbersome because the number of distinct minimal topologies is very large.</p><p>Fortunately, the following simple and intuitive fact greatly simplifies this problem. If two reactions are strictly serial or strictly parallel, this relationship does not change if a third reaction is removed from the module. This statement is the essence of Proposition 5. However, if the two reactions are serial-parallel, removal of a third reaction can change the relationship to a strictly serial or a strictly parallel one. As a consequence, there exist certain most connected ‘generating’ topologies where the relationship between the focal reactions is strictly parallel or strictly serial, and any other strictly serial minimal topology can be produced from at least one of the generating topologies by removal of reactions. This is the essence of Proposition 6. All generating topologies can be discovered by a simple algorithm provided in Appendix 3. They are listed in Table 2 and Table 3 and shown in Figure 10 through Figure 14.

First, I introduce the main idea, which is to eliminate a metabolite that is at QSS and to replace it with a set of new reactions between metabolites adjacent to the eliminated one. This is exactly analogous to the star-mesh transformation in the theory of electric circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Versfeld, 1970</xref>). The resulting network is a coarse-grained version of the original network in the sense that it has one less metabolite. Next, I define the CGP, which is simply multiple metabolite eliminations applied successively. I prove Proposition 1, which justifies applying the CGP to a whole module and replacing it with a single effective reaction (Corollary 2). Finally, I show how to apply the CGP in practice to compute function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf316"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> for modules with some simple topologies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Elimination of a single metabolite</title><p>I begin by outlining the main idea behind the CGP, which is to replace one metabolite internal to a module with a series of effective reactions between metabolites adjacent to it.

To see this, notice that for any module with a single marked reaction, the CGP can be carried out in two stages. In the first stage, we can eliminate all metabolites that do not participate in the marked reaction. The resulting coarse-grained module is minimal in the sense that it can have at most two internal metabolites. Such minimal modules (and, as a consequence, all modules with one marked reaction) fall into three distinct topological classes, which are specified by the location of the marked reaction with respect to the I/O metabolites, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. This implies that there are only three parameteric families of the function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf533"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

This result is formulated in Proposition 2.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Classification of single-marked modules.</title><p>Left column shows a general module from each topological class.

CGP that eliminates all metabolites that do not participate in the marked reactions maps all such modules onto respective minimal modules, which can have at most four internal metabolites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This result is formulated in Proposition 3. Minimal modules (and, as a consequence, all modules with two marked reactions) fall into nine distinct topological classes, which are specified by the locations of the marked reactions.

The idea of the proof is the following. According to Property 5 (<xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>), all single-marked modules that are mapped by the CGP onto a minimal module with the same topology <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf640"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> have the same functional form of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf641"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

In other words, <italic>all</italic> single-marked modules that belong to the topological class <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf650"><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> are described by functions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf651"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> that belong to one parameteric family corresponding to the fully connected topology minimal in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf652"><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. The three parameteric families of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf653"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are characterized by Proposition 2.</p><p>One important consequence of Proposition 2 is that it is not necessary to test the claim of Theorem 1 for each family of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf654"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> that corresponds to each minimal topology.

First, I note that any two reactions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf893"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf894"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> within any module μ can be either strictly serial, strictly parallel or serial-parallel. Then, Proposition 4 and its Corollary 4 establish that strictly parallel (serial) reactions in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf895"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are also strictly parallel (serial) in a minimal module <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf896"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which is obtained from μ by eliminating all metabolites that do not participate in the marked reactions. Next, recall that in both modules <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf897"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf898"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> the same function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf899"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> maps the rate constants of two marked reactions onto module’s effective rate constant (Proposition 3). Since the epistasis coefficient depends only on the shape of this function, we only need to consider all minimal modules in order to understand what kinds of epistasis may arise between mutations affecting strictly serial and strictly parallel reactions in any module. This is a big simplification because the number of different minimal topologies is finite and the parameteric families of function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf900"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are known for all of them (see Corollary 3). As a consequence, to prove Theorem 2, we could in principle list all of the minimal topologies, identify those where the marked reactions are strictly serial or strictly parallel and evalulate the epistasis coefficient using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 9</xref> for every respective function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf901"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the number of minimal topologies is very large, so that such brute-force approach would be quite cumbersome. I take a less cumbersome approach which is based on the realization that a strictly serial or strictly parallel relationship between two reactions cannot be altered by removing a third reaction from the module (Proposition 5). This implies that every minimal topology where the two reactions are strictly serial can be produced from another, more connected, ‘generating’ topology by removing some reactions; and similarly for minimal modules where the reactions are strictly parallel (Proposition 6). All generating topologies can be identified by a simple algorithm given in Appendix 3.</p><p>Finally, I prove Theorem 2 in three steps. First, Proposition 7 shows that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf902"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for any minimal module μ with any strictly parallel generating topology.

Unfortunately, the number of topologies to be considered is very large, so in practice it is very cumbersome. To avoid this complication, I take an alternative approach that is based on the same key idea as the proof of Theorem 1. Rather than considering one by one, each minimal topology where the marked reactions are strictly serial or strictly parallel (and the corresponding parametric families of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf997"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), the idea is to identify the most connected minimal topologies (and the corresponding largest parametric families of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf998"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) such that all the other minimal topologies with the strictly serial or strictly parallel reactions (and the corresponding parametric families) can be obtained from them by removing reactions (i.e. setting some parameters to zero).</p><p>This idea can be implemented using the following observations. If the two marked reactions are strictly parallel or strictly serial in a minimal module, then removing a third reaction from it does not change this relationship. This statement is proven in Proposition 5. As a consequence, all minimal modules in the topological classes <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf999"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>IO</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1000"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1001"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>IO</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> must be strictly parallel because the fully connected minimal topologies are strictly parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Similarly, all minimal modules in the topological class <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1002"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> must be strictly serial because the fully connected minimal topology is strictly serial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The fully connected minimal topologies in all other topological classes are serial-parallel. If the two reactions are serial-parallel, removing a third reaction can change their relationship into a strictly serial or strictly parallel one, depending on which reaction is removed, as shown for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C and D</xref>. In fact, by removing reactions from the fully connected minimal modules shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, it is easy to show that the topological classes <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1003"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1004"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1005"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1006"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1007"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> contain both strictly serial and strictly parallel modules.</p><p>These observations suggests that adding reactions to a minimal module where the marked reactions are strictly serial or strictly parallel will either change their relationship into serial-parallel or will preserve their relationship until the minimal module is fully connected. Therefore, among all minimal modules in a topological class, there must exist the most connected modules where the marked reactions are strictly parallel or strictly serial, such that all other less connected strictly serial or strictly parallel modules can be produced from the most connected ones by removal of reactions.

In Appendix 3, I provide an algorithm that discovers all strictly serial and strictly parallel generating topologies by sequentially removing reactions from the fully connected minimal topology in each topological class. The code implementing this algorithm in Matlab is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/skryazhi/epistasis_theory">https://github.com/skryazhi/epistasis_theory</ext-link>. All strictly parallel generating topologies are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and all strictly serial generating topologies are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. They are also illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> through Figure 14. I label each generating topology by a four-letter combination (see column 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>): the first three letters denote the topological class and the last letter (F, P, or S) denotes the specific generating topology within that class. Letter ‘F’ (stands for ‘full’) denotes the fact that the reaction set in the generating topology is complete. Letters ‘P’ (for ‘parallel’) and ‘S’ (stands for ‘serial’) denote strictly parallel and strictly serial generating topologies, respectively; if there are a multiple generating topologies within the same class, they are distinguished by subindices, for example, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1216"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1217"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, etc.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Graphical representation of strictly serial and strictly parallel generating topologies in the class <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1218"><mml:msup><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">io</mml:mi><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">io</mml:mi><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>.</title><p>Fully connected topology <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1219"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>io</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is shown for reference (same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60200-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4-15-9"><title>Topological relationship between reactions and epistasis</title><p>Each strictly serial and strictly parallel generating topology in a given class <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1220"><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) is produced by removing reactions from the fully connected topology minimal in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1221"><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℳ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

I then manually identify whether there exists a simple path connecting the input metabolite with the output metabolite for that module that passes through both reactions. (Note that, since some reactions are irreversible in this model, it is important to distinguish the input metabolite from the output metabolite). If such path does not exist, I classify the topological relationship between the two reactions as strictly parallel. If such path exists, I check if there are two paths connecting the input to the output metabolites such that each path contains only one of the two focal reactions. If such paths do not exist, I classify the topological relationship between the two reactions as strictly serial. Otherwise, I classify it as serial-parallel.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>I thank Chris Marx for discussions that stimulated this work, David McCandlish for making me aware of the Kron reduction, Daniel P Rice, the Kryazhimskiy lab, and the reviewers for feedback on the manuscript.

FBA and my model are designed to address different questions. My model was designed to explore how the flux depends on the kinetic parameters of a module. FBA was designed to avoid this dependence. Nevertheless, the two models are conceptually and mathematically related and in fact are in some sense equivalent, as discussed below. The most important similarity is that both models rely on flux balance—the assumption that internal metabolites are at steady state—as a key simplification.</p><p>The major difference is that my model assumes that all reaction kinetics are first order, which allows for analytical tractability, while FBA is agnostic with respect to reaction kinetics and takes into account only their stoichiometries and possibly some additional ‘capacity’ constraints on the reaction rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Orth et al., 2010</xref>). This difference deserves some additional discussion. In real cells, the concentrations of internal metabolites and the resulting fluxes (which are functions of these concentrations) are determined by the stoichiometries of reactions, the activities of enzymes and the concentrations of external nutrients. A general approach to modeling such systems, adopted by the metabolic control analysis and related theories, is to explicitly specify the dynamic equations for the metabolites, such as <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10">Equation 10</xref>, and solve them to find steady-state concentrations of internal metabolites (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Savageau, 1976</xref>). The steady-state fluxes are then determined automatically. In my model, the internal steady state exists and is unique for any module (see Corollary 1). In contrast, there are no dynamic equations within FBA. Instead, the steady-state fluxes are subject only to the mass-balance equations and the capacity conditions, which typically form a severely underdetermined system. Therefore, arriving at a unique flux distribution in FBA requires additional assumptions. The typical approach is to first fix at least some nutrient uptake rates and then maximize an objective function, such as the growth rate or biomass yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Feist and Palsson, 2010</xref>). In other words, FBA trades-off the ability to handle reactions with arbitrary kinetics and unknown kinetic parameters against the necessity to impose auxiliary conditions to find the right solution among many plausible ones.</p><p>As a consequence of these model design choices, mutations that add or remove reactions can be naturally studied within the FBA framework, but there is no natural way to incorporate mutations that perturb the kinetic parameters of reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alzoubi et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, mutations of small or large effect, including reaction additions and deletions, can be in principle naturally studied within my model.</p><p>Due to differences in the assumptions, my model and FBA describe different sets of biological systems. However, there are special cases which can be described by both FBA and my model, and in these special cases the two models are mathematically equivalent.</p><p>From the perspective of FBA, modules with two I/O metabolites and first-order kinetics described by my model are a special case.

This is important as such models are scarce. The paper is conceptually innovative, by studying epistasis in the context of a chemical reaction network, and showing how the underlying biochemical reactions constrain epistasis. This adds to ongoing efforts to more precisely understand, at the mechanistic level, how epistasis arises from microscopic processes, and as such will be of interest to a wide range of researchers in evolutionary cell biology, evolutionary genetics, and biophysics.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Emergence and Propagation of Epistasis in Metabolic Networks&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin H Good (Reviewer #1); Arvind Murugan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript investigates the emergence and propagation of epistasis in metabolic networks. To that end, the author provides a mathematical analysis of the relationship between epistasis for steady-state flux and network toplogy in linear metabolic networks. The approach is a mathematical study of the combined effect of pairwise perturbations of parameters in the set of linear ODEs that describes the system. The author considers these perturbations of microscopic reaction rates as &quot;mutations&quot;, and the interaction between the effects is interpreted as epistasis between the mutations.</p><p>Reviewers were positive overall about the paper, but noted three important areas where it must be improved prior to being acceptable for publication. I proceed to summarize these areas where revisions are needed.</p><p>With the goal of making these criticisms as useful and constructive as possible, I also include potential solutions to the issues raised by the reviewers. Note that these are offered as suggestions.</p><p>1) Clarity: The reviewers found that the paper was hard to read and that it would benefit from a clearer presentation. Below I summarize some of the main concerns regarding this issue and provide potential solutions:</p><p>Revision #1: The manuscript uses a complicated notation and terminology to derive results that are in the end (mathematically) rather simple. This makes the manuscript hard to read, and it will limit the readership. Just remembering the notation and the exact meaning of the terms is a challenge, and this level of complexity is not necessary to derive these results.</p><p>Possible solutions: Attempt to simplify notation. State the two theorems in the main text rather than in the appendix. Simplify the notation in the main text. Consider moving Proposition 6 to the main text.</p><p>Revision #2: The Materials and methods were hard to navigate even for specialists who are familiar with the math. A better organization should help. For instance, what the reviewers looked for in the Materials and methods was – (a) how to compute the expansion in Equation 3 for a simple network and in general, (b) details to understand the results on series and parallel pathways. These ideas are not easily found in Materials and methods.</p><p>Possible solutions: Re-organize the Materials and methods section in a more modular way, with clear headings and an introduction describing what is going to be accomplished in each subsection, linking each section with the main results in the text (e.g. &quot;Derivation of Equation X&quot;). Organizing by such themes, working out a specific example, and following it up with the general proofs would make it more easily readable. Clearly separating proofs/propositions that get at zero-th order ideas from mathematical technicalities would help.</p><p>Revision #3: The results in Figure 1D and e.g., why negative epistasis is maintained across coarse-graining. (see text below Equation 4) were not immediately intuitive.</p><p>Possible solutions: Present explicit expressions for H, F, epsilon in Equations 3,4 for a particular simple network and then state that these results in fact hold for any topology as shown in Materials and methods.</p><p>2) Generalizability and scope: All results are derived for linear ODEs near equilibrium. The linear steady-state assumption needs to be contextualized. The scope of the study and its practical applications could be understood more clearly if the validity of this approximation were more explicitly discussed (e.g. its validity for mutations of small effect, or as a null model)</p><p>Revision #4: The linear steady-state assumptions would be appropriate for mutations of small effect. This issue should be addressed, i.e. whether aspects of network toplogy can be inferred from system-level epistasis may simply depend on the effect size of the &quot;mutations&quot;.</p><p>Possible solutions: In addition to explicitly address the linear quasi-steady state assumption head on in the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion, the author should also evaluate the conditions where this assumption would be valid, e.g. how small do the changes need to be for the system to behave according to the theory?</p><p>3) Context: All reviewers found that the connection to previous work could be strengthened significantly, including references to key previous work.</p><p>Revision #5: The revised manuscript should include a more structured discussion of the relevant literature on gene interactions in metabolic networks and in gene-regulatory networks where the assumption of linear reactions is common. A brief discussion of Fisher's geometric model would be useful (e.g. the study by Martin (2014) Genetics should be referenced). The paper should also include a discussion of other systems where a similar “emergent” epistasis has been reported. For protein epistasis, Otwinoswki et al., 2018 made a phenomenological observation of emergence – e.g., epistasis between mutations in β-lactamase can be explained as a global non-linearity applied to non-epistatic linear trait. Sailer et al., 2017, Husain et al., 2020 give mechanistic explanations for how simple global epistasis can emerge from complex underlying interactions, closely tied to the discussion in “Inter-gene epistasis is generic”. Similarly, epistasis due to steady states, central to this paper, is similar to the arguments of Bender, Case and Gilpin, Ecology, 1984 (and later reviews by Case, Billick) in the context of (mistakenly) inferring ecological interactions from correlated variations of species abundances at steady state.</p><p>Possible fix: See the references suggested above, as well as:</p><p>Clark, A.

The main results appear to be derived for closed chemical reaction networks at steady state, rather than the driven metabolic networks (e.g. those with fixed input flux) that are more commonly considered in other works. This may complicate the interpretation of the results, since we do not know which findings are specific to the equilibrium assumption.</p><p>Possible solutions: The author may either (i) explicitly extend the results to allow for networks with a fixed input flux or (ii) simply rephrase key parts of the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion to make this distinction more explicit. The author should discuss how commonly used approaches such as Flux Balance Analysis would relate to this work, and in particular whether the assumptions of FBA are covered by his model. Can the author comment on how the results would change if one used dynamic flux balance where the environment changes over time as cells grow on it?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60200.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers were positive overall about the paper, but noted three important areas where it must be improved prior to being acceptable for publication.

The results of these new analyses are now presented in a new section “Sensitivity of results with respect to the magnitude of mutational effects” and in new Figure 4. Briefly, I tested the sensitivity of Theorem 1 with respect to the magnitude of mutations by numerically calculating the function that maps lower-level epistasis onto higher-level epistasis for modules with randomly sampled kinetic parameters and for mutations with various magnitudes and signs. Overall, the results of Theorem 1 appear to be fairly robust to the magnitude of mutational effects. Predictions of Theorem 1 begin to fail when both mutations have 10-50% positive effects on the rate constant of the lower-level module (see Figure 4A). The results of Theorem 2 are also quite robust with respect to the effect size of mutations. By carrying out similar numerical calculations, I found that mutations in parallel reactions never produced positive epistasis. Mutations in serial reactions never produced negative epistasis, but they did produce values of epistasis between 0 and 1 in a fraction of tested cases (Figure 4B).</p><p>I updated the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion accordingly to make the assumptions underlying analytical work clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Context: All reviewers found that the connection to previous work could be strengthened significantly, including references to key previous work.</p><p>Revision #5: The revised manuscript should include a more structured discussion of the relevant literature on gene interactions in metabolic networks and in gene-regulatory networks where the assumption of linear reactions is common.

Even though I was aware of most of the papers mentioned by the reviewers, I was missing many important connections, especially with the evolutionary literature. As a side note, the evolutionary angle was present much more prominently in earlier drafts of the manuscript but inadvertently got edited out in later versions. The new version of the paper has an expanded and structured discussion of the relevant previous literature in the Introduction, and I added several new paragraphs in the Discussion expounding some of these connections. I now reference almost all of the papers suggested in the list above. I decided not to cite Bender et al., 1984 and Plathe et al., 2013 because they only tangentially relevant. Instead of Jayawardhana et al., 2015, I now cite Rao et al., 2014, which is on the same topic but more relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revision#6: Finally, reviewers also identified an issue that needs clarification. The main results appear to be derived for closed chemical reaction networks at steady state, rather than the driven metabolic networks (e.g. those with fixed input flux) that are more commonly considered in other works. This may complicate the interpretation of the results, since we do not know which findings are specific to the equilibrium assumption.</p><p>Possible solutions: The author may either (i) explicitly extend the results to allow for networks with a fixed input flux or (ii) simply rephrase key parts of the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion to make this distinction more explicit. The author should discuss how commonly used approaches such as Flux Balance Analysis would relate to this work, and in particular whether the assumptions of FBA are covered by his model. Can the author comment on how the results would change if one used dynamic flux balance where the environment changes over time as cells grow on it?</p></disp-quote><p>A few points in response to this comment. First, a technical correction. A module—the main object of this work for which all the results are derived—is an open system, in the sense that there is constant metabolic flux through it. However, the steady-state flux through a module is determined by both the concentrations of its I/O metabolites (which, importantly, are not part of the module) and by module’s internal kinetic parameters. So, in that sense, modules are indeed not “driven”, as in FBA.</p><p>Second, the assumption that a module achieves a steady state, conditional on the concentrations of its I/O metabolites, is not only a more realistic assumption for modeling cells than the assumption of a fixed input flux, it is also a standard assumption in the metabolic control analysis literature. I now discuss both of these assumptions in more detail in the new Appendix 5 (“Relationship to the flux balance analysis”).</p><p>Third, modules in my model can be analyzed in the fixed input flux regime simply by making all reactions that connect the input metabolite to the internal metabolites irreversible. This regime (and the formal connection to FBA more generally) is now also discussed in the new Appendix 5. However, this regime is not very interesting from the perspective of epistasis because the flux through the module stops depending on the internal structure of the module. But technically, all my results still hold. Therefore, I did not modify the text.</p><p>Finally, the question how the changes in the environment affect epistasis is of course very important, but it goes beyond the scope of this paper. The only statement that I can make at this point is that, as long as the concentrations of the I/O metabolites change sufficiently slowly for the module to remain at steady state (as far as I understand, dynamic FBA makes the same assumption), all results remain unchanged.</p></body></sub-article></article>
