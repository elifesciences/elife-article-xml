lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is frequently administered to generate models of systemic inflammation. However, there are several side effects and no effective treatment for LPS-induced systemic inflammation. PEGylated PDZ peptide based on zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) was analyzed for its effects on systemic inflammation induced by LPS. PDZ peptide administration led to the restoration of tissue injuries (kidney, liver, and lung) and prevented alterations in biochemical plasma markers. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly decreased in the plasma and lung BALF in the PDZ-administered mice. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the PDZ peptide significantly inhibited inflammation, mainly by decreasing the population of M1 macrophages, and neutrophils (immature and mature), and increasing M2 macrophages. Using RNA sequencing analysis, the expression levels of the NF-κB-related proteins were lower in PDZ-treated cells than in LPS-treated cells. In addition, wild-type PDZ peptide significantly increased mitochondrial membrane integrity and decreased LPS-induced mitochondria fission. Interestingly, PDZ peptide dramatically could reduce LPS-induced NF-κB signaling, ROS production, and the expression of M1 macrophage marker proteins, but increased the expression of M2 macrophage marker proteins. These results indicated that PEGylated PDZ peptide inhibits LPS-induced systemic inflammation, reducing tissue injuries and reestablishing homeostasis, and may be a therapeutic candidate against systemic inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LPS</kwd><kwd>Systemic inflammation</kwd><kwd>ZO-1</kwd><kwd>PDZ</kwd><kwd>M1/M2 polarization</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023R1A2C3002483</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Yeong-Min</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Kyoung Seob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1A4A1031380</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jeongtae</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Kyoung Seob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PEGylated PDZ peptide reduces LPS-induced systemic inflammation, restores tissue integrity, decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines, and modulates macrophage populations, showing potential as a therapeutic for systemic inflammation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic inflammation causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Juskewitch et al., 2012</xref>) and is a common cause of pathogenesis for multiple degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders, and coronary heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Qin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Furman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sattar et al., 2003</xref>). One major source of morbidities is pro-inflammatory cytokines from immune cells and activation of the innate immune system against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Furman et al., 2019</xref>). However, the physiological mechanisms and therapeutic candidates against LPS-induced systemic inflammation are poorly understood.</p><p>ZO-1 is a tight junction protein that regulates cell permeability in many mammalian cells and functions as a scaffolding protein. ZO-1 consists of three PDZ domains, a SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase (GuK) domain. Because the ZO-1 protein strictly and completely regulates cell permeability, ZO-1 overexpression could inhibit LPS- and PM2.5-induced respiratory inflammation by diminishing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, among ZO-1 proteins, PDZ could participate in PDZ-PDZ interactions and bind with non-PDZ-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee and Zheng, 2010</xref>). The PDZ peptide consists of a core sequence that significantly decreases LPS-induced F-actin polymerization and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or chemokines to maintain homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, RGS12 expression activated by the PDZ peptide can completely block LPS-induced CXCR2 GPCR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Although the PDZ peptide can regulate LPS-and PM2.5-related airway inflammation, this is limited to the respiratory system. The effects of the PDZ peptide on LPS-induced systemic inflammation are poorly understood.</p><p>M1 and M2 macrophage polarization differs in specific functions in the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2023</xref>). M1 macrophages are the initial immune response to infections and can produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. M2 macrophages are mediated for anti-inflammation and tissue repair and have specific physiological functions to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Polarization of macrophages into these subtypes is important because it determines the progression to inflammation or anti-inflammation. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that mainly assist the body in fighting off infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2023</xref>). Immature neutrophils can be present but do not participate in infection control, while mature neutrophils are fully functional and primed for fighting infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, the presence of immature neutrophils in the bloodstream may be an indication of inflammation or infection.</p><p>Here, we suggest that PEGylated PDZ peptide inhibits LPS-induced systemic inflammation by hindering ROS production in the kidney mitochondria. Because the PDZ peptide restored LPS-induced tissue injury in the liver, kidney, and lung in mice, it likely inhibits the major symptoms of systemic inflammation and may be an innovative therapeutic candidate for sepsis and septic shock.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZO-1-based PDZ peptide is generated and PEGylated</title><p>Based on our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2020</xref>), ZO-1 protein potentially regulates LPS- or PM2.5-induced airway inflammation by enforcing membrane tightness. In addition, the PDZ domain plays an essential role in LPS- or PM2.5-induced ZO-1 physiological function by generating TEER. Therefore, we hypothesized that PDZ peptide downregulates systemic LPS inflammation. The PDZ peptide consisting of 22 amino acids and an additional TAT (GRKKRRQRRR) sequence to enable cell permeability was tagged with FITC for monitoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The clinical application of a therapeutic peptide is often limited by its short in vivo half-life. PEGylation is one of the well-established approaches for extending in vivo half-life of a peptide drug; A PEGylated peptide is expected to be more tolerable to renal clearance and proteolytic degradation. To PEGylate WT PDZ or mut PDZ at its amine groups, m-PEG-succinimidyl succinate with an average molecular weight of 5000 Da was incubated with WT PDZ or mut PDZ to yield mono- and di-PEGylated WT PDZ or mut PDZ, collectively referred to as PEG-WT-PDZ or PEG-mut PDZ, respectively. Size exclusion chromatography on the PEGylation mixture resulted in the separation of PEG-WT-PDZ or PEG-mut PDZ from unreacted PEG and residual WT PDZ or mut PDZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). PEG-WT PDZ or PEG-mut PDZ collected from eluting fractions was analyzed by in-gel fluorescence upon SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In comparison to the PEGylation mixture which contained native PDZ as well as PEGylated PDZs, purified PEG-WT PDZ or PEG-mut PDZ was comprised of only mono- and di-PEGylates with fairly retarded migration. These results indicated that PEGylation was successfully achieved through amine-coupling at lysine residues of PDZs and substantially increased the hydrodynamic volume of PDZs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PEGylation and purification of PEGylated PDZ (PEG-WT PDZ) and PEGylated mut PDZ (PEG-mut PDZ).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peptides were synthesized with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and entered the Tat region (italicized amino acids) for cell penetration based on the first PDZ domain sequence (A, upper panel), and 25GG26 was changed to 25AA26 for the mutant PDZ peptide (mut PDZ peptide; lower panel).

Mice were pretreated with either WT or mut PDZ peptide (7.5 mg/kg, i.v.) for 4 hr and then injected with LPS (10 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce experimental systemic inflammation. After sacrifice, blood samples were collected, and the ALT, AST, BUN, and creatinine levels were measured to identify the changes in plasma biochemical markers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A significant increase in plasma biomarkers of systemic inflammation was observed in LPS-administered mice. Notably, WT PDZ-treated mice had decreased levels of biomarkers compared to LPS-treated mice. However, mut PDZ-treated mice had not changed, except creatinine, suggesting that WT PDZ peptide significantly decreased LPS-induced elevation of creatinine in plasma. Although the function of ZO-1 protein as a diagnostic marker for sepsis was identified in 2020 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ni et al., 2020</xref>), additional studies have not been performed. Here, the in vivo survival effect of LPS and PDZ co-administration was examined in mice. The pretreatment with WT PDZ peptide significantly increased survival and rescued compared to LPS only; these effects were not observed with the mut PDZ peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). To investigate whether WT PDZ peptide can affect pro-inflammatory cytokine production/recruitment in the plasma after LPS administration, various pre-inflammatory cytokines were measured after blood perfusion through the heart. The IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels were significantly decreased in the plasma of WT PDZ peptide-administered mice, but not in mut PDZ peptide-administered mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Next, systemic inflammation can cause septic shock and severe damage to lung, kidney, liver, and other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caraballo and Jaimes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lelubre and Vincent, 2018</xref>). Thus, lung inflammation was examined under the same conditions. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were examined using specific ELISAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production was significantly inhibited in WT PDZ peptide-administered mice, but not in mut PDZ peptide-administered mice. These results indicate that the WT PDZ peptide significantly inhibits the LPS-induced the loss of weight and pro-inflammatory cytokine production to maintain homeostasis in blood and lungs after LPS administration.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The inhibitory effect of PDZ peptide on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammatory responses in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of survival rate and body weight change after administration of LPS or both LPS and PDZ peptide.

The liver, kidney, and lung samples were collected and histopathologically examined. LPS administration significantly enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), and lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) tissue samples. Interestingly, these infiltrations were significantly inhibited by WT PDZ administration, but not mut PDZ in the liver, kidney, and lung. And the immunohistochemistry staining using macrophage and microglia marker, Iba1, is helpful for the indication of an inflamed site. Iba1 staining was strongly positive in LPS-administrated Liver and kidney. Interestingly, this iba1 staining was dramatically decreased in WT PDZ treatment, but not mut PDZ in the liver and kidney. In addition, LPS administration increased PAS-positive goblet cells in lung tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). PAS-positive goblet cells were strongly decreased by WT PDZ administration, but not by mut PDZ administration. The specific physiological mechanism by which WT PDZ peptide decreases LPS-induced systemic inflammation in mice and the signal molecules involved remain unclear. These were confirmed by a semi-quantitative analysis of Iba-1 immunoreactivity and PAS staining in the liver, kidney, and lung, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d, e and f</xref>). To examine whether WT PDZ peptide can alter LPS-induced tissue damage in the kidney, a cell toxicity assay was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). LPS induced cell damage in the kidney, however, WT PDZ peptide could significantly alleviate the toxicity, but mut PDZ peptide could not. Because cytotoxicity caused by LPS is frequently due to ROS production in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Su et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qiongyue et al., 2022</xref>), ROS production in the mitochondria was investigated in renal mitochondria cells harvested from kidney tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). LPS significantly increased ROS production to induce renal inflammation in a time-dependent manner; however, the WT PDZ peptide blocked LPS-induced ROS production, but the mut PDZ peptide did not. The results indicate that the WT PDZ peptide may have therapeutic effects that inhibit LPS-induced tissue damage and systemic inflammation in several organs of mice administered LPS.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The effects of PDZ peptide on liver, kidney, and lung injuries in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-administered mice.</title><p>LPS administration (10 mg/kg/30 μL) into the peritoneum of mice injected 4 hr prior with either the wild-type (WT) PDZ peptide or the mutant PDZ peptide (7.5 mg/kg/30 μL, i.v.).

Screening of immune cells was performed for immature/mature neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages in the spleen from the mice by flow cytometry. Although proliferative immature/mature neutrophils were examined after treatment with LPS, the effect of PDZ peptide on an LPS-induced neutrophil lineage was unclear. To investigate this phenomenon, the neutrophil fraction was analyzed with CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). LPS significantly increased the percentage of total neutrophils. The WT PDZ peptide robustly decreased total neutrophils, however, the mut PDZ peptide increased compared to WT PDZ-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). Analyzing total neutrophils in the spleen, there were two populations of neutrophils: a population of CXCR2 +Ly6G+ neutrophils (Mature) and a second population of CXCR2-Ly6Glo/+ neutrophils (immature) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Both immature and mature neutrophils were dramatically increased by LPS. Importantly, the WT PDZ peptide robustly decreased both immature and mature neutrophils, however, mut PDZ peptide increased them compared to WT PDZ-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Next, LPS markedly increased the percentage of CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>int</sup> monocytes. There were no differences between the WT PDZ- and mut PDZ-treated mice in the spleen. However, the CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages were dramatically increased in the LPS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>). The WT PDZ peptide robustly decreased macrophages, however, the mut PDZ peptide increased compared to WT PDZ-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>). Lastly, to examine whether the PDZ peptide could regulate the M1 and M2 macrophages population and polarization in vivo, spleen cells were stained to characterize the cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). The F480 +CD86+ M1 macrophages were dramatically increased in the LPS-treated mice. The WT PDZ peptide remarkably decreased M1 macrophages, however, mut PDZ peptide increased compared to WT PDZ-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). The percentage of F4/80+CD206+M2 macrophages were also increased in the LPS-treated mice, however, there were no significant differences between the WT PDZ- and mut PDZ-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). More importantly, there were no significant differences of the M1/M2 ratio between the LPS- and mut PDZ-treated mice, whereas the ratio was dramatically decreased in WT PDZ-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). The decrease in the M1/M2 ratio meant that the M2 was relatively increased, suggesting that WT PDZ peptide can inhibit M1 macrophage polarization and promotes M2 macrophage polarization to decrease LPS-induced systemic inflammation. These results show that WT PDZ peptide may inhibit LPS-induced tissue damage and systemic inflammation by regulating the population of immune cells to keep homeostasis during LPS-induced systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>NF-κB- mediated gene expression levels are downregulated in PDZ peptide-treated cells</title><p>Although the physiological function of PDZ peptide has become increasingly important in systemic inflammation, the signaling pathway has not yet been fully elucidated. To identify PDZ-mediated signaling, we performed RNA sequencing analysis. The results of RNA-seq analysis showed the expression pattern of 24,424 genes according to each comparison combination, of which the results showed the similarity of 51 genes overlapping in four gene categories and the similarity between each comparison combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). As a result, compared to the control group, it was confirmed that LPS alone, WT PDZ+LPS, and mut PDZ+LPS were all upregulated above the average value in each gene, and when LPS treatment alone was compared with WT PDZ+LPS, it was confirmed that they were averaged or downregulated. When comparing LPS treatment alone and mut PDZ+LPS, it was confirmed that about half of the genes were upregulated. Regarding the similarity between comparison combinations, the comparison combination with LPS/Control and the comparison combination with WT PDZ+LPS/Control showed the most similar gene patterns, followed by the comparison combination with mut PDZ+LPS/Control. The comparison combination of WT PDZ+LPS/LPS and mut PDZ+LPS/LPS showed similar genetic patterns. Similarity between genes showed that inflammation-related genes had increased expression in the LPS/Control, WT PDZ+LPS/Control, and mut PDZ+LPS/Control treatment groups. NF-kB signaling pathway appeared most frequently in WT PDZ+LPS/LPS (91.46%), Inflammatory autoimmunity appeared most frequently in mut PDZ+LPS/LPS (47.75%), and inflammatory cytokines receptors and inflammasomes also appeared in mut PDZ+LPS/LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). It appeared the most at 33.33% and 61.42%. In addition, increased and decreased expression of genes in the inflammatory cytokines receptors gene category was observed in LPS/Control, WT PDZ+LPS/LPS, and mut PDZ+LPS/LPS. In addition, the STRING database was used to represent protein-protein interactions of genes in RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). In the network shown, genes served as nodes and edges served as protein-protein associations. The line thickness at the network edge indicated the strength of data support. Interaction scores were considered to have minimal reliability at 0.400. Focusing on NF-kB, mTOR, REL, SAA1, and CXCL3 had strong protein-protein interactions. Therefore, we thought the NF-kB signaling would be dominated for the anti-inflammatory signaling of PDZ peptide.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Comparison of mRNA expression in PDZ-treated BEAS-2B cells.</title><p>BEAS-2B cells were treated with wild-type PDZ or mutant PDZ peptide for 24 hr and then incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2 hr, after which RNA sequencing analysis was performed.

Based on the results of RNA-sequencing analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), to investigate which signal transduction pathway is induced in the cells stimulated by LPS, LPS was treated in a time-dependent manner. The Western blot analysis was performed using several phospho-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). LPS-induced the phosphorylation of iκB and p65 was significantly peaked at 4 hr and the expression of iNOS by LPS reached a maximum at 30 min and decreased. However, no change in total κB and p65 expressions was observed. Phosphorylation of Drp1 was performed to observe it at the protein level. The phosphorylation of Drp1 by LPS reached a maximum at 4 hr. Interestingly, wild-type PDZ peptide significantly inhibited the expression of iNOS and the phosphorylation of iκB, p65, and Drp1, but not mutant PDZ peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>), suggesting that NF-κB signaling and ROS production appear to be closely related during PDZ-restored mitochondria dynamics. In addition, we investigated whether wild-type PDZ peptides can alter the expression of specific marker proteins for M1 and M2 polarization. Wild-type PDZ peptide significantly decreased the expression of M1 marker protein (mIL-6, mIL-8, and mTNF-α) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In addition, the expression of M2 marker protein (mIL-10 and mMRC-1) were increased at 1 hr after the treatment of LPS, but not mFizz-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>).

In the present study, we hypothesized that a tight junction protein could affect systemic inflammatory response in LPS-administered mice. The main results are as follows: PDZ peptide administration into LPS-challenged mice significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production in plasma and BALF and diminished oxidative stress in the kidney; PDZ peptide downregulated immune cell population in spleen cells. Thus, the data indicate the PEGylated PDZ peptide as a therapeutic candidate for LPS-induced acute systemic inflammation.</p><p>The ZO-1 protein includes protein-protein interaction domains (three PDZ domains) and signaling domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hung and Sheng, 2002</xref>). In addition, the ZO-1 protein consists of SH3 and catalytically inactive GuK domains. In our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2020</xref>), the PDZ peptide strongly inhibited LPS- or PM2.5-induced airway inflammation in the mice respiratory tract. The physiological functions identified were as follows: PDZ peptide strongly suppressed LPS- or PM2.5-induced F-actin polymerization to result in decreased airway inflammation. Also, expression of CXCR2 as the receptor for IL-8 secretion activated by LPS was significantly inhibited by PDZ, whereas RGS12 expression that has a GTPase-activating function increased after PDZ peptide treatment and downregulated CXCR2 receptor activation. However, these phenomena were confined to only the respiratory tract. We could not determine whether ZO-1 is involved in LPS-induced systemic inflammation or if the PDZ peptide could downregulate systemic inflammation. Therefore, we are currently investigating the physiological symptoms of systemic inflammation caused by LPS in <italic>ZO-1</italic> conditional knock-out mice.</p><p>In the present study, the PEGylated PDZ peptide was considered an innovative therapeutic candidate to decrease LPS-induced systemic inflammation in mice. However, although colistin has poor efficacy and renal toxicity, it is a powerful antibiotic used as a last resort to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sabnis et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, treatment failure occurs frequently, and the efficacy of colistin is very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paul et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MacNair et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Satlin et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, colistin has significant renal and neurological side effects that generate oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spapen et al., 2011</xref>). However, the PDZ peptide in the present study did not have any side-effects and decreased ROS generation in renal mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Nevertheless, the physiological mechanisms by which the PDZ peptide can control LPS-induced systemic inflammation in mice and the signal molecules involved, especially in the downstream signaling of G-protein, remain unclear. Hypothetically, because PDZ has a TAT sequence as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), the peptide easily enters the mitochondria to regulate ROS generation. The PDZ peptide inhibited iNOS and eNOS activities in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B; data not shown), but the mut PDZ peptide did not. In our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim and Song, 2022</xref>), LPS secreted many cytokines and/or chemokines extracellularly to signaling pathways associated with inflammation to nearby cells, inducing severe cytokine storm in several organs. However, the PDZ peptide strongly inhibited these extracellular secretions at the cellular level. Because the PDZ domain can bind to many signaling-related proteins through PDZ-PDZ interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee and Zheng, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gisler et al., 2008</xref>), the signaling complex might regulate systemic inflammation. To investigate PDZ-binding partners in mammalian cells, the GST:PDZ complex was immunoprecipitated from BEAS-2B cells transfected with the construct. The binding proteins are currently being identified using tandem mass spectrometry analysis.</p><p>Neutrophils dominate the initial stage of inflammation by pathogen invasion, and macrophages are activated and differentiated by receiving signals from the microenvironment of damaged tissues, which are coordinated by the expression of numerous cytokines and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Butterfield et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, neutrophils and macrophages perform various roles, such as the defense of the body from pathogens, regulation of the inflammatory environment, tissue development, homeostasis, etc., and are therapeutic targets related to a wide range of inflammation. The spleen functions as a unique extramedullary reservoir for myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Recently, Deniset et al. revealed the existence of two distinct neutrophil populations within the red pulp (RP) of the spleen: the mature Ly6G<sup>high</sup> neutrophils, and the immature Ly6G<sup>int</sup> neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deniset et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, in the present study, the relationship between PDZ peptide and two distinct neutrophil populations was investigated in the spleen. The percentage and number of total neutrophils dramatically increased by LPS treatment were significantly decreased by WT PDZ peptide, but mut PDZ peptide increased them compared to the WT PDZ peptide. These results, also, were the same in the analysis of immature and mature neutrophils. Interestingly, the proportion of immature neutrophils was much higher than that of mature neutrophils during LPS-induced systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These were similar to the results found by Deniset et al. That is, after infection with <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic>, Ly6G<sup>high</sup> mature neutrophils within the RP of the spleen were replenished by Ly6G<sup>int</sup> immature neutrophils. This phenomenon was thought to be due to the local increase of Ly6G<sup>int</sup> immature neutrophils as a consequence of an extramedullary hematopoiesis and their differentiation into Ly6G<sup>high</sup> mature neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deniset et al., 2017</xref>). Next, we investigated the changes in monocytes and macrophages by PDZ peptide during LPS-induced systemic inflammation. Although the WT PDZ peptide did not reduce the increased monocytes caused by LPS-induced inflammation, it dramatically decreased the percentage and number of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In particular, the WT PDZ peptide dramatically reduced the M1 macrophages increased by LPS and significantly decreased the M1/M2 ratio, thereby promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The results indicated that the proinflammatory microenvironment of the LPS challenge might increase M1 macrophage polarization by inflammatory cytokines and/or chemokines inhibiting M2 macrophage polarization. However, the WT PDZ peptide treatment significantly inhibited M1 polarization to activate M2 polarization. Therefore, the results of the present study demonstrate an innovative therapeutic candidate for an increased ratio of M2 macrophages in the immune cell population during LPS-induced systemic inflammation. In addition, the PDZ peptide can alter the immature/mature neutrophil ratio and population of immune cells. These results indicate that the PDZ peptide may up-regulate the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and/or chemokines such as IL-4, TGF-β, IL-13, IL-10, and M-CSF to polarize M2 macrophages and the population of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Ismail, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kong et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, if the mechanism of M1/M2 polarization of macrophages and recovery of inflammatory tissue could be identified using PDZ peptide in vivo, it may apply to the study of various diseases caused by macrophages.</p><p>Recently, mitochondria have an important role in the control of inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marchi et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, mitochondria have emerged as being necessary for both the establishment and maintenance of innate and adaptive immune cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sandhir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weinberg et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we focused on the key function of mitochondria in regulating the innate immune response and the mitochondrial dysfunction known to be promoted by inflammation, we investigated whether mitochondria that modulate inflammatory signaling are regulated by PDZ peptides. LPS-induced mitochondrial membrane integrity and fission are critical in the inflammatory response, and we showed that PDZ regulates LPS-induced systemic inflammation by modulating these phenomena. These results can be explained as follows: (1) PDZ peptide inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB signal pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). While it is already known that NF-κB signaling plays an important role in mitochondria dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Laforge et al., 2016</xref>), this is the first study to show that inhibition of NF-kB signaling by PDZ affected the mitochondrial dynamics. (2) ROS production by iNOS also was suppressed by the PDZ peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). ROS induced by potassium deprivation increased the phosphorylation of Drp1 to mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cid-Castro and Morán, 2021</xref>). Although more precise studies are needed, the inhibition of iNOS expression by PDZ peptide inhibited ROS formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6f</xref>). (3) The phosphorylation of Drp1 has been known to be critical for mitochondria fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xie et al., 2020</xref>). The phosphorylation of Drp1 was significantly decreased by PDZ peptide in LPS-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and f</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the function of PDZ peptide can regulate the mitochondrial dynamics, and is a very important phenomenon that suppresses LPS-induced systemic inflammation through the mitochondria dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>).</p><p>In summary, two analyses of organ injury and spleen cells were used in the present study to understand the relationship between tissue injury and immune cells. We hypothesized that treatment with PDZ peptide at the early stage of LPS-induced infection would downregulate the inflammatory progress by activating homeostatic tight junction proteins and anti-inflammatory responses. Therefore, the PDZ peptide may be a therapeutic candidate for LPS-induced systemic inflammation including that of human pulmonary diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Peptide PEGylation</title><p>Both wild-type (WT) PDZ and mutant PDZ (mut PDZ) peptides were synthesized by Peptron (Daejeon, Korea).

They explored the mechanism of anti-systemic inflammatory action of PDZ peptides, which enhanced M1/M2 polarization and induced the proliferation of M2 macrophages. Additionally, they insisted the physiological mechanism that inhibited the production of ROS in mitochondria, thereby preventing systemic inflammation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In the absence of specific treatments for septic shock or sepsis, the study demonstrating that tight junction-based PDZ peptides inhibit systemic inflammation caused by LPS is highly commendable. Whereas previous research focused on antibiotics, this study proves that modifying parts of intracellular proteins can significantly suppress symptoms caused by septic shock. The authors expanded the study of localized inflammation caused by LPS or PM2.5 in the respiratory tract to systemic inflammation, presenting promising results. They not only elucidated the physiological mechanism by identifying the transcriptome through RNA sequencing but also demonstrated that PDZ peptides inhibit the production of ROS in mitochondria and prevent mitochondrial fission. This research is highly regarded as an excellent study with potential as a treatment for septic shock or sepsis.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) They Focused intensively on acute inflammation for a short duration instead of chronic inflammation.</p><p>(2) LPS was used to induce septic shock but administrating actual microbes such as <italic>E. coli</italic> would yield more accurate results.</p><p>(3) The authors used pegylated peptides, but future research should utilize the optimized peptides to derive the optimal peptide, and further, PK/PD studies are also necessary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95285.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Hyun-Chae</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kosin University College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Busan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Sun-Hee</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kosin University College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Busan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jeong</surname><given-names>Hye Min</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kosin University College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Busan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Goeun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Pukyong National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Busan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Sung In</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Pukyong National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Busan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jeongtae</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kosin University College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Busan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>Jaewon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kosin University College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Busan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Yeong-Min</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sejong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Kyoung Seob</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kosin University College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Busan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>(1) Peptides were synthesized with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Tat tag, and then PEGylated with methoxy PEG Succinimidyl Succinate.</p><p>I have two concerns about the peptide design.

However, the use of mut PDZ does not result in significant changes. Figure 3A shows inflammatory cells within the central vein, yet no substantial hepatotoxicity is observed during the 5-day treatment with LPS. Normally, the ranges of ALT and AGT in C57BL6 mice are 16 ~ 200 U/L and 46 ~ 221 U/L, respectively, according to UCLA Diagnostic Labs. Therefore, the values in all experiments fall within these normal ranges. In summary, a 5-day treatment with LPS induces inflammation in the liver but is too short a duration to induce hepatotoxicity, resulting in lower values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) MitoTraker Green FM shouldn't produce red images in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed new results (GREEN one) into Figs 6A and B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 5.

The results of RNA-seq analysis showed the expression pattern of 24,424 genes according to each comparison combination, of which the results showed the similarity of 51 genes overlapping in 4 gene categories and the similarity between each comparison combination (Figure 5a). As a result, compared to the control group, it was confirmed that LPS alone, WT PDZ+LPS, and mut PDZ+LPS were all upregulated above the average value in each gene, and when LPS treatment alone was compared with WT PDZ+LPS, it was confirmed that they were averaged or downregulated. When comparing LPS treatment alone and mut PDZ+LPS, it was confirmed that about half of the genes were upregulated.

Comparison of mRNA expression in PDZ-treated BEAS-2B cells.</p><p>BEAS-2B cells were treated with wild-type PDZ or mutant PDZ peptide for 24 h and then incubated with LPS for 2 h, after which RNA sequencing analysis was performed. (a) The heat map shows the general regulation pattern of about 51 inflammation-related genes that are differentially expressed when WT PDZ and mut PDZ are treated with LPS, an inflammatory substance. All samples are RED = upregulated and BLUE = downregulated relative to the gene average. Each row represents a gene, and the columns represent the values of the control group treated only with LPS and the WT PDZ and mut PDZ groups with LPS. This was used by converting each log value into a fold change value. All genes were adjusted to have the same mean and standard deviation, the unit of change is the standard deviation from the mean, and the color value range of each row is the same. (b) Significant genes were selected using Gene category chat (Fold change value of 2.00 and normalized data (log2) value of 4.00). The above pie chart shows the distribution of four gene categories when comparing LPS versus control, WT PDZ+LPS/LPS, and mut PDZ+LPS/LPS. The bar graph below shows RED=upregulated, GREEN=downregulated for each gene category, and shows the number of upregulated and downregulated genes in each gene category. (c) The protein-protein interaction network constructed by the STRING database differentially displays commonly occurring genes by comparing WT PDZ+LPS/LPS, mut PDZ+LPS/LPS, and LPS. These nodes represent proteins associated with inflammation, and these connecting lines denote interactions between two proteins. Different line thicknesses indicate types of evidence used in predicting the associations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>(1) In this paper, the authors demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of PDZ peptide by inhibition of NF-kB signaling. Are there any results on the PDZ peptide-binding proteins (directly or indirectly) that can regulate LPS-induced inflammatory signaling pathway? Elucidation of the PDZ peptide-its binding partner protein and regulatory mechanisms will strengthen the author's hypothesis about the anti-inflammatory effects of PDZ peptide.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the Discussion section, we believe it is crucial to identify proteins that directly interact with PDZ and regulate it. This direct interaction can modulate intracellular signaling pathways, so we plan to express GST-PDZ and induce binding with cellular lysates, then characterize it using the LC-Mass/Mass method. We intend to further research these findings and submit them for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors presented interesting insights into the therapeutic role of the PDZ motif peptide of ZO-1. PDZ domains are protein-protein interaction modules found in a variety of species. It has been thought that many cellular and biological functions, especially those involving signal transduction complexes, are affected by PDZ-mediated interactions. What is the rationale for selecting the core sequence that regulates inflammation among the PDZ motifs of ZO-1 shown in Figure 1A?</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale for selecting the core sequence that regulates inflammation among the PDZ motifs of ZO-1, as shown in Figure 1A, is grounded in the specific roles these motifs play in signal transduction pathways that are crucial for inflammatory processes. PDZ domains are recognized for their ability to function as scaffolding proteins that organize signal transduction complexes, crucial for modulating cellular and biological functions. The chosen core sequence is particularly important because it is conserved across ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3, indicating a fundamental role in maintaining cellular integrity and signaling pathways. This conservation suggests that the sequence’s involvement in inflammatory regulation is not only significant in ZO-1 but also reflects a broader biological function across the ZO family.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 3, the authors showed the representative images of IHC, please add the quantification analysis of Iba1 expression and PAS-positive cells using Image J or other software.

To examine whether WT PDZ peptide can alter LPS-induced tissue damage in the kidney, cell toxicity assay was performed (Figure 3g). LPS induced cell damage in the kidney, however, WT PDZ peptide could significantly alleviate the toxicity, but mut PDZ peptide could not.

It would be good to add an experiment on changes in M1 and M2 markers caused by PDZ peptides in human monocyte cells (for example, THP-1).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for your comments. To determine whether PDZ peptide regulates M1/M2 polarization in human monocytes, we examined changes in M1 and M2 gene expression in THP-1 cells. As a result, wild-type PDZ significantly suppressed the expression of M1 marker genes (hlL-1β, hIL-6, hIL-8, hTNF-ɑ), while increasing the expression of M2 marker genes (hlL-4, hIL-10, hMRC-1). However, mutant PDZ did not affect M1/M2 polarization. These results suggest that PDZ peptide can suppress inflammation by regulating M1/M2 polarization of human monocyte cells.
