(RNS). In many host plants, this occurs via transcellular tubular structures (infection threads - ITs) that extend across cell layers via polar tip-growth. Comparative phylogenomic studies have identified <italic>RPG</italic> (<italic>RHIZOBIUM-DIRECTED POLAR GROWTH</italic>) among the critical genetic determinants for bacterial infection. In <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, <italic>RPG</italic> is required for effective IT progression within root hairs but the cellular and molecular function of the encoded protein remains elusive. Here, we show that RPG resides in the protein complex formed by the core endosymbiotic components VAPYRIN (VPY) and LUMPY INFECTION (LIN) required for IT polar growth, co-localizes with both VPY and LIN in IT tip- and perinuclear-associated puncta of <italic>M. truncatula</italic> root hairs undergoing infection and is necessary for VPY recruitment into these structures. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) of phosphoinositide species during bacterial infection revealed that functional RPG is required to sustain strong membrane polarization at the advancing tip of the IT. In addition, loss of RPG functionality alters the cytoskeleton-mediated connectivity between the IT tip and the nucleus and affects the polar secretion of the cell wall modifying enzyme NODULE PECTATE LYASE (NPL). Our results integrate RPG into a core host machinery required to support symbiont accommodation, suggesting that its occurrence in plant host genomes is essential to co-opt a multimeric protein module committed to endosymbiosis to sustain IT-mediated bacterial infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>legume</kwd><kwd>nodulation</kwd><kwd>infection thread</kwd><kwd>symbiosis</kwd><kwd>polarity</kwd><kwd>rhizobia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1172165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ott</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>431626755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ott</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>39093984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ott</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>414136422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ott</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>426849454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ott</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201708080016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Infectosomes enabling polar progression of infection threads in legume roots require the symbioisis-related RPG protein that functions as an organizer of these structures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Legumes have evolved the capacity to maintain a mutualistic association with endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, hosting them in specialized lateral root organs, the nodules, where bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) to ammonia (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and release it to the plant in exchange for carbohydrates. By granting them access to an additional source of nitrogen, the RNS allows plants to overcome nitrogen limitations occurring in terrestrial ecosystems and agriculturally used sites. Thus, the transfer of this ability to cereals has been identified as one possible strategy to reduce the use of environmentally harmful and expensive industrial fertilizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oldroyd and Dixon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pankievicz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rogers and Oldroyd, 2014</xref>). Such an engineering approach, however, requires an in-depth understanding of the molecular machinery allowing rhizobial infections of legume roots.</p><p>In most cases, this host-controlled process requires a molecular dialogue between the partners, which involves the perception of bacterial lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) molecules called Nod factors (NFs) by plasma membrane-resident receptor complexes including the <italic>M. truncatula</italic> LysM receptor-like kinase NFP and its <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> ortholog NFR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Limpens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Radutoiu et al., 2003</xref>). Symbiont recognition triggers the onset of a signaling cascade involving the generation and decoding of nuclear-associated calcium oscillations, which mediates symbiosis-related gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the same pathway is activated by the perception of diffusible signals produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, including both LCOs and short-chain chitooligosaccharides (COs), although these are perceived by a different combination of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). This common symbiosis signaling pathway shares a number of genetic components including the machinery to decode the specific calcium signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kistner et al., 2005</xref>) and a few downstream factors such as VPY, a Major Sperm Domain- and ankyrin-repeat-containing protein, that is required for both symbiotic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pumplin et al., 2010</xref>). Although some structural features are shared between the AM symbiosis and RNS during intracellular colonization, others are remarkably different. A whole set of those RNS-specific responses is controlled by the master regulator NIN, a transcription factor orchestrating the transcriptional reprogramming of cells required to sustain bacterial accommodation and concomitant cell proliferation to induce the formation of a nodule primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schauser et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vernié et al., 2015</xref>). This spatial and temporal coordination of infection and nodule organogenesis represents a hallmark of RNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oldroyd and Downie, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Intracellular invasion of rhizobia is uniquely enabled by a membrane-confined transcellular tunnel called the IT. In many legumes such as <italic>M. truncatula</italic> and <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, IT formation is initiated from an infection chamber (IC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fournier et al., 2015</xref>) that forms upon curling of a growing root hair and subsequent entrapping of rhizobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Callaham and Torrey, 1981</xref>). Repolarization of targeted secretion towards this compartment enables local cell wall modifications (e.g. by secretion of the NPL to the IC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>) leading to its radial expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fournier et al., 2015</xref>) and a highly confined local invagination of the plasma membrane, which marks the onset of IT initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gage, 2004</xref>). The IT then extends through the trichoblast and subsequently progresses transcellular through the root cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Libbenga and Harkes, 1973</xref>). IT maintenance and progression require a highly coordinated interplay between the migrating nucleus, a cytosolic column ahead of the IT, actin, and dense microtubule arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fournier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perrine-Walker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qiu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yokota et al., 2009</xref>). IT propagation in underlying cortical tissues is supported by local cell wall modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Su et al., 2023a</xref>) and repolarization of these cells, forming pre-infection thread (PIT) structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Brussel et al., 1992</xref>). This ensures guidance of the symbionts towards the newly divided cortical cells constituting the core of the nodule primordium. There, rhizobia are released from the ITs into the host cell, where they differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vasse et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>Over the last decades, reverse and forward genetics have identified several genes required for bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tsyganova et al., 2021</xref>). Among these is <italic>RPG</italic>, which is specifically expressed upon rhizobial inoculation and encodes a protein of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrighi et al., 2008</xref>). A loss of RPG in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> results in the development of aberrant ITs and poorly colonized nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrighi et al., 2008</xref>). Nuclear localization of RPG when heterologously over-expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaf epidermal cells suggested a putative role as a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrighi et al., 2008</xref>), but its cellular and molecular function in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> has not been understood in detail. The protein, however, recently re-gained great attention, when two independent comparative phylogenomic studies identified <italic>NFP</italic>, <italic>NIN,</italic> and <italic>RPG</italic> as the only genes that have been consistently lost in non-nodulating species belonging to the Fagales/Fabales/Cucurbitales/Rosales (FaFaCuRo) clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Griesmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Velzen et al., 2018</xref>). This evolutionary pattern linking these genes and the ability to form RNS makes them prime candidates for engineering symbiotic nitrogen fixation in cereals.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that RPG is an essential component of the infectosome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roy et al., 2020</xref>). This multi-protein assembly associates with the very tip of growing ITs and with the nuclear periphery. A loss-of-function mutation in <italic>RPG</italic> entirely blocks the recruitment of VPY to infectosome foci. Furthermore, a highly confined membrane polarity domain at the IT tip, cytoskeleton connectivity between this site, and the nucleus and targeted secretion to the IT are aberrant in a <italic>rpg</italic> mutant. Thus, we propose that RPG provides specificity to a conserved cellular machinery that enables rhizobial accommodation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>RPG</italic> controls the development of infection thread structures in <italic>M. truncatula</italic></title><p>An ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutant of <italic>M. truncatula</italic> accession A17 (hereafter named <italic>rpg-1,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was previously reported to develop enlarged ITs and poorly colonized nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrighi et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that <italic>RPG</italic> is required for rhizobial infection. In order to genetically confirm this function, we isolated a second independent, homozygous mutant allele from the <italic>M. truncatula Tnt1</italic> transposon insertion collection in the R108 accession carrying an insertion at 948 bp downstream of the start codon (NF11990, hereafter named <italic>rpg-2</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Confocal imaging of infected root hairs 35 days post-inoculation (dpi) with a fluorescent GFP-tagged strain of the compatible symbiont <italic>S. meliloti</italic> (<italic>S. meliloti</italic>-GFP) revealed similar alterations of IT morphology in both <italic>rpg</italic> mutants, with ITs showing a distinctive bulbous and thick appearance compared to straight and thin ITs of their corresponding wild-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To better characterize and quantitatively evaluate this peculiar IT phenotype, we scored the diameter of the tube at three different points along the IT (proximal to the infection chamber, intermediate and distal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While the diameter size of ITs developed by the wild-types had little variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), reflecting the tight regulation exerted by the host over the development of this tubular structure, the diameter of ITs formed in roots of the <italic>rpg</italic> mutants was highly variable, and significantly wider at all measure points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To further extend localization pattern analysis, we additionally produced N-terminal mCherry fusions of the full-length protein (RPG-FL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and all truncated variants. Functionality of the constructs was first assessed by testing their capability to genetically complement IT morphology when expressed in <italic>rpg-1</italic> roots under the control of a functional native <italic>RPG</italic> promoter. For this, we used <italic>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</italic>-mediated gene transfer, generating composite plants having stably transformed roots but unaltered shoot genotypes, each representing an independent transformant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boisson-Dernier et al., 2001</xref>). Composite plants expressing mCherry-RPG-FL phenocopied the WT-like IT morphology, indicating that N-terminal tagging does not impair protein functionality during IT development within root hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the sole coiled-coil region of RPG (mCherry-RPG-CC) was equally able to significantly restore the morphological defects of <italic>rpg-1</italic> ITs, even though with lower efficiency when directly compared to RPG-FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). This ability was fully dependent on the N-terminal 143 aa of this region, as expression of mCherry-RPG-tCC did not rescue the <italic>rpg-1</italic> IT phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). These data suggest that major molecular determinants conferring functionality to RPG reside in its coiled-coil domain. This was further supported by the fact that the mCherry-NT variant alone did not restore normal IT growth in the <italic>rpg-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). On the other side, the lower complementation efficacy of mCherry-RPG-CC compared to mCherry-RPG-FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) clearly indicates the relevance of the N-terminal region for full RPG functionality and further suggests that the NLS, the NT-C2 domain, and the disordered region might constitute an important regulatory unit required to fine-tune the protein function or regulate its stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RPG resides in infectosome foci hosting the VPY-LIN-EXO70H4 protein complex</title><p>To analyze RPG localization patterns, we performed live-cell imaging of WT <italic>M. truncatula</italic> roots (A17) expressing mCherry-RPG-FL under the control of the native <italic>RPG</italic> promoter. Following rhizobial inoculation, the RPG protein consistently coalesced into a few discrete cytoplasmic puncta that were visible in both uninfected and infected root hairs imaged 4–7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In uninfected root hairs, such puncta were found in the vicinity of the tip (uRH; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) while in curled root hairs at the early stage of infection, these puncta were located in close proximity to the IC, and adjacent to the entrapped bacteria (IC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In root hairs harboring growing ITs, RPG-labeled puncta were systematically present in the perinuclear cytoplasm and associated with the tip of the extending IT (IT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Closer inspection showed that IT tip-associated puncta formed a patch juxtaposed to the growing IT tip ahead of progressing bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When ITs exhibited multiple branches, RPG-labeled puncta were associated with the tip of each branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Alongside with such punctate patterning, a diffuse RPG signal was also detectable in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of most, though not all, infected root hairs (18/28), but its intensity was orders of magnitudes weaker compared to the signal intensity detected in the puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>) and thus currently not accessible for functional analysis. Altogether, these data indicate that RPG preferentially accumulates in cytoplasmic puncta associated with infection sites during bacterial accommodation within root hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is in contrast to the exclusive nuclear localization previously reported for RPG when being ectopically expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrighi et al., 2008</xref>). While we also observed nuclear accumulation of RPG upon constitutive, heterologous over-expression in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves, we additionally observed RPG signal diffuse in the cytoplasm, accumulating in the nucleolus and in a few small cytoplasmic punctate structures associated to the perinuclear area but also found in other areas of pavement cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To facilitate the detection of these puncta, we co-expressed RPG with the viral silencing suppressor p19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Voinnet et al., 2003</xref>), which reduces post-transcriptional gene silencing impeding gene expression during Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johansen and Carrington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Voinnet et al., 2003</xref>). This enhanced the accumulation of RPG in punctate structures, although it concurrently led to the formation of large accumulations of the fusion protein in the perinuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), most likely caused by the high level of transgene expression reached under co-infiltration conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jay et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, the coalescence of RPG in cytoplasmic puncta occurs also in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> heterologous system, as similarly recently reported by a second independent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Rhizobium-directed polar growth (RPG) is a key component of the VPY-LIN-EXO70H4 infectosome complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Live-cell confocal images showing mCherry-RPG localization in root hairs of WT transgenic roots at 4–7 dpi with <italic>S. meliloti-</italic>GFP. mCherry-RPG accumulates in cytoplasmic punctate structures (arrowheads) which are found close to the apex of uninfected root hairs (uRH), in the vicinity of rhizobia entrapped within the infection chamber of curled root hairs (IC) and associated to the perinuclear cytoplasm and the tip of infection threads (IT).

Lifetime-based separation of channels in their major fluorescent components (left panel) via global fitting of the intensity decay profile maintains the signals of VPY-GFP (~2.5–2.7 ns) and of the nuclear-localized tandem NowGFP (~4.0 ns) in a single component (see focal plane 3). This is most likely due to the high photobleaching rate of the NowGFP compared to the GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">George Abraham et al., 2015</xref>), preventing the collection of enough photons originating from the nuclear marker to enable its discrimination as an isolated component. Determination of the spatial localization of the two different markers is achieved by analyzing the decay profile of the discrete region of interest (colored outlines, right panel) selected on the corresponding fluorescent channel (Ch1). The lifetime value (ns) of the signal from puncta (yellow) and from the cytoplasm (orange) is consistent with the predicted lifetime of the GFP, indicative of VPY accumulation. The signal in the nucleus of the cortical cell (green) exhibits a lifetime consistent with the predicted lifetime of the NowGFP, targeted to the nucleus via fusion with the NLS. Co-localization of VPY-GFP and NLS-2xNowGFP in the nucleus of the infected root hair cell (sky blue) is inferred from the shorter lifetime calculated in this region, resulting from the spatial overlap of the two fluorophores.

When expressed in this mutant background, mCherry-RPG-FL exhibited a comparable localization pattern to what was observed in the WT background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We found that both mCherry-RPG-CC and mCherry-RPG-tCC accumulated to bright punctate structures as mCherry-RPG-FL, while the mCherry-RPG-NT signal remained diffuse in the cytoplasm and preferentially accumulated in the nucleus of transformed root hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). These results indicate that the coiled-coil domain is necessary and sufficient for RPG localization to discrete puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and that the deletion of amino acid residues 331–473, although abolishing its functionality, does not affect its localization to these foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>). In addition, the consistent nuclear accumulation of mCherry-RPG-NT compared to the diffuse nucleo-cytoplasmic localization weakly detectable for RPG-FL, suggests that the coiled-coil domain determines the preferential retention of the protein in cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). It should, however, be noted that the accumulation of mCherry-RPG-CC at IT-tip associated puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref> - inset) occurred less frequently (7/22 root hairs harboring infection threads) compared to mCherry-RPG-FL (17/21 root hairs harboring infection threads), while both consistently labeled perinuclear or cytoplasmic puncta. This suggests that optimal targeting and/or accumulation of RPG to the IT tip relies on the presence of its N-terminal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which well correlates with the reduced capacity of RPG-CC to restore IT morphology in <italic>rpg-1</italic> transgenic roots in comparison to RPG-FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>The subcellular patterning of RPG resembles the recently described localization of the so-called ‘infectosome’ complex formed by VPY, LIN, and EXO70H4. These proteins systematically co-localize and interact in IT tip- and perinuclear-associated cytoplasmic puncta during root hair infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roy et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we tested whether RPG is a component of this protein assembly. For this, we first co-expressed mCherry-RPG and VPY-GFP under the control of their respective native promoters in roots of composite <italic>M. truncatula</italic> WT plants and imaged them at 4–7 dpi with <italic>S. meliloti</italic>-mCherry. Since the signal from co-expressed RPG- and VPY- fluorophore fusions was consistently weak, to improve its detection and to unambiguously distinguish it from background fluorescence, we applied Fluorescent Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM). By performing multiple cycles of excitation and detection of photon arrival times, this method increases the intensity of fluorescence emission. Furthermore, it allows to analyze its decay profile, thereby enabling an increased spatial resolution of genetically encoded fluorophores according to their particular lifetimes (GFP ~2.5–2.7 ns; mCherry ~1.4–1.5 ns, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarkisyan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seefeldt et al., 2008</xref>). It additionally allows the subtraction of the autofluorescence signal, having similar spectral characteristics but significantly shorter lifetimes (see materials and methods for more details). We found that mCherry-RPG co-localized with VPY-GFP in punctate structures located at the tip of the IT and in the cytoplasm connecting the nucleus to the IT tip of infected root hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>). A VPY-GFP signal of lower intensity was also diffusely visible in the cytoplasm and nucleus, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>), coinciding with a weak signal from RPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>). Co-expression of GFP-RPG with mCherry-LIN<italic>,</italic> the latter being transcriptionally driven by the constitutive <italic>Ubiquitin</italic> promoter from <italic>L. japonicus</italic> (pLjUbi), also resulted in distinct co-localization of the two proteins in root hairs undergoing infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A–C</xref>).

When using anti-RFP nanobody traps, GFP-RPG and mCherry-RPG co-purified with mCherry-EXO70H4 and VPY-GFP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>). To reciprocally validate these data, we performed these assays using anti-GFP nanobody traps. While GFP-RPG consistently co-precipitated with mCherry-EXO70H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7B</xref>), we were unable to pull sufficient amounts of VPY-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7C</xref>), suggesting that the majority of the VPY protein pool is not associated with RPG under these conditions. Since we experienced the same difficulties as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2023</xref>) when trying to purify recombinant RPG from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells<italic>,</italic> we are not able at this stage to biochemically address the interaction of RPG, VPY, and the other infectosome components. However, given the peculiar coalescence of all of these proteins in cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019b</xref> and this study; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), we decided to further genetically evaluate the impact of <italic>RPG</italic> on infectosome foci formation in <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, focusing on VPY as one of its central components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>RPG is necessary and sufficient for VPY recruitment to infectosome foci</title><p>Since the characteristic punctate localization of VPY is triggered by rhizobial inoculation and does not depend on functional LIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>), we hypothesized that VPY accumulation to infectosome foci may be triggered by and dependent on RPG. This is further supported by the fact that <italic>RPG</italic> expression is induced in root hairs starting from 2 days following inoculation with <italic>S. meliloti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrighi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we expressed VPY-GFP in roots of WT and <italic>rpg-1</italic> composite plants and visualized its spatial patterning in root hairs at 4–7 dpi with <italic>S. meliloti</italic>-mCherry. Indeed, while we systematically observed bright VPY-positive puncta in infected (18/19 in a total number of eight plants) and uninfected (6/8 in a total number of six plants) root hairs of transformed WT roots, a reliable signal of such punctate subcellular structures in <italic>rpg-1</italic> transformed root hairs was neither detected in infected (19/19 events in a total number of 10 plants) nor in uninfected (8/8 events in a total number of seven plants) root hairs. In all cases, VPY exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In a few instances (5/19 infection events found in 2 plants out of 10), we observed VPY accumulating close to bacteria entrapped within a curl, seemingly surrounding the site of membrane invagination occurring at the early stage of IT emergence, but no cytoplasmic or perinuclear-associated puncta were visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is in sharp contrast to what we observed in WT root hairs at a similar stage of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

FLIM-based confocal imaging initially yields an image (sum intensities) where the intensities of the different fluorescent components present in the scanned area are summed up. By applying n-exponential reconvolution of the fluorescence intensity decay profile of the whole image, the major fluorescent components are separated and a lifetime value is assigned to each of them. The number of components is determined according to a reduced chi-squared (χ2) criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>). The components exhibiting lifetime values ≤1.1 ns are considered as autofluorescence and are subtracted from the image. To determine with higher accuracy the enrichment of mCitrine-PH<sup>PLC</sup> at the apical membrane domain, the decay profile at a such region of interest (ROI) is analyzed. The lifetime is calculated via mathematical fitting, yielding a more precise estimation, as shown by the chi-squared (χ2) reaching values closer to one. A lifetime value of ~3 ns for mCitrine is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Söhnel et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, Phasor fingerprints of fluorescence emissions at the ROIs are generated using the fit-free Phasor approach, which assigns a position to each pixel in the ROI according to its composition in terms of fluorescent species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malacrida et al., 2021</xref>). Enrichment of the mCitrine-PH<sup>PLC</sup> biosensor at the apical membrane domain results in pixels forming a cloud positioned on or close to the semicircle in the left part of the plot, where long mono-exponential decays are located. The Phasor fingerprint is further converted to a point in an XY plot by measuring the center of mass of the pixel population in the Phasor image using ImageJ/(Fiji) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

Bacterial internalization requires profound restructuring of the host cell to form an infection thread compartment via polarized secretion of plasma membrane and cell wall material to a single focal point. Spatially and temporally coordinated polar progression of IT structures determines the establishment of a functional nitrogen-fixing association.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that RPG is a crucial modulator of the infectosome machinery sustaining the polar growth of intracellular ITs. RPG coalesces with VPY and LIN in IT tip- and perinuclear-associated puncta (infectosome foci, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A–C</xref>) and is indispensable for VPY recruitment into these cytoplasmic structures during IT progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). A cooperative function of RPG with the infectosome complex in regulating IT polar growth is consistent with the phenotypes of <italic>rpg</italic>, <italic>vpy,</italic> and <italic>lin</italic> mutants, exhibiting strong defects in the establishment and/or the maintenance of IT progression but not being affected in nodule organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Moreover, the peculiar enlargement of ITs developed by <italic>rpg</italic> mutants, indicative of a loss of unidirectional polarized growth, is well explained by the failure of <italic>rpg-1</italic> to maintain the typical VPY punctate localization observed in WT root hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Interestingly, infectosome-like and VPY-positive compartments have also been observed during the AM symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pumplin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>vpy</italic> mutants exhibit strong defects in this association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feddermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pumplin et al., 2010</xref>). Functionally, the accumulation of VPY in such compartments seems more important for full arbuscule development rather than for controlling initial fungal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindsay et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, the correlation between loss of VPY-recruitment into infectosome foci in the <italic>rpg</italic> mutant and its strong infection defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>) argues for a higher relevance, and perhaps extended function, of these cytoplasmic structures during bacterial accommodation. In line with this, we hypothesize that RPG serves as a specificity determinant for infectosome-related endo- and exocytotic events during RNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This is further supported by the transcriptional dependency of <italic>RPG</italic> from NIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soyano and Hayashi, 2014</xref>) and is in line with <italic>RPG</italic> being one of the few essential factors that have been lost in non-nodulating species of the FaFaCuRo clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Griesmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Velzen et al., 2018</xref>). Upon recruitment of VPY into the infectosome complex, it is further stabilized by LIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>). This can also be assumed for CERBERUS, the ortholog of LIN in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, which has been shown to stabilize VPY protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) and to interact with RPG in this closely related legume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Different from <italic>RPG</italic>, the genes encoding for VPY and LIN are retained in angiosperm species forming intracellular symbioses, together with those encoding for the central components of the common symbiosis signaling pathway CCaMK and CYCLOPS, which are essential for both AM and RNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Radhakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, VPY was recently proposed to coordinate signaling and cellular accommodation during AM by negatively regulating the nuclear-localized symbiosis signaling kinase CCaMK via direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindsay et al., 2022</xref>). If such regulatory function would be conserved during rhizobial infection, the ability of RPG to sequester VPY to cytoplasmic foci might additionally represent a way to modulate the input/output of a conserved endosymbiotic signaling circuit to adequately mediate bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for Rhizobium-directed polar growth (RPG) role during intracellular rhizobial infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During Root Nodule Symbiosis (RNS), NIN-dependent transcription of <italic>RPG</italic> (gray arrow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soyano and Hayashi, 2014</xref>) leads to accumulation of the encoded protein (black arrow) within infectosome foci hosting VAPYRIN (VPY), LUMPY INFECTION (LIN), and EXO70H4 (gray irregular round shape, this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>). The coalescence of VPY into cytoplasmic foci is fully dependent on RPG (curved arrow, this study), while LIN is required to stabilize VPY (dotted arrow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Since VPY and LIN belong to a conserved endosymbiotic signaling pathway including the core components CCaMK and CYCLOPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Radhakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>, blue dots), we propose that RPG serves as a specificity determinant for infectosome-related endo- and exocytotic events (double arrow) enabling IT-mediated rhizobial infection. This is further supported by the capacity of RPG to interact with the exocyst subunit EXO70H4 (rectangular arrow). RPG-dependent segregation of VPY in infectosome foci might additionally allow to modulate the symbiotic signaling circuit (gray dashed arrow), if the putative negative regulation exerted by VPY on CCaMK (dashed gray flat arrow) during AM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindsay et al., 2022</xref>) would be conserved during RNS.

It is, however, tempting to draw parallels to the so-called ‘polarisome,’ a macromolecular complex coordinating the polarized growth of yeasts and fungal hyphae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xie and Miao, 2021</xref>). Polarisomes are dense spot-like structures localized at the site of polarized growth and are formed by a number of core components and many cooperative interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xie and Miao, 2021</xref>). The polarisome is also required to maintain the Spitzenkörper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crampin et al., 2005</xref>), a vesicle supply center located at the tip during hyphal growth, whose positioning is correlated with growth directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Riquelme and Sánchez-León, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, a myosin protein has recently been shown to mediate focal packing of the polarisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dünkler et al., 2021</xref>). The structural similarity of the RPG C-terminal extension with myosins, as supported by structural predictions and as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrighi et al., 2008</xref>), and the RPG-dependent recruitment of VPY into discrete cytoplasmic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>), further supports the hypothesis that RPG functions as an organizational hub protein for infectosome assembly and polarity maintenance during intracellular rhizobial infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). It should, however, be considered that a vesicle-associated fraction of RPG, which is compatible with the predicted lipid binding capability of its NT-C2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang and Aravind, 2010</xref>), as well as of the other infectosome components outside the puncta might contribute to their functionalities. Although the diffuse cytoplasmic signal exhibited by RPG, VPY, LIN, and EXO70H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>) might represent a such a fraction, it cannot be reliably investigated at present due to the vesicle size and/or fluorescence intensity. Within the RPG protein, the core functional scaffolding element is the coiled-coil domain as it is sufficient to mediate the punctate localization of RPG and to complement IT progression in root hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-D</xref>). The latter is unlikely to be determined by transcript stability as all deletion variants were consistently detected as fluorescent proteins when performing live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-D</xref>).</p><p>Rendering the infectosome complex dysfunctional in <italic>rpg</italic> mutants results in the loss of the highly polarized membrane enrichment of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the IT tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>) and unconfined secretion of key factors such as NPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>) required for IT progression to the growing IT tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xie et al., 2012</xref>). As in many eukaryotic polarized systems, where localized exocytosis targets PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-rich membrane domains, accumulation of this phosphoinositide was also shown to occur on perimicrobial membranes during pathogenic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qin et al., 2020</xref>) and during AM symbiosis, where PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> specifically accumulated at the tips of intracellular linear hyphae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivanov and Harrison, 2019</xref>). In eukaryotes, the generation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> involves the phosphorylation of position 5 of PI4P catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5K) localized at the plasma membrane and in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colin and Jaillais, 2020</xref>). At least ten genes encoding for isoforms of this enzyme are contained in the Medicago genome and, interestingly, two of them are induced during infection thread development within root hairs (<italic>Medtr3g073100</italic>, <italic>Medtr7g089950</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>), one of which (<italic>Medtr7g089950</italic>) in a NIN<italic>-</italic>dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>). This further supports our data and suggests that increased PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> accumulation during infection might occur, at least in part, via transcriptional upregulation of its biosynthetic enzymes. However, the trafficking/activity of these and/or other PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-metabolizing enzymes are also likely to contribute to the observed membrane enrichment, which is possibly a result of complex feedback loops occurring between those enzymes and their protein effectors such as, for instance, small GTPases, as reported for other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>). In line with this, a ROP (Rho of a plant) GTPase and its GEF effector were shown to be required for infection thread growth in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), and expression of at least one gene encoding for a RopGEF is induced during IC and IT formation in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>). Ultimately, the generation of a stably polarized cell arises from the functional interplay between membrane-associated polarity circuits and consequent downstream cellular reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramalho et al., 2022</xref>), with localized exocytosis being central to the process of tip growth, as shown for pollen tube growth guidance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luo et al., 2017</xref>). It is noteworthy that maintenance of the IC and secretion of NPL into the symbiotic apoplastic compartment is unaltered in <italic>rpg</italic> mutants, but remains unconfined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). The capacity of RPG to interact with EXO70H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>) residing within infectosome foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>) is compatible with a model where RPG-mediated recruitment of this exocyst subunit could contribute to restrict the tethering of exocytotic vesicles at a single focal site to enable rapid tip growth and IT extension. In the absence of functional RPG, the slow growth caused by unrestricted secretion might negatively feedback on membrane polarization, as shown in yeast and fungi, where reduced growth rates have been linked to the destabilization of polar domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haupt et al., 2018</xref>). Such depolarization might, in turn, alter the cytoskeleton organization with consequent loss of active polar tip growth. Alongside with an alteration of the microtubule-based connectivity between the IT and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>), it is likely that actin rearrangements might as well be affected. While the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during infection thread progression will have to be investigated, several genes encoding for actin remodeling proteins were reported to be important for IT growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hossain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yokota et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qiu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miyahara et al., 2010</xref>) and actin dynamics were recently shown to be reduced upon inducible depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doumane et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data strongly support the hypothesis that IT polarity requires few specific factors like RPG but predominantly relies on a highly conserved mechanism as suggested earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yamazaki and Hayashi, 2015</xref>). While the secretion domain in curled root hairs comprises the entire IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fournier et al., 2015</xref>), the loss of highly restricted focal polarization results in uncoordinated expansion of such compartment and failure to maintain IT elongation. Indeed, while thin and elongated ITs are formed in root hairs of WT over the time period of our live-cell imaging analysis (4–8 dpi), the growth of infection structures developed within root hairs of the <italic>rpg-1</italic> mutant appears retarded and their shape is highly variable and irregular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). Continuous multiplication of bacteria within these structures then likely leads to their slow and unguided progression across root hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>), as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrighi et al., 2008</xref>) and further supported by the progressive disintegration of the EMT array and the increase distancing between the nucleus and the IT tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>), indicative of aborted active growth. Although polarization of the basal membrane domain in the respective trichoblasts and formation of PITs in the outer cortical cells are unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrighi et al., 2008</xref>), effective infection of nodules is impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), likely because a strictly defined time window that allows transcellular IT growth through recently divided cells is missed by these slowly growing ITs in the <italic>rpg</italic> mutant.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marie-Cécile Caillaud (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Three reviewers agreed that the work was fundamentally strong and interesting, but each also noted areas that could be clarified, and there was some concern about lack of quantification/replication in some experiments. The authors should either provide/present additional evidence, or temper their conclusions and claims.</p><p>1) Quantification of several cellular and tissue phenotypes is missing. For example, in Figure 5, please provide some other quantification of the MT and nuclear defects in rpg, or at least a few other representative images as a figure supplement. Please also address the quantification issues brought up by Reviewer 3 major points 1 + 3.</p><p>2) Replication of experiments and sample size is not always included. This information should be included in the legends and/or text for each. For replicated experiments, or those for which sample size is too small to make robust statistical conclusions, text and conclusions should be tempered to recognize this limitation.</p><p>3) In Co-IP experiments, the signals are rather weak for the interacting partner. The authors should address why the experiments were done in the manner they were (i.e., why did they isolate protoplasts, rather than directly extracting proteins from whole leaves. Surely most samples are lost during protoplasting). Also, co-IP results are typically validated both ways (not only A IPs B, but B also IPs A). Was this done? If not, the authors should temper the conclusions about interactions.</p><p>4) Help the reader parse complicated information by provide a diagrammatic model for the different molecular components (lipids, cytoskeleton, protein) they studied in the context of this biotic interaction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I found this an exciting and engaging story. It places a classic nodulation defective mutant into a plausible protein complex and provides solid support for its cellular role in maintaining the infection thread through high-quality imaging and phenotypic analysis. This work established a hierarchy of &quot;infectosome&quot; assembly using genetics and localization of components. I have no major experimental or data analysis concerns. In general, the figures are well laid out and the images are of excellent quality, so the data are easy to evaluate. The sample sizes and statistical measurements are appropriate for the conclusions the authors draw.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I enjoyed reading this meticulous work. It is very informative and the findings will be highly relevant to the field. However, I also have a number of puzzling observations. I raise them here in the order they appear:</p><p>1. In Figure 3A, panels on the right half show the localization inside the infection thread. However, the close-up (in particular panel 2 and 3) does not exactly match the dotted area in panel 1. Several GFP dots, representing bacteria, are missing in the close up. Did the authors happen to use different optical sections for the lower- and high-magnification images?</p><p>2. On Line 199 the authors stated that &quot;IT tip-associated puncta encased the growing IT tip&quot;. However in Figure 3-supplement 1A the RPG punctum does not look like a case of any sort. This seems an unnecessary overstatement.</p><p>3. In Figure 3-supplement 3D, why does the mCherry channel appear to be white even in the merged panel? This makes it hard to assess the claim that RPG-NT is mainly in the nucleus.</p><p>4. In the GFP panel of Figure 3B, how did the authors differentiate the signal of VPY-GFP from that of 3xNowGFP? I assume the latter is used as a transformation marker. Does the confocal settings avoid or exclude fluorescence from NowGFP? This is important, as it seems to be the basis for concluding that VPY-GFP &quot;was also diffusely visible in the cytoplasm&quot;.</p><p>5. The co-IP signals are rather weak for the interacting partner. Most often, co-IP results are validated both ways (not only A IPs B, but B also IPs A). Are the proteins expressed well? If they are, I wonder why the authors isolated protoplasts, rather than directly extracting proteins from whole leaves. Surely most samples are lost during protoplasting.</p><p>6. The rpg mutant does form elongating infection threads, albeit highly irregular ones. Yet in Figures 3E, 5A, and 5B, one cannot see the file of bacteria along the mutant root hair. The structure shown here in the rpg mutant is more akin to infection chambers. In 4A, the mutant seems to be just starting an infection thread. Why did the authors not choose elongating infection threads like they did in Figures 1B and 2B?</p><p>7. The distinct puncta of VPY disappears in the rpg mutant (Figure 3-supplement 5). Can the authors tell whether the cause is diffuse localization, reduced total protein levels, or reduced transcription in the absence of RPG?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors report larger infection threads in rpg mutants than in WT. Could the morphology of uninfected root hair in rpg mutant explain this phenotype? Quantification of the diameter of noninfected RH in WT and rpg mutants should allow the authors to rule out this hypothesis. Moreover, the author reported that TEM micrographs of nodule infected cells revealed &quot;larger IT structures present in nodule tissues of rpg-1 compared to WT but WT-like cell organization and symbiosome morphology&quot;: quantification is needed here.</p><p>2. To gain more insights into the structural requirements for RPG functionality, the authors generated a series of truncation derivatives and tested them for their capability to genetically complement rpg-1. They showed that the major molecular determinant conferring functionality to RPG resides in its coiled-coil domain. It is not clearly stated how the authors check that the constructs were expressed? It is particularly important for two variants that do not complement the rpg mutant. The authors should explain how they assessed that the constructs were stable and therefore the phenotype observed is not due to an absence of the truncated version but rather to a loss in its activity. It will be appreciated to have the number of independent transformants in the legend of the figure or in the panels (rather than in the material and method).</p><p>3. The authors clearly showed that RPG protein has a punctate localization. mCherry-RPG clearly co-localized with VPY-GFP in punctate structures located at the tip of the infection threads and in the cytoplasm connecting the nucleus to the infection threads tip of infected root hairs. However, quantifications are missing for all the data presented in Figure 3A-C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-D, Figure 3—figure supplement 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-D, Figure 3—figure supplement 4A-D.</p><p>4. The author showed that RPG co-purified with EXO70H4 and VPY indicating that these proteins indeed belong to the same complex. Moreover, they showed that the major molecular determinant conferring functionality to RPG resides in its coiled-coil domain. Does the CC domain important for RPG interaction with VAPYRIN (VPY)/mCherry-EXO70H4? Furthermore, there is no clear indication of the number of times this experiment has been replicated.</p><p>5. While no quantification is presented, the authors showed with clear illustrations that the mCherry-RPG-NT construct which does not complement the rpg mutant remained diffuse in the cytoplasm and preferentially accumulated in the nucleus of transformed root hairs. It would be interesting to repeat this analysis (mCherry-RPG-CC, mCherry-RPG-tCC, mCherry-RPG-NT) in WT plants: These complementary analyses will allow the authors to further evaluate if the function of RPG depends on its localization or on its interaction with protein partners.</p><p>6. In Figure 4, they reported that in uninfected growing root hairs, PI(4,5)P2 was enriched at the apical membrane domain while at the onset of infection PI(4,5)P2 was locally and specifically enriched at the membrane surrounding invading bacteria emerging from the infection chamber. The observations presented in Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 5 should be quantified. Did the authors try to over-express RPG and check for a potential increase in membrane polarity? How do these increases in PIP2 polarity occur? Is it via the transcriptional regulation of the PIP2 metabolism or via the trafficking/activity of the PIP2 regulating enzymes? Some pieces of information should be added at least in the discussion of the paper.</p><p>7. They further observed that local PI(4,5)P2 enrichment also occurred on the basal membrane of root hairs hosting polarized infection threads and on the apical membrane of underlying cortical neighboring cells. It is not clear to me how the authors know that this membrane belongs to the infected cell and is not part of another cell that is about to initiate a root hair. Imaging in 3D will help to understand the topology here.</p><p>8. Since nuclear movement appeared uncoupled from the infection threads' growth in rpg, the authors tested the implication of the MTs in this phenomenon. Even if the authors are citing other studies showing the role of MTs, it is not clear to me why the actin cytoskeleton was excluded from this analysis. Maybe the authors should consider discussing it, in particular since the actin cytoskeleton is important for polar growth and might be linked to PIP2 polarity.</p><p>9. By comparing microtubule organization in WT and rpg root hairs harboring the infection threads using live-cell imaging, they reported the loss of nuclear-mediated IT guidance occurs in rpg &quot;in the majority of the case&quot;, &quot;often&quot;. Please quantify more deeply the results obtained in Figure 5A (in particular in the corresponding text of the result section). Why the nucleus is not visible in magenta in the right panels?</p><p>10. Regarding the polar secretion of NPL which requires functional RPG, is there a direct role of the membrane polarization (or PIP2) in the exocytosis of cell wall modifying enzyme NODULE PECTATE LYASE (NPL)? Maybe some information could be added in the discussion of the manuscript about the general knowledge from the literature.</p><p>11. The authors should consider adding a model for the different molecular components they studied in the context of this biotic interaction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80741.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Quantification of several cellular and tissue phenotypes is missing.

On Line 199 the authors stated that &quot;IT tip-associated puncta encased the growing IT tip&quot;. However in Figure 3-supplement 1A the RPG punctum does not look like a case of any sort. This seems an unnecessary overstatement.</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased our statement referring to IT tip-associated puncta in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A as “a patch juxtaposed to the growing IT tip ahead of progressing bacteria”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 3-supplement 3D, why does the mCherry channel appear to be white even in the merged panel? This makes it hard to assess the claim that RPG-NT is mainly in the nucleus.</p></disp-quote><p>The apparent white coloring of the mCherry channel in the merge panel is due to the fact that mCherry-RPG-NT (green) perfectly co-localizes with the nuclear-localized tandem CPF (magenta) in the nucleus, giving white as a sum of the two opposite colors in the merge image. To further support the claim, and facilitate a comparison between the localization pattern of RPG-FL and RPG-NT, we have implemented in Figure 3—figure supplement 4 a plot of the intensity profile measured across the nucleus of infected root hairs presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the GFP panel of Figure 3B, how did the authors differentiate the signal of VPY-GFP from that of 3xNowGFP? I assume the latter is used as a transformation marker. Does the confocal settings avoid or exclude fluorescence from NowGFP? This is important, as it seems to be the basis for concluding that VPY-GFP &quot;was also diffusely visible in the cytoplasm&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, we apologize as we noticed we did a mistake in annotating the construct in the upper line of the panel, where pAtUbi::2xNowGFP should instead be pAtUbi::NLS-2xNowGFP, since we used a nuclear-targeted tandem NowGFP as transformation marker and not a cytosolic 2xNowGFP. We have now corrected this mistake. Beside this, the separation of the GFP and the NowGFP signal is based on their different lifetimes (GFP ~ 2.5-2.7 ns; Sarkisyan et al., 2015 NowGFP ~ 4.0 ns, Abraham et al., 2015), and we have added this information in the text. Moreover, we have implemented a detailed explanation of how the FLIM-based separation of GFP and NowGFP was performed in a separate supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 5), supporting the statement that VPY-GFP is diffusely present in the cytoplasm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The co-IP signals are rather weak for the interacting partner. Most often, co-IP results are validated both ways (not only A IPs B, but B also IPs A). Are the proteins expressed well? If they are, I wonder why the authors isolated protoplasts, rather than directly extracting proteins from whole leaves. Surely most samples are lost during protoplasting.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the bands are comparably weak. We have now validated these results by reciprocal pull-downs as suggested (Figure 3—figure supplement 7). While we got reproducible interactions between RPG and EXO70H4, we can pull VPY only when using RPG as a bait. Given the presence of a cytosolic fraction of VPY we currently believe that only a subfraction of the VPY pool interacts with RPG. It should be noted that all three proteins indeed seemed to be lowly expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves, as we were unable to detect a signal in a classical input fraction. However, upon immuno-precipitation, we got reliable signals of all three proteins when used as baits. One thing that really hampered any further biochemical analysis is the fact that the RPG protein is extremely difficult to isolate and to handle. The same experience was made by Fang Xie’s lab, who just reported on this in their recent publication (Li et al., 2023; PLoS Genetics). We experienced such difficulties as well when trying to isolate RPG from total protein extracts of leaves. Here, the majority of the protein precipitated with the debris fraction. This is the reason why we decided to first isolate protoplasts, in order to remove the cell wall, and to do the Co-IPs on this type of material.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The rpg mutant does form elongating infection threads, albeit highly irregular ones. Yet in Figures 3E, 5A, and 5B, one cannot see the file of bacteria along the mutant root hair. The structure shown here in the rpg mutant is more akin to infection chambers. In 4A, the mutant seems to be just starting an infection thread. Why did the authors not choose elongating infection threads like they did in Figures 1B and 2B?</p></disp-quote><p>During our live-cell imaging approach we specifically aimed to image infected root hairs within a similar and early time window (4-8 dpi) in WT and <italic>rpg-1</italic> transgenic roots expressing the different markers. At this early time point, the infection structures formed in <italic>rpg-1</italic> roots are highly irregular and, indeed, more akin to enlarged infection chambers, compared to thin and elongated ITs formed in WT roots, which well correlates with a defect in polarity maintenance. ITs shown in Figure 1B and 2B have been imaged at 35 and 21 dpi, respectively, and their elongated shape is likely the result of passive and unrestricted bacterial multiplication coupled to unpolarized growth occurring over time. To clarify this point, we have added few sentences in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The distinct puncta of VPY disappears in the rpg mutant (Figure 3-supplement 5). Can the authors tell whether the cause is diffuse localization, reduced total protein levels, or reduced transcription in the absence of RPG?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question but difficult to address conclusively at the moment. The fact that we can consistently observe a clear and diffuse cytoplasmic signal of VPY in both WT and <italic>rpg-1</italic> transgenic roots expressing <italic>VPY</italic> under its native promoter (Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1), suggests that, if present, reduction of VPY either at the transcript or protein level is subtle. Although detection of global VPY transcript or protein abundance from WT and <italic>rpg-1</italic> transgenic roots could be performed, such analyses would not maintain cellular resolution. On the other hand, quantitative measurements of the cytoplasmic signal from VPY in root hairs would not be providing a decisive answer either, and they are likely to be subjected to high variation. To capture small and dynamic variations while maintaining cellular resolution, single-cell based transcriptomic or proteomic approaches would be required, but as such approaches are highly time and resource demanding, we decided to not undertake them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors report larger infection threads in rpg mutants than in WT. Could the morphology of uninfected root hair in rpg mutant explain this phenotype? Quantification of the diameter of noninfected RH in WT and rpg mutants should allow the authors to rule out this hypothesis. Moreover, the author reported that TEM micrographs of nodule infected cells revealed &quot;larger IT structures present in nodule tissues of rpg-1 compared to WT but WT-like cell organization and symbiosome morphology&quot;: quantification is needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the diameter of differentiated root hair cells in the maturation zone of <italic>rpg</italic> mutant alleles and their corresponding wild-types in un-inoculated conditions (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C), confirming that the IT phenotype is not due to an altered root hair morphology. We also provide quantification of the diameter of nodular ITs developed in WT and <italic>rpg-1</italic> nodules (Figure 1F), supporting our initial statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To gain more insights into the structural requirements for RPG functionality, the authors generated a series of truncation derivatives and tested them for their capability to genetically complement rpg-1. They showed that the major molecular determinant conferring functionality to RPG resides in its coiled-coil domain. It is not clearly stated how the authors check that the constructs were expressed? It is particularly important for two variants that do not complement the rpg mutant. The authors should explain how they assessed that the constructs were stable and therefore the phenotype observed is not due to an absence of the truncated version but rather to a loss in its activity. It will be appreciated to have the number of independent transformants in the legend of the figure or in the panels (rather than in the material and method).</p></disp-quote><p>When conducting these experiments, we consistently observed signals from RPG-FL and all the deletion derivatives in root hairs of transgenic <italic>rpg-1</italic> roots, coinciding with the presence of either thin and elongated ITs (RPG-FL and RPG-CC, Figure 3A-B) or enlarged IT structures (RPG-tCC and RPG-NT, Figure 3C-D), in good correlation with our complementation data (Figure 2A-C). This suggests that the deletion derivatives are sufficiently expressed, although we cannot completely rule out that domain deletion has influenced their expression and/or the protein stability. We have mentioned this in the discussion session.</p><p>Each composite plant equals to an independent transformant, as its root system derives from an independent transformation event. We apologize for not having explained this, as also pointed out by reviewer 1. We have now explained the term “composite plant” in the text when mentioned for the first time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors clearly showed that RPG protein has a punctate localization. mCherry-RPG clearly co-localized with VPY-GFP in punctate structures located at the tip of the infection threads and in the cytoplasm connecting the nucleus to the infection threads tip of infected root hairs. However, quantifications are missing for all the data presented in Figure 3A-C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-D, Figure 3—figure supplement 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-D, Figure 3—figure supplement 4A-D.</p></disp-quote><p>For each figure, we now report the number of cells analyzed for each infection stage, together with the number of independently transformed root systems. Frequencies of observation are additionally reported when directly comparing the sub-cellular patterning of deletion derivatives (RPG-FL and RPG-CC). Co-localization data are presented as percentage of discrete signals from RPG and/or VPY/LIN in punctate structures in a separate figure (Figure 3F and Figure 3—figure supplement 6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The author showed that RPG co-purified with EXO70H4 and VPY indicating that these proteins indeed belong to the same complex. Moreover, they showed that the major molecular determinant conferring functionality to RPG resides in its coiled-coil domain. Does the CC domain important for RPG interaction with VAPYRIN (VPY)/mCherry-EXO70H4? Furthermore, there is no clear indication of the number of times this experiment has been replicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important question but we decided to not extend our co-immunoprecipitation analysis to the RPG deletion derivatives, since we are not able at this moment to fully address biochemically the interaction between RPG and VPY. We recognize this limitation in the result part of the text.</p><p>We apologize for not having stated the number of replica for the Co-IP, we have now implemented this information in the legend of the corresponding figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. While no quantification is presented, the authors showed with clear illustrations that the mCherry-RPG-NT construct which does not complement the rpg mutant remained diffuse in the cytoplasm and preferentially accumulated in the nucleus of transformed root hairs. It would be interesting to repeat this analysis (mCherry-RPG-CC, mCherry-RPG-tCC, mCherry-RPG-NT) in WT plants: These complementary analyses will allow the authors to further evaluate if the function of RPG depends on its localization or on its interaction with protein partners.</p></disp-quote><p>As for all the other data concerning sub-cellular distribution patterns, we now report the number of cells analyzed for each infection stage, together with the number of independently transformed root systems for mCherry-RPG-NT.</p><p>We agree that such complementary analysis would integrate our functional studies and we had done explorative experiments assessing the localization of mCherry-RPG-CC and mCherry-RPG-NT in WT transgenic roots. Although preliminary, these observations did not reveal any obvious differential pattern of the two truncated versions in WT vs <italic>rpg-1</italic>. Therefore, we decided to prioritize the analysis of the localization of the deletion derivatives in the <italic>rpg</italic> mutant as more informative when coupled to our functional analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 4, they reported that in uninfected growing root hairs, PI(4,5)P2 was enriched at the apical membrane domain while at the onset of infection PI(4,5)P2 was locally and specifically enriched at the membrane surrounding invading bacteria emerging from the infection chamber. The observations presented in Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 5 should be quantified. Did the authors try to over-express RPG and check for a potential increase in membrane polarity? How do these increases in PIP2 polarity occur? Is it via the transcriptional regulation of the PIP2 metabolism or via the trafficking/activity of the PIP2 regulating enzymes? Some pieces of information should be added at least in the discussion of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the differential enrichment of PI4P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in WT vs <italic>rpg-1</italic> (previously Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 5) by assessing the IT tip versus plasma membrane fluorescence ratio of each biosensor in infected root hairs (Figure 5B), statistically supporting our observations.</p><p>We have added a paragraph in the discussion where we discuss how the membrane enrichment of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> during infection could potentially occur and how RPG could impinge on it. We did not monitor membrane polarity upon ectopic expression of RPG. Although it could be interesting to perform such experiment, we think that, on its own, it would not provide decisive information to unravel the mechanism by which RPG affects membrane polarization. Further experiments with the required depth and robustness would, however, by far exceed the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. They further observed that local PI(4,5)P2 enrichment also occurred on the basal membrane of root hairs hosting polarized infection threads and on the apical membrane of underlying cortical neighboring cells. It is not clear to me how the authors know that this membrane belongs to the infected cell and is not part of another cell that is about to initiate a root hair. Imaging in 3D will help to understand the topology here.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have now investigated this experimentally and added a 3D projection and a 3D volume rendering of the samples shown in Figure 5A-CC in Figure 5—figure supplement 2C and 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Since nuclear movement appeared uncoupled from the infection threads' growth in rpg, the authors tested the implication of the MTs in this phenomenon. Even if the authors are citing other studies showing the role of MTs, it is not clear to me why the actin cytoskeleton was excluded from this analysis. Maybe the authors should consider discussing it, in particular since the actin cytoskeleton is important for polar growth and might be linked to PIP2 polarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree that the actin cytoskeleton is likely playing an important role during IT polarity. We indeed performed preliminary experiments to monitor the actin cytoskeleton in WT vs <italic>rpg-1</italic> infected root. On the one hand, we used Phalloidin on fixed roots to stain actin filaments within root hairs but we could not obtain conclusive and robust results, mainly due to the low amount of infected root hairs maintaining a well-preserved cytological organization after fixation. On the other hand, we tried to visualize actin fibers in live samples by overexpressing the actin binding probe LifeAct, but ectopic expression of this marker seemed to negatively affect infection, and we could not reliably image root hair hosting infection threads neither in WT nor in <italic>rpg-1</italic> transgenic roots.</p><p>We have recognized the possible involvement of the actin cytoskeleton and the necessity to investigate it in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. By comparing microtubule organization in WT and rpg root hairs harboring the infection threads using live-cell imaging, they reported the loss of nuclear-mediated IT guidance occurs in rpg &quot;in the majority of the case&quot;, &quot;often&quot;. Please quantify more deeply the results obtained in Figure 5A (in particular in the corresponding text of the result section). Why the nucleus is not visible in magenta in the right panels?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now provide five additional representative pictures of the microtubule patterning in infected root hairs of WT and <italic>rpg-1</italic>, which are presented as a supplementary figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We also provide a more precise quantification of our observations in the corresponding text. In addition, we provide quantification of the distance between the nucleus and the tip of the infection thread, further supporting the loss of nuclear-mediated IT guidance in infected root hairs of the <italic>rpg-1</italic> mutant.</p><p>We have changed the images in the right panel (Figure 6A <italic>rpg-1</italic>) with a more representative one, where the nucleus and IT tip are at a distance falling close to the median calculated by our quantification. The previous image has been moved to the supplementary (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). To augment the visibility of the nucleus, we have increased the contrast of the mCherry channel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Regarding the polar secretion of NPL which requires functional RPG, is there a direct role of the membrane polarization (or PIP2) in the exocytosis of cell wall modifying enzyme NODULE PECTATE LYASE (NPL)? Maybe some information could be added in the discussion of the manuscript about the general knowledge from the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>While the NPL homolog of soybean has been shown to co-localize with VAMP721d-positive compartments in infected nodule cells (Gavrin et al., 2016, New Phytol.), we are not aware of a direct functional link reported between NPL and membrane polarization during IT growth and, at this stage, we cannot fully resolve the primary reason for the secretion defect. However, and in line with a loss of a PIP2 domain at the IT tip, we strongly believe that targeted vesicle delivery to this site is abolished in the mutant. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that we do observe secretion of NPL to the symbiotic apoplastic compartment but this remains unconfined (Figure 6 D-F). Since RPG interacts with EXO70H4 residing within infectosome foci, it is possible that RPG-mediated recruitment of this exocyst subunit could enable the confinement of secretion at a unique focal point. We have now added this to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The authors should consider adding a model for the different molecular components they studied in the context of this biotic interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added graphical summaries of the conclusions drawn from each set of experiments in the respective Figure or panel.</p></body></sub-article></article>
