Loss of IHC-SGN synapses, known as cochlear synaptopathy, is evident following noise exposure producing both temporary threshold shifts (TTS) and permanent threshold shifts (PTS), with rapid loss of up to 40–50% of synapses and gradual degeneration of SGNs even in the absence of hair cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>). Aging mice show similar synaptopathy, with a steady loss of synapses and a delayed but similar decrease in the number of SGNs that precedes age-related hair cell loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sergeyenko et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Damage to stereocilia, the mechanosensory microvilli, is also observed in aging and noise-exposed cochleas. Following PTS-inducing noise exposure, irreversible disarray, fusion, and loss of IHC stereocilia are visible even in the absence of hair cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, IHC stereocilia in aging mice undergo a number of changes including fusion, elongation, and internalization without obvious hair cell loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bullen et al., 2019</xref>). Stereocilia defects compromise the integrity of the mechanosensory transduction apparatus, resulting in absent or impaired sensory transduction and thus contribute to diminished hearing sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pickles et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assad et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Despite the concurrence of mechanosensory insult and cochlear synaptopathy in noise exposure and aging, impaired sensory transduction has not been implicated as a mechanism contributing to the loss of hair cell synapses. To begin to address the contributions of sensory transduction to the development and maturation of IHC-SGN synapses, we evaluated IHC ribbon synapses across multiple developmental timepoints in five genetic models with disrupted sensory transduction, including mice lacking <italic>Tmc1</italic>, <italic>Tmc2</italic>, or both (<italic>Tmc1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic>, <italic>Tmc2<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic>, <italic>Tmc1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup>;Tmc2<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic>), <italic>Beethoven</italic> mice which carry a dominant mutation in <italic>Tmc1</italic> (<italic>Bth</italic>) and <italic>Spinner</italic> mice (<italic>Tmie<sup>sr</sup></italic>), which carry a mutation in <italic>Tmie</italic>.

Another study assessed the synaptic consequences of genetic deletion of vesicular glutamate transporter type 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) and found roughly half of IHC synapses were lost by 9 weeks of age. Although the genetic targets are different, disruption of synaptic proteins or transduction proteins lead to similar loss of IHC-SGN synapses suggesting they may converge upon similar molecular pathways that regulate synaptic development and maturation.</p><p>Genetic deletion of <italic>Tmc1</italic> or <italic>Tmc2</italic> alone did not alter synapse counts prior to hearing onset; <italic>Tmc1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> and <italic>Tmc2<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> single KO mice exhibited similar counts to those of WT mice at P7.

These differences between <italic>Tmc1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> and <italic>Tmc2<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mice are consistent with a developmental shift from <italic>Tmc2</italic> to <italic>Tmc1</italic> mRNA and TMC protein expression that occurs in the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kurima et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Tmc2</italic> is transiently expressed in the cochlea until P8, while a rise in <italic>Tmc1</italic> expression is observed between P2 and P22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>).

Indeed, while localization of TMC proteins may be disrupted in the absence of TMIE, TMC expression level is not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cunningham et al., 2020</xref>).

The differences in <italic>Tmc1<sup>Bth</sup></italic> mice suggest calcium permeability may play a subtle role in regulating synapse numbers.

While the hair cell sensory signaling cascade is well established, secondary consequences of disrupted sensory signaling remain obscure. Our data suggest a mechanistic connection between sensory and molecular signaling pathways in the auditory periphery. We propose that sensory signals, in addition to relaying auditory information to the brain, may also converge with molecular signaling pathways that govern development and maturation of IHC-SGN synapses. Disruption of sensory signals, whether genetic in origin or via environmental insults or aging, may disrupt a common pathway leading to synaptopathy and auditory dysfunction. While a number of studies have documented both pathological and normal developmental changes in IHC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu and Goodrich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voorn and Vogl, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sobkowicz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nouvian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sergeyenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kujawa and Liberman, 2015</xref>), the molecular mechanisms that regulate development and maturation of IHC synapses and their afferent connections remain unclear.</p><p>To further investigate the relationship between sensory transduction and IHC synapses, we discovered that <italic>Tmc1</italic> gene therapy in <italic>Tmc1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mice promoted restoration of sensory transduction, and consequently, preserved synapse counts and ribbon volume distributions.

Importantly, the data suggest <italic>Tmc1</italic> gene therapy promotes recovery of sensory transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nist-Lund et al., 2019</xref>) and preservation of synapses, both of which are necessary for normal auditory function. Whether <italic>Tmc1</italic> gene therapy introduced at more mature stages can prevent or promote recovery from synaptopathy remains to be determined.</p><p>While our study demonstrates an important role for sensory transduction in development and maturation of IHC-SGN synapses, one caveat is that synapse counts alone are not indicative of the functional status of IHC synapses. Direct assays of synaptic function and synaptic transmission may help validate our results. Verification of normal synapse function, functional sensory transduction, and robust ABR waveforms following inner ear gene therapy may also help inform the continued development of inner ear therapeutics.</p><p>This study also raises additional questions regarding the absolute volume of CtBP2-positive ribbons. While our quantification methods allowed for relative comparison of the distribution of ribbon volumes, super resolution microscopy may be better suited to quantify absolute changes in ribbon volumes during development, in the absence of sensory transduction and following gene therapy recovery of sensory transduction. Furthermore, whether synapses are preferentially lost or recovered on the pillar or modiolar side of IHCs remains to be investigated.</p><p>In summary, our study provides novel insight into the role of sensory transduction in synapse development and maturation. While glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated in the acute loss of synapses observed immediately following noise exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liberman and Kujawa, 2017</xref>), the mechanisms underlying chronic synaptic changes and neural degeneration of SGNs are unknown. Since noise exposure, aging, and genetic mutations can all cause deficits in sensory transduction, we speculate that damage to the sensory transduction apparatus, regardless of the source of the insult, may affect a common molecular pathway that leads to chronic loss of IHC-SGN synapses and degeneration of SGNs. Identification of these molecular pathways may guide development of future therapeutic strategies that prevent synaptopathy and promote healthy synaptic function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57B/L6-<italic>Cdh23</italic><sup>753A&gt;G</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lentz et al., 2010</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lentz et al.

Briefly, P1 mice were anesthetized with hypothermia and a postauricular incision was made to expose the semicircular canals. A small puncture into the temporal bone surrounding the utricle was made and a glass micropipette was inserted into the puncture to manually inject 1 µL AAV.

Mice were anesthetized with 0.5 mg of ketamine and 0.15 mg of xylazine per 10 g body weight via intraperitoneal injection. Subcutaneous needle electrodes were inserted at the vertex (reference electrode), pinna (active electrode), and rump (ground electrode). Acoustic stimuli were delivered directly into the ear through a custom probe tube speaker/microphone system (EPL PXI Systems) consisting of two electrostatic earphones (CUI Miniature Dynamics) to generate primary tones and a Knowles microphone (Electret Condenser) to record sound pressures from the ear canal. In a sound-proof chamber, mice were presented 5 ms pure tone stimuli of 8, 11.3, 16, 22.6, and 32 kHz at SPL of 10–115 dB in 5 dB increment steps; 512 responses of alternating stimulus polarity were collected and averaged for each SPL. ABR potentials were amplified (10,000×), band-pass filtered (0.3–10 kHz), and digitized using custom data acquisition software from the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories Cochlear Function Test Suite.</p><p>Waveforms with peak to trough amplitudes greater than 15 µV were discarded by an artifact-reject function.

Temporal bones were then decalcified in 120 mM EDTA for 2 hr for 7-day-old mice and up to 20 hr for 4-week-old mice. Following decalcification, the entire length of the organ of Corti was microdissected in PBS for whole-mount processing. Tissues were then permeabilized by freezing on dry ice in 30% sucrose and blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in PBS with 0.3% Triton X + 5% normal horse serum. Tissues were then stained with the following primary antibodies and incubated at 37°C overnight: (1) mouse isotype IgG1 anti-C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2, 1:200, BD Transduction Laboratories #612044), (2) mouse isotype IgG2a anti-glutamate receptor 2 (GluA2, 1:2000, Millipore #MABN1189), and (3) rabbit anti-myosin VIIa (Myo7a, 1:200: Proteus Biosciences #25–6790). Tissues were washed in PBS and incubated for 2 hr at 37°C with the following secondary antibodies diluted in 1% normal horse serum + 0.3% Triton X: (1) goat anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa Fluor 546 (1:1000, Thermo Fisher #A-21123), (2) goat anti-mouse IgG2a Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000, Thermo Fisher #A-21131), and (3) donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (1:200, Thermo Fisher #A-31573). Finally, samples were mounted on glass coverslips with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).</p><p>Using the 10× air objective on an LSM 800 (Carl Zeiss), low-power images of the myosin channel were obtained from each microdissected piece. Using a custom ImageJ plugin, a cochlear frequency map was generated by measuring the full length of the cochlea from apex to base using all microdissected pieces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Müller et al., 2005</xref>). Full z-stacks were then acquired at cochlear regions corresponding to five frequencies (8, 11.3, 16, 22.6, 32 kHz) using a 63 × 1.4 NA oil objective lens (Carl Zeiss, z step = 0.36 μm, scaling per pixel: 0.068 μm × 0.068 μm); 9–12 IHCs per field were imaged with z-stacks spanning the entire length of the hair cells. For volume estimations, confocal z-stacks were acquired using the 63× oil objective with AiryScan processing (Carl Zeiss, z step = 0.18 μm, scaling per pixel: 0.034 μm × 0.034 μm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Ribbon synapse counts and volume distribution measurements</title><p>Confocal z-stacks were ported to Imaris, an image analysis software, for creation of 3D projections and quantitative analyses of synapse counts and volumes. The ‘Spots’ module in Imaris was used for automated identification and counting of all ribbons in a given z-stack. All counts were manually reviewed and verified. Synapses were defined as juxtaposition of presynaptic ribbons labeled with anti-CtBP2 with postsynaptic AMPA receptor puncta labeled with anti-GluA2. Juxtaposition was verified manually for every ribbon identified using the ‘Spots’ module. The total number of synapses was divided by the number of IHCs in the image to calculate the average number of synapses/IHC. For estimation of ribbon volume distributions, confocal z-stacks of ribbon synapses were obtained from P28 control, <italic>Tmc1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tmc1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mice injected with AAV2/9-PHP.B-CMV- <italic>Tmc1</italic><sup><italic>ex1</italic></sup>WPRE using Airyscan processing and ported to Imaris. 3D projections of Airyscan z-stacks were generated and ribbon volumes were segmented from each projection using the ‘Surfaces’ module in Imaris. Identical settings were applied across image stacks, including the threshold for ‘background subtraction (local contrast)’. This threshold was fixed to ensure digital analyses in Imaris were consistent across images (despite potential variability in immunostaining quality and image acquisition confocal settings) and to prevent subjective biases from affecting ribbon volume calculations. As with the synapse counts, ribbons identified using the ‘Surfaces’ module were manually verified to be juxtaposed with anti-GluA2 staining. Calculated volumes from each z-stack for each mouse were normalized to the median volume of all ribbons in the z-stack to account for differences in immunostaining quality and image acquisition settings across mice, genotypes, and cochlear regions. Standard deviations of normalized ribbon volumes from each z-stack for each mouse were compared to determine if significant differences in ribbon volume distributions were evident between groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experimental design and statistical analyses</title><p>The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for comparison of P2 WT and <italic>Tmc1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup>;Tmc2<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> CtBP2+ puncta counts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Elisabeth Glowatzki (Reviewer #1); Mark A Rutherford (Reviewer #2); Andreas Neef (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers found that the study is overall well executed and that the results are of significant interest both for auditory neuroscientists as well as potentially for the broader neuroscience community. However, the reviewers also raised a number of criticisms and comments that are listed below.</p><p>Figure 6:</p><p>There are some issues with panel C. When normalizing to the median, the distribution should be around the value of 1. Clearly, something else was done here but it is not clear what was done. Let's step back for a minute. The reason why Charlie normalizes to the median is two fold – (1) because of the difference in brightness across images, as you stated, and (2) because all of his comparisons are between modiolar and pillar groups in the same images, pooled for different images from the same group. Comparisons between groups are made only in relative terms. Here, you could compare modiolar and pillar and perhaps you should, since the data are already in hand. However, here you are not comparing modiolar and pillar, so, why are you normalizing to the median? The reason to normalize to the median in this case would be to compare the shapes of the distributions, which is basically what you described – a change in the shape where the dKO has a broader distribution. Please mention that you are not detecting potential difference in absolute volume, only differences in the shape of the distribution. Comparing modiolar and pillar would strengthen the paper as well. Another appropriate addition would be to look at GluA2 volumes as well.</p><p>The conclusion &quot;suggesting Tmc1 gene therapy preserves both synapse counts and ribbon morphology&quot; should not be based on distributions of normalized ribbon volumes, but absolute ribbon volumes. Is there no better way to address the question? Why is the volume estimate so strongly dependent on the staining? Does Imaris not use a threshold adapted to the dynamic range of the data? What do the raw data look like?</p><p>Statistical analysis:</p><p>The scarce information about the statistical evaluation is contradictory and unclear:</p><p>1. The combination of &quot;assumed to be not normally distributed and &quot;use ANOVA&quot; could be disputed. The assumption of ANOVA is normal distribution, but it may work with samples drawn from distributions violating this assumption.</p><p>2. The sentence on line 549 indicates the use of multiple ANOVAs. This probably references the use of one ANOVA for Figure 3 WT vs double mut and one ANOVA across all variants in figure 3 and one ANOVA for figure 4. It would be much clearer if the authors stated that precisely and also made clear that the correction was done for triple testing and also state that the reported p values are one-third the original ones – just to be clear.</p><p>3. line 551: &quot;Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used for comparison of P2 WT and Tmc1Δ/Δ;Tmc2Δ/Δ ribbon counts&quot;.</p><p>The source of the &quot;matched&quot; is unclear to me. Obviously, within each WT group and each mutant group, data at different cochlear sections are matched. However, the comparison reported is between WT and mutant across all frequency bands. The data are not matched across the two groups, and therefore it is not clear why the matched-pairs test was warranted.</p><p>The statistical description ends as it begins, only that here the word &quot;Gaussian&quot; replaces &quot;normal&quot;. Again, it is unclear what is meant by this and why the assumption &quot;Gaussian&quot; is associated with Wilcoxon tests. There is the faint possibility that the authors refer to a specific detail of the implementation of Wilcoxon rank tests. Sometimes, the test uses the assumption of a gaussian distribution of the test statistics to evaluate the probability of the observed rank counts much more quickly. In some programs, this behaviour can be toggled by a parameter switch. Should the authors indeed have this &quot;assumption of Gaussian distribution&quot; in mind, they can safely remove the sentence. For sample sizes of 9 this is never invoked. The speed improvement only kicks in for larger sample sizes. Should they refer to some other assumption, it was not clear.</p><p>Given the low number of independent data points, the authors might want to include a statement about the certainty with which they report &quot;no difference&quot;. A possibility would be an effect size range they can safely exclude at 90% statistical power.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Sensory Transduction is Required for Normal Development and Maturation of Cochlear Inner Hair Cell Synapses&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Barbara Shinn-Cunningham (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Required changes:</p><p>1) Figure 6C:</p><p>– Maybe it is the log scale that is confusing. Please confirm, for each violin plot, that one-half of the data points are above the median of 1 and one-half of the data points are below the median of 1. How does this look on a linear scale (please show in the response to the reviewers, does not need to be included in the revised manuscript)?</p><p>– Figure 6C contains very many individual data points, which cannot be visually separated. Those do not contribute to the reader's information. Almost all detectable information lies in the shape of the violin plots. Those indicate Gaussian shapes for all data groups, but they appear Gaussian on a logarithmic scale. The ordinate values of maximum density are between 0.1 and 0.3 for the KO and around 0.8 to 1 for the WT and rescued KO.</p><p>This impression has nothing to do with the actual distribution of the data. I have tried very patiently to reproduce anything resembling those violin plots from the provided data for 8kHz, and I failed.</p><p>Just how wrong the impression given by the violin plots is, can readily be appreciated from histograms (of the logarithm of the normalized data). The highest density of data in the blue (KO) cloud is above 1, not below. Interestingly, for the accumulated normalized data BEFORE taking the logarithm, the density is highest below 1, because the distribution of the KO data is very skewed (but not for the WT or KOrescue data).</p><p>My recommendation: Please find a program, that correctly reproduces density distributions. If in doubt, whether the algorithms will work with the logarithmic scale, please take the logarithm of your data and then use the violin plot. Then plot on a linear scale and create ticks that reflect the logarithmic scaling.</p><p>– It is not per se ok to normalize distributions, then to accumulate the results treat the result as if it represents the original distributions (just with less noise). Only if the samples came from the same distribution (plus a linear scaling), this approach will always yield correct conclusions.</p><p>The reason named for normalizing is &quot;variability between stainings&quot;. Under some strong assumptions (no offset, i.e. no background staining, and most importantly: a LINEAR relation between staining intensity and detected volume) the data distribution could be meaningfully normalized by division by the median. It is not clear to me that those assumptions have been understood and discussed.</p><p>– Raw volume values can be surprisingly small. Zeiss states that the Airyscan can at best resolve 0.14 x 0.14 x 0.35 um. An ellipsoid of these dimensions has a volume of 0.0035um^3. Some of the values in the dataset are smaller. That is counter-intuitive.</p><p>– On a positive note, I do not think the discussion about normalization and violin plots is discussion is necessary at all. The unnormalized data (at 8kHz), fully support the following claims about the measured volumes:</p><p>mean(Tmc1KO) &lt; mean(WT) &lt; mean(Tmc1rescued)</p><p>sd(Tmc1KO) &gt; sd(WT) and no significant difference between the variance of WT and Tmc1rescued.</p><p>If I understood the current version correctly, the authors argue that the distributions are different. The statistics of the unnormalized data seems to support this claim.</p><p>My advice: work with raw data, accumulate across cochleas, plot histograms rather than violin plots and find a way to capture the vastly different shape of the distributions.</p><p>2) In response to a previous reviewer critique the authors say: &quot;The Bonferroni correction was applied following these paired comparisons and the reported p values are 1/6 of the original ones.&quot; Let's be careful not to confuse people. For the Bonferroni correction, you need to multiply the original p values, not divide them. In other words, you must divide 0.05 by 3 or 6 to obtain the critical p value to get below to obtain significance. I assume this is a typo, and not a realization that changes the results of the statistical tests. In any case, it should be clarified, and the sentence changed.</p><p>3) Reporting of statistical Analysis</p><p>This will require some work of the authors or external experts. The standards are pretty clear. <italic>eLife</italic> has supported the push towards more reproducible research and published, among other resources, papers on typical pitfalls and reviews on inadequate reporting:</p><p>Meta-Research: Why we need to report more than 'Data were Analyzed by t-tests or ANOVA' Weissgerber et al. 2018 https://doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.36163.001</p><p>Please read those and change the methods section but also the Results section accordingly. The problem is simply that it is not possible to understand what analysis has been performed, even though the data is available, and all variables are clear to me.</p><p>Please report the ANOVA design and results.</p><p>I am not a statistician, but here is a quick run-down of how ANOVA results are reported – see for instance the <italic>eLife</italic> review cited above.</p><p>– Naming the model type (mixed model) – that has been done.</p><p>– Naming the dimensionality of the model 3 factors with X levels (4 genotype x 3 Times x 5 Frequency ranges), that's very unclear here.</p><p>– Naming the significant effects observed with the model(e.g. effect of time, effect of frequency, effect of genotype, interactions: genotype by time, genotype by frequency), again, nothing is reported about which ones were observed.</p><p>By my training, only after the ANOVA shows an effect of factor X, the direction of the effect is checked with t-Tests (as the ANOVA already assumes normality).</p><p>What is clear from the numbers in the supplemental data is that 90 separate t-Tests were performed to test for the significance of individual pairs of synapse per IHC counts (5 frequencies x 6 genotype combinations x 3 time points). It is necessary to clarify how the relevant correction factor becomes 6 and not 90.</p><p>The authors implicitly report an effect of time at P7 we see this, at P28, we see this. Hence an omnibus ANOVA (freq x genotype x time) would have to show an interaction of time and genotype.</p><p>As a side-note: Once more it is unclear how the comparisons are &quot;paired&quot; (line 583). In my reading, 4 values from wt are compared to 4 values from the double KO at the same position of the basilar membrane from animals of the same age. That does not make those comparisons &quot;paired&quot;. Truly 'paired' are comparisons of data from the same basilar membrane, i.e. counts at 8, 11.3, 16, … kHz. However, it seems the effect of frequency was not tested (which I presume leads to missing the Tmc2 KO vs wt x Frequency interaction).</p><p>I would like to suggest that the authors use less conservative ways of multiple-comparison correction (e.g. Holm).

As recommended, Figure 6C has been revised so distributions are normalized with the median value set to 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clearly, something else was done here but it is not clear what was done. Let's step back for a minute. The reason why Charlie normalizes to the median is two fold – (1) because of the difference in brightness across images, as you stated, and (2) because all of his comparisons are between modiolar and pillar groups in the same images, pooled for different images from the same group. Comparisons between groups are made only in relative terms. Here, you could compare modiolar and pillar and perhaps you should, since the data are already in hand. However, here you are not comparing modiolar and pillar, so, why are you normalizing to the median? The reason to normalize to the median in this case would be to compare the shapes of the distributions, which is basically what you described – a change in the shape where the dKO has a broader distribution. Please mention that you are not detecting potential difference in absolute volume, only differences in the shape of the distribution. Comparing modiolar and pillar would strengthen the paper as well. Another appropriate addition would be to look at GluA2 volumes as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel it is inappropriate to consider immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy as accurate tools for measuring absolute volumes of synaptic elements, including presynaptic ribbons. There is too much variability in tissue quality, immunostaining quality, etc., which prevents accurate comparison of volumes across samples. However, we do feel that it is accurate to measure volumes within a single image and then normalize for each image. This yields a normalized distribution for each image to itself and allows comparison of volume distributions for each image. We show the normalized data, which we feel provide a valid distribution of CtBP2 volumes that can be compared across samples and experimental conditions.</p><p>Comparison of modiolar vs pillar synapses was not part of our study design as we had no reason to hypothesize that manipulation of sensory transduction might have different regional effects within a single cell. Future studies utilizing high resolution techniques methods (i.e. STED, STORM, FIB-SEM) may provide more accurate estimations of ribbon volumes and allow for more precise comparisons.</p><p>We have expanded our discussion of these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion &quot;suggesting Tmc1 gene therapy preserves both synapse counts and ribbon morphology&quot; should not be based on distributions of normalized ribbon volumes, but absolute ribbon volumes. Is there no better way to address the question? Why is the volume estimate so strongly dependent on the staining? Does Imaris not use a threshold adapted to the dynamic range of the data? What do the raw data look like?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have revised the text to read “suggesting Tmc1 gene therapy preserves both synapse counts and the distribution of ribbon volumes”. As noted above, we feel super resolution microscopy techniques could be used to allow better estimates of absolute ribbon volumes. Those measurements are beyond the scope of the current study but may be well suited for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistical analysis:</p><p>The scarce information about the statistical evaluation is contradictory and unclear:</p><p>1. The combination of &quot;assumed to be not normally distributed and &quot;use ANOVA&quot; could be disputed. The assumption of ANOVA is normal distribution, but it may work with samples drawn from distributions violating this assumption.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We agree the combination of ANOVA and assumption of non-normal distribution are contradictory. The contradictory sentence was removed from the “Experimental Design and Statistical Analyses” paragraph in the methods section. As detailed in our responses below and clarified in the methods section, ANOVA was used for Figures 3A-C, Figures 4A-C, and Figure 6A. We met with Boston Children’s Hospital’s senior biostatistician, Kosuke Kawai (see acknowledgements) and he confirmed it was reasonable to assume normality for our synapse count datasets. However, for CtBP2+ counts (Figure 1B) and ribbon volumes (Figure 6C), we used non-parametric tests because these data may not be normally distributed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The sentence on line 549 indicates the use of multiple ANOVAs. This probably references the use of one ANOVA for Figure 3 WT vs double mut and one ANOVA across all variants in figure 3 and one ANOVA for figure 4. It would be much clearer if the authors stated that precisely and also made clear that the correction was done for triple testing and also state that the reported p values are one-third the original ones – just to be clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. For each panel in Figure 3 (i.e. each timepoint), a total of six paired comparisons was made using ANOVA to analyze the four groups (i.e. A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D). The Bonferroni correction was applied following these paired comparisons and the reported p values are 1/6 of the original ones. In Figure 4 and 6A, 3 paired comparisons were made using ANOVA to analyze the three groups (i.e. A-B, A-C, B-C) so reported p values are 1/3 of the original values. We now describe the statistical tests in more detail in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. line 551: &quot;Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used for comparison of P2 WT and Tmc1Δ/Δ;Tmc2Δ/Δ ribbon counts&quot;.</p><p>The source of the &quot;matched&quot; is unclear to me. Obviously, within each WT group and each mutant group, data at different cochlear sections are matched. However, the comparison reported is between WT and mutant across all frequency bands. The data are not matched across the two groups, and therefore it is not clear why the matched-pairs test was warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We agree the data are not matched across the two groups and the sentence/statistical test were erroneously included in our description. Statistical analyses of the P2 WT vs. Tmc double KO CtBP2+ puncta counts were repeated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. P values in Supplemental Table 1 were updated and the sentence was also updated in our “Experimental Design and Statistical Analyses” paragraph. No statistically significant differences between the two groups were evident at any of the frequency regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statistical description ends as it begins, only that here the word &quot;Gaussian&quot; replaces &quot;normal&quot;. Again, it is unclear what is meant by this and why the assumption &quot;Gaussian&quot; is associated with Wilcoxon tests. There is the faint possibility that the authors refer to a specific detail of the implementation of Wilcoxon rank tests. Sometimes, the test uses the assumption of a gaussian distribution of the test statistics to evaluate the probability of the observed rank counts much more quickly. In some programs, this behaviour can be toggled by a parameter switch. Should the authors indeed have this &quot;assumption of Gaussian distribution&quot; in mind, they can safely remove the sentence. For sample sizes of 9 this is never invoked. The speed improvement only kicks in for larger sample sizes. Should they refer to some other assumption, it was not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you again for the detailed comments/suggestions regarding our statistical analyses. As with the “assumed to be not normally distributed” and “use ANOVA” comment above, we have removed these contradictory sentences from the revised methods sections to clarify the statistical analyses/descriptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the low number of independent data points, the authors might want to include a statement about the certainty with which they report &quot;no difference&quot;. A possibility would be an effect size range they can safely exclude at 90% statistical power.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that large standard deviations may mask statistically significant differences in means, especially with low numbers of independent data points. We have edited our supplemental tables to reflect the new/updated statistical analysis and to include additional data (i.e. mean, mean difference, SD, SEM, 95% confidence interval, p values). We carefully examined effect size (mean difference and 95% CI) and believe that any significant differences between groups were captured in the statistical analyses.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 6C:</p><p>– Maybe it is the log scale that is confusing. Please confirm, for each violin plot, that one-half of the data points are above the median of 1 and one-half of the data points are below the median of 1. How does this look on a linear scale (please show in the response to the reviewers, does not need to be included in the revised manuscript)?</p><p>– Figure 6C contains very many individual data points, which cannot be visually separated. Those do not contribute to the reader's information. Almost all detectable information lies in the shape of the violin plots. Those indicate Gaussian shapes for all data groups, but they appear Gaussian on a logarithmic scale. The ordinate values of maximum density are between 0.1 and 0.3 for the KO and around 0.8 to 1 for the WT and rescued KO.</p><p>This impression has nothing to do with the actual distribution of the data. I have tried very patiently to reproduce anything resembling those violin plots from the provided data for 8kHz, and I failed.</p><p>Just how wrong the impression given by the violin plots is, can readily be appreciated from histograms (of the logarithm of the normalized data). The highest density of data in the blue (KO) cloud is above 1, not below. Interestingly, for the accumulated normalized data BEFORE taking the logarithm, the density is highest below 1, because the distribution of the KO data is very skewed (but not for the WT or KOrescue data).</p><p>My recommendation: Please find a program, that correctly reproduces density distributions. If in doubt, whether the algorithms will work with the logarithmic scale, please take the logarithm of your data and then use the violin plot. Then plot on a linear scale and create ticks that reflect the logarithmic scaling.</p><p>– It is not per se ok to normalize distributions, then to accumulate the results treat the result as if it represents the original distributions (just with less noise). Only if the samples came from the same distribution (plus a linear scaling), this approach will always yield correct conclusions.</p><p>The reason named for normalizing is &quot;variability between stainings&quot;. Under some strong assumptions (no offset, i.e. no background staining, and most importantly: a LINEAR relation between staining intensity and detected volume) the data distribution could be meaningfully normalized by division by the median. It is not clear to me that those assumptions have been understood and discussed.</p><p>– Raw volume values can be surprisingly small. Zeiss states that the Airyscan can at best resolve 0.14 x 0.14 x 0.35 um. An ellipsoid of these dimensions has a volume of 0.0035um^3. Some of the values in the dataset are smaller. That is counter-intuitive.</p><p>– On a positive note, I do not think the discussion about normalization and violin plots is discussion is necessary at all. The unnormalized data (at 8kHz), fully support the following claims about the measured volumes:</p><p>mean(Tmc1KO) &lt; mean(WT) &lt; mean(Tmc1rescued)</p><p>sd(Tmc1KO) &gt; sd(WT) and no significant difference between the variance of WT and Tmc1rescued.</p><p>If I understood the current version correctly, the authors argue that the distributions are different. The statistics of the unnormalized data seems to support this claim.</p><p>My advice: work with raw data, accumulate across cochleas, plot histograms rather than violin plots and find a way to capture the vastly different shape of the distributions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the editor’s attention to this issue. Indeed, we also struggled with how to best represent the data before we settled on the violin plots. To address the editors concerns we replotted the data 24 different ways. In the end, we have followed the editor’s advice and plot the raw data in five histograms, one for each frequency region of the cochlea. We agree this presentation provides the most accurate visual representation of the data for the three conditions, WT, Tmc1 KO and recovery with Tmc1 gene therapy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In response to a previous reviewer critique the authors say: &quot;The Bonferroni correction was applied following these paired comparisons and the reported p values are 1/6 of the original ones.&quot; Let's be careful not to confuse people. For the Bonferroni correction, you need to multiply the original p values, not divide them. In other words, you must divide 0.05 by 3 or 6 to obtain the critical p value to get below to obtain significance. I assume this is a typo, and not a realization that changes the results of the statistical tests. In any case, it should be clarified, and the sentence changed.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a mistake as noted below in “Suggested changes”. The error was corrected and p values were verified in Prism, R, and SAS. Results of statistical tests were unaltered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reporting of statistical Analysis</p><p>This will require some work of the authors or external experts. The standards are pretty clear. eLife has supported the push towards more reproducible research and published, among other resources, papers on typical pitfalls and reviews on inadequate reporting:</p><p>Meta-Research: Why we need to report more than 'Data were Analyzed by t-tests or ANOVA' Weissgerber et al. 2018 https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36163.001</p><p>Please read those and change the methods section but also the Results section accordingly.

It is necessary to clarify how the relevant correction factor becomes 6 and not 90.</p><p>The authors implicitly report an effect of time at P7 we see this, at P28, we see this.
