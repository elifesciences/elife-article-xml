How NSCs are instructed to generate neuronal or glial progeny is not well understood. Here, we addressed how murine adult hippocampal NSC fate is regulated and described how scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB) blocks oligodendrocyte production to enable neuron generation. We found that SAFB prevents NSC expression of the transcription factor nuclear factor I/B (NFIB) by binding to sequences in the <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA and enhancing Drosha-dependent cleavage of the transcripts. We show that increasing SAFB expression prevents oligodendrocyte production by multipotent adult NSCs, and conditional deletion of <italic>Safb</italic> increases NFIB expression and oligodendrocyte formation in the adult hippocampus. Our results provide novel insights into a mechanism that controls Drosha functions for selective regulation of NSC fate by modulating the post-transcriptional destabilization of <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA in a lineage-specific manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Drosha</kwd><kwd>SAFB</kwd><kwd>adult neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>neural stem cells</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_162609</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Verdon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_182388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Verdon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Extensive analysis shows that the RNA-binding protein SAFB binds to Drosha in hippocampal stem cells and controls oligodendrocyte fate commitment through post-transcriptional regulation of NFIB expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent, generating the neurons and glia of the brain. NSCs produce neurons during development before switching to glial production and then disappearing from most regions of the brain. Therefore, NSC fate determination is precisely controlled. While neurogenesis is prominent at embryonic stages, in the adult vertebrate brain the generation of new neurons is predominantly restricted to two niches that maintain NSCs; the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Obernier and Alvarez-Buylla, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>). Whereas V-SVZ NSCs generate multiple neuron types, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, DG NSCs predominantly generate glutamatergic granule neurons and, to a lesser extent, astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pilz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonzano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonaguidi et al., 2011</xref>). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays a central role in memory formation, plasticity, and learning in rodents but has also been reported in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eriksson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spalding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gage, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boldrini et al., 2018</xref>). Although still controversial, hippocampal neurogenesis persists in humans, and changes in neuron production might be linked to neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boldrini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sorrells et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kempermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beckervordersandforth and Rolando, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tobin et al., 2019</xref>). In rodents, adult NSC regulation has been studied extensively at the molecular and physiological levels, however, the importance of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in adult neurogenesis is less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pilaz and Silver, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baser et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The ribonuclease Drosha is a core component of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway and forms the miRNA Microprocessor with DGCR8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). The Microprocessor cleaves primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA) stem loop hairpins (HPs) to generate precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) in a specific pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Pre-miRNAs are further processed into mature miRNAs by Dicer before being directed to target mRNAs by the RNA-induced silencing complex. However, Drosha has direct, non-canonical post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms beyond its function in miRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rolando and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Shin, 2018</xref>). Although miRNAs are important for terminal neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yoo et al., 2011</xref>), Drosha maintains the embryonic and hippocampal NSC pool independent of its miRNA biogenesis activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knuckles et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>). The proneural transcription factor Neurogenin2 specifies neuronal differentiation by NSCs and the expression of <italic>Neurog2</italic> gene is tightly controlled at the transcriptional level. At the post-transcriptional level, Drosha cleaves evolutionary conserved HPs in <italic>Neurog2</italic> mRNA transcripts inducing degradation and preventing translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knuckles et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to <italic>Neurog2</italic> transcripts, other mRNAs have been identified in NSCs that are cleaved by Drosha, including those of the transcription factors NeuroD1, NeuroD6, and NFIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knuckles et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>). NFIB is required and sufficient to promote glial fate specification by neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deneen et al., 2006</xref>). In the adult mouse hippocampus, Drosha destabilizes <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNAs preventing NFIB expression and thereby blocks DG NSCs from acquiring an oligodendrocytic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA contains HPs in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) and 3’ UTR, which are both bound by Drosha and the 3’ UTR HP is actively cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>). How Drosha binding to different mRNAs is regulated and cleavage specificity is achieved remains unclear.</p><p>Drosha’s activity on target RNAs is regulated by its binding partners. Although DGCR8 and Drosha form the core of the Microprocessor, multiple Drosha-interacting proteins have been identified, underlining its functional diversity in RNA and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spadotto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rouillard et al., 2016</xref>). It remains elusive how Drosha-mediated cleavage of specific mRNAs is regulated during NSC maintenance and cell fate determination. We hypothesized that the specificity of Drosha activity in the regulation of NSC cell fate determination is precisely regulated by its interacting partners. Hitherto, the composition of the Drosha-containing protein complexes in NSC of the adult brain are unknown.</p><p>Using proteomic analyzes, we identified Drosha-interacting proteins in DG hippocampal NSCs and found that the RNA-binding protein (RBP), SAFB, regulates Drosha’s activity in the destabilization of <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA. SAFB is implicated in multiple cellular processes including cellular stress, DNA damage response, cell growth and apoptosis, and has been linked to miRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altmeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Townson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Treiber et al., 2017</xref>). Although SAFB is expressed in many tissues, its expression is particularly high in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rivers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Townson et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that SAFB levels are high in DG NSCs, and thereby block oligodendrocytic differentiation by regulating Drosha cleavage of the <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Drosha-binding partners in DG NSCs</title><p>In order to examine the Drosha interactome in DG NSCs and identify proteins that potentially regulate canonical and non-canonical activities of Drosha in controlling NSC fate, we performed Drosha co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS<sup>2</sup>) from adult mouse DG NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). 165 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Drosha (p&lt;0.05, log<sub>2</sub> fold change ≥3, false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.001, peptide count ≥4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the majority of which are RBPs (138; 84%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). We compared the DG NSC Drosha interactome with results of a previous Drosha IP performed from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) and found an overlap of 24 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macias et al., 2015</xref>).

Therefore, approximately 50% of the canonical large Drosha complex proteins identified in other cellular systems were identified as Drosha partner proteins in DG NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). However, we identified over 100 novel Drosha partners. As expected, the canonical Drosha partner in the miRNA Microprocessor complex, DGCR8, was highly enriched in the DG NSC Drosha interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of Drosha and <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA with RNA-binding proteins in dentate gyrus (DG) neural stem cells (NSCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the endogenous Drosha co-immunoprecipitation procedure from DG NSCs followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS<sup>2</sup>) analysis.

In the adult DG, NSCs retain tri-lineage potency but differentiation to oligodendrocytes is blocked by suppression of NFIB protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>). Drosha destabilizes <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNAs in DG NSCs and, as a consequence, promotes neurogenesis. The <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA contains two evolutionary conserved HPs located in the 5’ and 3’ UTR, both of which are bound by Drosha but only the 3’ UTR HP is cleaved by Drosha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>). We found that DGCR8, the partner of Drosha in early miRNA biogenesis, does not interact with the <italic>Nfib</italic> UTR HPs and DGCR8 overexpression did not affect <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA cleavage. Therefore, DGCR8 and the core Microprocessor are unlikely to contribute directly to Drosha-mediated regulation of <italic>Nfib</italic> expression by adult NSCs. This implied the requirement for other factors in cell type-specific regulation of <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA stability.</p><p>Therefore, we used the <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR HPs as baits to capture interacting DG NSC proteins. Comparison of the MS<sup>2</sup> data from these pull-down experiments revealed major differences in the proteins associated with the 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR HPs suggesting different functions of these sequences in the control of NFIB expression. The <italic>Nfib</italic> 5’ UTR HP interacted with ribosomal proteins including RPL7, RPL15, RPL23a, RPL27, RPL31, RPS7, RPS15a, and RPS25 suggesting a role for the 5’ UTR HP in NFIB translation. This is supported by the GO analysis of the 5’ UTR HP-associated proteins suggesting translational regulation. Whether Drosha plays a role in NFIB translation through the 5’ UTR HP region of its mRNA remains unclear.</p><p>We considered that proteins that preferentially associate with the 3’ UTR HP of <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA potentially regulate the cleavage activity of Drosha at this site. We found that all three SAFB protein family members, SAFB-like transcription modulator (SLTM), SAFB, and SAFB2 bind to the <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA. STLM, SAFB, and SAFB2 were also pulled down from NSC lysates together with Drosha. As SAFB proteins form homo- and heterodimers, it is possible that they can form distinct multimeric complexes with Drosha and convey different functions. Interestingly, although broadly expressed, SAFB proteins are not redundant as SAFB-deficient mice die during embryonic development or perinatally whereas SAFB2-null mice are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ivanova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to SAFB, SLTM and SAFB2 do not bind selectively to the <italic>Nfib</italic> 3’ UTR HP. SAFB2 has been shown to bind to Drosha in human cells where it assists in the processing of the non-optimal miRNA15a/16-1 pri-miRNA cluster, although this function does not require the SAFB2 RNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutter et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, it will be important to also investigate the roles of SLTM and SAFB2 in DG NSC fate regulation.</p><p>SAFB has not been shown previously to bind to Drosha and is a novel partner of Drosha in adult DG NSCs where it regulates oligodendrogenesis both in vitro and in vivo by preventing NFIB expression. We showed that SAFB levels are important in controlling Drosha cleavage of <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA in a dose-dependent fashion. This is in line with the SAFB expression by adult DG NSCs, where oligodendrogenesis does not occur under physiological conditions, and lower expression by oligodendrogenic NSCs of the postnatal V-SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rivers et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>SAFB binds AT-rich scaffold-matrix attachment regions in DNA and GAA/AAG/AGA triplicates in a GAAGA consensus motif on RNA to regulate RNA-dependent chromatin organization and mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rivers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Nostrand et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stoilov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Renz and Fackelmayer, 1996</xref>). SAFB binding to the <italic>Nfib</italic> 3’ UTR HP but not to the <italic>Nfib</italic> 5’ UTR HP indicates sequence specificity, and we mapped putative SAFB-binding sites around the 3’ UTR HP which is supported by CLIP analysis of SAFB binding to <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA in HepG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Nostrand et al., 2020</xref>). Using RIP<sup>2</sup> we show that Drosha and SAFB interact with the same endogenous <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA transcript. In addition, a mutant form of SAFB lacking the RE protein interaction domain which does not bind Drosha did not promote cleavage of <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA transcripts. Together these data show that Drosha cleavage of <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA transcripts in DG NSCs requires SAFB binding and that both proteins associate simultaneously with the same transcript.</p><p>Here, we focused on SAFB, but found many novel Drosha-binding proteins that associated with the <italic>Nfib</italic> UTR HPs. Interestingly, SAM68, a member of the STAR family of RBPs, also affected <italic>Nfib</italic> HP processing. SAM68 has been shown to control RNA splicing also during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chawla et al., 2009</xref>). SAFB interacts with SAM68 and they co-distribute in the nucleus in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sergeant et al., 2007</xref>). SAM68 has been shown to interact with the Microprocessor in different systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Messina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sellier et al., 2013</xref>). It is currently unclear whether SAM68 controls Drosha canonical or non-canonical functions potentially together with SAFB. We found that in contrast to SAFB, FUS enhanced the levels of GFP expression from the <italic>Nfib</italic> 3’ UTR HP reporter. Interestingly, FUS also interacts with SAFB on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamaguchi and Takanashi, 2016</xref>). This raises the intriguing question of whether FUS and SAFB cooperate to regulate <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA or work in independent protein complexes.</p><p>In summary, several mRNAs are now known to be targets of Drosha and most of them contain evolutionarily conserved HP structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rolando and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knuckles et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johanson et al., 2013</xref>). More than 2000 human mRNAs are predicted to form secondary HPs that resemble pri-miRNAs, opening up a huge potential for non-canonical Drosha mRNA endonuclease function in different cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johanson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pedersen et al., 2006</xref>). Given the wide range of Drosha-interacting RBPs, it is conceivable that Drosha targets many more mRNAs than is currently appreciated and thus could control many biological processes. We propose that Drosha-mediated RNA cleavage requires interactions with specific RBPs that direct target specificity and activity potentially in a contextual and cell type-specific fashion. A differential targeting of Drosha to cell type-specific substrates has major implications in the dynamic control of Drosha activity and functions. Therefore, our data with in vivo implications uncovered novel Drosha-interacting proteins and in the future, it will be important to investigate these Drosha/RBP complexes and their functional involvement in NSC fate regulation as well as in other cellular systems and contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains and husbandry</title><p>The mouse alleles used in our experiments were: Rosa26-CAG::Egfp, Hes5::CreER<sup>T2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Drosha<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>Safb<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Both reviewers indicate the interest and importance of the topic, and acknowledge the significant amount of work put in providing evidence for the novel non-canonical Drosha's function mediated by Safb1 in vitro. However, they also raise a number of significant concerns regarding the biological significance of the described observations for the fate determination of adult hippocampal neural stem cells in vivo.</p><p>In particular, both reviewers express serious reservations concerning the in vitro cellular systems used to document most of the data reported in the paper.</p><p>Moreover, they also indicate that the propose effects on fate determination, as demonstrated now in vitro, are not convincing. The effects on fate determination towards the oligodendrocytic or neuronal fate need to be clearly shown and their in vivo relevance substantiated, and there are also concerns that you do not actually show that Drosha and Safb1 interact directly on the native NFIB's 3'UTR.</p><p>In addition to the reviewer's mayor concerns, some of the manuscript sections are difficult to read. In particular, the summary does not completely reflect the content of the manuscript and the introduction section seems to be written in a different level of writing fluidity than the rest of the manuscript, please revise them carefully. In general, It would be advisable to refer consistently to oligodendrocyte differentiation, rather than the more general &quot;glia&quot;, and to make a better effort to highlight the novelty and importance of your new findings over your previous work in Rolando et al., 2016.</p><p>Please consider carefully the experimental recommendations indicated by the reviewers</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

This could be achieved by LNA-antisense oligonucleotides targeting Safb1 transcript, or by overexpression of RNA oligos bearing the NFIB 3'UTR-HP, for example.

We deliberated about how to address the concern about the in vivo relevance of our findings. As <italic>Safb1</italic> knockout mice are perinatal lethal, we considered that the best approach to address this major concern was to generate a conditional knockout of <italic>Safb1</italic> (<italic>Safb1</italic> cKO) in adult DG neural stem cells, and address the effects on neural stem cell fate by performing lineage tracing. Therefore, we first had to generate a floxed <italic>Safb1</italic> allele in mice and delete <italic>Safb1</italic> from the adult neural stem cells using <italic>Hes5::CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> and to lineage trace the progeny of the <italic>Safb1</italic>-deficient stem cells. This naturally took a considerable amount of time and effort. We present the <italic>Safb1</italic> cKO data in the new Figure 8. We show that <italic>Safb1</italic> cKO from DG neural stem cells of adult mice significantly increases oligodendrocyte production, supporting our in vitro findings. In addition, we could show that loss of SAFB1 results in an increase in expression of the transcription factor NFIB by DG neural stem cells and their progeny supporting that the mechanism of SAFB1 action in controlling stem cell fate in the adult DG is, at least in part, through suppression of NFIB expression. Although this was a major effort, we believe this was the best way to show the relevance of the role of SAFB1 in the DG in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, both reviewers express serious reservations concerning the in vitro cellular systems used to document most of the data reported in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raised concerns that the cells used in the in vitro assays were not neural stem cells as they had been sorted on the basis of <italic>Hes5::GFP</italic> expression. However, there was a misunderstanding here as the DG neural stem cells were not isolated from the DG by sorting, but were isolated according to the protocol of Babu et al. 2007 (doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0000388) and cultured and differentiated according to Rolando et al. (doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2016.07.003). We have clarified this in the methods section of the revised manuscript and added a citation to Babu et al.. In addition, we added additional images of the DG neural stem cells and images of the neurons generated after removal of bFGF and EGF (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). In addition, we also stained the cells for “classic” astroglial markers under undifferentiated and differentiated culture conditions. As expected, the DG neural stem cells used do not express GFAP or S100b under undifferentiated culture conditions, but generate a few astrocytes upon differentiation. These data are included in the revised Figure 4—figure supplement 1 in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, they also indicate that the propose effects on fate determination, as demonstrated now in vitro, are not convincing.

To address this, we have generated a floxed <italic>Safb1</italic> allele and conditionally deleted <italic>Safb1</italic> from adult DG neural stem cells in vivo and followed their fate (new Figure 8). This was a huge effort but we believe that the results convincingly show that SAFB1 regulates oligodendogliogenesis in the adult hippocampus in vivo. In addition, we could show that loss of SAFB1 results in an increase in NFIB protein levels in DG neural stem cells and their progeny. We hope that these new data convince the reviewers of the role of SAFB1 in suppressing oligodendrocyte formation in the adult mouse DG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>…and there are also concerns that you do not actually show that Drosha and Safb1 interact directly on the native NFIB's 3'UTR.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. We had shown with CLIP experiments with anti-SAFB1 antibodies in DG neural stem cells that SAFB1 binds native <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNAs. These results show that endogenous SAFB1 can bind <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA. These data are also supported by SAFB1 CLIP experiments performed in HepG cells (Van Nostrand et al., 2020). In addition, we showed previously that Drosha interacts directly with native <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA in DG neural stem cells (Rolando et al. 2016).</p><p>The reviewers raised the question of whether Drosha and SAFB1 interact with the same <italic>Nfib</italic> transcript. This was not trivial to address. We needed to develop a novel method of re-RNA precipitation (RIP<sup>2</sup>) of RNA transcripts that simultaneously associate with endogenous Drosha and SAFB1. ReRIP is not an established procedure and, therefore, we developed a method on the basis of a reChIP procedure. These experiments were extremely challenging but clearly show that sequential precipitation of Drosha and then SAFB1 from DG neural stem cells pulls-down the endogenous <italic>Nfib</italic> 3’ UTR region of the RNA transcript (revised Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the reviewer's mayor concerns, some of the manuscript sections are difficult to read.

We have tried to highlight the novelty of our findings showing that SAFB1 controls Drosha activity in adult DG neural stem cell fate decisions. We have completely revised the summary to reflect our findings. We have changed the text to refer to oligodendrocyte formation rather than glial differentiation. We hope that the reviewers appreciate the great effort we have made in addressing their concerns. The reviewer’s comments have certainly improved the manuscript and led to us being able to solidify our interpretations of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

The differentiation protocol we used to induce gliogenesis are based on previous experiments and are described in Rolando et al. 2016. However, we have added additional images of immunostains of the DG neural stem cells with astrocytic markers (GFAP and S100b) under undifferentiating and differentiating conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How were the RBPs from the Drosha-interacting protein dataset selected for the gain-of-function experiments in Tet-on DG NSCs? In addition, Sam68 and Tdp4 cannot be found neither in Figure 1G nor in the relevant supplementary table.</p></disp-quote><p>The RBPs we show were selected based on their interaction with Drosha and NFIB RNA HP regions and ranking across the various assays. However, we chose those that were pulled-down with Drosha from DG neural stem cells. The lists we present in the excel sheets contain the genbank information which includes the gene ID and gene name. As some proteins have different gene names, we considered it was more consistent to use the gene names. The gene encoding SAM68 is <italic>Khdrbs1</italic> which can be found in multiple lists in the data sheets. The gene encoding TDP43 is <italic>Tardbp</italic>, which is also present in many of the data sets presented in Table S2. In Figure 1G, Tardbp is present in the RBPs enriched in the <italic>Nfib</italic> 5’ UTR HP pull-down list (list C in Table S3 iVenn).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We turned to a heterologous cell type N2A for these biochemical experiments as N2A cells are considerably easier to transfect than primary DG neural stem cells. Therefore, in order to have consistent and sufficient material, a cell line that expresses Drosha, SAFB1 and NFIB mRNA was needed for these experiments. It should be noted that neuroblastoma N2A cells express endogenously Drosha, SAFB1 and <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 7E, the Sox10 signal -if anything- increases upon Safb1 OE, in contract to the quantification indicated in Figure 7F. The authors should explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we are not sure what the reviewer is referring to here. The quantification shown in Figure 7E shows the quantification of levels of SAFB1 protein in DG versus V-SVZ neural stem cells (mean intensity). In Figure 7G we show the effects of SAFB1 OE on Sox10 expression. In this experiment, the SAFB1 overexpressing cells (lower panels) are labelled with CFP and indicated with arrows. In Figure 7H, we show the quantification of proportion of transfected cells (CFP+) that express Sox10 (Sox10<sup>+</sup>CFP<sup>+</sup>) and not the levels. We hope this clarifies the issue for the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. in vivo staining of Sox10 is mentioned in the text but not shown in Figure 7A.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment.

For example, it is not clear why the modified in vitro processing assay of NFIB HP (shown in Figure 6 F, G) was done with the Drosha/Safb1 complexes precipitated from N2A cells instead from DG NSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The reason we had to use N2A cells for isolation of the SAFB1-Drosha complexes was that knockdown of <italic>Safb1</italic> mRNA in DG neural stem cells in vitro resulted in cell death under undifferentiating culture conditions – this we stated in the manuscript. Hence, in order to generate endogenous SAFB1-Drosha complexes where SAFB1 levels were reduced in a controlled manner by knockdown, we had to turn to an alternative cell type. As N2A cells express SAFB1Drosha and <italic>Nfib</italic> mRNA, and Drosha seems to regulate NFIB protein levels in these cells, we considered that the SAFB1-Drosha complexes in N2A play similar roles in N2A as in DG neural stem cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state that Safb1 KD in cultured DG NSCs led to a rapid increase in activated Casp3 and cell death within 48 hours, preventing further fate analysis.

This strategy should induce oligodendrocyte fate in DG NSCs (in vitro upon GF removal in presence of serum as in Figure 7B), as well as in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. Indeed, we used antisense esiRNA knockdown in DG neural stem cells in an attempt to reduce SAFB1 levels and this induced cell death. Overexpressing NFIB 3’ UTR hairpin is an interesting idea. However, when we performed the activity screening experiments with the Tet-regulated <italic>Nfib</italic> hairpin containing expression vectors (where the 3’ UTR hairpin is highly expressed) we did not see effects on stem cell survival or differentiation. This we interpret to suggest that the Drosha cleavage activity on <italic>Nfib</italic> RNA is highly efficient (which we also show in the manuscript and in Rolando et al. 2016) and, hence, it is not easy to saturate the process under physiological conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Overexpression of Safb1 in V-SVZ NSCs reduced oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro, is this true also in vivo? What happens to the levels of endogenous NFIB in these cells upon OE of Safb1?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important question. We have not performed over expression of SAFB1 in vivo. In the revisions, we focused on the essential requirements and addressed the knockout of <italic>Safb1</italic> and the co-binding of SAFBI and Drosha to endogenous NFIB. Although this is a very important question, we focused on addressing the role of SAFB1 in the DG neural stem cells during the revisions. We are planning to address the roles of SAFB1 in SVZ and other neural stem cells in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Beside Safb1, the expression of NFIB protein in SVZ NSCs and DG NSCs should be also documented in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we now document and quantified NFIB levels in DG neural stem cells and show images before and after <italic>Safb1</italic> ablation (Figure 8 E and F). We include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> showing NFIB expression in the V-SVZ and adjacent striatum. As the manuscript is focused on the role of SAFB1 in the DG and not the in adult SVZ, we believe this data does not add important information to the manuscript. We are addressing additional roles of SAFB1 in neurogenesis including in the V-SVZ, but these analyses are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of NFIB in the V-SVZ of adult Hes5::CreER<sup>T2</sup> Rosa26-CAG::Egfp mice 21 days after Tamoxifen induction (as described in Figure 8A of the manuscript) and lineage tracing of V-SVZ neural stem cells and their progeny (GFP<sup>+</sup>).</title><p>NFIB expression was found in the stem and progenitor cells of the V-SVZ (arrowheads) and GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes in the striatum (*).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74940-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
