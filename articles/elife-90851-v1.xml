sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Here, we determined electron crystallographic structures of AQP0 in sphingomyelin/cholesterol membranes and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish that the observed cholesterol positions represent those seen around an isolated AQP0 tetramer and that the AQP0 tetramer largely defines the location and orientation of most of its associated cholesterol molecules. At a high concentration, cholesterol increases the hydrophobic thickness of the annular lipid shell around AQP0 tetramers, which may thus cluster to mitigate the resulting hydrophobic mismatch. Moreover, neighboring AQP0 tetramers sandwich a cholesterol deep in the center of the membrane. MD simulations show that the association of two AQP0 tetramers is necessary to maintain the deep cholesterol in its position and that the deep cholesterol increases the force required to laterally detach two AQP0 tetramers, not only due to protein–protein contacts but also due to increased lipid–protein complementarity. Since each tetramer interacts with four such ‘glue’ cholesterols, avidity effects may stabilize larger arrays. The principles proposed to drive AQP0 array formation could also underlie protein clustering in lipid rafts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>electron crystallography</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulations</kwd><kwd>lipid rafts</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>array formation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY015107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walz</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Tandem initiative at the Universidad de los Andes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orjuela</surname><given-names>Juan D</given-names></name><name><surname>Aponte Santamaría</surname><given-names>Camilo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007316</institution-id><institution>Klaus Tschira Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aponte Santamaría</surname><given-names>Camilo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019560</institution-id><institution>Bayerisches Hochschulzentrum für Lateinamerika</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orjuela</surname><given-names>Juan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electron crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations show that a cholesterol sandwiched in between two neighboring aquaporin-0 tetramers stabilizes the association between the tetramers and thus promotes array formation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The current view of biological membranes is that proteins are densely packed and often organized into functional modules that perform specific biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Engelman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nicolson, 2014</xref>).

Cholesterol has a planar four-aromatic ring structure with a short isooctyl alkyl chain and a small 3-β-hydroxyl head group that can form a hydrogen bond with a polar group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because the aliphatic groups linked to the ring system are asymmetrically distributed, cholesterol features a smooth (or α) face and a rough (or β) face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It makes up 40–90% of the lipids in eukaryotic cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Liscum and Munn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>).

With a molar ratio of cholesterol to other phospholipids ranging from 2.02 to 2.52, the human lens core plasma membrane features the highest molar cholesterol content of all membranes found in human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fleschner and Cenedella, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zelenka, 1984</xref>). Aquaporin-0 (AQP0), a lens-specific water channel, is the most abundant membrane protein in lens membranes (over 60% of the total protein content) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alcalá et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloemendal et al., 1972</xref>), where it forms large two-dimensional (2D) arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gorin et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kistler and Bullivant, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zampighi et al., 1982</xref>).</p><p>The propensity of AQP0 to form 2D crystals was used to determine its structure by electron crystallography (EC) of in vitro assembled 2D crystals grown with the lipid dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gonen et al., 2005</xref>). Later, AQP0 2D crystals were grown with a variety of different lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hite et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>). All these crystals had the same lattice constants, which were identical to those of AQP0 arrays in native lens membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buzhynskyy et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, in vitro grown 2D crystals recapitulate the organization of AQP0 tetramers in 2D arrays in the native lens membrane. Interestingly, however, high-resolution EC studies, which also resolved the annular lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gonen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>), showed that AQP0 tetramers in the 2D crystals are separated by a layer of lipids and form essentially no direct protein–protein interactions. As the crystal contacts are almost exclusively mediated by lipids, it is surprising that AQP0 2D crystals could be obtained with almost every lipid tested.</p><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further advanced our understanding of how lipids interact with AQP0. Initial simulations probing the interactions of AQP0 with lipids were carried out with pure DMPC and mixed DMPC:cholesterol membrane patches, predicting the existence of a cholesterol hotspot at the extracellular side of the AQP0 surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">O’Connor and Klauda, 2011</xref>). Later, MD simulations demonstrated that the positions of lipids around AQP0 seen in EC structures obtained from 2D crystals, in which the lipids are constrained by the protein crystal packing, are indeed representative of the localization of unconstrained lipids around individual AQP0 tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>). Molecular aspects, such as protein mobility and surface roughness, were identified to play key roles in defining the lipid positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briones et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, a combination of coarse-grained and atomistic MD simulations revealed that annular lipids adopt similar positions around several members of the aquaporin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Stansfeld et al., 2013</xref>), while mass spectrometry demonstrated the weak nature of the interaction of lipids with AQPZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Laganowsky et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In vitro, AQP0 can be induced to form 2D crystals by choosing a very specific lipid-to-protein ratio (LPR) for reconstitution, but this in vitro approach does not explain why AQP0 tetramers form 2D arrays in native lens membranes, which contain an excess of lipids as well as other membrane proteins. Since lipids mediate the interactions in AQP0 2D arrays, it is likely that specific lipids play a role in the assembly of AQP0 2D arrays in the native lens membrane. As AQP0-containing lens membrane junctions are greatly enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fleschner and Cenedella, 1991</xref>), lipids that play a key role in raft formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown and London, 2000</xref>), these lipids were prime candidates to drive AQP0 array formation. To gain structural insights into how cholesterol and/or sphingomyelin may induce AQP0 to form 2D crystals in vivo and potentially to obtain a more general understanding of how these lipids can establish lipid microdomains, we determined structures of AQP0 in membranes formed by mixtures of sphingomyelin and cholesterol and performed extensive equilibrium and force-probe MD simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AQP0 forms 2D crystals with all tested cholesterol/sphingomyelin mixtures</title><p>Purified AQP0 was reconstituted with mixtures of sphingomyelin and cholesterol at molar ratios of 1:0, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 0:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>).

AQP0 appears to fulfill this requirement as it does form membranes with cholesterol. However, reconstitution of AQP0 with cholesterol only yielded membranes within a narrow LPR range, from 0.2 to 0.4. At higher or lower LPRs, only protein aggregates and no membranes were observed.</p><p>Fourier transforms of cryo-EM images of trehalose-embedded AQP0 2D crystals formed with cholesterol at an LPR of 0.4 showed clear reflections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), establishing that the crystals have the same lattice constants as all other AQP0 2D crystals analyzed to date (<italic>a</italic>=65.5 Å, <italic>b</italic>=65.5 Å, and <italic>γ</italic>=90°).

We considered two lipid interfaces between the two neighboring tetramers: an ‘SM interface’ that consisted of only SM lipids at the positions seen in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure, and a second identical one, except that two SM molecules were replaced by the deep-binding Chol3 molecules in the position observed in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Comparison of these two cases should allow us to assess the effect of the deep-binding Chol3 molecules on the mechanical stability of the associated AQP0 tetramers. During a cumulative time of 10 μs of equilibrium MD simulations, the two AQP0 tetramers overall behaved very similarly for the two interfaces and stayed close together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), exhibiting only minor variations (of less than 13.4°) in angular lateral, tilt, and torsional intra-tetramer motions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To explore the effect of the deep cholesterols on the mechanical stability of the paired tetramers in response to a lateral mechanical perturbation, we applied an external harmonic force to the tetramers, attaching virtual springs to their centers of mass and moving these springs in opposite directions at constant velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The force exerted on the two tetramers was ramped up until the two tetramers detached from each other and the force leveled off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). The resulting force–distance profiles revealed that the tetramer pairs withstood a higher force before detachment when cholesterol was present at the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). More quantitatively, at our fastest pulling rate of 0.1 m/s, at which the integrity of the membrane was still maintained, the detachment forces were not significantly different whether the interface contained cholesterol or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). However, for the slower pulling rates of 0.02 m/s and 0.004 m/s, which are more relevant, because there should not be strong forces pulling on AQP0 tetramers in native membranes, the detachment force required to separate the tetramers was statistically significantly higher when their interface contained cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Thus, because a higher force is required to separate neighboring AQP0 tetramers when cholesterol is present at their interface, deep cholesterols appear to mechanically stabilize AQP0 arrays.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of pairs of associated aquaporin-0 (AQP0) tetramers and force-induced separation of two associated AQP0 tetramers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distance between the centers of mass <italic>d<sub>CM</sub></italic> (top) and minimum distance <italic>d<sub>tet-tet</sub></italic> (bottom) between the pair of AQP0 tetramers during the 2×AQP0 simulations in equilibrium for the interface containing only sphingomyelin (SM) molecules (SM, green) and the interface containing the deep cholesterol (Chol, blue) (n=10 simulations for each case).

The approximate angular extent for each of the modes, attributed to these projections, is indicated (in degrees). The distributions with and without cholesterol are very similar, except for PC1.

The probability of formation increased mainly for residue pairs above the two cholesterol molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>).

We quantified surface complementarity as the contact area between the sandwiched lipids (either cholesterol or sphingomyelin) and the two tetramers, <italic>A<sub>Contact</sub></italic>, and normalized it by the surface area of the lipid in question, <italic>A<sub>Lipid</sub></italic>, i.e., a larger <italic>A<sub>Contact</sub></italic>/<italic>A<sub>Lipid</sub></italic> ratio would indicate a higher surface complementarity between the lipid and the proteins (see Materials and methods for details of this calculation and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> for a schematic diagram).

Remarkably, the sandwiched cholesterol displayed a higher surface complementarity than the sandwiched sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). This analysis thus suggests that cholesterol better accommodates to the roughness of the two AQP0 tetramer surfaces than sphingomyelin can, a feature that may contribute to the enhanced resistance of associated tetramers to detach when cholesterol is present at their interface.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we determined two EC structures of AQP0 in membranes formed by sphingomyelin and cholesterol. As these so-called raft lipids are the main constituents of lens membranes, they represent the natural environment of AQP0. The AQP0 crystals formed in sphingomyelin/cholesterol membranes have the same lattice constants as previous 2D crystals obtained with other lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gonen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>) as well as the 2D arrays found in lens membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buzhynskyy et al., 2007</xref>). The 2D crystals thus reflect the arrangement of AQP0 tetramers in native 2D arrays.</p><p>Our structure of AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> reveals seven sphingomyelins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the same number of lipids also seen in structures of AQP0 in bilayers formed by DMPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gonen et al., 2005</xref>) and EPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>), and these are also located in almost identical positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). The interaction of sphingomyelins with AQP0 thus seems to be governed by the same principles that were found for phosphoglycerolipids, namely that the acyl chains locate to grooves in the protein surface and that the lipid head groups make few if any interactions with the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>). However, compared to the acyl chains in the EPL bilayer, those of the sphingomyelins appear to be straighter, which likely reflects the saturated nature of the sphingomyelin acyl chains. Despite this difference, the structure of the sphingomyelin bilayer is very similar to those of bilayers formed by phosphoglycerolipids, indicating that sphingomyelin by itself is unlikely the reason for AQP0 to form 2D arrays in lens membranes.</p><p>Cholesterol has a higher affinity for sphingomyelin than for phosphoglycerolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Niu and Litman, 2002</xref>), because the mostly saturated acyl chains of sphingomyelin can better accommodate the planar ring system of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Epand and Epand, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>) and because the sphingomyelin backbone has two hydrogen-bond donor groups, an amide and a hydroxyl group, that make hydrogen bonding to cholesterol more effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Róg and Pasenkiewicz-Gierula, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction of the sphingomyelin amide group with the hydroxyl group of cholesterol orients the smooth (α) face of the cholesterol toward sphingomyelin, leaving only the rough (β) face to interact with membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fantini and Barrantes, 2013</xref>). In the context of AQP0 2D arrays, however, these interactions do not appear to occur. While Chol1 does interact with sphingomyelin acyl chains in both structures, the additional cholesterols in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure seem to have little interactions with sphingomyelin acyl chains and instead seem to substitute for some of the sphingomyelin acyl chains seen in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). We also do not observe interactions between the hydroxyl head group of any cholesterols with an amide group of the sphingomyelins. While we cannot rule out that specific sphingomyelin–cholesterol interactions occur in the membrane area enclosed by four AQP0 tetramers (where we were unable to build models for the lipids due to the fourfold symmetry axis), our structures suggest that specific sphingomyelin–cholesterol interactions do not play a critical role in AQP0 array formation in the lens membrane.</p><p>Cholesterol increases the order of lipid acyl chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Meyer and Smit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lafleur et al., 1990</xref>), and the resulting phase transition is thought to contribute to the segregation of cholesterol-enriched membrane areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pandit et al., 2007</xref>). A potential mechanism by which cholesterol could induce AQP0 array formation could thus be that cholesterol bound to AQP0 would order the surrounding lipids, leading to a phase transition that leads to an initial segregation and crystallization of the AQP0/cholesterol/sphingomyelin units in the membrane.</p><p>In an attempt to assess this possibility, we looked at the <italic>B</italic>-factors of the acyl chains, which are affected, among other factors, by the mobility of the atoms. Comparison of corresponding acyl chains showed that the <italic>B</italic>-factors of the acyl chains in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure tend to be slightly lower than those of the acyl chains in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the cholesterols could have an ordering effect on the sphingomyelin acyl chains. However, the <italic>B</italic>-factors of the acyl chains in the AQP0<sub>EPL</sub> structure, which contain double bonds and are not constrained by cholesterol and should thus be much less ordered, are similar to those of the acyl chains in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure. A likely explanation is that acyl chains, including unsaturated ones, preferentially fill in grooves in the protein surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>), which should already substantially constrain their mobility. Therefore, cholesterol bound to the protein surface may not add much additional constraints to their already restricted mobility. Cholesterol-induced phase separation thus does not seem to be a likely cause for AQP0 array formation.</p><p>The hydrophobic thickness is an important characteristic of a lipid bilayer, which depends on the length and saturation of the acyl chains of the lipids forming the bilayer. Mismatch of the hydrophobic thickness between a membrane protein and the lipid bilayer is thought to be one mechanism by which membrane proteins can cluster in a membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hanulová and Weiss, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>). One factor that affects the hydrophobic thickness of a membrane is its cholesterol content, which is related to the ordering effect of cholesterol on the lipid acyl chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Meyer and Smit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lafleur et al., 1990</xref>). Change in cholesterol-induced hydrophobic thickness may thus be another potential force that drives the formation of AQP0 arrays in the lens membrane. Our measurements of the average distance between the phosphorus atoms of the phosphodiester groups and the nitrogen atoms of the amide groups of the sphingomyelins in the two leaflets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) show that both distances are larger for the bilayer with the higher cholesterol content, by ~3 Å for the phosphodiester groups and ~4 Å for the amide groups, suggesting that a higher cholesterol content indeed increases the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer formed by the annular sphingomyelins.</p><p>In cells, sphingomyelin is predominantly found in the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Devaux, 1991</xref>), so that sphingomyelins seen in the extracellular leaflet in our two structures likely represent true positions of sphingomyelin in native AQP0 2D arrays. The two sphingomyelins in the extracellular leaflet that are seen in both sphingomyelin/cholesterol membranes are in exactly the same position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), establishing that the extracellular leaflet does not change its position relative to AQP0 upon thickening of the membrane with increasing cholesterol content. Sphingomyelin SM3 may be responsible for the fixed position of the extracellular leaflet. In all structures of AQP0 in different lipid bilayers, the lipid at the position equivalent to that of SM3 always has the best-defined density and the lowest <italic>B</italic>-factors (including for the acyl chains; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The lipid at this position is always the only one whose head group makes interactions with AQP0. It is thus possible that the lipid at this position defines and locks in the position of the extracellular leaflet with respect to AQP0. As a result, the extracellular leaflet does not play a role in defining the thickness of the membrane.</p><p>The increase in hydrophobic thickness with higher cholesterol content is the result of the three sphingomyelins in the cytoplasmic leaflet moving further out from the bilayer center, which they do even though this leaflet contains only a single cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The notion that an increase in hydrophobic thickness is predominantly due to movements of lipids in the cytoplasmic leaflet is consistent with the observation that these lipids are usually more mobile, i.e., have higher <italic>B</italic>-factors in crystal structure than lipids in the extracellular leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belrhali et al., 1999</xref>). Comparison of the lipid arrangement in the cytoplasmic leaflet shows that Chol4 in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure assumes the position of SM6 in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). The new position of the displaced SM6 in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure is further out from the bilayer center and potentially is the cause for similar outward movements of lipids SM5 and SM7, thus defining the new position of the cytoplasmic leaflet and increasing the hydrophobic thickness of the annular lipid bilayer. Hence, a higher cholesterol concentration of the membrane does increase the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer formed by the annular lipids surrounding AQP0 tetramers, thus creating a hydrophobic mismatch with the remaining lipid bilayer, which, in turn, would provide a driving force for AQP0 tetramers to cluster in the native lens membrane.</p><p>The cholesterols in our structures do not interact with AQP0 through consensus cholesterol-binding sites known as the <underline>C</underline>holesterol <underline>R</underline>ecognition/interaction <underline>A</underline>mino acid <underline>C</underline>onsensus sequence (CRAC domain; -L/V-(X)<sub>1-5</sub>-Y-(X)<sub>1-5</sub>-R/K-) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Li and Papadopoulos, 1998</xref>) or the inverted CRAC domain, CARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baier et al., 2011</xref>). Cholesterol can also bind to membrane proteins in a fashion that does not involve a CRAC or CARC domain, as seen for example for the influenza M2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Elkins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Elkins et al., 2017</xref>) and α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fantini et al., 2011</xref>). Emerging cryo-EM structures of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) also do not show a consensus motif for their interaction with cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sarkar and Chattopadhyay, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Taghon et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the cholesterols interact with AQP0 through their smooth α face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is not engaged in interactions with sphingomyelin as previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fantini and Barrantes, 2013</xref>), thus differing from the predominant interaction of cholesterols with GPCRs, the G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium-2 (GIRK2) channel, and the Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which occur predominantly through the rough β face of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gimpl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mathiharan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shinoda et al., 2009</xref>). However, there are other cases in which cholesterol interacts with membrane proteins through its α face, such as seen for the Niemann–Pick C1-like 1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Likely the residues on the protein surface determine whether a protein interacts with cholesterol through its α or β face. The smooth α face interacts with aromatic side chains through π-stacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nishio et al., 1995</xref>), whereas the β face appears to interact with hydrophobic side chains, such as leucine, valine, or isoleucine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fantini et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Chol3 is the most unusual lipid in our structures, because it is located in the middle of the lipid bilayer and because it is sandwiched between two neighboring AQP tetramers. Binding sites for cholesterol in the middle of the membrane have also been described for GPCRs, and these sites have been named ‘deep binding sites’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Genheden et al., 2017</xref>). A docking investigation with known membrane protein structures for cholesterol-binding sites revealed deep binding sites not only in GPCRs but also in ion channels and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lee, 2018</xref>). Unlike any other cholesterol in our structures, Chol3 interacts directly with two AQP0 subunits that are part of different tetramers. This interaction is different from the cholesterol-induced dimerization of GPCRs as these are mediated by interactions between two or more cholesterol molecules rather than one cholesterol directly interacting with two GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gimpl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>). The two adjacent AQP0 tetramers form a pocket that is ~8.5 Å wide at the position of the ring system and ~2.5 Å at the position of the acyl chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The interaction surface on the AQP0 subunit interacting with the smooth face of Chol3 encompasses 373 Å<sup>2</sup> and is formed by residues Ser106, Val103, Ala102, Ala99, and Leu21, which line the ring system, and three phenylalanine residues, Phe17, Phe18, and Phe14, which surround the acyl chain. The interaction surface on the AQP0 subunit interacting with the rough face of Chol3 is 344 Å<sup>2</sup> and is predominantly formed by residues Ile132, Ile135, Phe136, Ile210, Leu214, and Leu217 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Leucine and isoleucine residues have also been found to mediate the interaction of many GPCRs with the rough β face of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gimpl, 2016</xref>). The hydroxyl head group of Chol3 interacts with a water molecule that may be stabilized through an interaction with Ser126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Because of its intricate interactions with two AQP0 subunits, Chol3 can likely function as a glue that can keep two tetramers together. This structural characteristic may be the reason why AQP0 can form 2D arrays in pure cholesterol membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p><p>To gain further insights into the role cholesterol plays in the stability of AQP0 arrays, we used MD simulations to investigate the interplay between cholesterol and AQP0. The first set of simulations investigated the localization of cholesterol around a single AQP0 tetramer. Cholesterol positioned at well-defined positions, i.e., hotspots, that were in notable agreement with both the predicted positions from a previous computational study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">O’Connor and Klauda, 2011</xref>) and the positions in the EC structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, as it has been previously demonstrated to be the case for phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>), the crystal packing in the crystallographic structures does not greatly affect the positioning of cholesterol around AQP0. In consequence, crystallographic cholesterol positions recapitulate the behavior of unconstrained cholesterol molecules around a single AQP0 tetramer. This is the case for all cholesterols except for one, the deep cholesterol, which will be discussed in detail below. Cholesterol localization around membrane proteins has been extensively studied, especially in the context of the regulation and activity of GPCRs, exchangers, and ion channels, but also aquaporins (for a comprehensive review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Corradi et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, in coarse-grained MD simulations, when AQP1 was embedded in a lipid bilayer resembling the plasma membrane, cholesterol was enriched at two positions that qualitatively correspond to the lateral projections of Chol3 and Chol4 positions observed here for AQP0 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> with Figure 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corradi et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that individual AQP0 and AQP1 tetramers share similarities in their cholesterol-binding fingerprints, as was already shown for phospholipids in this protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Stansfeld et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, cholesterol was rather depleted from the Chol1 position in AQP1. The shape of the protein surface has been shown to critically define the positions where lipids non-specifically associate with AQP0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briones et al., 2017</xref>) and also other proteins (e.g. ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Niemelä et al., 2010</xref>] and GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kurth et al., 2020</xref>], among many others reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Corradi et al., 2019</xref>). This principle presumably applies here, too, i.e., the different surface of AQP0 at the Chol1 position, compared to that of AQP1, may result in a greater association of cholesterol over sphingolipids in this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">3</xref>).</p><p>In a second set of simulations, we attempted to understand the molecular reasons for the unusual position of deep-binding Chol3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We demonstrate that neither a single AQP0 tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>) nor a specific bulk cholesterol concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) is sufficient to maintain annular cholesterol molecules at such a deeply inserted position. Instead, the constraint imposed by two adjacent AQP0 tetramers and the coordination of two water molecules were required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data are thus consistent with the existence of deep cholesterol positions but only in a highly constrained setup that involves two AQP0 tetramers. The immediate questions raised by the existence of deep cholesterols are whether these affect the formation and/or stability of 2D AQP0 arrays.</p><p>Our simulations provide strong evidence for a direct influence of deep cholesterol molecules on the mechanical stability of the association between two adjacent AQP0 tetramers. We demonstrate that two adjacent tetramers can withstand larger lateral detachment forces when their interface contains deep cholesterol molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–F</xref>). Crystal structures of several membrane proteins already revealed that cholesterol can mediate crystal packing interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Crnjar and Molteni, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Khunweeraphong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the presence of cholesterol has been reported to influence membrane–protein oligomerization, a feature mainly explored for GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Corradi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gahbauer and Böckmann, 2016</xref>). We expand on these data, by providing evidence of cholesterol—directly—engaging in the stronger attachment of two membrane proteins. We attribute this to cholesterol facilitating the formation of transient protein–protein contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>) together with providing higher surface complementarity when sandwiched between two AQP0 tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>). Cardiolipin is a phospholipid that has been implicated in stabilizing transient α-helical membrane protein oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>). More specifically, cardiolipin has been described to serve as a ‘glue’ for the cytochrome components of the respiratory chain in mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arnarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, cardiolipin also impacts the resistance of AQPZ, the bacterial homolog of AQP0, to unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Laganowsky et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, lipids have been recently shown to mediate protein assembly in the outer membrane of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Webby et al., 2022</xref>). Analogous to these systems and based on our EC structures and MD simulations, we propose that deep cholesterol increases the mechanical stability of associated AQP0 tetramers. Although we provide solid evidence here that deep cholesterol imparts mechanical stabilization, free energy calculations would be required to obtain the full picture of thermodynamic stabilization. However, such free energy calculations are challenging for lipids, due to the chemical complexity and poor convergence involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), and are thus beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>Our structures of AQP0 arrays in sphingomyelin bilayers with low and high cholesterol content and the results from the MD simulations allow us to propose a model for cholesterol-induced array formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In a lipid bilayer with a low cholesterol concentration, cholesterol may interact with AQP0 predominantly through the most specific cholesterol-binding site, the one occupied by Chol1, but this interaction would be transient and would not have a meaningful effect on the organization of the surrounding lipid molecules (sphingomyelin in our AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). An increase in cholesterol concentration will cause more cholesterols in the extracellular leaflet to bind to AQP0. In addition, cholesterol will also enrich in the cytoplasmic leaflet and associate with AQP0. This interaction will shift the annular lipids in this leaflet further away from the membrane center and create a hydrophobic mismatch between the shell of annular lipids and the surrounding lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Driven by the force to minimize membrane tension induced by hydrophobic mismatch, AQP0 tetramers will cluster. Cholesterols in between the tetramers can diffuse deeper into the membrane and associate with deep binding sites on AQP0, thus stabilizing the interaction between adjacent tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Alternatively, it may also be possible that cholesterol first interacts with a deep binding site on one AQP0 but is only stabilized as the second AQP0 traps it in position. As each AQP0 tetramer has four deep cholesterol-binding sites, the avidity effect would result in the formation and stabilization of large 2D arrays as those seen in native lens membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for how an increasing cholesterol concentration drives aquaporin-0 (AQP0) two-dimensional (2D) array formation in the native lens membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) At a low cholesterol concentration, AQP0 tetramers are mostly surrounded by phospholipids and sphingomyelin. Free cholesterol in the membrane (green ovals) only associates with the highest affinity cholesterol-binding sites. Cholesterols occupying these peripheral binding sites are shown as red ovals and the black double-headed arrow indicates the transient nature of this interaction. The deep cholesterol-binding sites (orange squares) are not occupied. (<bold>B</bold>) With increasing cholesterol concentration, more cholesterols associate with the AQP0 surface. These cholesterols cause the interacting lipids in the cytoplasmic leaflet to move out from the bilayer center (blue arrow), resulting in the annular lipid shell that has a bigger hydrophobic thickness than the surrounding membrane, creating a hydrophobic mismatch that results in membrane deformation. (<bold>C</bold>) To minimize hydrophobic mismatch, AQP0 tetramers cluster. Cholesterol in between adjacent tetramers can move into the deep binding sites (yellow arrow) and cholesterol occupying deep binding sites (yellow ovals) act as glue that increases that association of the adjacent tetramers (indicated by the small double-headed black arrow) as compared to adjacent tetramers that do not sandwich a deep-binding cholesterol (indicated by the large double-headed black arrow). Clustering of proteins to minimize hydrophobic mismatch and stabilization by deep cholesterol-mediated protein–protein interactions may be the basis for the formation of transient lipid rafts. (<bold>D</bold>) Each AQP0 tetramer has four deep cholesterol-binding sites. As a result of the avidity effect, AQP0 can form large and stable 2D arrays.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90851-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>This model is specific for the formation of AQP0 arrays in lens membranes, but we speculate that similar principles may underlie the organization of lipid rafts. AQP0 may be special in that it forms tetramers and thus has four deep cholesterol-binding sites, so that the avidity effect allows it to form much larger domains than seen for typical lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zelenka, 1984</xref>). In addition, it is presumably not common that the same protein has surfaces that can interact with both the smooth α and the rough β face of cholesterol. However, cholesterol would have the potential to mediate the association of any protein with an α face-interacting surface with any other protein that features a β face-interacting surface. Thus, while hydrophobic mismatch and phase separation may be driving forces that bring proteins into close proximity, cholesterol may be the actual glue that increases the time they remain associated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Purification of AQP0</title><p>AQP0 was purified as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gonen et al., 2004</xref>.

In this case, both the tetramer pair and the sandwiched lipids were inserted in a membrane containing 1594 lipids.</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Summary of the simulations.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Scheme</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Protein system</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Membrane system</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Pulling rate (m/s)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Number of replicas</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Length per replica (ns)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="10">Equilibrium simulations</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">No AQP0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pure SM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="10">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">2:1 SM:Chol</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:2 SM:Chol</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">One AQP0 tetramer without EC lipids</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pure SM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">2:1 SM:Chol</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:2 SM:Chol</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">One AQP0 tetramer with EC lipids</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2:1 SM:Chol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:2 SM:Chol</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Two AQP0 tetramers with deep cholesterol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pure SM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Two AQP0 tetramer without deep cholesterol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pure SM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="6">Force probe</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">Two AQP0 tetramers with deep cholesterol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">Pure SM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">20 replicas for each velocity</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">~55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">~230</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.004</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">~900</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">Two AQP0 tetramers without deep cholesterol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">Pure SM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">20 replicas for each velocity</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">~55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">~230</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.004</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">~900</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Initial positions of the protein and annular lipids were taken from the EC structures of AQP0 with the surrounding annular lipids obtained in <italic>N</italic>-palmitoyl sphingomyelin (SM) membranes at low (~33%) and high (~66%) cholesterol (Chol) concentrations. Initial configurations of fully solvated membranes with three different cholesterol concentrations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>) were generated and equilibrated using the standard protocol of CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). This equilibration process started with a Steepest Descent energy minimization step, followed by five consecutive short equilibration simulations (first three with a timestep of 1 fs, the final two with a timestep of 2 fs) with a gradual decrease in position and dihedral restraints for the lipid head groups and a final one without position restraints. This last step was performed for at least 100 ns until the bulk membrane properties, deuterium order parameter and area per lipid, became stable and congruent with previous reports such as those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Doktorova et al., 2020</xref>, and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Large variations in the area per lipid occurred within the first few tens of nanoseconds, after which the area per lipid stabilized. In the particular case of the SM:Chol = 2:1 mixture, the 64 lipids/leaflet system converged to a stable area per lipid value in the last 70 ns and the 244 lipids/leaflet system approached the same value in approximately the last 30 ns. This was a good indication that the larger system had also converged.</p><p>AQP0 with or without the EC lipids was inserted into equilibrated SM:Chol membranes using g_membed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yesylevskyy, 2007</xref>). Five simulation replicas (10 for the tetramer pair) were run for each system with a simulation time per replica of 1 μs for the tetramer pair, and 500 ns for all others. For all simulations including EC lipids, the protein was inserted and then each replica was initialized with different velocity distributions. Upon insertion, the systems with one tetramer contained from 284 to 344 lipids and the systems containing the tetramer pair from 1292 to 1318 lipids. For simulations of a single AQP0 tetramer without EC lipids, in addition to using different random starting velocities, the protein was rotated at 18° intervals such that it faced different lipids. For simulations of a tetramer pair, the pair was rotated at 36° intervals for each replica. In the first five replicas, the tetramer pair was inserted at the center of the membrane, while in the other five replicas it was inserted at the corner of the pre-equilibrated lipid membrane. The first 100 ns of each simulation replica (the first 300 ns for the two tetramer simulations) were considered as additional equilibration time and were not included in further analysis.</p><p>All simulations were run using GROMACS (2019 version) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Páll et al., 2020</xref>) using the CHARMM36 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>). Periodic boundary conditions were applied. All systems were maintained at a temperature of 323 K (coupling constant of 1 ps) and a pressure of 1 bar (coupling constant of 5 ps) using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hoover, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nosé, 1984</xref>) (the Berendsen thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>) in the position-restrained equilibration steps) and the Parrinello–Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Nosé and Klein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) in a semi-isotropic scheme, respectively. The chosen temperature, which was also used in a previous MD study of pure SM membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Niemelä et al., 2004</xref>), ensured that the lipid bilayers remained well above the liquid phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Keyvanloo et al., 2018</xref>). For the Hydrogen atoms, we used the LINCS algorithm to solve the bond-length constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hess et al., 1997</xref>), while the water molecules were constrained with the SETTLE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992</xref>). Simulations were run at a NaCl concentration of ~0.150 M and with the CHARMM TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">MacKerell et al., 1998</xref>).

The simulations of cholesterol in a pure SM bilayer, of an individual AQP0 tetramer with EC lipids, and of AQP0 tetramers pairs, were all considered independently for this calculation. In the case of pure SM bilayers, only the one inserted deep cholesterol molecule was analyzed, whereas for the simulations with an individual APQ0 tetramer, we monitored separately the closest cholesterol molecule to each S1 and S2 surface center (thus, the cholesterol at the deep position was dynamically selected and the EC cholesterol molecules were free to swap positions with the surrounding bulk ones). For simulations with pairs of AQP0 tetramers, due to symmetry, the two deep cholesterol molecules sandwiched between the tetramers were considered thus doubling the sampling.</p><p>The membrane-insertion depth was defined as the position of the cholesterol oxygen atom in reference to the average <italic>z</italic> position of the phosphorus atoms of the SM molecules in the extracellular leaflet within 0.8 nm of the protein for the systems containing AQP0 tetramers, or within 3.0 nm of the monitored lipid for the systems not containing AQP0 tetramers (‘no-AQP0’). Accordingly, the reference (i.e. <italic>d</italic>=0) was also dynamically set. The cholesterol angle was defined as the angle between the vector from the C-17 to the C-3 atom in the steroid ring and the <italic>z</italic>-axis (normal to the membrane plane).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Cholesterol distribution around AQP0 from unbiased simulations</title><p>The set of simulations with one AQP0 tetramer without the EC lipids was used to monitor the localization of cholesterol around an isolated AQP0 tetramer. The localization density was computed around every AQP0 monomer, which, due to the tetrameric structure of AQP0, effectively increased the sampling fourfold. Time-averaged density maps for the cholesterol localization were generated using GROmaρs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Briones et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, a grid of 0.1 nm in resolution, spanning the simulation box, was considered. Atomic positions were spread onto the grid by a linear combination of four Gaussian curves with amplitudes and widths taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hirai et al., 2007</xref>. The density was computed separately around every monomer after least-square rigid-body fitting of their positions in the trajectories to the initial monomer position from the EC structure. The resulting four maps were then summed up using the GROmaρs mapdiff tool. Density maps were visualized with PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger, LLC) as isosurfaces at 9<italic>σ</italic> at a maximum distance of 1 nm away from the protein.

The covariance matrix of the positions of the backbone atoms was computed and diagonalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amadei et al., 1993</xref>). The equilibrium MD simulations with a pair of AQP0 tetramers containing an ‘SM’ interface were used for these calculations. Subsequently, both sets of trajectories (for the ‘Chol’ and ‘SM’ interfaces) were projected on the main principal components. A least-square fitting of the C<sub>α</sub> atoms of one of the tetramers with respect to its initial conformation preceded the PCA calculation.

The detachment force was assumed to be the maximum registered force before the separation of the centers of mass of the two tetramers surpassed 7.3 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). 20 replicas were performed for each system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

This propensity to form 2D crystals was originally exploited to solve the structure of aquaporin-0 reconstituted in membranes. Existing structures do not explain why the proteins spontaneously form these arrays, however. In this work the authors investigate the hypothesis that the main lipids in the native membranes, sphingomyelin and cholesterol, contribute to lattice formation. By titrating the cholesterol: sphingomyelin ratio, the authors identify cholesterol binding sites of increasing stability. The authors identify a cholesterol that interacts with adjacent tetramers and is bound at an unusual membrane depth. Computational simulations suggest that this cholesterol is only stable in the context of adjacent tetramers (ie lattice formation) and that the presence of the cholesterol increases the stability of that interface. The exact mechanism is not clear, but the authors propose that the so-called &quot;deep cholesterol&quot; improves shape complementarity between adjacent tetramers and modulates the kinetics of protein-protein interactions.

Cholesterol interacts with a variety of membrane proteins via its smooth alpha face of rough beta face. AQP0 is somewhat unique in that it binds the rough face of cholesterol in a &quot;deep&quot; binding site that places cholesterol in the middle of the membrane bilayer. So-called &quot;deep&quot; cholesterol binding sites have been described for GPCRs and docking studies suggest they may exist on other ion channels and transporters. In the case of AQP0, the deep cholesterol acts as a glue that holds two tetramers together. Since each tetramer has four binding sites for deep cholesterol, the assembly and mechanical stability of an extended two-dimensional array of AQP0 tetramers is a natural consequence in lens membranes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors report that the findings generally apply to raft formation in membranes.

The authors utilized electron crystallography and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to shed light on the role of cholesterol in shaping the structural organization of AQP0. The evidence suggests that cholesterol not only defines the positions and orientations of associated molecules but also plays a crucial role in stabilizing AQP0 tetramer arrays. This study provides valuable insights into the potential principles driving protein clustering within lipid rafts, advancing our understanding of membrane biology.</p><p>In this review, I will focus on the MD simulations part, since this is my area of expertise. The authors conducted an impressive set of MD simulations aiming at understanding the role of cholesterol in structural organization of AQP0 arrays. These simulations clearly demonstrate the well-defined localization of cholesterol molecules around a single AQP0 tetramer, aligning with previous computational studies and the crystallographic structures presented in this manuscript. Interestingly, the authors identified an unusual position for one cholesterol molecule, located near the center of the lipid bilayer, which was stabilized by the adjacent AQP0 tetramers. The authors showed that these adjacent tetramers can withstand a larger lateral detachment force when deep cholesterol molecules are present at the interface compared to scenarios with sphingomyelin (SM) molecules at the interface between two AQP0 tetramers. Authors interpret that result as evidence that deep cholesterol molecules mechanically stabilize the interface of the AQP0 tetramers.</p><p>The simple steered MD simulations are typically employed to either identify pathways for subsequent free energy calculations, such as umbrella sampling or perform numerous non-equilibrium simulations, utilizing the Jarzynski equation to extract free energy. In this paper, the authors conducted steered MD simulations to examine the maximum force required to separate tetramers, and they did not carry out the more rigorous but challenging free energy calculations. The observation that the maximum force needed to separate tetramers in the presence of cholesterol (compared to the SM case) suggests a positive direction in the authors' work, however, free energy calculations would be needed to fully support the cholesterol stabilization effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90851.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Po-Lin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Arizona State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tempe</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Orjuela</surname><given-names>Juan D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Universidad de Los Andes</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bogotá</named-content></addr-line><country>Colombia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>de Groot</surname><given-names>Bert L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Göttingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Aponte Santamaría</surname><given-names>Camilo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Heidelberg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Walz</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Rockefeller University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The model presented by the authors is consistent with the data described. Further testing of this model, for example by mutating the deep cholesterol binding site, would strengthen the model.

However, as the reviewer points out, such experiments would be challenging, not only because of the non-specific/hydrophobic nature of the deep cholesterol-binding site but also because we have been purifying AQP0 from natural sources (sheep eyes) and because it would be very difficult to secure the substantial amount of cryo-EM time needed to generate an electron crystallographic structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors report that the findings generally apply to raft formation in membranes. However, this point is less clear as the lens membrane in which AQP0 resides is rather unique in lipid and protein content and density.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the lens membrane is quite unique in its lipid and protein content and density, but rafts are also characterized by the same lipids and high protein density. Nonetheless, we do agree that our suggested implications for lipid rafts are speculative and so we emphasize this more in the revised version of the manuscript by writing: “This model is specific for the formation of AQP0 arrays in lens membranes, but we speculate that similar principles may underlie the organization of lipid rafts”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors showed that these adjacent tetramers can withstand a larger lateral detachment force when deep cholesterol molecules are present at the interface compared to scenarios with sphingomyelin (SM) molecules at the interface between two AQP0 tetramers. Authors interpret that result as evidence that deep cholesterol molecules mechanically stabilize the interface of the AQP0 tetramers. This conclusion has minor weaknesses, and the rigor of the lateral detachment simulations could be increased by establishing a reference point for the detachment force needed to separate AQP0 tetramers in a scenario without lipids at the interface between tetramers, and by increasing the number of repeats for the non-equilibrium steered MD simulations. Thermodynamic integration might be a better approach to compute the stabilization energy in the presence of cholesterol compared to the SM case.</p></disp-quote><p>In all electron crystallographic structures of AQP0 determined to date, lipids have always been observed sandwiched in between the AQP0 tetramers (see, for example, Gonen et al., Nature, 2005 and Hite et al., EMBO J., 2010). Therefore, considering a scenario without lipids at the interface would be unnatural and the AQP0 array would likely not be stable. Such a scenario would thus not be the most appropriate reference point for the lateral detachment simulations. In our view, comparison of a scenario with the deep cholesterol at the interface <italic>versus</italic> a scenario without it appeared a more realistic setup to investigate the stabilizing role the deep cholesterol has on the association of AQP0 tetramers. In the Results subsection regarding these simulations, we added the following sentence to further stress the rationale of our experimental setup: “Comparison of these two cases should allow us to assess the effect of the deep-binding Chol3 molecules on the mechanical stability of the associated AQP0 tetramers.”</p><p>Concerning the second suggestion of the reviewer of increasing the number of repeats, we doubled the number of simulation replicas: now it is n=20 for each pulling velocity and lipid interface. The trend of higher detachment forces for the interface containing cholesterol prevailed in a statistically significant, robust fashion (see Figure 7 of the revised manuscript and the main text referring to it). In consequence, as the reviewer suggested, extension of the dataset increased the rigor of the lateral detachment simulations. In addition to Figure 7 and the Results section, the Methods section and Table 4 have been updated to reflect the expanded dataset.</p><p>Finally, concerning the usage of thermodynamic integration to compute the stabilization energy, we agree with the reviewer that calculation of the free energy would be better to determine the thermodynamic stabilization imparted by the cholesterol molecules. At an earlier stage of the project, we did indeed consider carrying out this type of simulations, but we decided against it because of the complexity and poor convergence of such calculations. Our choice is also based on a previous attempt in which it proved very challenging to use free energy calculations to assess the binding of lipids to a flippase (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). We now included this consideration in the revised manuscript by adding the following sentence in the Discussion: “Although we provide solid evidence here that deep cholesterol impart mechanical stabilization, free energy calculations would be required to obtain the full picture of thermodynamic stabilization. Such free energy calculations are challenging for lipids, due to the chemical complexity and poor convergence involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), and are thus beyond the scope of the current work.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Reorganizing a few concepts would make the story easier to follow. For example, the analysis of the bilayer thickness seems disjointed. Although Figure 4 shows measurements, it is not clear that the measurements represent bilayer thickness until the last paragraph of page 21 in the discussion, where &quot;Hydrophobic thickness&quot; is first introduced. Moving that first paragraph of page 22 that refers to Fig. 4A to the results would be helpful to understand the figure, and would prepare the reader for this part of the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer, we moved the description of the measurements of the hydrophobic thickness to the Results section (Page 12) and adjusted the Discussion to minimize repetition (page 22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, Figure 4E shows measurements of something, but it is not clear that these are the dimensions of a protein pocket until well into the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment, we added a sentence both in the Results section [It sits in a pocket between the two adjacent AQP0 tetramers that is wider in the extracellular leaflet than the cytoplasmic leaflet (Figure 4E)] as well as to the caption of Figure 4E [The dotted lines indicate the distance between the two adjacent AQP0 tetramers at the positions of the ring system (~8.5 Å) and the acyl chain (~2.5 Å)].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 - a comment for the non-specialists on what this region of the protein is would be helpful context.

The authors state the problem (investigate cholesterol positions), but it would be helpful to the readers if they also described the experimental approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and made the following addition to the sentence “we performed MD simulations and calculated time-averaged densities to investigate ...”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Technical comments:</p><p>(1) Authors stated: &quot;Equilibration simulations were then performed until bulk membrane properties, such as thickness and deuterium order parameters, became stable and congruent with previous reports such as those by (Doktorova et al., 2020) and others (Figure 5-figure supplement 2 and Figure 5-figure supplement 3).&quot; However, bilayer thickness is not represented in these figures. Additionally, I observed that the area per lipid (APL) appeared to be somewhat variable. This variation was particularly noticeable in systems where SM:CHOL=2:1, which seem to be not fully equilibrated. Is the figure displaying APL data for only one repetition? Could you please include plots for the other repetitions?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We would like to clarify that we used CHARMMGUI to generate one lipid bilayer configuration for each mixture and system size. These configurations (one per system) were extensively simulated to generate stable initial configurations of the lipid bilayers. Figure 5 – supplements 2 and 3 refer to this pre-equilibration step. The final pre-equilibrated configurations were then used in the subsequent multiple equilibrium MD runs that we performed, either with a single cholesterol molecule or with the AQP0 tetramer(s) inserted. We have clarified this procedure in the revised manuscript (see changes in the Methods section for the MD equilibrium simulations).</p><p>Concerning this pre-equilibration step, we have chosen the area per lipid, not thickness, to characterize the equilibration of the pure lipid bilayers. Accordingly, the area per lipid is the quantity shown in Figure 5 – figure supplement 3. We no longer refer to the membrane thickness in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Concerning the variability in the area per lipid, we note that the large changes occur within the first few tens of nanoseconds of the pre-equilibration step, after which the area per lipid stabilizes. We would like to also point out that in Figure 5 – figure supplement 3, we chose a logarithmic scale for the time axis to actually make it possible for the reader to see the major changes that occur at the beginning of the pre-equilibration step (which would otherwise be difficult to see). In the particular case of the SM:CHOL=2:1 mixture_,_ the 64 lipids/leaflet system converged to a stable area per lipid value in the last 70 ns and the 244 lipids/leaflet system approached the same value in approximately the last 30 ns. This was a good indication that the large system had also converged. After equilibration of the membranes, a single cholesterol or AQP0 tetramer(s) were inserted and equilibrium simulations were initiated. However, the first 100 ns (or 300 ns in the case of the double tetramer system) were considered as a further equilibration time and were not included in the analysis. This is now explicitly stated in the revised manuscript: “The first 100 ns of each simulation replica (the first 300 ns for the two tetramer simulations) were considered as additional equilibration time and were not included in further analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Could you clarify the reasoning behind conducting the simulations at 323 K?</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted the simulations at 323 K to ensure that the lipid bilayers were in the liquid phase.</p><p>SM:CHOL mixtures have been reported to be in the liquid phase above 314 K (Keyvanloo et al. Biophys. J. 114: 1344, 2018). 323 K was thus chosen to be well above this value. Note that this temperature was also chosen in a previous MD simulation study of pure sphyngomyelin bilayers (Niemelä et al. Biophys. J. 87: 2976, 2004). This reasoning, as well as the two references, have been added to the Methods section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There appears to be a discrepancy in Figure 7.

Furthermore, in the text, the authors assert, &quot;In the absence of cholesterol, the AQP0 surface is completely covered by sphingomyelin in the hydrophobic region of the membrane and by water outside this region (Figure 8A, left column). As noted before, there are essentially no direct protein-protein interactions between the adjacent tetramers. When cholesterol was present at the interface, it interacted with AQP0 at the center of the membrane and remained mostly in place (Figure 8A, right column).&quot; However, the left column shows cholesterol density. Could you please clarify this inconsistency, especially regarding the absence of cholesterol?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this mistake.
