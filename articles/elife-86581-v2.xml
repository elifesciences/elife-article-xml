Chemogenetic silencing of these learning-activated cholinergic neurons prevents expression of the defensive behavior to the tone. In contrast, we show that NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> cholinergic neurons are not activated by an innately threatening stimulus (predator odor). Instead, VP/SI<sub>a</sub> cholinergic neurons are activated and contribute to defensive behaviors in response to predator odor, an innately threatening stimulus. Taken together, we find that distinct populations of cholinergic neurons are recruited to signal distinct aversive stimuli, demonstrating functionally refined organization of specific types of memory

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acetylcholine (ACh) is critical for cognition. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), neurons that synthesize and release ACh that are sparsely distributed throughout the base of the forebrain, provide the primary source of ACh to the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Disruptions to normal cholinergic transmission are thought to contribute to several neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Higley and Picciotto, 2014</xref>) as well as to cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ananth et al., 2023</xref>) and salience-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hersman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>). BFCNs are anatomically divided into several clusters: the medial septum/diagonal band complex (MS/DB), the ventral pallidum (VP), the substantia innominata (SI), and the nucleus basalis (NBM). Between and within these anatomical groupings, BFCNs comprise heterogenous subclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zaborszky and Gyengesi, 2012</xref>). How this heterogeneity contributes to the significant control that cholinergic signaling exerts over large, behaviorally relevant circuits is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zaborszky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>).</p><p>ACh plays an important role in modulating emotionally salient memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luchicchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knox, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ananth et al., 2023</xref>). We and others have found that cholinergic signaling in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is important for generating defensive behaviors in response to both learned and innate threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Power and McGaugh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilson and Fadel, 2017</xref>). Optogenetic manipulation of endogenous ACh release in the BLA during learning modulates the expression of threat response behaviors in mice upon recall of a conditioned stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). Stimulating release of ACh increases activity of BLA principal neurons, in part by increasing the release probability of glutamatergic inputs to these neurons, and is sufficient to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) when paired with minimal (non-LTP generating) stimulation of glutamatergic input to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Unal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). Memory formation and retrieval are associated with fast synaptic mechanisms that are modulated by ACh, that are in turn necessary for the proper learning and expression of threat response behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nonaka et al., 2014</xref>). Given the broad distribution of cholinergic input across the BLA, and the well-established role of ACh in modulating BLA plasticity, the basal forebrain cholinergic system is well positioned to serve an important role in the encoding of threat memories and generation of threat response behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ananth et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The BLA receives dense cholinergic input from neurons located in various regions within the basal forebrain (such as the VP, SI, and NBM). In this study, we asked how these distinct populations of BLA-projecting BFCNs contribute to threat responses. Using a genetically encoded ACh sensor, activity-dependent genetic tagging, chemogenetic manipulations, and electrophysiological recordings, we identify a population of BFCNs in the NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> (SI<sub>p</sub> defined as the portion of the sublenticular SI posterior to bregma −0.4 mm) that are required for learned threat responsiveness. We find that NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> cholinergic neurons are necessary for freezing behavior following cue-conditioned threat learning while freezing behavior elicited by an innately threatening stimulus activates cholinergic neurons in the VP/SI<sub>a</sub> (VP/SI<sub>a</sub>; SI<sub>a</sub> defined as the portion of the SI ventral to the anterior commissure located anterior to bregma −0.4 mm).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Animals recognize varied sensory stimuli and categorize them as either threatening or non-threatening. Recognition of threatening stimuli can be innate or acquired, for example, by association of an aversive experience with an innocuous, co-occurring sensory input. In this study, we sought to understand if the basal forebrain cholinergic system participates in the encoding of associative threat or in response to innate threat.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>ACh is released in the basal lateral amygdala in response to threat</title><p>The BLA plays a central role in associative threat learning and in the generation of threat responses. We have previously demonstrated that silencing cholinergic input to the BLA during cue-conditioned threat learning (pairing a naive tone with a foot shock) blunts learned freezing in response to the conditioned stimulus (tone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). Given this, the first question we asked was whether ACh was released in the BLA during associative threat learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). To monitor acute changes in extracellular ACh levels during the cue conditioned threat-learning task, we expressed a genetically encoded ACh sensor, GRAB<sub>ACh3.0</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jing et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jing et al., 2020</xref>) in BLA neurons and visualized fluorescence using fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our associative threat-learning protocol involved placing mice in a novel chamber and exposing them to an 80 dB tone for 30 s. During the final 2 s of the tone the mice received a foot shock (0.7 mA). The tone–shock pairing was repeated twice (for a total of three pairings). Twenty-four hours later, mice were placed in a different chamber (with different tactile, visual, and olfactory cues to the training chamber) and exposed to tone alone.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Acetylcholine (ACh) is released in basolateral amygdala (BLA) during threat recall (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Schematic of strategy for targeting the genetically encoded ACh sensor (GRAB<sub>ACh3.0</sub>) to BLA.

Therefore, after repeated tone–shock pairings, BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons acquire enhanced tone responsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> cholinergic neurons are activated by threat learning and reactivated during threat memory recall</title><p>Following associative threat-learning, cholinergic neurons exhibited increased ACh release in the BLA in response to a previously innocuous auditory stimulus; this increase occurred exclusively following pairing of the tone with a shock. Using a two-color labeling system, we asked whether NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> cholinergic neurons were activated during the training session and reactivated during the recall session. To do this, we injected the offspring of a cross of Chat-IRES-Cre x Fos-tTA:Fos-shGFP with a viral vector, AAV<sub>9</sub>-TRE-DIO-mCherry-P2A-tTA<sup>H100Y</sup>, resulting in <underline>a</underline>ctivity (tTA) <underline>d</underline>ependent, <underline>C</underline>re <underline>d</underline>ependent (aka ADCD) mCherry expression (see methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These mice carry three transgenes: one encoding Cre recombinase in cholinergic neurons, a second doxycycline (Dox) repressible, tetracycline transactivator (tTA) expressed following activation of the <italic>fos</italic> promoter, and a third destabilized green fluorescent protein (short half-life GFP) also under transcriptional regulation of the <italic>fos</italic> promoter. tTA and shGFP are transiently expressed in activated neurons. In the absence of Dox (delivered via chow diet), activation of Cre-expressing cholinergic neurons leads to tTA expression and expression of the virally transduced mCherry along with a mutant tTA, which is insensitive to Dox. Thus, after closure of the labeling window by re-administration of Dox, cholinergic neurons activated during the Dox off period maintain mCherry expression permanently driven by the mutant tTA. When ADCD labeling is coupled with the transient expression of Fos−shGFP, we can label and visualize participation of cholinergic neurons in two separate behavioral sessions (mCherry+ = session 1 activated cells and GFP+ = session 2 activated cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Two to three weeks following injection with the ADCD virus, mice were either (1) kept in home cage throughout, (2) exposed to tone without foot shock (tone alone), or (3) put through the standard threat-learning paradigm (tone + shock). Twenty-four hours prior to the training session (session 1) mice were switched from Dox-containing to Dox-free chow to allow function of tTA. Immediately following tone–shock pairings, mice were placed back on Dox-containing chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This switch from Dox on → Dox off → Dox on was also performed for mice that remained in their home cages and for those that were exposed to tones without shock. Recall was performed 72 hr later (tone alone in a new context), and mice were sacrificed ~2.5 hr following recall (the peak of the Fos−shGFP expression). We quantified the number of mCherry+/GFP+ (double positive) neurons following session 2 (e.g. white arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Significantly more double positive cholinergic neurons were seen following the complete associative threat-learning paradigm (tone + shock followed by tone recall) compared to mice that underwent session 1 without shocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, p = 0.0249). To further ensure that the reactivation of these cholinergic neurons was not due to a generalized increase in responsiveness of these neurons following shock exposure, we quantified reactivated neurons in mice exposed to shock alone during session 1 followed by tone alone during session 2 (shock alone (session 1) → tone alone (session 2)) along with shock alone (session 1) → home cage (session 2), and home cage controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). All three conditions showed few reactivated neurons and no differences between groups (p = 0.9471).

The virally delivered ADCD construct can only be expressed in (cre expressing) cholinergic neurons, in the absence of doxycycline (DOX OFF). Once expression initiates, it is maintained even in the presence of Dox by a dox-insensitive tTA (red line), thereby resulting in permanent labeling. However, labeling in cells that were not activated during the DOX OFF period is prevented. Intercepting the peak of a shGFP signal (for example following a second behavioral assay) can allow for identification of cells that express mCherry (activated during DOX OFF) and cells that express GFP (activated 2.5 hr prior to euthanasia).

We further demonstrated that the increased glutamatergic transmission in BLA was dependent on presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) located on glutamatergic terminals in the BLA, and that nAChR activation in the BLA was necessary for acquisition of conditioned threat memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these findings, we propose that chemogenetic silencing of BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons during threat learning or during recall results in loss of Fos expression due to alterations in presynaptic glutamatergic transmission resulting in disruption to the formation and/or recruitment of the BLA engram.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>BFCNs ‘learn’ to respond to the conditioned stimulus</title><p>In this study, we used a genetically encoded ACh sensor (GRAB<sub>ACH3.0</sub>) to monitor endogenous ACh release in the BLA during threat learning and recall.

However, following conditioning, when mice were exposed to the conditioned tone in a novel environment 24 hr later, we observed robust ACh release in the BLA compared with the naive tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This enhancement of ACh release supports the notion that BLA-projecting BFCNs undergo physiological changes which allow robust responsiveness to previously naive sensory stimuli. When mice were exposed to tones in the absence of foot shocks and then exposed to the same tone 24 hr later, we did not detect increased ACh release in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To assess whether such changes occurred in recruited cholinergic neurons following memory retrieval, we recorded properties of neuronal excitability from activated NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> BFCNs (Fos+) and compared them with Fos− BFCNs recorded in the same brain slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Recall-activated NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> cholinergic neurons showed increased excitability which lasted for at least several hours following threat memory retrieval, returning to baseline within days. This finding is in line with previous reports of learning-associated changes in electrical properties, which are found shortly after recall, but disappear at later time points despite the persistence of the learned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moyer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>). Observed changes in the electrophysiological properties were not see in Fos-shGFP+ cholinergic neurons immediately following training. Thus, many of the changes in electrical properties we observed were specific to recall-activated cholinergic neurons. Within recall-activated cholinergic neurons we find several changes consistent with an increased excitability such as decreased AP half-width, decreased rheobase, and an increase in maximum firing rate. Common features of activated neurons previously reported include similar increases in firing rate, with reductions in adaptation, decreased duration of post-burst AHP, decreased AHP amplitude, and synaptic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whitaker and Hope, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Differential contribution of distinct BLA-projecting BFCNs in learned vs. innate threat processing</title><p>Amygdala microcircuits play an important role in the regulation of active vs. passive avoidance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rickenbacher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terburg et al., 2018</xref>). Our finding that silencing cholinergic input to the BLA resulted in a selective loss of threat-motivated freezing behavior supports potential specificity of cholinergic modulation within BLA microcircuits for freezing, but not active, defensive behaviors.

Instead, predator odor activated BLA-projecting VP/SI<sub>p</sub> cholinergic neurons and resulted in a freezing response. Based on these data, we propose that distinct populations of BLA-projecting BFCNs control freezing in response to fundamentally distinct threatening situations (learned vs. innate).

Each modulatory system seems to respond rapidly and robustly to aversive stimuli like mild electrical shocks, and activity within these systems during conditioning (i.e. during CS–US pairing) is critical for generation of freezing behavior during memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). VTA dopaminergic neurons have also been shown to display plasticity in tone responsiveness such that a naive tone does not result in significant firing of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). However, following three pairings of the tone with shocks, VTA DA neurons begin responding to tone presentations with millisecond latencies, a response that is sustained the following day during memory retrieval. A majority of the shock-responsive DA neurons were also found to acquire tone responsiveness following pairing, a finding replicated within the cholinergic system in our study. While shock rapidly activates LC NA neurons, conditioned tone-related responses in these neurons seems to be slow, occurring on average several seconds following tone presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). How signaling by these different modulators interacts in the BLA and informs plasticity of BLA neurons is an intriguing question.</p><p>In addition to these modulators, peptides such as oxytocin have also been shown to participate in threat memory formation. A recent study demonstrated presence of a threat memory engram within the hypothalamic oxytocinergic projection to the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hasan et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, upon conditioning these neurons demonstrate a transmitter preference switch, releasing glutamate in the amygdala. Thus, subcortical neuromodulatory and peptidergic systems might display unique mechanisms of engram-related biophysical changes that have not been found in traditionally studied systems.</p><p>We demonstrate at least two populations of BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons that are engaged in learned vs. innate threat responses. Differences in function of other BLA-projecting BFCNs (NBM vs. HDB) in threat memory formation vs. extinction were recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hasan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crimmins et al., 2023</xref>), further highlighting that effects of ACh release in the BLA are highly specific to which axons release the ACh, despite the dense overlapping terminal fields from different BFCN populations within the BLA. Similar heterogeneity of responses has also been found in the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azcorra et al., 2023</xref>). It is possible that single-cell transcriptomic analyses of the cholinergic basal forebrain may provide insight into the functional heterogeneity observed in our study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Is there a cholinergic component in the associative threat memory engram?</title><p>Studies examining mechanisms of learning and memory in recent years have revived Semon’s theory on memory engrams: learning must result in lasting biophysical changes that form the substrate for retrieval of the learned experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Semon, 1921</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tonegawa et al., 2015</xref>). Josselyn and Tonegawa have recently updated the definition of engram cells, requiring that these be activated by learning, modified by learning, and reactivated by subsequent presentation of the recall-inducing stimuli, resulting in memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Josselyn and Tonegawa, 2020</xref>). NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> BFCNs investigated in this study indeed fulfil these criteria as they are activated by learning, show induction of Fos and altered physiological properties with recall, are reactivated by recall, and the reactivation of previously, training-activated BFCNs was necessary for recall behavior.</p><p>Multiple studies have used threat and reward learning paradigms in rodents to examine allocation of neurons to memory engrams. These studies have looked for these engram cells in regions such as cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus focusing on glutamatergic pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Josselyn et al., 2015</xref>). However, recent work has demonstrated that memory engrams are distributed across brain-wide networks, and that reactivation of a multi-region engram more closely recapitulates natural recall behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roy et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the BLA, cholinergic neurons in the NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> region project to various limbic and sensory regions such as the lateral orbital cortex, cingulate cortex, somatosensory cortex, and mediodorsal thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ananth et al., 2023</xref>). This raises the interesting possibility that the cholinergic signaling modulates various nodes of the threat memory engram circuit in conjunction with the amygdala, allowing for coordinated retrieval of engrams across distributed networks. Such coordinated activation of distributed engrams has been recently demonstrated to more closely recapitulate natural memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roy et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, functionally related regions have been shown to receive their cholinergic input from the same cholinergic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zaborszky et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that engram-enrolled cholinergic neurons bind distributed engrams to encode stimulus-convergent, efficient memory retrieval.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Resource availibility</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Lead contact</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by Lead Contact, Dr. David Talmage (david.talmage@nih.gov).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Materials availability</title><p>Plasmids generated in this study have been deposited to Addgene and will be available upon publication under Talmage Lab.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>Adult (3–6 month) male and female Chat-IRES-Cre (B6;129S6-Chattm2(cre)Lowl/J), Jax stock number: 006410 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rossi et al., 2011</xref>), Fos-tTA, Fos−shGFP (TetTag, Jax stock number: 018306, referred to as Fos-tTA/shGFP or Fos-shGFP), and Chat-IRES-Cre × Fos-tTA/shGFP mice were used.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Joshua Johansen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ekaterina Likhtik (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use hM4Di to &quot;silence&quot; Fos-tagged neurons in the basal forebrain, but they have not validated the efficiency or the possible various effects of this reagent.</p><p>It is possible that hM4Di actually has a relatively small effect on suppressing the AP activity of neurons. Nevertheless, hM4Di might still be an effective manipulation, because it was shown to additionally reduce transmitter release at the nerve terminal (see e.g. Stachniak et al. (Sternson) 2014, Neuron). Thus, the authors should evaluate in control experiments whether hM4Di expression plus CNO actually electrically silences the AP-firing of ChAT neurons in the BF as they seem to suggest, and/or if it reduces ACh release at the terminals. For example, one experiment to test the latter would be to perfuse CNO locally in the BLA; after expressing hM4Di in the cholinergic neurons of the BF. At the very least, the assumed action of hM4Di, and the possible caveats in the interpretation of these results should be discussed in the paper. See Reviewer 1, Point 1.</p><p>2) Throughout the paper, the authors use comparisons of cell activity between groups to address questions about projection-specific and cue-specific cell activation and reactivation. However, statistical comparisons are sometimes done between biological replicates (animal groups e.g. Figure 5A), whereas a lot of them are done between technical replicates (data points/slices, e.g. Figure 2B, 5B, 7B). Adding statistics that compare biological replicates would help increase confidence in the results.</p><p>3) To demonstrate engram-like specificity, in figure 4C the authors show fold change in cholinergic reactivation in low and high responders (animals that show low and high defensive freezing upon cue presentation) as normalized by cell activity while sitting in the home cage. However, the authors also collected a better control for this comparison, which is shown in figure S4, where the animals were exposed to an unconditioned tone cue. Comparing fold change to this tone-alone condition would provide stronger evidence for the authors' point, as this would directly compare the specificity of cholinergic reactivation to a conditioned vs an unconditioned cue. A discussion of the same comparison is relevant for figure 2 (and is shown in figure S4) but is not mentioned in the text.</p><p>4) The significant correlation between cue-evoked percent change in defensive freezing from pretone and fold change in cholinergic cell activity relative to the home cage that is shown in figure 4D is somewhat confusing. Is the correlation considering all the points shown (high and low responders as depicted by black and grey points)? It's first reported as one correlation but then is discussed as two populations that have different results. Further, is the average amount of reactivation for the home-cage controls used here the same denominator for each reported animal? Similarly to the point above, a correlation looking at fold change from tone-alone would also be helpful to determine the degree to which cholinergic reactivation is specific to threat-association learning versus the more general attentional component that this system is known for.</p><p>5) Some important controls are missing from the 'engram' causal manipulation study (Figure 3) which makes it difficult to definitively support the authors' contention that the captured cells are in fact 'engram' cells. The established definition of engram cells refers to those which store memory and are activated during learning and memory expression. While the authors do show conditioning-induced changes in CS activation in NBM-ACh cells, they don't have the necessary controls for their causal manipulations to rule out other non-engram factors which could account for their results. For example, it is possible that the captured cells are simply activated by auditory cues (even prior to learning, the immuno approach in Figure 2 may not be sensitive enough to detect this) and that they are transmitting CS-activated ACh signals to BLA which are necessary for memory expression. It is also possible that inhibiting a small number of NBM-ACh neurons (not restricted to 'engram' cells) reduces memory expression (early engram studies by the Josselyn lab controlled for this). The authors could address this with further experiments such as including 1) a control group in which cells are captured (off-dox) during a habituation session with CS presentation prior to on-dox learning and 2) using a dilute virus to manipulate a similar number of cells as in the engram group. Alternatively, they could present a more careful discussion of this issue and potentially avoid the use of the term 'engram'.</p><p>6) The authors suggest that the ACh 'engram' cells participate in the expression of learned defensive responses through projections to the BLA. However, they have not demonstrated this definitively. To do this would require testing the effects of the inactivation of ACh-engram neurons which project to BLA on learned freezing responses. This may be technically challenging, but one approach could be to use the ADCD technique they've developed and inactivate terminals of captured cells in the BLA (chemogenetically or optogenetically). At a minimum, the authors should examine whether retrogradely labeled ACh cells projecting to BLA are Fos activated during a recall session (compared with appropriate controls).</p><p>7) For most experiments, significantly more raw data should be shown (e.g. raw example traces for GRAB-ACh3.0), and also brain section images for almost all experiments. Significantly more raw data should also be shown in the Main Figures. Please see Reviewer # 1, &quot;Specific points relating to data presentation and statistical analysis&quot;, for details and specific examples.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific points relating to data presentation and statistical analysis:</p><p>1) The reporting of statistical data (N's, p- values, and the test used) is a bit cryptic. In general, the authors seem to report these values in the Figure legends. This, however, has the advantage that the reader has to constantly jump between the results text and legends text if he/she wishes to check the values for a given experiment. I would therefore suggest that the authors report all values of statistical tests in the results text (N's, p- values, and the test used).</p><p>Also, in some instances, N-values seem to be missing from the legend texts. Please check all legends / Results text accordingly.</p><p>2) Figure 1:</p><p>– Traces of GRAB-ACh3.0 should be shown more extensively. In Figure 1B, only the onset to the CS is shown – the response along the entire tone (30 s) should also be shown.</p><p>– Furthermore, the trace in Figure 1B seems to be an average over all mice. In addition, traces from individual mice should be shown, to allow an estimation of the S/N ratio of these measurements.</p><p>– In the quantification (Figure 1B, right), it would be easily possible to show the individual data points (there are 11 mice). I did not understand what the leftmost quantification tells us (&quot;Pre-tone&quot;). Please explain how this was calculated, and inasmuch it is relevant.</p><p>– What is the unit &quot;Z%deltaF/F0&quot;? In my view, this should either be Z-scored or else, deltaF/F0 – please clarify.</p><p>3) Figure 2:</p><p>– the authors should extensively show images of brain sections. It is curious to see that the entire paper doesn't show a single image at low magnification, which shows the investigated basal forebrain areas, and stained neurons in there, in their anatomical context. This would allow the reader to put the images into context, and to roughly validate whether the analyses by the authors (e.g. counted cells) make sense. For example, for Figure 2A, please show an additional low mag image of the corresponding brain area, that shows this brain area (NBM/SIp) in the wider context. The actual image can then be shown as an insert.</p><p>– In the plot of Figure 2B, a tick at the value of 0 is missing – please add this (this also applies to Figure 2C, 4B, 4C, 5A, right, 5B, right, 5C, right, 7A, 7D, S6B, S6C, S7A-C – please add all ticks at zero). Adding the tick at zero will help the reader eyeball the values of the data points.</p><p>– In some plots, the y-axis doesn't start at 0, but at an artificially chosen higher value. This increases &quot;graphically&quot; the effect size; however, it doesn't allow the reader to look at the data in the most unbiased way (indeed, some Journals do not allow this practice) (see Figure 7C, Figure S6A, right). Please newly plot the data from zero.</p><p>– The authors did not report in the Statistics part, which criteria they used to add &quot;stars&quot; onto the plots. For example, Figure 2B has *** (3 stars), but the reported p-value is p = 0.0017. According to the criteria used by many authors, p &lt; 0.05 (1 star), p &lt; 0.01 (two stars), and p &lt; 0.001 (three stars). Thus, Figure 2B should have 2 stars, but not 3. Please explain the criteria you used, and please validate all star symbols according to the criteria you used.</p><p>– What is the unit of the cell numbers plotted in Figure 2B, C? Were these indeed absolute numbers as the axis labelling seems to suggest, or was there a normalization for the analyzed area? Please comment.</p><p>4) Figure 3:</p><p>– While the freezing data is shown at a quite high time resolution for the training day (Figure 3B), for recall (Figure 3C), only excessively binned data are shown. It would be advantageous for the reader to see the data at the same time resolution, in a quasi-continuous trace, to evaluate the effects also of silencing.</p><p>5) Figure 4:</p><p>– There are several issues with the definition of high and low freezers, and with the analysis in this Figure.</p><p>– Hig+low freezers: The Methods state &quot;High responders were defined as those mice that exhibited at least a 10 percentage point increase in % time spent freezing in the bin during the tone from the bin immediately pre-tone (e.g. Pre-tone freezing 10% to tone-induced freezing of {greater than or equal to}20%).&quot; However, the Results text speaks about a &quot;3-fold increase&quot; (l. 235) – these are different criteria, please explain.</p><p>– Related to the above, the y-axis labeling in Figure 4B is unclear – is this the difference in freezing (as the Methods would suggest) or a fold-change (like the Results would suggest)? Also, the 3-star symbol for p = 0.005 seems not justified, should be 2 stars according to often-used criteria (see also above).</p><p>– l. 238 states: &quot;There was no difference in mCherry expression in 'Low Responders' compared to the home cage group (fold change ~ 1),&quot;</p><p>– this should be tested statistically.</p><p>– I don't see that the freezing data in Figure 4D (y-axis) shows a &quot;positive correlation&quot; with the number of Fos-labelled cells (x-axis). Indeed, looking at the high responders only, the data falls very close to a flat line. Please explain how the correlation was analyzed – this was probably done by fitting all data, i.e. also including the &quot;low&quot; responders (?). The obvious absence of a correlation for the &quot;high responders&quot; alone (black data points) is worrisome.</p><p>– In Figure 4D, the location of the data points (y-axis, freezing; about -10 – 0%) does not seem to correspond to what is plotted in Figure 4B (~ 2%; please explain).</p><p>– Figure 4F, and Figure S5: The result about the location of labelled cells along the a-p axis of the brain should be documented with a series of original images, both at low and high mag (see general comments, above).</p><p>6) Figure 5:</p><p>– The location of back-labelled cells should again be amply documented with several low and high mag images from all analyzed areas (hDB, VP/SIa, NBM/SIp).</p><p>– 3 stars in Figure 5B might be 2 stars.</p><p>7) Figure S4:</p><p>– was the data in Figure S4C a further analysis of data in Figure 2B? If yes, why are the animal numbers seemingly different between the two datasets?</p><p>8) Figure S5:</p><p>– The legend doesn't state the N-numbers.</p><p>– The box plot should be explained (meaning of the boxes). Even better, individual data points should be shown instead, if this is feasible.</p><p>9) Figure S6:</p><p>– For the data in A, again example images at low and high magnification should be shown …</p><p>– For the images in B, please indicate lateral-medial, and dorsal-ventral directions in these images (assuming that these are coronal sections?).</p><p>– The data in C again suggest that there might also be an effect on contextual fear learning (see also above).</p><p>10) Figure S7</p><p>– The text describing the data in A states &quot;did not freeze to the tone&quot; (l. 305). This is not a scientifically warranted statement, since there seems to be residual freezing. Rather, the data should be tested statistically.</p><p>– The N-numbers for the data in A, and B should be stated in the legends.</p><p>– For these and possibly similar experiments, the authors need to show in detailed histological images, for each individual mouse, that the expression of hM4Di has occurred in the expected set of cholinergic BF neurons.</p><p>11) Figure S8:</p><p>– I wonder why the firing rate data of the &quot;Training&quot; group in panel H is extremely small (around 5 Hz or less), and smaller than in all other groups. Is there another type of modulation of intrinsic excitability, a down-modulation, after training? Please explain.</p><p>12) Figure S9:</p><p>– In panel C, could you show the freezing data at a higher time resolution, e.g. the 30s bins also used in Figure 3B?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– For the flow of the story, I recommend switching the order of presentation where the lack of effect on behavior after silencing the CeA-projecting NBM/SIp neurons (lines 286-301) comes after the data showing the effect of silencing the BLA-projecting NBM/SIp.</p><p>– I would also recommend moving figures S7A and S7B into the main figures as they provide important evidence for the author's point.</p><p>– Given that the authors don't see an effect of clozapine on memory when inactivating during the consolidation period (Figure S7C), it might be worthwhile to discuss why this might be the case, and the effects of cholinergic input starting cascades of neural activation in the BLA during training.</p><p>– Overall, there are missing Bregmas and mapping of placements in several places (e.g. Figure 1A – Bregma and mapping of placements/spread of the virus across animals, it appears that the recordings are relatively anterior in the BLA; Bregma in Figures 5, S3C, 6SB, S6C – not clear how much of a CeA there is at this location, 7D; a zoomed out section of where the example data in figure 7C is coming from).</p><p>– It would also be helpful to indicate the area where the signal fluorescence is being calculated in traces shown in figures 1 and S1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) For the 'engram' data in Figure 2, the logic of the double labeling is a bit confusing as described and it's not clear, from a simple reading of the paper, how the authors achieve double labeling of encoding (training activated) and recall activated cells. After digging around in the Methods, Figs/legends I was able to figure it out, but it was difficult initially. The authors should state this in a simple way in the main text along with a description of how this works at the level of transgene expression at different time points.</p><p>2) Some important controls are missing from the 'engram' causal manipulation study (Figure 3) which makes it difficult to definitively support the authors' contention that the captured cells are in fact 'engram' cells. The established definition of engram cells refers to those which store memory and are activated during learning and memory expression. While the authors do show conditioning-induced changes in CS activation in NBM-ACh cells, they don't have the necessary controls for their causal manipulations to rule out other non-engram factors which could account for their results. For example, it is possible that the captured cells are simply activated by auditory cues (even prior to learning, the immuno approach in Figure 2 may not be sensitive enough to detect this) and that they are transmitting CS-activated ACh signals to BLA which are necessary for memory expression. It is also possible that inhibiting a small number of NBM-ACh neurons (not restricted to 'engram' cells) reduces memory expression (early engram studies by the Josselyn lab controlled for this). The authors could address this with further experiments such as including 1) a control group in which cells are captured (off-dox) during a habituation session with CS presentation prior to on-dox learning and 2) using a dilute virus to manipulate a similar number of cells as in the engram group. Alternatively, they could present a more careful discussion of this issue and potentially avoid the use of the term 'engram'.</p><p>3) The authors suggest that the ACh 'engram' cells participate in the expression of learned defensive responses through projections to the BLA. However, they have not shown this definitively. To do this would require testing the effects of the inactivation of ACh-engram neurons which project to BLA on learned freezing responses. This may be technically challenging, but one approach could be to use the ADCD technique they've developed and inactivate terminals of captured cells in the BLA (chemogenetically or optogenetically). At a minimum, the authors should examine whether retrogradely labeled ACh cells projecting to BLA are Fos activated during a recall session (compared with appropriate controls).</p><p>4) In Figure 5, the authors report a reduction in BLA Fos-activated neurons with chemogenetic inhibition of BLA-projecting ACh neurons. However, this experiment requires a control group without training (or, ideally, with unpaired CS/US training) to demonstrate that the inhibition is affect learning-induced activation of BLA neurons. While others have reported this using other paradigms previously, it is still important to show here using their own preparation.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are part of the threat memory engram&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and Josh Johansen (Reviewing Editor).</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>We thank the authors for their response to the reviewers' previous suggestions. Many of the findings have been strengthened through the addition of new experiments and analyses. However, there are remaining concerns about the statistical approaches used and low population size in some experiments which should be addressed. Related to sample sizes, power analyses or clear demonstrations of existing standards in the field should be used to justify animal numbers. If necessary, further animals should be added to experimental groups (e.g. the differential role of NBM/SIp and VP/SIa in learned vs. innate threats) or, as suggested by reviewer 1, data with low n could be removed if it does not seriously undermine the conceptual advance of the paper. In addition, the strong focus on the activated basal forebrain cholinergic cells as being part of the threat memory engram is not well supported. The authors should moderate the claims related to this aspect of the paper.</p><p>Furthermore, the title and/or abstract should provide a clear indication of the biological system under investigation (i.e., species name or broader taxonomic group, if appropriate). Please revise your title and/or abstract with this advice in mind.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>For this first revision, improvements in the data display have been implemented, at least concerning the traces for GRAB-ACh measurements. In addition, new data has been added; thus, the ms has been reorganized quite substantially. Nevertheless, there are still a lot of questions regarding the statistical analyses, and the anatomical analysis. In one instance, it seems that a control data set was used twice (Figure 5C and Figure 5SD; see Specific point 16 below).</p><p>Since my list of points is long, the question arises what might be the best strategy to go forward with the paper? Most of my points are about data display, statistical analyses, and similar, and it should be feasible to address these points. On the other hand, I also feel that especially the anatomical analysis relating to Figures 5 and 6 is still not clear and that some of the points the authors want to make related to these Figures, especially about the a-p distribution of (re-)activated Ach neurons (differential role of NMB/SIp versus VPSIa neurons in learned fear), differential role of these pools in &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; responders, and differential role of the same in learned versus innate fear, are unclear, and might go beyond the scope of the present paper. In my view, the authors should therefore consider the possibility to remove some of the controversial data, and related claims (see my detailed comments – these data are also often plagued by low n-numbers and incomplete anatomical analyses), and concentrate on the remaining main findings of the paper.</p><p>Specific points (in order of appearance)</p><p>1) l. 156/157 &quot;when it was not explicitly paired with a shock&quot; (data in Figure 1S3D).</p><p>– Please explain in the legend the exact temporal sequence between shock(s) and tone(s) used for this &quot;non-explicitly paired&quot; protocol (or does this refer to the &quot;shock-only&quot; protocol?).</p><p>2) Figure 1 S3C, D: The legend to this Figure states that here, the results from a &quot;shock-only&quot; training are displayed for the subsequent &quot;recall&quot; session.</p><p>First, the authors should also show the freezing response for the standard group undergoing standard fear learning (3x tone-shock pairings); this is important for a comparison to the &quot;shock-only&quot; training group.</p><p>Second, the Results text states that Figure 1S3D shows the ACh response when &quot;it was not explicitly paired with a shock&quot;.</p><p>– Is this the same as the &quot;shock-only&quot; protocol described in the legend? Please clarify, and make changes in the manuscript as appropriate.</p><p>3) Figure 1 S4 was not called out from the Results text; this should be changed i.e. what was done in this Figure, should be (briefly) mentioned in the Results.</p><p>4) The use of star symbols in Figure 2C, in conjunction with what is stated in the corresponding Results text, is misleading and tends to over-interpret the statistical significance of this data set.</p><p>Specifically, l. 202 states: &quot;Significantly more double-positive cholinergic neurons were seen following the complete (tone + shock followed by tone recall) associative threat learning paradigm compared to mice that underwent session 1 without shocks (Figure 2C, p=0.0249).&quot;</p><p>– This is misleading. The Figure legend and statistics table state that the value &quot;p = 0 0.0249&quot; refers to the &quot;overall&quot; significance of the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test used here, but NOT to the specific comparison cited in the above sentence. For that specific comparison, the p-value was higher (&quot;p=0.0464, Dunn's corrected&quot;, see Figure legend).</p><p>– In response, the authors should spell out the &quot;overall&quot; significance of this dataset (effect of group; p = 0.0249; KW) in the Results section, followed by the pertinent p-value for important specific comparisons (in this case, p = 0.046 for the comparison between the &quot;tone-tone&quot; and tone+shock – tone&quot; groups). The n-values for these pertinent comparisons should also be given in the Results text.</p><p>Furthermore, in this dataset (Figure 2C), the post-hoc test for the comparisons between the home cage (HC) and standard fear conditioning group is NOT significant (p = 0.72). This value should be indicated by a &quot;bracket&quot; symbol in Figure 2C, and the meaning of this non-significance should be discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>5) The p-values, n-values, and the statistical tests applied, should be reported together either in the figure legends or in the Results text (please choose one section to use for reporting these statistics, in addition to the statistical table) throughout the entire manuscript (see point 4, and see also my previous point &quot;Data Recommendation 1&quot;).</p><p>6) Figure 2D:</p><p>l. 210 states:</p><p>&quot;All three conditions showed few reactivated neurons and no differences between groups (p=0.9471)&quot;</p><p>– The finding that all these 3 control groups are not significantly different from each other, is not surprising and does not go to the point of the control experiment. Rather, it should be tested statistically whether the number of re-activated neurons in these three conditions is significantly different from the one after standard fear conditioning (the data in Figure 2C, right column).</p><p>7) I think the title of the Sub-header:</p><p>&quot;Reactivation of cholinergic neurons activated by training is required for learned behavioral responses&quot; (l. 214) is wrong, it should read &quot;Activation&quot; instead (and then replace &quot;activated by&quot; with &quot;during&quot;).</p><p>To my understanding, the chemogenetic silencing experiments in Figure 3 test the role of activated cholinergic neurons but do not suppress the &quot;re-activation&quot; of neurons (during recall…), since ADCD expression of hM4Di is driven during the training session.</p><p>8) In Figure 3 S1B, the average trace of time-resolved freezing is shown, for the same data set as the one in Figure 3D. However, the number of mice included in the time-resolved display was lower (n = 5 and 6) than in the display of Figure 3D (n = 7 and 8). This must be homogenized, i.e. all data used for the statistical analysis in Figure 3D (n = 8 and 7 mice) should also be shown in a time-resolved fashion for Figure 3S1B.</p><p>9) l. 273 states:</p><p>&quot; We injected cav.hM4DiBLA or sham control mice with clozapine (CLZ) 10 min prior to initiating cue-conditioned threat learning&quot;</p><p>– Please add here that these were IP (?) injections, for a quick reference for the reader. Indeed, this information should possibly also be added to the Methods (I did not find it upon a rapid check).</p><p>10) The authors should control for the possibility of leaky expression of hM4Di, following presumed Cre-dependent retrograde expression from a CAV2 virus after injections in the BLA (Figure 5). Because, as I assume, CLZ was not injected into the basal forebrain (BF) but rather IP (see point 9), a leaky expression of hM4Di beyond the cholinergic BF has the potential to strongly change the interpretation of this experiment. Thus, the authors have to show, first, whether hM4Di-mCherry is expressed at the injection site in the BLA itself (this would lead to a direct inhibition of BLA neurons). This should be done by showing example images of hM4di-mCherry fluorescence on the level of the BLA, and by analyzing the number of hM4Di-mCherry+ neurons in the BLA over the entire dataset. Second, the authors should show extensive raw example images of the BF at different a-p locations (and of further brain areas in a zoomed-out fashion), in an attempt to exclude the possibility that hM4Di might also be expressed in non-cholinergic neurons (ChAT could be visualized by IHC). Only a non-leaky expression of hM4Di-mCherry, essentially limited to ChAT-positive neurons in the BF, would support the conclusions of the authors.</p><p>11) On l. 298, the results of a control experiment is reported, which is not documented (&quot;data not shown&quot;). Some journals do not allow the statement &quot;data not shown&quot;. The authors should document the control data set, or else remove this statement from the manuscript. See also l. 441, another &quot;data not shown&quot;, which should be similarly documented or else removed.</p><p>12) Data in Figure 5C.</p><p>When checking the p-values from the legends/statistics table, I was puzzled by the fact the comparison of the two &quot;grey&quot; data sets has a reported p-value of &lt; 0.0001, although many of the data points between the two groups overlap. On the other hand, the comparison between the &quot;sham&quot; group and hM4Di group at the &quot;pre-tone&quot; time had a p-value of 0.096, although the overlap of the data points is only partial. Please comment, and validate the underlying tests.</p><p>13) Related to point 12, there is a strong tendency that freezing before the tone is lower in the hM4Di group as compared to the &quot;sham&quot; group. Although the authors reported a p-value of 0.096 (and therefore, &quot;not significant&quot;) for this comparison (Figure 5C), this p-value should nevertheless be verified. Because the trend is seen in this data set, as well as in several other ones (Figure 5B and Figure 3D), the authors should discuss the possibility that chemogenetic suppression of ACh release might, in addition to the effects studied here, also reduce contextual fear learning (see also my previous &quot;Specific comment 2&quot;).</p><p>14) Still related to the data in Figure 5C:</p><p>The time-resolved display of tone-evoked freezing during the recall day should be shown both for this data set (Figure 5C), and for the data set in Figure 5B, similarly as was done above for the data in Figure 3D (see panel Figure 3 S1B). This would also be helpful to gain insight into the p-values resulting from ANOVA / KW testing (see point 12), which were probably performed on similar time-resolved data sets (because the effect of &quot;time&quot; was always tested).</p><p>15) l. 299 states:</p><p>&quot;Differences in recall-induced Fos expression between sham and cav.hM4DiBLA mice were maximal in rostral portions of the BLA (between bregma -0.8mm to -1.4mm) (Figure 5-Supplement 1B)&quot;</p><p>– First, the analysis in Figure 5 S1B seems to have been done in only N = 1 mouse, which is problematic (please confirm the n-number, and state it in the Results text and in the legend to that Figure).</p><p>Second, I actually fail to see an a-p gradient as claimed by the authors (higher in anterior than posterior). If one looks at the number of Fos+ cells in the hM4Di group (red data points), then it seems that hM4Di suppresses the number of Fos+ cells, in relative terms, stronger at more posterior levels (e.g. reduction by &gt; 80% at -1.2 mm) than at anterior levels (e.g. reduction by &lt; 40% at -0.8 mm). Wouldn't this suggest that opposite from the author's interpretation, MORE cholinergic neurons are specifically (in a hM4Di-dependent manner) activated posteriorly than anteriorly? Please comment.</p><p>16) Visual inspection of the data in Figure 5 S1D strongly suggests that the data in the control (&quot;sham&quot;) group (n = 9, grey data) are actually the same as the data for the sham group in Figure 5C. In Figure 5C, retrograde expression from the BLA was studied, whereas in Figure 5 S1D, the effects of retrograde expression of hM4Di from the CeA were studied. If the experiment was originally set up for 3 groups of mice (thus, sham control – CAV2-hM4Di in BLA – CAV2-hM4Di in CeA), then this should be reported as such, the data should be shown in one panel, and the statistical comparisons should be done accordingly (i.e. the &quot;multiple comparison&quot; correction would need to be done for 3 groups). If, on the other hand, the CeA experiments were done without proper controls, and were simply compared to the control group from another experiment, then the CeA data should be removed. Please comment, and make appropriate changes in the manuscript.</p><p>17) Figure 5 S2 claims that neurons in the &quot;NBM/SIp&quot; versus neurons in the &quot;VP/SIa&quot; have been targeted selectively with AAV9:DIO:hM4Di-mCherry. This should be documented extensively, by showing expression of hM4Di-mCherry throughout several brain slices in a de-zoomed fashion for an example mouse, and by showing average results from the quantification of the localizations in a suitable manner (for example, by plotting cell density/number along the a-p axis), for all investigated mice. Otherwise, it remains unclear whether the two areas have indeed been targeted differentially.</p><p>18) In Figure 5 S2A, the &quot;triple star&quot; symbol comparing the two control data points might be removed. It is not surprising that the tone recall causes increased freezing in the &quot;sham&quot; group.</p><p>19) The data set reported in Figure 5 S2B looks underpowered (only n = 3 and 4 mice). I highly doubt that with such a small sample size, significant conclusions can be drawn in a behavioral experiment. For some reason, the data in this experiment seem to scatter much less than in comparable experiments even with larger n's (compare to the neighboring panel A, bottom) – please comment. Also, the use of star symbols (3 stars?), and the use of the bracket symbols is misleading (the brackets suggest that the data was pooled amongst all &quot;pre-tone&quot; and &quot;recall tone&quot; groups; the rationale of this analysis approach remained cryptic). Importantly, there was no group effect in the ANOVA (p = 0.1574 was reported). Thus, no further post-hoc group comparisons should be done. Overall, I think the authors need to first, show that they can indeed differentially target NBM/SIp versus VP/SIa (see point 17). If this can be shown, then they would have to obtain significantly more data in both the control and effect groups for the VP/SIa targeting, to drive the point home that targeting these two areas has differential behavioral effects.</p><p>On the other hand, the authors might simply remove the data in Figure 5 S2A and B from the manuscript, and remove the claim about the differential effects of the NBM/SIp and VP/SIa. These claims are currently little supported by experimental evidence, and I feel they are not important for the overall conclusions of the paper.</p><p>20) Figure 6A shows time-resolved freezing responses on the recall day for n = 9 control mice, and n = 9 effect mice. However, it remained unclear from which of the previous experimental groups these data were taken; whether a sub-selection was made, and whether animals were pooled from various manipulations. This should be explained in detail in the Results text and legend.</p><p>21) The &quot;fold-change&quot; analysis of expression analyzed in Figure 6D remained unclear to me (sorry if I didn't get it). Please explain this briefly in the Results text, and make sure it is explained in more detail in the Methods. Also, please give details about the viral construct used in Figure 6C (currently it only states &quot;ADCD&quot;).</p><p>22) The picture shown in Figure 6E is simply a scheme of the idea that neurons activated in &quot;high responders&quot;, in your view, should be localized more anteriorly, but it is in no way a documentation of an anatomical observation. This scheme should be replaced by experimental evidence.</p><p>23) The data that might relate to the above issue (localization of ChAT+, activated neurons along the a-p axis in &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; responders), might be contained in Figure 6 S2. However, the data seems to be only partially analyzed, and it is confusing to fully understand how the plot in panel C was derived. First, it was unclear from which group of mice the images in Figure 6 S2A were taken. Please explain in the legend from which experiment these images were taken, which mouse genotype was used (Fos-tTA/shGFP with or without ChAT-Cre?), and which viral constructs were injected in these mice.</p><p>For panel C, I assume that the red data point represents an analysis of the images in panel B (correct?), but I am unsure from which data set the black data points were taken (# of recall-activated BFCNs (ADCD)&quot;) – please mention this in detail in the legend of the Figure. Were the black data points related to the images in panel A? were they taken from &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; responder mice?</p><p>24) The images shown in Figure 6 S2C, should be shown in a de-zoomed fashion for several representative brain images on the level of the BF, and beyond. Such a documentation of the data would represent the control for &quot;leaky&quot; expression mentioned above (best after co-staining against ChAT; see point 10).</p><p>25) The 2-star symbol in Figure 7D above the comparison &quot;HC&quot; – Fos+&quot; should probably be 3-stars, not 2-stars (p = 0.0006).</p><p>26) The authors should use the less &quot;pushy&quot; and more conventional criteria for using star symbols for statistical significance (i.e. 1 star, p &lt; 0.05; 2 stars, &lt; 0.01; 3 stars &lt; 0.001), and omit the &quot;4 star&quot; symbol and definition throughout. The 1-3 star criteria should be stated in the Methods (I didn't find it). The paper in its current version has only a single &quot;4 star&quot; symbol (Figure 3D), which should be changed to &quot;3 star&quot; according to the above definition, or removed (see also point 18) (see also my previous point &quot;Data Recommendations 4&quot;).</p><p>27) The bracket symbol in Figure 7F is probably wrong. On the left side, it should only point to the &quot;HC&quot; group, but not to both the &quot;HC&quot; and &quot;Fos-&quot; group as it stands now.</p><p>28) The authors claim that &quot;latency to fire an AP&quot; and AHP might significantly change in re-activated ChAT neurons (Figure 7 S1E, F). However, these effects are somewhat more subtle than the other effects shown in the main Figure 7. For example, the effect of &quot;latency&quot; seems to be driven merely by some outlier neurons in the home cage group with very long latencies (the authors would need to show example recordings), whereas the data from the Fos- and Fos+ groups virtually overlay and the latter comparison is the more pertinent one. Thus, I think it is more cautious to drop this claim.</p><p>29) l. 427 states:</p><p>&quot;Next, we quantified the number of cholinergic neurons expressing Fos (Fos shGFP+) after saline or predator odor exposure&quot;</p><p>– Please explain how long the mice were exposed to the odors.</p><p>30) In Figure 8, the authors seem to analyze the results of a triple-labeling anatomical experiment; i.e. there are neurons that are Fos+; neurons that are back-labelled by fast Blue; neurons that are ChAT+, and all combinations thereof. Thus, to give the reader a better view of the various neuron pools, the authors should report the numbers of all pools of neurons (i.e. the &quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot; neurons and all combinations thereof). This can be either done numerically or in the form of a Venn diagram. As it stands, only part of the information is given (Figure 8C, right; which seems to correspond to the percentage of back-labelled, ChAT+ neurons which were also Fos+). However, this is only part of a bigger picture. For example, the images in Figure 8C, and in Figure 8 S1A (middle, right) show also many non-ChAT+ neurons, that were re-activated in the VP/SIa area.</p><p>31) What does the dashed line label &quot;Home cage&quot; in Figure 8C, right panel, mean, and how was it derived?</p><p>32) l. 442:</p><p>&quot; Nearly the entire subset of BLA-projecting VP/SIa cholinergic neurons were also Fos-shGFP+ (Figure 8C right).&quot;</p><p>– Another non-scientific statement. Rather, the average plus/minus S.D. of the quantification should be reported. In addition, information about all labelled neuronal populations should be given (see above, point 30).</p><p>33) The retrograde expression experiment of hM4Di from the BLA in Figure 8D is expected to drive hM4Di expression in all cholinergic BLA-projectors, not selectively in the VP/SIa. This caveat in the interpretation should be mentioned more carefully when the results of this section are summarized (lines 451 – 454).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I thank the authors for addressing my concerns, and I'm happy to recommend the manuscript for publication in its current form. There are a few figures that would benefit from additional labeling (outlined below).</p><p>Please add anatomical references for basal forebrain in figures F1S4, F2S1a, F4c, F5S1a, F5S1b , F6S2a.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed many of my previous concerns and now nicely dissociate the role of NBM/SIp and VP/SIp ACh neurons in learned threat memory processing and show that NBM/SIp ACh cells are activated by memory recall and necessary for threat memory expression. However, I still have a lingering concern with their strong emphasis on the role of NBM/SIp ACh neuron (and their projections to BLA) as being memory 'engram' cells. While some of their data are consistent with this idea, they do not test key criteria for defining engram neurons, and the new data supporting a role of NBM/SIp ACh cells which project to the BLA in the threat memory 'engram' is only correlative.</p><p>Specifically, while there is evidence in support of the NBM/SIp ACh cell population (independent of where they project) in memory engrams (activated by memory cues, necessary for memory expression). There are several criteria for defining engram neurons (see Josselyn and Tonegawa Science 2020) which haven't been met including sufficiency (stimulation should produce memory in the absence of recall cues), mimicry (creation of an artificial engram) and long-lasting cellular or synaptic changes in engram neurons (here they only see excitability differences at 2.5 hr, not at long term memory timepoints). It is possible (even likely) that activity in these neurons modulates/facilitates threat memory formation and expression and are not storing the memory trace themselves.</p><p>There is even less evidence that NBM/SIp ACh cells which project to BLA being engram cells. The authors report an increase in ACh release in BLA (which isn't necessarily coming only from NBM/SIp) and added new data showing that NBM/SIp ACh cells projecting to BLA are fos activated.</p><p>While there is data supporting a potential role for these cells in engram processing, it is inappropriate to so strongly insist (in the title, abstract, and throughout) that NBM/SIp ACh neurons, and particularly those which project to BLA, are engram cells. The authors should moderate this aspect of the paper and perhaps broaden the discussion of the potential role of these cells in threat memory processing as they've already nicely done in the 'Cholinergic Modulation of Associative Threat Learning' section of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86581.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use hM4Di to &quot;silence&quot; Fos-tagged neurons in the basal forebrain, but they have not validated the efficiency or the possible various effects of this reagent.</p><p>It is possible that hM4Di actually has a relatively small effect on suppressing the AP activity of neurons. Nevertheless, hM4Di might still be an effective manipulation, because it was shown to additionally reduce transmitter release at the nerve terminal (see e.g. Stachniak et al. (Sternson) 2014, Neuron). Thus, the authors should evaluate in control experiments whether hM4Di expression plus CNO actually electrically silences the AP-firing of ChAT neurons in the BF as they seem to suggest, and/or if it reduces ACh release at the terminals. For example, one experiment to test the latter would be to perfuse CNO locally in the BLA; after expressing hM4Di in the cholinergic neurons of the BF. At the very least, the assumed action of hM4Di, and the possible caveats in the interpretation of these results should be discussed in the paper. See Reviewer 1, Point 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We clearly demonstrate that activation of hM4Di expressed in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons with clozapine significantly alters behavior and/or activation of neurons in projection targets of BFCNs (see Figure 3, Figure 3-supplement 1, Figure 5, Figure 5 Supplement 1, Figure 5-Supplement 2, Figure 6-Supplement 1 and Figure 8). As discussed on Page 17 Lines 488-493 of the revised manuscript, whether the effects we see on behavior result from inhibition of action potential firing per se, or from decreasing ACh release from terminals (or both) is not clear. However, the effect on behavior is striking and consistent with prior demonstrations that activating hM4Di (or hM3Dq) in cholinergic neurons changes membrane potential, blocks action potential firing and reduces firing rate (Zhang et al. 2017 and Jin et al. 2019) demonstrating DREADD-mediated excitation and inhibition of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons can alter electrical activity and behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Throughout the paper, the authors use comparisons of cell activity between groups to address questions about projection-specific and cue-specific cell activation and reactivation. However, statistical comparisons are sometimes done between biological replicates (animal groups e.g. Figure 5A), whereas a lot of them are done between technical replicates (data points/slices, e.g. Figure 2B, 5B, 7B). Adding statistics that compare biological replicates would help increase confidence in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replotted our data as scatter plots showing values from individual animals</p><p>(biological replicates) in New Figures 1 – 8 and in Figure 1-Supplements1, 2, and 3,</p><p>Figure 5-Supplements 1 and 2, Figure 6-Supplements 1 and 2, Figure 7-Supplement 1,</p><p>and Figure 8-Supplement 1.

This can be found as a separate file uploaded with the manuscript associated documents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To demonstrate engram-like specificity, in figure 4C the authors show fold change in cholinergic reactivation in low and high responders (animals that show low and high defensive freezing upon cue presentation) as normalized by cell activity while sitting in the home cage. However, the authors also collected a better control for this comparison, which is shown in figure S4, where the animals were exposed to an unconditioned tone cue. Comparing fold change to this tone-alone condition would provide stronger evidence for the authors' point, as this would directly compare the specificity of cholinergic reactivation to a conditioned vs an unconditioned cue. A discussion of the same comparison is relevant for figure 2 (and is shown in figure S4) but is not mentioned in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We compared cholinergic neuron response to tone under three conditions: (1) in animals that were exposed to three tone-shock pairings, and then to a single tone; (2) in animals exposed to three tones (no shock) and subsequently to a single tone; and (3) in animals exposed to three shocks (no tone) and subsequently to a single tone. These responses were compared to responses from animals that remained in the home cage. There was no significant increase in ACh release in the BLA in response to tone presentation unless the tone had previously been paired with foot shock (condition 1) (new Figure 1 and Figure 1Supplements 1-4), and no significant increase in tone associated re- activation of cholinergic neurons (using IEG expression as a read-out) relative to home cage unless the tone had been previously paired with foot shock (new Figures 2, 4), and no significant difference between responses to conditions 2, 3, or 4 (Figure 2C- home cage-home cage vs. tone-tone comparison p=0.5012). Based on these analyses, for the subsequent experiments, we have used the home cage conditions as the control group for comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The significant correlation between cue-evoked percent change in defensive freezing from pretone and fold change in cholinergic cell activity relative to the home cage that is shown in figure 4D is somewhat confusing. Is the correlation considering all the points shown (high and low responders as depicted by black and grey points)? It's first reported as one correlation but then is discussed as two populations that have different results. Further, is the average amount of reactivation for the home-cage controls used here the same denominator for each reported animal? Similarly to the point above, a correlation looking at fold change from tone-alone would also be helpful to determine the degree to which cholinergic reactivation is specific to threat-association learning versus the more general attentional component that this system is known for.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our prior presentation was confusing, and we have removed the correlation plots (see new Figure 6 and new Figure 6-Supplement 1). We now use data from a distinct cohort of mice (distinct from the ADCD labeling experiments) that underwent behavioral testing to demonstrate high vs. low responder behavioral performance (new Figure 6A/B). To the reviewer’s point regarding the denominator, counts of ADCD+ neurons from animals that underwent the recall session were normalized to the average of number of ADCD+ neurons in home cage animals in their respective cohorts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some important controls are missing from the 'engram' causal manipulation study (Figure 3) which makes it difficult to definitively support the authors' contention that the captured cells are in fact 'engram' cells. The established definition of engram cells refers to those which store memory and are activated during learning and memory expression. While the authors do show conditioning-induced changes in CS activation in NBM-ACh cells, they don't have the necessary controls for their causal manipulations to rule out other non-engram factors which could account for their results. For example, it is possible that the captured cells are simply activated by auditory cues (even prior to learning, the immuno approach in Figure 2 may not be sensitive enough to detect this) and that they are transmitting CS-activated ACh signals to BLA which are necessary for memory expression. It is also possible that inhibiting a small number of NBM-ACh neurons (not restricted to 'engram' cells) reduces memory expression (early engram studies by the Josselyn lab controlled for this). The authors could address this with further experiments such as including 1) a control group in which cells are captured (off-dox) during a habituation session with CS presentation prior to on-dox learning and 2) using a dilute virus to manipulate a similar number of cells as in the engram group. Alternatively, they could present a more careful discussion of this issue and potentially avoid the use of the term 'engram'.</p></disp-quote><p>Point 5.1: We have measured NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> cholinergic response to the CS tone using two distinct approaches. First, we have used GRAB<sub>ACh3.0</sub> to quantify changes in ACh levels in the BLA in response to the CS tone (New Figures 1, and Figure 1-Supplements 1-4). Second, we use an immediate early gene transcriptional response to identify cholinergic neurons that were activated in response to various conditions, (home cage, CS alone, USCS followed by CS). These latter experiments have used a viral approach (ADCD), immunostaining of Fos-shGFP transgene expression and immunostaining of endogenous Fos protein expression. Within the limits of sensitivity of each approach, we have not seen a significant increase in NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> activation in response to the tone (CS) unless the tone had been paired with foot shock. For example, we did not see increases in ACh release in the BLA in response to naïve tone (first tone presentation during training, Figure 1C and Figure 1-Supplement 1), to three repeat tones followed 24 hr later by tone alone (Figure 1Supplement 2) or in response to tone 24 hr after three foot shocks (Figure 1-Supplement 3). Likewise, we did not see activation or re-activation of NBM/SIp cholinergic neurons in response to tone (above levels seen in home cage animals), unless the tone had been paired with foot shock (Figures 2, 3 and Figure 6-Supplement 1).</p><p>Point 5.2: The BLA receives cholinergic input from both the NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> and the VP/SI<sub>a</sub> (roughly in a 2 or 3:1 ratio based on the number of cholinergic neurons retrogradely labeled, see for example Figure 5). We have compared silencing of each of these populations on freezing in response to the CS (using AAV-DIO-hM4Di injected specifically into either the NBM or the VP of Chat-IRES-Cre animals, new Figure 5-Supplement 2). Silencing the NBM cholinergic neurons eliminated a significant freezing response to the CS whereas inhibiting the VP cholinergic neurons did not affect freezing in response to the CS. The lack of effect on freezing in response to the CS following VP cholinergic silencing is not consistent with the possibility that generally reducing ACh in the BLA reduces memory expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors suggest that the ACh 'engram' cells participate in the expression of learned defensive responses through projections to the BLA. However, they have not demonstrated this definitively. To do this would require testing the effects of the inactivation of ACh-engram neurons which project to BLA on learned freezing responses. This may be technically challenging, but one approach could be to use the ADCD technique they've developed and inactivate terminals of captured cells in the BLA (chemogenetically or optogenetically). At a minimum, the authors should examine whether retrogradely labeled ACh cells projecting to BLA are Fos activated during a recall session (compared with appropriate controls).</p></disp-quote><p>We retrogradely labeled cholinergic neurons projecting to BLA using the retrograde tracer FastBlue in [chat-cre X fos-tTA/shGFP] mice. We simultaneously injected ADCD into the NBM/SI<sub>p</sub>. Animals were trained off-dox. Mice were sacrificed following recall and we quantified BLA-projecting (Fast Blue+) cholinergic neurons that were activated during training (ADCD+) and reactivated during recall (GFP+). ~20% of BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons were reactivated (engram) in the Training + Recall group, while only ~4% of BLAprojecting cholinergic neurons are reactivated in the home cage group (see new Figure 4). These data, combined with the results of silencing BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons, show that BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons are indeed part of the cholinergic threat memory engram.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For most experiments, significantly more raw data should be shown (e.g. raw example traces for GRAB-ACh3.0), and also brain section images for almost all experiments. Significantly more raw data should also be shown in the Main Figures. Please see Reviewer # 1, &quot;Specific points relating to data presentation and statistical analysis&quot;, for details and specific examples.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised all figures and added additional data to both main figures and supplemental figures to include more raw data to accompany the quantified data. In addition, we have provided additional detailed information on our statistical analyses (both in Figures, legends and in the new Statistical reporting table). Almost all plots now show individual data points. We have extended the GRABACh3.0 traces to show the full recording intervals (shown as average plots with SEMs and as individual traces).

In general, the authors seem to report these values in the Figure legends. This, however, has the advantage that the reader has to constantly jump between the results text and legends text if he/she wishes to check the values for a given experiment. I would therefore suggest that the authors report all values of statistical tests in the results text (N's, p- values, and the test used).</p><p>Also, in some instances, N-values seem to be missing from the legend texts. Please check all legends / Results text accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a separate statistical reporting table which details sample size, statistical test, and p-value for each comparison reported in the manuscript. In addition, these details have been included in the figure legends for reference along with the corresponding figures. We have also included p-values of the statistical comparisons directly in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1:</p><p>– Traces of GRAB-ACh3.0 should be shown more extensively. In Figure 1B, only the onset to the CS is shown – the response along the entire tone (30 s) should also be shown.</p><p>– Furthermore, the trace in Figure 1B seems to be an average over all mice. In addition, traces from individual mice should be shown, to allow an estimation of the S/N ratio of these measurements.</p><p>– In the quantification (Figure 1B, right), it would be easily possible to show the individual data points (there are 11 mice). I did not understand what the leftmost quantification tells us (&quot;Pre-tone&quot;). Please explain how this was calculated, and inasmuch it is relevant.</p><p>– What is the unit &quot;Z%deltaF/F0&quot;? In my view, this should either be Z-scored or else, deltaF/F0 – please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Please find our response to each individual point below:</p><p>1. We have now added the full GRABACh3.0 traces showing the average +/- SEM throughout the tone (Figure 1-Supplement 2D and Figure 1-Supplement 4B) and tone-shock pairings (Figure 1-Supplement 1C).</p><p>2. To aid in estimation of the S/N we have now included individual traces of data shown in Figure 1D in Figure 1-Supplement 4C. In addition we have included individual responses for the tone only controls (3X tone presentation on Day 1 without shock followed by tone presentation on Day 2) during naïve tone (Tone 1) presentation and 24h tone presentation in Figure 1-Supplement 2C.</p><p>3. We have now included individual data points (biological replicates) for all figures. We define the period prior to stimulus onset as the “pre-tone period.” This can better be referred to as baseline and has been amended accordingly in all figures and in the text. In Figure 1C you will note the baseline and tone-response period are indicated by a black bar above. We use 1s prior to tone onset for baseline measurements and the 1s following tone onset for our tone measurements. To combine our ‘slope’ and ‘max’ metrics and better represent the data, we have now reanalyzed our ACh release data to compute the area under the curve (AUC) at baseline or in response to the tone. Please note the AUC metric has now been incorporated throughout Figure 1 and Figure 1-Supplements 1-3.</p><p>4. Our GRABACh3.0 data is displayed as a z-score of the change in fluorescence over baseline fluorescence (deltaF/F0) over time. We have labeled the axis of each figure accordingly as “z-score X time”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2:</p><p>– the authors should extensively show images of brain sections. It is curious to see that the entire paper doesn't show a single image at low magnification, which shows the investigated basal forebrain areas, and stained neurons in there, in their anatomical context. This would allow the reader to put the images into context, and to roughly validate whether the analyses by the authors (e.g. counted cells) make sense. For example, for Figure 2A, please show an additional low mag image of the corresponding brain area, that shows this brain area (NBM/SIp) in the wider context. The actual image can then be shown as an insert.</p><p>– In the plot of Figure 2B, a tick at the value of 0 is missing – please add this (this also applies to Figure 2C, 4B, 4C, 5A, right, 5B, right, 5C, right, 7A, 7D, S6B, S6C, S7A-C – please add all ticks at zero). Adding the tick at zero will help the reader eyeball the values of the data points.</p><p>– In some plots, the y-axis doesn't start at 0, but at an artificially chosen higher value. This increases &quot;graphically&quot; the effect size; however, it doesn't allow the reader to look at the data in the most unbiased way (indeed, some Journals do not allow this practice) (see Figure 7C, Figure S6A, right). Please newly plot the data from zero.</p><p>– The authors did not report in the Statistics part, which criteria they used to add &quot;stars&quot; onto the plots. For example, Figure 2B has *** (3 stars), but the reported p-value is p = 0.0017. According to the criteria used by many authors, p &lt; 0.05 (1 star), p &lt; 0.01 (two stars), and p &lt; 0.001 (three stars). Thus, Figure 2B should have 2 stars, but not 3. Please explain the criteria you used, and please validate all star symbols according to the criteria you used.</p><p>– What is the unit of the cell numbers plotted in Figure 2B, C? Were these indeed absolute numbers as the axis labelling seems to suggest, or was there a normalization for the analyzed area? Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>1. We have included additional supplemental figures to accompany Figures 1, 5, 6, and 8 that include raw images of IHC data for added transparency. We have also added schematics showing the exact location where analyses were conducted for Figures 2 and 3.</p><p>2. We have added tick marks at 0 for all plots.</p><p>3. We have updated all our plots to start at 0.</p><p>4. The criteria used for significance is as follows: * ≤0.05, **≤0.01, ***≤0.001, **** ≤ 0.0001. All plots have been checked to ensure consistency.</p><p>5. In Figure 2, we report the average number of double labeled (mCherry+ and GFP+) cells within each condition from slices at bregma -0.7/-0.8mm. This value is not normalized to area since the NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> lacks easily defined boundaries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3:</p><p>– While the freezing data is shown at a quite high time resolution for the training day (Figure 3B), for recall (Figure 3C), only excessively binned data are shown. It would be advantageous for the reader to see the data at the same time resolution, in a quasi-continuous trace, to evaluate the effects also of silencing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided ‘quasi-continuous’ traces for both the training and recall sessions from Figure 3 in new Figure 3-Supplement 1A/B. Above the tracers we have indicated tone/shock onset, and the time-windows that were used for analysis of the recall data (pretone vs. recall tone response period). The binned comparisons of these data during the training and recall sessions are shown in Figure 3C/D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4:</p><p>– There are several issues with the definition of high and low freezers, and with the analysis in this Figure.</p><p>– Hig+low freezers: The Methods state &quot;High responders were defined as those mice that exhibited at least a 10 percentage point increase in % time spent freezing in the bin during the tone from the bin immediately pre-tone (e.g. Pre-tone freezing 10% to tone-induced freezing of {greater than or equal to}20%).&quot; However, the Results text speaks about a &quot;3-fold increase&quot; (l. 235) – these are different criteria, please explain.</p><p>– Related to the above, the y-axis labeling in Figure 4B is unclear – is this the difference in freezing (as the Methods would suggest) or a fold-change (like the Results would suggest)? Also, the 3-star symbol for p = 0.005 seems not justified, should be 2 stars according to often-used criteria (see also above).</p><p>– l. 238 states: &quot;There was no difference in mCherry expression in 'Low Responders' compared to the home cage group (fold change ~ 1),&quot;</p><p>– this should be tested statistically.</p><p>– I don't see that the freezing data in Figure 4D (y-axis) shows a &quot;positive correlation&quot; with the number of Fos-labelled cells (x-axis). Indeed, looking at the high responders only, the data falls very close to a flat line. Please explain how the correlation was analyzed – this was probably done by fitting all data, i.e. also including the &quot;low&quot; responders (?). The obvious absence of a correlation for the &quot;high responders&quot; alone (black data points) is worrisome.</p><p>– In Figure 4D, the location of the data points (y-axis, freezing; about -10 – 0%) does not seem to correspond to what is plotted in Figure 4B (~ 2%; please explain).</p><p>– Figure 4F, and Figure S5: The result about the location of labelled cells along the a-p axis of the brain should be documented with a series of original images, both at low and high mag (see general comments, above).</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended this figure significantly to state our point more clearly. Please note: this is now new Figure 6.</p><p>1. We have added two panels of data into Figure 6 to better explain our responder criteria. In Figure 6A/B, we stratified the freezing response of animals into two groups: High vs. Low responders. High Responders were defined as mice who showed a &gt;10 percentage points increase in time spent freezing in response to the tone compared to the pre-tone period. In Figure 6A, the full time-course of the recall trace is shown to highlight the difference in response to the tone between High and Low responders. In Figure 6B, the dotted line at 10% marks the criteria used to stratify the two groups. The methods section has now been edited to clearly state the criteria to match the figure (Page 43 Line 1231-1239). This is also described along with the associated figures in the Results section on (Page 11-12 Lines 329-343).</p><p>2. We have now presented this as the difference between pre-tone and tone period according to the criteria in Figure 6A. The statistical testing is now done and shown on the quasi-continuous trace of recall. The details of post-hoc tests comparing each time bin to the other can be found in the statistical reporting table.</p><p>3. We have added a grey shaded area to Figure 6D to indicate the range of ADCD+ neurons captured in home cage animals (ADCD+ neuron counts in each home cage animal normalized to average of all home cage animals). We have included a formal statistical comparison between home cage and low (home cage vs. low, fold change ~ 1, p&gt;0.99) or high responders (home cage vs. high, fold change ~3, p=0.0121) in the associated figure legend and in the Results section on Page 12 Lines 350-353.</p><p>4. We have removed the correlation plots and analyses from this figure. Instead, we believe our data are consistent with a threshold effect, whereby mice with ~2 fold increase in activation of cholinergic neurons results in the freezing behavior distinguishable from baseline freezing. Additionally, we find that this “critical mass” of activated cholinergic neurons is localized to a specific region within the anterior NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> of the basal forebrain.</p><p>5. We have added raw images of ChAT and Fos IHC following recall in Figure 5Supplement 2A from a High and Low responder mouse to supplement the schematic shown in Figure 6E. Quantification of counts of ADCD+ cells captured during recall across the A-P extent can be found in Figure 5-Supplement 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5:</p><p>– The location of back-labelled cells should again be amply documented with several low and high mag images from all analyzed areas (hDB, VP/SIa, NBM/SIp).</p><p>– 3 stars in Figure 5B might be 2 stars.</p></disp-quote><p>1. We have provided injection site mapping for data presented in Figure 5A in Figure 5-Supplement 1A. Images of CAV back-labeled cells are provided in Figure 6Supplement 2B across the hDB, SI<sub>a</sub>, and NBM/SI<sub>p</sub>.</p><p>2. We have replotted Figure 5b’’ (previously 5B) data as biological replicates rather than technical replicate. The significance value has updated accordingly in the figure as well in the text (p=0.0286, *).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure S4:</p><p>– was the data in Figure S4C a further analysis of data in Figure 2B? If yes, why are the animal numbers seemingly different between the two datasets?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now replotted and analyzed all our data by biological replicates and have rectified this discrepancy. Figure S4C can now be found as new Figure 6-Supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure S5:</p><p>– The legend doesn't state the N-numbers.</p><p>– The box plot should be explained (meaning of the boxes). Even better, individual data points should be shown instead, if this is feasible.</p></disp-quote><p>1. We have now included sample sizes in the figure legends and in the statistical reporting table.</p><p>2. This is now Figure 6-Supplement 2C. We have converted this plot to individual data points as suggested. The data is described in the Results section on Page 12 Lines 363-366.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure S6:</p><p>– For the data in A, again example images at low and high magnification should be shown …</p><p>– For the images in B, please indicate lateral-medial, and dorsal-ventral directions in these images (assuming that these are coronal sections?).</p><p>– The data in C again suggest that there might also be an effect on contextual fear learning (see also above).</p></disp-quote><p>1. Newly added Figure 5-Supplement 1A/B shows a detailed A/P mapping of the injection sites and Fos labeling for experiments presented in Figure 5.</p><p>2. Figure 5-Supplement 1 images have been additionally labeled with medial/lateral (M/L) and dorsal/ventral (D/V) designations for ease.</p><p>3. We find no statistically significant differences in pre-tone freezing between groups (Figure 5B, Sham vs. hM4Di, Pre-tone p=0.0679; Figure 5C, Sham vs. hM4Di, Pretone p=0.0966).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure S7</p><p>– The text describing the data in A states &quot;did not freeze to the tone&quot; (l. 305).

We have amended our text in the Results section to note that silencing BLA projecting cholinergic neurons during training (Figure 5B) <italic>blunted the recall induced freezing behavior</italic> (p&lt;0.0001) and subsequent activation of BLA neurons (p&lt;0.0286). Similarly, silencing BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons during recall (Figure 5C) <italic>reduced recall-induced freezing behavior</italic> (p=0.0279) and the activation of BLA neurons (p=0.0317). Amended text in the Results section can be found on Page 9-10 Lines 271-282. Further details of the statistical comparisons can be found in the Statistical Reporting Table.</p><p>2. Sample size has been included in the figure legends and in the statistical reporting table.</p><p>3. We have included additional raw images to support the data. An example injection site is now included as part of Figure 5A, center panel, along with an example of ChAT+ cells that also have mCherry expression. The distribution of these hM4diexpressing cholinergic neurons is quantified in Figure 5A, left panel. Additionally, images across the A-P axis of the basal forebrain of hM4Di-mCherry expressing cells have been provided in Figure 6-Supplement 2B. We visually inspected each animal in these experiments for bilateral GFP expression in the BLA and presence of mCherry+ cells in the basal forebrain prior to including (or excluding) mice in the analysis. We have provided representative images showing the A/P extent of the GFP expression (injection area) from one animal in Figure 5-Supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure S8:</p><p>– I wonder why the firing rate data of the &quot;Training&quot; group in panel H is extremely small (around 5 Hz or less), and smaller than in all other groups. Is there another type of modulation of intrinsic excitability, a down-modulation, after training? Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have also been intrigued by this observation. However, we reserve any conclusions regarding this decrease as it is not statistically significant and overlaps with the firing rate from neurons recorded from the home-cage condition. Further experiments will be necessary to investigate whether there is a bonafide decrease in excitability in Fos+ BFCNs following training.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure S9:</p><p>– In panel C, could you show the freezing data at a higher time resolution, e.g. the 30s bins also used in Figure 3B?</p></disp-quote><p>Please find the requested plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.

The amended results can be found on Page 10-11 Lines 297-314.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I would also recommend moving figures S7A and S7B into the main figures as they provide important evidence for the author's point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this set of experiments is critical to the main point of the manuscript. We have taken this suggestion and have now included these experiments into a significantly modified main figure, Figure 5 (Panels B-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Given that the authors don't see an effect of clozapine on memory when inactivating during the consolidation period (Figure S7C), it might be worthwhile to discuss why this might be the case, and the effects of cholinergic input starting cascades of neural activation in the BLA during training.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the possible function of ACh during consolidation is of interest, but feel that this requires a more complete experimental investigation that is beyond the scope of the present study, and as such we have removed prior Figure S7c as too preliminary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Overall, there are missing Bregmas and mapping of placements in several places (e.g. Figure 1A – Bregma and mapping of placements/spread of the virus across animals, it appears that the recordings are relatively anterior in the BLA; Bregma in Figures 5, S3C, 6SB, S6C – not clear how much of a CeA there is at this location, 7D; a zoomed out section of where the example data in figure 7C is coming from).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included raw images and schematics to provide transparency to the data. These have been added to Figures 2, 3, 4, and Figure 1-Supplement 4, Figure 5-Supplement 1, Figure 6-Supplement 2, and Figure 8-Supplement 1. In new Figure 1-Supplement 4A we have included a schematic of the relocalized fiber placements from fiber photometry experiments presented in Figure 1. In Figures 2 and 3, we have now included low magnification and high magnification images of ADCD labeled neurons within the NBM/SI<sub>p</sub>. An A/P extent of the Fast Blue injection locations for the newly added Figure 4 is included as panel within Figure 4A. We have now included raw images detailing the AP extent of the evaluated BLA as related to Figure 5 data, shown in Figure 5-Supplement 1A/B. In Figure 5-Supplement 1C, we have included low and high magnification images to localize the CeC within the image. In Figure 6-Supplement 2 we provide images across the A/P extent of the basal forebrain to show where activated cholinergic neurons are clustered in High vs. Low responders. Finally, in Figure 8-Supplement 1, we show raw images of across the basal forebrain of activated cholinergic neurons in response to predator odor. We believe these additions have substantially strengthened the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would also be helpful to indicate the area where the signal fluorescence is being calculated in traces shown in figures 1 and S1.</p></disp-quote><p>We now indicate with a black bar above our traces in Figure 1 the period that is being quantified for baseline (1s before stimulus onset) and tone response (1s following tone onset). We have also included additional text in the methods section to clarify this on Page 45 Lines 1288-1291.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) For the 'engram' data in Figure 2, the logic of the double labeling is a bit confusing as described and it's not clear, from a simple reading of the paper, how the authors achieve double labeling of encoding (training activated) and recall activated cells. After digging around in the Methods, Figs/legends I was able to figure it out, but it was difficult initially. The authors should state this in a simple way in the main text along with a description of how this works at the level of transgene expression at different time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the text to clarify our double-labeling strategy (Page 6 and 7 Lines 170188). We have also added a schematic in Figure 2-Supplement 1B accompanied by detailed text in the figure legend (Page 28 Lines 807-817) detailing how the ADCD-engram labeling works. In brief, we deliver the ADCD construct in the basal forebrain of Chat-Cre X FostTA-shGFP mice. In this manner, the virally delivered ADCD construct can only be expressed in cholinergic neurons, in the absence of doxycycline (DOX OFF). Once expression initiates, it is maintained even in the presence of Dox by a dox-insensitive tTa, thereby resulting in permanent labeling. Intercepting the peak of a shGFP signal (for example 2.5h following a second behavioral assay) allows for identification of cells that express mCherry (activated during DOX OFF) and cells that express GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some important controls are missing from the 'engram' causal manipulation study (Figure 3) which makes it difficult to definitively support the authors' contention that the captured cells are in fact 'engram' cells. The established definition of engram cells refers to those which store memory and are activated during learning and memory expression. While the authors do show conditioning-induced changes in CS activation in NBM-ACh cells, they don't have the necessary controls for their causal manipulations to rule out other non-engram factors which could account for their results. For example, it is possible that the captured cells are simply activated by auditory cues (even prior to learning, the immuno approach in Figure 2 may not be sensitive enough to detect this) and that they are transmitting CS-activated ACh signals to BLA which are necessary for memory expression. It is also possible that inhibiting a small number of NBM-ACh neurons (not restricted to 'engram' cells) reduces memory expression (early engram studies by the Josselyn lab controlled for this). The authors could address this with further experiments such as including 1) a control group in which cells are captured (off-dox) during a habituation session with CS presentation prior to on-dox learning and 2) using a dilute virus to manipulate a similar number of cells as in the engram group. Alternatively, they could present a more careful discussion of this issue and potentially avoid the use of the term 'engram'.</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout the manuscript, we have evaluated the cholinergic response to the tone using 1) GRABACh 3.0 to quantify changes in ACh levels in the BLA and 2) using an IEG response to tag and identify cholinergic neurons that were activated under specific behavioral conditions. Using either approach, we have not seen a significant increase in activation or ACh release in response to the unconditioned tone (Figure 1C-left, 1D-left, 2C/D, Figure 1-Supplement 2, Figure 1-Supplement 3, Figure 6-Supplement 1A) unless it has been paired with a footshock (see Figure 1C-right, 2C, 3D).</p><p>The BLA receives a majority of cholinergic input from the NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> with additional cholinergic input from the VP/SI<sub>a</sub>. We evaluated the contribution of each of these populations to the freezing response to the conditioned tone. We find that silencing the NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> results in a decrease in freezing to the conditioned tone (Figure 5-Supplement 2A), while silencing the VP/SI<sub>a</sub> population does not affect the freezing response (Figure 5Supplement 2B). The lack of effect with VP inhibition suggests that silencing a random, small number of BFCNs, or decreasing ACh release in the BLA alone is not sufficient to affect memory recall.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggest that the ACh 'engram' cells participate in the expression of learned defensive responses through projections to the BLA. However, they have not shown this definitively. To do this would require testing the effects of the inactivation of ACh-engram neurons which project to BLA on learned freezing responses. This may be technically challenging, but one approach could be to use the ADCD technique they've developed and inactivate terminals of captured cells in the BLA (chemogenetically or optogenetically). At a minimum, the authors should examine whether retrogradely labeled ACh cells projecting to BLA are Fos activated during a recall session (compared with appropriate controls).</p></disp-quote><p>In new Figure 4, we retrogradely label cholinergic neurons that project BLA using the retrograde tracer FastBlue in [Chat-IRES-Cre X Fos-tTA/shGFP] mice. Simultaneously, we injected our ADCD virus into the NBM/SI. Cells were captured off-dox during training. Mice were sacrificed following recall to capture GFP expression in recall-activated cells. We quantified BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons (Fast Blue+) that were activated during training (ADCD+) and became reactivated during recall (GFP+). We find that ~20% of BLAprojecting cholinergic neurons are reactivated (engram) in the Training + Recall group, while only ~4% of BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons are reactivated in the home cage group.

However, this experiment requires a control group without training (or, ideally, with unpaired CS/US training) to demonstrate that the inhibition is affect learning-induced activation of BLA neurons. While others have reported this using other paradigms previously, it is still important to show here using their own preparation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included images across the A/P axis in the BLA for Fos expression in home cage animals alongside Fos expression following recall in animals that had a sham surgery or those that were injected with CAV2-DIO-hM4Di with cholinergic inhibition during training (Figure 5-Supplement 1B).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>We thank the authors for their response to the reviewers' previous suggestions. Many of the findings have been strengthened through the addition of new experiments and analyses. However, there are remaining concerns about the statistical approaches used and low population size in some experiments which should be addressed. We suggest using the 'eLife Transparent Reporting Form' as a guide. Related to sample sizes, power analyses or clear demonstrations of existing standards in the field should be used to justify animal numbers. If necessary, further animals should be added to experimental groups (e.g. the differential role of NBM/SIp and VP/SIa in learned vs. innate threats) or, as suggested by reviewer 1, data with low n could be removed if it does not seriously undermine the conceptual advance of the paper. In addition, the strong focus on the activated basal forebrain cholinergic cells as being part of the threat memory engram is not well supported. The authors should moderate the claims related to this aspect of the paper.</p><p>Furthermore, the title and/or abstract should provide a clear indication of the biological system under investigation (i.e., species name or broader taxonomic group, if appropriate). Please revise your title and/or abstract with this advice in mind.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these concerns in the following manner:</p><p>1. We excluded the data related to the lack of engagement of the VP in cue associated-learned threat from the manuscript, as suggested, as this does not compromise the main claims of the revised manuscript.</p><p>2. We removed the use of term “engram” from the title, abstract and results text. We do discuss the definition of “engram” in the Discussion section.</p><p>3.

While mice demonstrated freezing behavior during the session on day 2, there was no significant increase in freezing behavior to the 24h tone presentation (Figure 1-Supplement 3C, p=0.2418). There was no increase in ACh in response to the tone when it was not explicitly paired with a shock, confirming that the changes in ACh release were indeed associative (Figure 1-Supplement 3D; baseline (pre-tone, day 2) to 24h tone (tone presentation, day2): p=0.7272).”</p><p>When read within the context of the entire paragraph it seems clear that we are referring to the shock alone training, followed by a tone alone recall.

We have used a classic experimental paradigm to do so (Josselyn and Tonegawa, 2020. Science). That is, we expressed the inhibitory hM4Di construct in cholinergic neurons that had been activated during training (Activity dependent Cre dependent virus, dox off during training), We then use the DREADD ligand, clozapine, right before and during recall to selectively prevent these previously activated neurons (activated during training) from being activated again (hence, re-activated) during the recall session. The schematic in this figure and the figure legend attempt to clarify this further as follows:</p><p>“A. ADCD-hM4Di was injected into the NBM/SIp of Chat-IRES-Cre x Fos-tTA/shGFP mice. Two weeks later animals underwent training on regular chow (Dox chow removed 24 hr prior to training session) to allow hM4Di.mCherry to be selectively expressed in training activated cholinergic neurons. Three days later, recall was tested in Dox on conditions. Clozapine (CLZ) was injected 10min before the recall session to activate the inhibitory DREADD, hM4Di specifically in previously activated cholinergic neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 3 S1B, the average trace of time-resolved freezing is shown, for the same data set as the one in Figure 3D. However, the number of mice included in the time-resolved display was lower (n = 5 and 6) than in the display of Figure 3D (n = 7 and 8). This must be homogenized, i.e. all data used for the statistical analysis in Figure 3D (n = 8 and 7 mice) should also be shown in a time-resolved fashion for Figure 3S1B.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in noting that two mice are missing from each group in the population data, time resolved plot. The reason for this omission is that those mice were part of a cohort, where the video aspects of the data were temporarily stored on a drive that was damaged in a major flood that affected multiple labs within building 35 (NIH; Bethesda) last December. As such, we could not go back to generate the specific time-resolved plots for those 4 mice. We provided the data for the remainder of the mice to aid in clarity, as requested. We also reanalyzed our data by removing the missing mice from the summary data plots and this did not alter the statistical validity of our findings as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86581-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) l. 273 states:</p><p>&quot; We injected cav.hM4DiBLA or sham control mice with clozapine (CLZ) 10 min prior to initiating cue-conditioned threat learning&quot;</p><p>– Please add here that these were IP (?) injections, for a quick reference for the reader.

Because, as I assume, CLZ was not injected into the basal forebrain (BF) but rather IP (see point 9 above), a leaky expression of hM4Di beyond the cholinergic BF has the potential to strongly change the interpretation of this experiment. Thus, the authors have to show, first, whether hM4Di-mCherry is expressed at the injection site in the BLA itself (this would lead to a direct inhibition of BLA neurons). This should be done by showing example images of hM4di-mCherry fluorescence on the level of the BLA, and by analyzing the number of hM4Di-mCherry+ neurons in the BLA over the entire dataset. Second, the authors should show extensive raw example images of the BF at different a-p locations (and of further brain areas in a zoomed-out fashion), in an attempt to exclude the possibility that hM4Di might also be expressed in non-cholinergic neurons (ChAT could be visualized by IHC). Only a non-leaky expression of hM4Di-mCherry, essentially limited to ChAT-positive neurons in the BF, would support the conclusions of the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5A shows that the expression of hM4Di is wholly restricted to ChAT+ neurons. We have no reason to suspect that the Chat-IRES-Cre mice used in this study display leaky cre expression. We refer the reviewer to the Jax Labs page for this mouse line, with particular reference to the details posted there relevant to the ways in which the line we have used was created to address a previous cre leak issue - https://www.jax.org/strain/031661.</p><p>Figure 6 Supplement 2 shows several zoomed out images of the BFCNs in response to this same request made previously by Reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) On l. 298, the results of a control experiment is reported, which is not documented (&quot;data not shown&quot;).

On the other hand, the comparison between the &quot;sham&quot; group and hM4Di group at the &quot;pre-tone&quot; time had a p-value of 0.096, although the overlap of the data points is only partial.

Although the authors reported a p-value of 0.096 (and therefore, &quot;not significant&quot;) for this comparison (Figure 5C), this p-value should nevertheless be verified. Because the trend is seen in this data set, as well as in several other ones (Figure 5B and Figure 3D), the authors should discuss the possibility that chemogenetic suppression of ACh release might, in addition to the effects studied here, also reduce contextual fear learning (see also my previous &quot;Specific comment 2&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We have used standard, and in our opinions correct, statistical tests to evaluate the quantitative data in this study and therefore feel that it would be unscientific to discuss mechanisms underlying results that do not differ significantly as detected by these tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Still related to the data in Figure 5C:</p><p>The time-resolved display of tone-evoked freezing during the recall day should be shown both for this data set (Figure 5C), and for the data set in Figure 5B, similarly as was done above for the data in Figure 3D (see panel Figure 3 S1B). This would also be helpful to gain insight into the p-values resulting from ANOVA / KW testing (see above, point 12), which were probably performed on similar time-resolved data sets (because the effect of &quot;time&quot; was always tested).</p></disp-quote><p>We can provide these plots additionally as a supplemental figure. However, our summary plots in the main figures are the commonplace reporting standard for these types of data.

Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the plot shown in Figure 5 S1B as it is not critical to the point of the analysis. To address the reviewer’s point, anterior BLA is located from bregma -0.8 to ~-2.0 after which posterior BLA begins to predominate (these are referred to in the Paxinos mouse brain atlas as BLA and BLP respectively). In our studies, DREADD mediated suppression of Fos activity was seen in the regions analyzed and presented but not beyond those bounds. This observation was consistent with a previously published report showing the segregation of negative valence processing BLA neurons, and as such we had included that plot in this manuscript.</p><p>We would like to note that we make no comments or claims regarding the relationship between BLA anterior to posterior anatomy and the basal forebrain anterior to posterior anatomy.

In Figure 5C, retrograde expression from the BLA was studied, whereas in Figure 5 S1D, the effects of retrograde expression of hM4Di from the CeA were studied. If the experiment was originally set up for 3 groups of mice (thus, sham control – CAV2-hM4Di in BLA – CAV2-hM4Di in CeA), then this should be reported as such, the data should be shown in one panel, and the statistical comparisons should be done accordingly (i.e. the &quot;multiple comparison&quot; correction would need to be done for 3 groups). If, on the other hand, the CeA experiments were done without proper controls, and were simply compared to the control group from another experiment, then the CeA data should be removed.

However, these effects are somewhat more subtle than the other effects shown in the main Figure 7. For example, the effect of &quot;latency&quot; seems to be driven merely by some outlier neurons in the home cage group with very long latencies (the authors would need to show example recordings), whereas the data from the Fos- and Fos+ groups virtually overlay and the latter comparison is the more pertinent one. Thus, I think it is more cautious to drop this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, as in standard practice, we show all the data and all of the results of the statistical analyses for all biophysical measures made whether “subtle” or not. These analyses consider the full range and distribution of the data without bias as to normality. Our commitment to presentation of all the features for all the recorded neurons, whether statistically significantly different or not, uses both the main and supplemental figures to provide full transparency. This is considered best practice for reporting biophysical data in general and the results of these single cell recording + post hoc PCR, labor-intensive experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>29) l. 427 states:</p><p>&quot; Next, we quantified the number of cholinergic neurons expressing Fos (Fos shGFP+) after saline or predator odor exposure&quot;</p><p>– Please explain how long the mice were exposed to the odors.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure legend states this:</p><p>“A.

Thus, to give the reader a better view of the various neuron pools, the authors should report the numbers of all pools of neurons (i.e. the &quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot; neurons and all combinations thereof). This can be either done numerically or in the form of a Venn diagram. As it stands, only part of the information is given (Figure 8C, right; which seems to correspond to the percentage of back-labelled, ChAT+ neurons which were also Fos+). However, this is only part of a bigger picture. For example, the images in Figure 8C, and in Figure 8 S1A (middle, right) show also many non-ChAT+ neurons, that were re-activated in the VP/SIa area.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of this experiment, and indeed the entire study, is to investigate the contribution of different populations of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons to threat responses. At no time do we say or even imply that other neuronal types are not involved as well, but these “non-ChAT+” cells are not our focus. The requested analyses are outside the scope of this study and would not add or take away from our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>31) What does the dashed line label &quot;Home cage&quot; in Figure 8C, right panel, mean, and how was it derived?</p></disp-quote><p>The meaning of the dashed line (which we referred to as dotted) was delineated in the figure legend:</p><p>“Dotted line indicates % of Fos+ cholinergic neurons in the home cage group in this experiment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>32) l. 442:</p><p>&quot; Nearly the entire subset of BLA-projecting VP/SIa cholinergic neurons were also Fos-shGFP+ (Figure 8C right).&quot;</p><p>– Another non-scientific statement.

However, I still have a lingering concern with their strong emphasis on the role of NBM/SIp ACh neuron (and their projections to BLA) as being memory 'engram' cells. While some of their data are consistent with this idea, they do not test key criteria for defining engram neurons, and the new data supporting a role of NBM/SIp ACh cells which project to the BLA in the threat memory 'engram' is only correlative.</p><p>Specifically, while there is evidence in support of the NBM/SIp ACh cell population (independent of where they project) in memory engrams (activated by memory cues, necessary for memory expression). There are several criteria for defining engram neurons (see Josselyn and Tonegawa Science 2020) which haven't been met including sufficiency (stimulation should produce memory in the absence of recall cues), mimicry (creation of an artificial engram) and long-lasting cellular or synaptic changes in engram neurons (here they only see excitability differences at 2.5 hr, not at long term memory timepoints). It is possible (even likely) that activity in these neurons modulates/facilitates threat memory formation and expression and are not storing the memory trace themselves.</p><p>There is even less evidence that NBM/SIp ACh cells which project to BLA being engram cells. The authors report an increase in ACh release in BLA (which isn't necessarily coming only from NBM/SIp) and added new data showing that NBM/SIp ACh cells projecting to BLA are fos activated.</p><p>While there is data supporting a potential role for these cells in engram processing, it is inappropriate to so strongly insist (in the title, abstract, and throughout) that NBM/SIp ACh neurons, and particularly those which project to BLA, are engram cells. The authors should moderate this aspect of the paper and perhaps broaden the discussion of the potential role of these cells in threat memory processing as they've already nicely done in the 'Cholinergic Modulation of Associative Threat Learning' section of the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and thoughtful recommendations. We agree with the reviewer that the criteria as established by the study of glutamatergic projection neurons in the BLA and hippocampus are not completely demonstrated in our study. However, our findings do satisfy the criteria defining engram cells as mentioned in Josselyn and Tonegawa (Science, 2020). Among the 4 methods to evaluate engram cells, we have used 2 to demonstrate observation and necessity. Additionally, a similar study of oxytocinergic cells being part of a threat memory engram was recently published (Hasan MT., et al. Neuron, 2019) wherein they satisfy the same 2 criteria as our study.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have now moderated our claims regarding the presence of a cholinergic engram throughout the manuscript.</p><p>We have changed the title of the manuscript to reflect this, and modified figure titles and legends, as well as their mention in the Results section.</p><p>Finally, we have added some text to the Discussion section to reflect our thoughts on the matter:</p><p>Lines 567-595:</p><p>“Is there a Cholinergic Component in the Associative Threat Memory Engram?</p><p>Studies examining mechanisms of learning and memory in recent years have revived Semon’s theory on memory engrams: learning must result in lasting biophysical changes that form the substrate for retrieval of the learned experience (Semon 1921, Tonegawa, Liu et al. 2015). Josselyn and Tonegawa have recently updated the definition of engram cells, requiring that these be activated by learning, modified by learning, and reactivated by subsequent presentation of the recall-inducing stimuli, resulting in memory retrieval (Josselyn and Tonegawa 2020). NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> BFCNs investigated in this study indeed fulfil these criteria as they are activated by learning, show induction of Fos and altered physiological properties with recall, are reactivated by recall, and the reactivation of previously, training-activated BFCNs was necessary for recall behavior.</p><p>Multiple studies have used threat and reward learning paradigms in rodents to examine allocation of neurons to memory engrams. These studies have looked for these engram cells in regions such as cortex, amygdala and hippocampus focusing on glutamatergic pyramidal neurons (Josselyn, Köhler and Frankland 2015). However, recent work has demonstrated that memory engrams are distributed across brain-wide networks, and that reactivation of a multi-region engram more closely recapitulates natural recall behavior (Roy, Park et al. 2022).</p><p>In addition to the BLA, cholinergic neurons in the NBM/SI<sub>p</sub> region project to various limbic and sensory regions such as the lateral orbital cortex, cingulate cortex, somatosensory cortex, and mediodorsal thalamus (Ananth, Rajebhosale et al. 2023). This raises the interesting possibility that the cholinergic signaling modulates various nodes of the threat memory engram circuit in conjunction with the amygdala, allowing for coordinated retrieval of engrams across distributed networks. Such coordinated activation of distributed engrams has been recently demonstrated to more closely recapitulate natural memory retrieval (Roy, Park et al. 2022). Furthermore, functionally related regions have been shown to receive their cholinergic input from the same cholinergic nucleus (Zaborszky, Csordas et al. 2015). We propose that engram-enrolled cholinergic neurons bind distributed engrams to encode stimulus-convergent, efficient memory retrieval.”</p><p>We hope these changes will prove to be satisfactory.</p></body></sub-article></article>
