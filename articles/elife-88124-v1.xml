However, several recent studies have shown that perceptual learning or monocular deprivation can also induce plasticity in the adult dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus. How plasticity in the thalamus and cortex interact in the adult visual system is ill-understood. To assess the influence of thalamic plasticity on plasticity in primary visual cortex (V1), we made use of our previous finding that during the critical period ocular dominance (OD) plasticity occurs in dLGN and requires thalamic synaptic inhibition. Using multielectrode recordings we find that this is also true in adult mice, and that in the absence of thalamic inhibition and plasticity, OD plasticity in adult V1 is absent. To study the influence of V1 on thalamic plasticity, we silenced V1 and show that during the critical period, but not in adulthood, the OD shift in dLGN is partially caused by feedback from V1. We conclude that during adulthood the thalamus plays an unexpectedly dominant role in experience-dependent plasticity in V1. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the thalamus as a potential source of plasticity in learning events that are typically thought of as cortical processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ocular dominance</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>binocular</kwd><kwd>feedback</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>lateral geniculate nucleus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NeuroTime Erasmus+</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levelt</surname><given-names>Christiaan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Human Brain Project 785907 (HBP SGA2) and 945539 (HBP SGA3)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levelt</surname><given-names>Christiaan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibitory innervation in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus is crucial for adult thalamic and cortical ocular dominance plasticity, highlighting potential thalamic involvement in conditions like amblyopia and learning disabilities.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Experience-dependent plasticity in the adult visual system is largely thought of as a cortical process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gilbert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gilbert and Wiesel, 1992</xref>). However, several recent studies have demonstrated that plasticity also occurs in the adult dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus of human subjects during perceptual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2016</xref>) and mice upon monocular deprivation (MD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaepel et al., 2017</xref>). How plasticity in adult dLGN is regulated and whether plasticity in dLGN and V1 influence each other have barely been studied.</p><p>In this study, we addressed these questions using ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in mice as a model. OD is the property that neurons preferentially respond to visual stimuli presented to one eye versus the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963a</xref>). Visual experience affects OD and a period of MD results in an OD shift in V1 neurons due to weakened responses to the deprived eye and strengthened responses to the non-deprived eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hensch and Stryker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963a</xref>). OD plasticity is most prominent during a critical period of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963a</xref>) but can also be induced in young adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heimel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hofer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lehmann and LÃ¶wel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sawtell et al., 2003</xref>). This requires a longer period of deprivation, however, and the shift is smaller and less persistent and is mediated predominantly by strengthening of responses to the non-deprived eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frenkel and Bear, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heimel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hofer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lehmann and LÃ¶wel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we demonstrated that during the critical period extensive OD plasticity can be induced in dLGN and that this requires synaptic inhibition in the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sommeijer et al., 2017</xref>). Multielectrode recordings revealed that OD plasticity in dLGN is strongly reduced in mice in which thalamic synaptic inhibition is inactivated by deleting the gene encoding the GABA receptor alpha1 subunit (<italic>Gabra1</italic>) selectively in the dorsal thalamus (<italic>Gabra1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Ã <italic>Olig3</italic><sup>Cre/+</sup> mice, hereafter referred to as â<italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO miceâ). Interestingly, OD plasticity induced by long-term MD is also reduced in V1 of these mice due to the absence of ipsilateral eye response strengthening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sommeijer et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that during the critical period thalamic plasticity contributes to plasticity in V1. Here, we investigated how dLGN and V1 influence each other during OD plasticity in adulthood. We find that in adult mice lacking thalamic synaptic inhibition OD plasticity is absent in both dLGN and V1. Silencing V1 of adult wild-type (WT) mice does not affect the OD shift in dLGN, showing that it does not depend on feedback from V1. In contrast, we find that during the critical period the OD shift in dLGN partially depends on activity in V1. Together, our findings show that thalamocortical interactions underlying OD plasticity change with age and suggest that the thalamus may be an important source of plasticity in adult learning events that have generally been considered cortical processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visual responses in adult dLGN of WT and <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice</title><p>Previous work showed that during the critical period visual responses of dLGN neurons in <italic>Gabra1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Ã <italic>Olig3</italic><sup>Cre/+</sup> (<italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO) mice were less sustained due to the lack of thalamic synaptic inhibition, while average response strengths and basic receptive field properties seemed surprisingly unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sommeijer et al., 2017</xref>). To assess whether this situation remained similar in adulthood, we measured visual responses in dLGN using a 16-channel silicon probe in anesthetized <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice and <italic>Gabra1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> Ã <italic>Olig3</italic><sup>Cre/-</sup> (WT) siblings. Recordings were performed in the ipsilateral projection zone of dLGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Receptive field sizes and positions were determined by presenting white squares (5Â°) at random positions on a black background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We observed no differences in receptive field sizes in <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As receptive field sizes in dLGN are known to become smaller between eye opening and critical period onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tschetter et al., 2018</xref>), this observation suggests that dLGN develops surprisingly normally in the absence of synaptic inhibition. To investigate this further, we analyzed the numbers, densities, and sizes of inhibitory and cholinergic boutons, which are also known to increase during the same developmental window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bickford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sommeijer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sokhadze et al., 2018</xref>).

In these mice, OD plasticity in V1 is absent, suggesting that it requires thalamic plasticity. We do not find evidence that feedback from V1 affects the thalamic OD shift in adult mice. This differs from the situation during the critical period, in which the OD shift in dLGN is partially inherited from V1.</p><p>In line with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaepel et al., 2017</xref>), we find that in dLGN of adult mice, 7 d of MD causes a strong OD shift. The main substrate of this plasticity in adult dLGN appears to be the retinogeniculate synapse as silencing V1, the other main source of visual input to dLGN, does not affect the OD shift. Recent work has shown that while many relay cells in dLGN receive binocular inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rompani et al., 2017</xref>), synapses from the non-dominant eye are often silent and dominated by NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bauer et al., 2021</xref>). Because silent synapses contribute strongly to OD plasticity in V1, it is interesting to speculate that OD plasticity in dLGN also involves the unsilencing and strengthening of these synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yusifov et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, the OD shift in adult mice involves many (monocular) contralateral eye-selective neurons to become binocular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaepel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In apparent contradiction to our findings and the work by Jaepel et al., a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2023</xref>) did not observe an OD shift in dLGN of adult mice upon 6 d of MD. A possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that Li et al. only included binocular dLGN neurons in the analysis. This approach will exclude the monocular, contralateral-eye selective neurons in non-deprived animals from the analysis, thus decreasing the measured OD shift.</p><p>We find that in adult <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice OD plasticity in dLGN is absent. As we have previously shown that OD plasticity is also absent in dLGN of <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice during the critical period, it is possible that maturation of dLGN is halted in a pre-critical period like state in adult <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice, in analogy to the situation in GAD65-deficient mice in which reduced GABA release interferes with the onset of the critical period of cortical OD plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fagiolini and Hensch, 2000</xref>). However, we did not find evidence for halted thalamic development. Receptive fields of dLGN relay cells become smaller between eye opening and critical period onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tschetter et al., 2018</xref>), and we find that in WT and <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice receptive field sizes are the same. Furthermore, there is a substantial increase in inhibitory and cholinergic boutons during this developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bickford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sokhadze et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sommeijer et al., 2017</xref>), but again, we find that adult WT and <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice are not different in this respect. The primary difference between WT and <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice in adult dLGN thus appears to be the lack of synaptic inhibition. We do not know how this lack of synaptic inhibition in adult dLGN interferes with OD plasticity, but a possible explanation may lie in altered temporal profile of the visual responses it causes, which could interfere with spike timing-dependent plasticity.</p><p>How does inactivation of synaptic inhibition and OD plasticity in dLGN interfere with the OD shift in V1? We believe that it is unlikely that OD plasticity in V1 is deficient due to halted development of V1 in a pre-critical period like state. We have previously shown that brief MD induces an OD shift in V1 of these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sommeijer et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the critical period starts normally in <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice. The previously observed plasticity deficit during the critical period was limited to the second stage of the OD shift in V1, which requires long-term MD. It thus appears that both during the critical period and in adulthood, the late phase of OD plasticity in V1 induced by long-term MD requires thalamic plasticity or inhibition. The most straightforward explanation for the cortical plasticity deficit is that MD-induced changes in dLGN relay cell responses to inputs from the two eyes contribute to the OD shift in V1. Additionally, the strengthening of responses to the non-deprived eye in dLGN neurons may provide their axons with a competitive advantage during OD plasticity in V1, further enhancing the OD shift in V1. Finally, it possible that OD plasticity in V1 is also affected by deficits in spike timing-dependent plasticity due to the more attenuated nature of dLGN responses that we observe in <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice. Together, our results indicate that thalamic inhibition and plasticity play a crucial role in OD plasticity in adult V1, regardless of a possible developmental contribution to the plasticity deficit in dLGN.</p><p>The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bauer et al., 2021</xref> showed that binocularity in mouse dLGN may be lower than suggested by the current study and earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howarth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sommeijer et al., 2017</xref>) that involved multi-electrode recordings in dLGN. Although this difference may be caused by technical limitations of single-unit recordings or calcium imaging, we think it is most likely explained by the fact that studies employing electrophysiological recording in dLGN targeted the frontal ipsilateral projection zone of dLGN, which is its most binocular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bauer et al., 2021</xref>). Recording in this region is essential when studying OD plasticity or binocularity in dLGN, but will strongly bias towards binocularly responding relay cells. When using two-photon imaging of dLGN boutons in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bauer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaepel et al., 2017</xref>), neurons from other parts of dLGN including the monocular shell- and caudal regions are also sampled.</p><p>It is unknown whether adult thalamic OD plasticity also occurs in species in which retinal inputs from the two eyes are organized in more strictly separated layers in dLGN, such as cats or primates. Studies in cats consistently found that upon MD or squint during the critical period the layers responding to the affected eye were thinner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hickey et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963b</xref>) and that the neuronal responses in these layers were slower or weaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eysel et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ikeda and Wright, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sestokas and Lehmkuhle, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963b</xref>). Also in human amblyopes it was noted that dLGN responses to the amblyopic eye were weaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hess et al., 2009</xref>). So far, studies on dLGN plasticity by prolonged visual deprivation in adulthood are missing, though it was noted that in human subjects who suffered from glaucoma, the dLGN layers representing the affected eye were thinner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">YÃ¼cel et al., 2001</xref>). Future research will need to establish whether plasticity in dLGN in humans contributes to amblyopia, and whether it can be enhanced to treat the disorder. That enhancement of thalamic plasticity is in principle possible is shown by experiments in mice, demonstrating that inactivation of the nogo-66 receptor in thalamus allows recovery of reduced acuity in adult mice that were monocularly deprived during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stephany et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite extensive monosynaptic excitatory feedback and bisynaptic inhibitory feedback (through TRN) from V1, we found that feedback does not affect the average strength of response to ipsi- or contralateral eye stimulation and thus neither the measured OD shift in dLGN of adult mice. The absence of V1 on the OD shift in adult mice was also reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaepel et al., 2017</xref>). However in that study, silencing V1 with muscimol reduced the imaged calcium responses in boutons of dLGN axons projecting to V1, suggesting that dLGN neurons became less responsive to inputs from both eyes. A possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy may be that muscimol also has a direct effect on thalamocortical inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamauchi et al., 2000</xref>), which may reduce calcium responses in synaptic boutons of dLGN neurons without actually reducing their spiking activity at the soma.</p><p>Studies involving optogenetic stimulation of layer 6 neurons find that feedback from V1 suppresses dLGN responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denman and Contreras, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirchgessner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olsen et al., 2012</xref>), though this differs per cell and changes with stimulus strength and frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirchgessner et al., 2020</xref>). When V1 feedback is silenced, however, the average strength of dLGN responses is not reduced in most studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denman and Contreras, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howarth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirchgessner et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that broad optogenetic stimulation of layer 6 predominantly recruits inhibitory feedback, while visual stimulation provides either more balanced or more limited excitatory and inhibitory feedback to dLGN. In line with these previous studies, we find that silencing V1 does not significantly alter dLGN responses to either eye in WT mice. If the lack of effect of V1 silencing is due to balanced excitatory and inhibitory feedback, one would expect that in <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice lacking thalamic synaptic inhibition, silencing V1 would cause a reduction of dLGN responses. However, such an effect in <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice was only observed in dLGN responses to the ipsilateral eye and reached significance only in monocularly deprived mice. This suggests that V1 feedback affects dLGN responses to the ipsilateral eye more strongly than those to the contralateral eye. This may be the result of V1 receiving input from the ipsilateral eye through dLGN but also through callosal V1 inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerri et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We found that during the critical period the influence of V1 feedback on the OD shift in dLGN was much stronger. It is possible that inhibitory innervation of dLGN is still weaker during the critical period than in adulthood, causing excitatory feedback from V1 to dominate like in <italic>Gabra1</italic> cKO mice. Additionally, a stronger OD shift occurs in V1 during the critical period, adding to the strength of the cortical feedback representing the ipsilateral eye. Interestingly, an excitotoxic lesion of V1 was found to alter OD in dLGN during development and affect OD plasticity in dLGN at various ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2023</xref>). This suggests that continuous crosstalk between thalamus and cortex during development guides plasticity, possibly optimizing thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections. The continued absence of corticothalamic feedback is likely to have a much larger impact on dLGN plasticity than the acute silencing we performed.</p><p>During the critical period, an experience-dependent phase of retinogeniculate refinement takes place, probably optimizing direction-selective inputs from the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hooks and Chen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rompani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>). This experience-dependent refinement, like OD plasticity in dLGN, also depends on feedback from V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). It is thus possible that refinement of binocular inputs and direction-selective inputs in dLGN are one and the same process.</p><p>We conclude that dLGN retains a high level of plasticity in adulthood and has considerable influence on cortical plasticity. This plasticity may not be restricted to binocular responses, but could also be relevant for other forms of perceptual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). The findings stress that a thalamic involvement needs to be considered in amblyopia and learning disabilities. Additionally, the results may help understanding brain disorders that are thought to involve dysfunctional thalamocortical circuits, ranging from attention-deficit disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wells et al., 2016</xref>) to schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benoit et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pinault, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pratt et al., 2017</xref>). Future experiments focusing on changes in thalamic responses and their interaction with the cortex may provide exciting new insights into how the brain learns.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice used to assess OD plasticity in adulthood were bred from homozygous conditional <italic>Gabra1</italic>-deficient mice (Gabra1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vicini et al., 2001</xref>) crossed with homozygous <italic>Gabra1</italic>-deficient, heterozygous <italic>Olig3</italic><sup>Cre/+</sup> knockin mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vue et al., 2009</xref>) (<italic>Gabra1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Olig3</italic><sup>Cre/+</sup>).

Post fixation time was consistent between compared groups. Sections from dLGN of 50 Âµm were made by using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). Mouse-Î±-GAD67 (1:500, Chemicon, MAB5406) was used to label inhibitory boutons and guinea pig-Î±-VaChT (1:500, SySy 139105) to label cholinergic boutons.

The craniotomies for dLGN (2.0 mm lateral, 2.5 mm posterior from bregma) and V1 (2.95 mm lateral, 0.45 mm anterior from lambda) recording windows were made using a dental drill.

Visual stimuli were projected by a gamma-corrected projector (PLUS U2-X1130 DLP) on a back-projection screen (Macada Innovision, covering a 60 Ã 42 cm area) positioned 17.5 cm in front of the mouse. The visual stimuli were programmed using the MATLAB (MathWorks) scripts package Psychophysics Toolbox 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brainard, 1997</xref>). V1 was first recorded at a depth of approximately 800 Î¼m from the cortical surface. Receptive field position was checked by showing white squares (5Â°) at random positions on a black background. If the receptive field was not within 30<sup>o</sup> from the center, we relocated the electrode and checked again. ODI was measured by presenting alternating white and gray full-screen stimuli to each eye in turn. Each stimulus lasted 3 s. Both white and gray screens were presented with 100 repetitions. When the V1 recording was finished, we relocated the electrode to dLGN at a depth of 2700â3000 Î¼m from bregma. The receptive field and ODI measurement procedures were repeated in dLGN. We then silenced V1 by injecting muscimol (Sigma; 10 mM; ~150 ÂµL per mouse), a selective agonist for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, in V1 and measured the ODI again in dLGN. After recording, we moved the electrode back to V1 to verify that muscimol had silenced V1.</p><p>If mice died before the full recordings were finished, the animal was excluded from analysis. Additionally, if analysis revealed that the response to visual stimulation with closed shutters was more than 1 standard deviation above zero, the mouse was excluded from OD analysis.</p><p>The extracellular signals were amplified and bandpass filtered at 500 Hz to 10 kHz and digitized at 24 kHz using a Tucker-Davis Technologies RX5 Pentusa base station.

The significant on- and off responses were calculated separately. Therefore, for each unit, four responses were tested: contra on, contra off, ipsi on, and ipsi off. For each unit, if the contra on or off response passed the ZETA test (p&lt;0.05), but neither the ipsi on nor the off response did, we categorized this unit as pure contra. The same approach, but then reversely, was used to determine pure ipsilateral eye-responsive units.

However, the adult plasticity is not dependent on feedback from primary visual cortex, an important difference from juveniles.

Through muscimol inhibiting the V1 feedback, thalamic OD plasticity was unaffected in both WT and KO adult mice. However, during the critical period, the thalamic OD plasticity was dependent on V1 feedback in WT mice.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. The experiments were well designed. The authors used both MD and No MD controls with both WT and KO mice. The authors used in vivo SU recording, which is broadly accepted as the major method for evaluating OD plasticity.</p><p>2. The data analysis was solid. The authors used proper statistical tests for non-parametric data set.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. In my previous review I pointed out that an alternative interpretation of the results is that the lack of OD plasticity in adult V1 and dLGN was caused by an early blockade of the development of the inhibitory circuit in dLGN, which causes life-long deficits in the functional connection of dLGN. The best way to rule out this possibility is by using conditional KO mice that dLGN synaptic inhibition was only interfered in adulthood. In response to my concern, the authors replied with a long text of reasoning why the current results are solid enough and the proposed experiment was unnecessary. I agree with most of the explanation that the current conclusion is solid, but I still think that the cKO experiment will be a good supplement to the current study, and if we do see a similar result in the cKO mice, the conclusion that the adult perturbation of thalamic inhibitory circuit interfere with the OD plasticity will be more convincing. However, I do understand that repeating the experiments again in another mouse line will be difficult and time-consuming, so the authors could choose if they want to perform the experiment or not.</p><p>2.

We also indicate which of the example neurons in figure 1D are monocular or binocular according to these criteria. We would like to stress that these percentages are not representative for the level of binocularity in dLGN as a whole, as our recordings were limited to the frontal ipsilateral projection zone of dLGN, which is its most binocular region, and only units with a receptive field within 30o from the center were included in the analysis. We mention this in the discussion on page 23.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 1: Please perform statistical comparison of data presented in Figure 1c by genotype, as in other figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted post-hoc Tukey's tests exclusively when a significant interaction between phenotype and genotype was detected in the two-way ANOVA (as seen in Figs. 2B and 3E). This decision was made because interpreting a significant post-hoc test becomes uncertain when there is no interaction, which is evident in Fig. 1C. In that case, the posthoc Tukey's test yielded a p-value of 0.044 for the difference in RF size between KO NOMD and KO MD, while all other comparisons were not significant (WT NO-MD vs WT MD: P=0.15, WT NO-MD vs KO NO-MD: p=0.99, WT MD vs KO MD: p=0.21). However, since there was no significant interaction between genotype and phenotype, we cannot conclude that there is an effect in KO mice that is absent in WT mice. In Fig. 3B, all posthoc Tukey's tests resulted in P-values greater than 0.05.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 1e: There is no justification for splitting the data into two time epochs before and after 150 msec.

The current work was basically a follow-up of a previous study in juvenile mice, and the results were also very similar to the juvenile results (Sommeijer et al., 2017). One possible interpretation of the results is that the lack of OD plasticity in adult V1 and dLGN was caused by an early blockade of the development of the inhibitory circuit in dLGN, which retains the dLGN in an immature stage till adulthood. The authors indeed claimed in the discussion that the 2-day OD shift is intact in juvenile dLGN and V1 in KO mice, and provided evidence in supplementary figure that GABAergic and cholinergic synapse amount are similar between WT and KO mice. However, the 7-day OD shift is indeed defected in juvenile V1 and dLGN in KO mice (Sommeijer et al., 2017), and it is possible that this early functional deficit didn't induce a structural remodeling in adulthood. To better support the author's claim that the lack of adult V1 OD plasticity is specifically due to reduced dLGN synaptic inhibition, the author should generate conditional KO mice that dLGN synaptic inhibition was only interfered in adulthood.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address this criticism it is important to discuss the plasticity deficits in dLGN and V1 separately.</p><p>Concerning V1 plasticity: We have previously shown that brief MD induces an OD shift inV1 of mice lacking thalamic synaptic inhibition in dLGN. OD plasticity induced by brief MD is a hallmark of critical period plasticity in V1, and it thus seems highly unlikely that critical period onset in V1 is defective or that development of V1 is halted in an immature state that does not support OD plasticity in thalamus-specific GABRA1 deficient mice.</p><p>The observed plasticity deficit during the critical period was limited to the second stage of the OD shift in V1, which requires long-term monocular deprivation. The straightforward explanation for this result and our current findings is that both during the critical period and in adulthood, the second stage of OD plasticity in V1 induced by long-term monocular deprivation requires thalamic plasticity or inhibition. The proposed alternative, that lack of thalamic synaptic inhibition during development results in a possible lack of structural change in V1 that would cause a lifelong deficiency selectively affecting OD plasticity induced by long-term monocular deprivation, requires many more assumptions.</p><p>Concerning dLGN plasticity: The simplest explanation for the observed lack of OD plasticity in dLGN is that it is a direct consequence of the absence of synaptic inhibition in the KO mice. However, an alternative explanation could indeed be that dLGN is kept in an immature (pre-critical period-like) state due to the developmental absence of synaptic inhibition. This situation would be analogous to that in V1 of GAD65 deficient mice (which have reduced GABA release), in which OD plasticity cannot be induced by brief monocular deprivation during the critical period or in adulthood (Fagiolini and Hensch, 2000). Because this deficit can be reversed by treating the mice with benzodiazepines (allosteric modulators of GABA receptors) at any age, it is thought that development of V1 in GAD65 mice is halted in a pre-critical period-like state until inhibition is strengthened. We cannot exclude that something similar occurs in dLGN of mice lacking thalamic synaptic inhibition, although we did not observe any changes in hallmarks of dLGN maturity, such as reduced receptive field size, and increased cholinergic and inhibitory bouton densities.</p><p>However, if the analogy with the developmental deficit in V1 of GAD65 deficient mice is valid, the reduced plasticity is still likely to be a direct consequence of reduced inhibition. In GAD65 deficient mice, long term monocular deprivation during the critical period causes a full OD shift, showing that no additional deficits (besides reduced inhibition) limit OD plasticity in V1 of these mice (Gagiolini and Hensch 2000). And, as already mentioned, increasing inhibition rescues OD plasticity in GAD65 KO mice. Thus, the immature state of V1 in these mice is probably nothing more than a situation in which inhibition tone is too low to support efficient OD plasticity. In dLGN, knocking out GABRA1 at a later age could therefore also create a situation in which inhibition is too low to support thalamic OD plasticity, which is not different from the situation in which the gene is inactivated at birth. Only if lack of synaptic inhibition in thalamus affects another, unknown developmental process that is of importance later in life to support OD plasticity in dLGN, the proposed experiment would result in a different outcome. We are not convinced that this scenario is likely enough to justify repeating most of this study, but now using mice in which GABRA1 is inactivated in dLGN through bilateral AAV-cre injections.</p><p>Independently of the exact cause of the plasticity deficit in dLGN, our results make clear that a cortical plasticity deficit in adulthood can have a thalamic origin, which we believe is an important insight that is highly relevant.</p><p>We have included part of these arguments in the discussion on page 17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors found that in juveniles, dLGN OD shift is dependent on V1 feedback, but not in adults. However, a recent work showed that the effects of V1 silencing on dLGN OD plasticity could differ with various starting points and duration of the V1 silencing and MD (Li et al., 2023). Could the authors provide more details of the MD and V1 silencing for an in-depth discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss some of the findings of the Li et al paper on pages 16 and 20 of the manuscript now.</p></body></sub-article></article>
