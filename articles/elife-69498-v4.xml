proceed in their absence. They form a tight complex through two major binding modes: through STX1’s N-peptide and through STX1’s closed conformation driven by its H<sub>abc</sub>- domain. However, physiological roles of these two reportedly different binding modes in synapses are still controversial. Here we characterized the roles of STX1’s N-peptide, H<sub>abc</sub>-domain, and open conformation with and without N-peptide deletion using our STX1-null mouse model system and exogenous reintroduction of STX1A mutants. We show, on the contrary to the general view, that the H<sub>abc</sub>-domain is absolutely required and N-peptide is dispensable for synaptic transmission. However, STX1A’s N-peptide plays a regulatory role, particularly in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity and the short-term plasticity of vesicular release, whereas STX1’s open conformation governs the vesicle fusogenicity. Strikingly, we also show neurotransmitter release still proceeds when the two interaction modes between STX1A and Munc18-1 are presumably intervened, necessitating a refinement of the conceptualization of STX1A–Munc18-1 interaction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>syntaxin-1</kwd><kwd>Munc18-1</kwd><kwd>N-peptide</kwd><kwd>habc-domain</kwd><kwd>leopen conformation</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB958 TRR186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Reinhart Koselleck Projects</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mutant rescue approach in STX1-null autaptic neurons provides definitive answers and opens up new questions into a controversial matter of syntaxin-1's binding to Munc18-1 through its N-peptide and its function in neurotransmission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion is the fundamental process in synaptic transmission, and it is catalyzed by the merger of plasma and vesicular membranes by the neuronal SNAREs syntaxin-1 (STX1 collectively refers to STX1A and STX1B throughout this study), synaptobrevin-2 (Syb-2), and SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rizo and Sudhof, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Hughson, 2016</xref>). STX1 is the most important neuronal SNARE because not only synaptic transmission grinds to a halt in its absence, but also neurons cannot survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vardar et al., 2016</xref>). Compared to the other SNAREs, it also has a unique structure with its regulatory region composed of a bulky three helical H<sub>abc</sub>-domain and a short N-peptide preceding its SNARE motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandez et al., 1998</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>STX1A’s H<sub>abc</sub>-domain is essential and N-peptide is dispensable for neurotransmitter release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain structure of STX1A.

Munc18-1, which is an assistor of SNARE-mediated vesicular release, is an equally important protein as its absence also leads to inhibition of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>). Two major modes for STX1 binding to Munc18-1 have been defined: one through its N-peptide, the other through its closed conformation driven by the intramolecular interaction between its H<sub>abc</sub>- and SNARE domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Misura et al., 2000</xref>). However, several issues regarding these reportedly different binding modes of STX1 to Munc18-1 are still subjects of dispute.</p><p>It is evident that STX1’s H<sub>abc</sub>-domain is required for proper folding of STX1 and for proper co-recruitment of STX1–Munc18-1 complex to the active zone (AZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meijer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vardar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), yet it has been deemed to play a secondary role in synaptic transmission, to the point that it is dispensable for vesicle fusion <italic>per se</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rathore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meijer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). However, an increasing number of mutations discovered in the H<sub>abc</sub>-domain of STX1B in patients with epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schubert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolking et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vardar et al., 2020</xref>) points to greater importance for this region in neurotransmitter release.</p><p>The physiological significance of Munc18-1 binding to STX1’s N-peptide is less clear, even though the general view leans towards its indispensability for synaptic transmission. Firstly, the STX1 N-peptide does not majorly contribute to its overall affinity for Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhardt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbert et al., 2013</xref>), yet liposome fusion cannot proceed without the N-peptide in reconstitution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rathore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, interfering with STX1-N-peptide–Munc18-1 interaction by mutations either on STX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2016</xref>) or on Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khvotchev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meijer et al., 2012</xref>) in synapses in diverse model systems disclosed either its essentiality or its dispensability. Thus, a collective consensus as to what function the binding of STX1’s highly conserved N-peptide to Munc18-1 plays in synaptic transmission has not been reached.</p><p>So far, the physiological roles of STX1’s N-peptide, H<sub>abc</sub>-domain, and open-closed conformation were not assessed in central synapses completely devoid of STX1. Rather, studies have been conducted either in synapses with normal STX1 expression but mutant Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khvotchev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meijer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shen et al., 2018</xref>) or in synapses with only severely reduced expression of STX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, in vitro studies do not contain the full panel of native synaptic proteins and mostly do not use full-length STX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rathore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we addressed the contribution of different domains of STX1 to neurotransmission using our STX1-null mouse model system and exogenous reintroduction of STX1A mutants either lacking N-peptide or the H<sub>abc</sub>-domain, or STX1 mutants forced into the open conformation (LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation) with or without an N-peptide deletion. We show that the H<sub>abc</sub>-domain is absolutely required for STX1’s stability and/or expression and thus neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, in contrast to the general view, we find that N-peptide is not indispensable for synaptic transmission; however, we propose that STX1’s N-peptide plays a regulatory role, particularly in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of vesicular release and generally in vesicle fusion, which is only unmasked by STX1’s open conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>STX1’s H<sub>abc</sub>-domain is essential and N-peptide is dispensable for neurotransmitter release</title><p>Vesicle fusion does not occur in the absence of STX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vardar et al., 2016</xref>) providing a null background in terms of neurotransmitter release. Thus, we used STX1A constitutive, STX1B conditional knockout (STX1-null) mouse neurons and lentiviral expression of different STX1 mutants in conjunction with <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vardar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vardar et al., 2020</xref>) to study the structure–function relationship of STX1 domains. With the focus on the effects of different Munc18-1 binding modes, we expressed STX1A mutants either with the deletion of the N-peptide (STX1A<sup>∆N2-9</sup>) or the H<sub>abc</sub>-domain (∆29–144; STX1A<sup>∆Habc</sup>) or with the introduction of well-described LE<sub>Open</sub> (L165A, E166A; STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>) mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Firstly, we utilized immunocytochemistry in high-density hippocampal neuronal culture to quantify the exogenous expression of STX1A<sup>∆N2-9</sup>, STX1A<sup>∆Habc</sup>, and STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> at presynaptic compartments as defined by Bassoon-positive puncta and normalized fluorescence signals to the signals caused by expression of STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, all in STX1-null neurons. As expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meijer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), deletion of the N-peptide had no significant effect on STX1A expression compared to STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, whereas STX1A<sup>∆Habc</sup> did not produce a measurable signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Loss of STX1 leads to a severe reduction in Munc18-1 expression, which can be rescued by the expression of either STX1A or STX1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vardar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vardar et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with the expected relative binding states of STX1A<sup>∆N2-9</sup> and STX1A<sup>∆Habc</sup> to Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhardt et al., 2008</xref>), N-peptide deletion did not cause a significant change in Munc18-1 expression at Bassoon positive puncta, whereas the H<sub>abc</sub>-domain deletion was unable to rescue Munc18-1 levels back to WT-like levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>).

Because STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons showed increased EPSCs – albeit not significant – with an average of ~7 nA compared to ~4 nA of STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, EPSCs recorded from STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N</sup> neurons were significantly smaller than that of STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons and remained at ~3 nA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that the small enhancement of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release by the presumed open conformation by LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation was reversed by additional N-peptide deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). On the other hand, the reduction in RRP observed in neurons that express LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation was not reverted back to WT-like levels by the addition of N-peptide deletions, but instead was further exaggerated as the RRP size significantly decreased in STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N</sup> neurons compared to that in STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As a result, increased Pvr, which is the hallmark phenotype of the LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerber et al., 2008</xref>), was reversed back to WT-like levels with only a trend toward a small increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Increased Pvr in STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>-expressing neurons led to decreased PPR when measured at 40 Hz, and N-peptide deletions in STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> reverted PPR back to levels comparable to neurons expressing STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Similarly, mEPSC frequency and mEPSC release rate obtained from the STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N</sup> mutants were significantly smaller than that of STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, putative disruption of the two supposedly main interaction points between STX1A and Munc18-1 – by deleting N-peptide in its entirety in LE<sub>Open</sub> STX1A – ultimately led to neuronal death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicative of independence of STX1’s functions in neurotransmitter release and neuronal maintenance of one another. However, the onset of cell death was postponed by the expression of STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N</sup> mutants compared to that observed in STX1-null neurons as at DIV15 almost all neurons expressing the STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N</sup> mutants were still alive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the electrophysiological recordings are mostly conducted at DIV 13–20, the compromised cell viability is unlikely to account for the reduction in neurotransmission in STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N</sup> mutants compared to that of in STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> mutant.</p><p>A severe reduction in STX1 expression induced by in vitro knock-down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arancillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) or transgenic knock-in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arancillo et al., 2013</xref>) strategies results in a strong impairment in neurotransmitter release. Based upon that, we argued that the reduction of release parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–I</xref>) of STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> by additional N-peptide deletions may be due to decreased expression of STX1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we down-titrated the viral load from 1× (~400 × 10<sup>3</sup> viral particles per 35 mm well) to 1/12× for STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and to 1/3× and 1/6× for STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> to reach expression of STX1A at a level comparable to that in STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). As our viral constructs include NLS-GFP before the P2A sequence followed by STX1A, nuclear GFP showed a decrease when the amount of virus was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Immunofluorescent labeling in autaptic neurons revealed that reducing the viral amount was effective in reducing expression levels of either STX1A<sup>WT</sup> or STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> to the levels comparable to that of STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup>. However, reducing the exogenous expression level of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> or STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> down to the level of STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> did not cause a difference in their neurotransmitter release properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We have previously reported that STX1 level becomes a rate-liming factor in neurotransmission when endogenous STX1B expression is knocked-down by shRNA to a level below 20% on an STX1A-null background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arancillo et al., 2013</xref>). Because reducing the lentiviral exogenous expression of STX1A down to ~20% of the initial experimental conditions did not show any alterations in synaptic release properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and thus not reconcile with our previous hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arancillo et al., 2013</xref>), we compared the endogenous STX1A expression in <italic>STX1A</italic><sup>+/+</sup>; <italic>STX1B</italic><sup>+/+</sup> neurons to the exogenous expression level in STX1-null neurons transduced with 1× STX1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found that transduction of STX1-null neurons with STX1A using 1× viral volume leads to approximately threefold higher STX1A exogenous expression compared to that of WT neurons. Thus, using 1/12th of the initial viral volume for STX1A transduction leads to an expression level of ~60% compared to the endogenous level, suggesting that indeed one copy of either <italic>STX1A</italic> or <italic>STX1B</italic> is enough to drive normal synaptic transmission while being insufficient to rescue Munc18-1 levels back to the WT-like levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, please note that our model system does not include STX1B expression and therefore exogenous expression of STX1A in STX1-null neurons by 1× viral volume does not fall within overexpression studies. In summary, our STX1A down-titration experiments show that the reduction in neurotransmitter release properties observed in STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> neurons compared to that of STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons does not stem from lower copy number of STX1A but rather from a functional deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>It is known that Munc18-1 also functions upstream of the vesicle docking step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toonen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gulyas-Kovacs et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the state of docked vesicles in neurons that express either STX1A<sup>∆N2-28</sup>, STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>, or STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> using HPF-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Strikingly, the neurons in which two Munc18-1 binding modes were modulated by the STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> mutation showed docked vesicles were reduced to ~50% of those in STX1A<sup>WT</sup> synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). On the other hand, neither LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation nor N-peptide deletion alone did not influence vesicle docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, vesicle distribution analysis revealed an accumulation of vesicles at 5 nm distance from AZ in STX1A<sup>∆N2-28</sup> neurons but a reduction in STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>), whereas STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons did not show a major alteration in their vesicle distribution within 100 nm from AZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>‘Opening’ of STX1A in combination with the deletion of its entire N-terminal stretch reduces the number of docked synaptic vesicles (Svs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example high-pressure freezing fixation combined with electron microscopy (HPF-EM) images of nerve terminals from high-density cultures of STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, STX1A<sup>∆N2-28</sup>, STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>, and STX1A<sup>LEOpen + ∆N2-28</sup> Neurons.

In that scenario, number of docked vesicles, which is morphologically assessed by evaluating the existing synapses in mass culture, would not be affected and thus lead to differential outcomes for vesicle docking and vesicle fusion in neurons destined to death. To test this, we analyzed the synapse number in autaptic neurons for which we used the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and found no difference neither in the synapse number nor in the synapse area among STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>, and STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> neurons as determined by VGlut1-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We also have reported that the vesicle priming is more prone to impairments by mutations in the vesicle release machinery than is vesicle docking, which suggests a separation or a different cooperativity between these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zarebidaki et al., 2020</xref>). In this light, we plotted the number of docked SVs versus the RRP size and observed that the RRP is also more susceptible to a reduction than is vesicle docking for the STX1A–Munc18-1 binding mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>STX1’s N-peptide has a modulatory function in short-term plasticity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of synaptic transmission</title><p>So far, our analysis has shown that STX1’s N-peptide is not indispensable for neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), but plays a modulatory role in protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and, when STX1’s open conformation is facilitated by LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation, in vesicle fusion and Pvr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To elucidate the modulation of neurotransmitter release by STX1’s N-peptide, we took a closer look at Pvr and its effect on STP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Even though the neurons expressing any STX1A<sup>∆N</sup> mutants showed only a trend towards decreased Pvr compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), their STP behavior in response to 50 stimuli at 10 Hz differed greatly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Because all the STX1A<sup>∆N</sup> neurons showed an altered behavior in the late phase of STP, we hypothesized that these neurons might keep up better with the high-frequency stimulus than STX1A<sup>WT</sup> does because of an increase in newly arrived SVs or replenishment of the RRP. To study the efficacy of replenishment of the primed vesicles, we stimulated the neurons with a double pulse of 500 mM sucrose solution with a time interval of 2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) as the replenishment of the whole pool of the primed vesicles after sucrose depletion takes at least 10 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stevens and Tsujimoto, 1995</xref>). STX1A<sup>∆N2-9</sup> showed no effect on the fraction of the RRP recovered after full depletion when compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). On the other hand, STX1A<sup>∆N2-19</sup> and STX1A<sup>∆N2-19</sup> slightly decreased the vesicle replenishment rate by ~10%, which is contrary to our initial expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This suggests that an increased replenishment rate does not account for the decreased depression in the STP curves of STX1A<sup>∆N</sup> mutants.</p><p>Pvr and the degree of STP depend on both vesicle fusogenicity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the vesicular release, thus we scrutinized the effects of N-peptide deletions on these variables. Calculating the RRP fraction released in response to a sub-saturating, 250 mM sucrose solution application revealed no difference between STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and STX1A<sup>∆N</sup> neurons, suggesting no decrease in SV fusogenicity with these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Interestingly, when we generated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dose–response curves by evoking AP driven EPSCs in the presence of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing extracellular solutions, we observed a slightly lowered apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity in the STX1A<sup>∆N2-19</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and STX1A<sup>∆N2-28</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) when compared to STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons. On the other hand, STX1A<sup>∆N2-9</sup> neurons showed a normal pattern of increase in EPSCs in relation to increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We also measured the PPR, which is inversely related to Pvr, at different extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations and determined that STX1A<sup>∆N2-28</sup> had a significantly higher PPR at 0.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This was also evident in STP behavior elicited by 5 AP stimulation at 40 Hz as STX1A<sup>∆N2-28</sup> neurons showed a greater facilitation at 0.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whereas increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> to 2 mM was not sufficient to drive the STP behavior of STX1A<sup>∆N2-28</sup> neurons towards STX1A<sup>WT</sup>-like pattern, at the highest [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> tested all the groups STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, STX1A<sup>∆N2-9</sup>, and STX1A<sup>∆N2-28</sup> showed a similar level of depression upon 40 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>It is well documented that the presumed facilitation of opening of STX1 and thus the increase in Pvr by LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation enhances short-term depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerber et al., 2008</xref>). Deletion of N-peptide at any length in STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> did not change the degree of the depression in the late phase of the high-frequency stimulus; however, all the deletions decreased the slope of the depression in the initial phase compared to that of STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Whereas the EPSCs recorded from STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons by 10 Hz stimulation tended to be initially larger, they declined further compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). On the other hand, STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> mutants remained to produce smaller EPSCs throughout the HFS compared to those of both STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). The recovery of the RRP after sucrose depletion was enhanced by the open conformation of STX1A but reverted back to the WT-like levels by the expression of STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Strikingly, the increase in fusogenicity was not influenced by the N-peptide deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that those mutants also did not change LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation-driven enhancement of short-term depression at the late phase of the HFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). On the other hand, N-peptide deletions imposed a right-shift in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dose–response curves on the STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>, which markedly increased the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity, making them approach again WT-like levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with increased fusogenicity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity, STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons always showed a greatly reduced PPR when compared to STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons in all extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). However, at low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> neurons exhibited a PPR comparable to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons, but at high Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations it was comparable to that of STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Contrary to STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons, STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons showed no facilitation at 0.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> and a greater depression at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> as well as at 10 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. Whereas STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> showed a similar pattern of facilitation at 0.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> to STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, at higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> their short-term depression approached the level of STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This and the observation that N-peptide deletion leads to an altered behavior only in the initial phase of the 10 Hz stimuli – when STX1A’s open conformation is facilitated – is consistent with the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) but unaltered fusogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) of the vesicles.</p><p>Decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity can arise from either reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx as a result of alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel localization or gating, or from a disturbance in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-secretion coupling.

This led us to interpret Munc18-1’s binding to STX1 and its ultimate effect on SNARE complex formation as a two-step process, which is a convolution of the affinity and the efficacy of this interaction. Consistently, it has been thought that LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation exposes the SNARE domain of STX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>), whereas absence of N-peptide tightens its Munc18-1-driven closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khvotchev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbert et al., 2013</xref>) potentially resulting in opposing effects in SNARE complex formation. Indeed, our observation that N-peptide deletion reverses the STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>-dependent facilitation of neurotransmitter release parameters, which is generally attributed to its promotion of SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerber et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2014</xref>), hints at a reduction in the number of SNARE complexes formed by STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>. However, N-peptide likely plays only a minor role in determining the equilibrium of open-closed conformations of STX1<sup>WT</sup> in a membranous environment when STX1’s TMR is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawidowski and Cafiso, 2013</xref>), and thus the modulation of neurotransmitter release by the N-peptide cannot be observed in STX1<sup>WT</sup> but can be only unmasked by the introduction of LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation.</p><p>Importantly, Munc18-1 does not bind only to STX1, but it is also thought to bind to the SNARE complex formed by STX1, SNAP-25, and Syb-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zilly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dulubova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhardt et al., 2008</xref>) to provide a template as a scaffold together with Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Given that the SNARE complex formation is a dynamic process, which involves not only the assistance but also the protection by Munc18-1 and Munc13 against NSF-dependent dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2017</xref>), such a two-step process is also applicable for the back- and forward shift in the number of SNARE complexes. Furthermore, one of Munc13’s primary functions is priming the vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>) in addition to templating proper SNARE complex formation for which it assists opening of Munc18-1-bound STX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In this context, it has been shown that STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> recovers neurotransmitter release in Munc13-1/2-deficient mouse or worm neurons albeit only minimally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tien et al., 2020</xref>), while it impairs Munc13’s proper assistance of parallel SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) and further reduces the locomotor activity and neurotransmitter release in Munc18-1-deficient worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tien et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that the stability of the SNARE complex is ensured by Munc18-1’s and Munc13’s efficient binding to STX1, which may account for the additive effects of N-peptide deletion and LE<sub>Open</sub> conformation on the size of RRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). However, this regulation process must be upstream of the vesicle priming as the fusogenicity of the primed vesicles was predominantly dictated by the LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>STX1A’s N-peptide regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of SVs and short-term plasticity, whereas LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation dictates the SV fusogenicity</title><p>How the SVs become more fusogenic in the presence of STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> is not known, though one simple explanation is its propensity to produce reactive SNARE complexes with a higher number and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerber et al., 2008</xref>). This hypothesis is appealing as it can also account for the faster recovery of the SVs to the RRP by LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Surprisingly, however, addition of N-peptide deletions not only in STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> but also in STX1A<sup>WT</sup> exclusively slowed down the RRP replenishment without an effect on the SV fusogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), uncoupling the regulation of these two processes. We cannot explain this phenomenon based on our data but would like to draw attention to that there are still unsolved questions regarding the regulation of SV fusogenicity. In fact, it is thought that at the state of primed and even docked vesicles the SNAREs are zippered up to hydrophobic layer +4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sorensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vardar et al., 2016</xref>) and thus include already ‘opened’ STX1. Therefore, the increase in SV fusogenicity by STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>- and STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N</sup>-mutants might involve yet an unknown mechanism, which does not employ STX1’s N-peptide.</p><p>It is remarkable that the deletion of the N-peptide of 19 or 28 aa reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the vesicular release both in default and LE<sub>Open</sub> STX1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the vesicular release is estimated by the assessment of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dose–response, which is a convoluted measurement of SV fusogenicity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel–SV distance coupling. Accordingly, the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of vesicular release by LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation stems partly from the increased fusogenicity of SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, the rightward shift in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dose–response curve caused by N-peptide deletions was not accompanied by an altered fusogenicity of SVs neither on default nor on LE<sub>Open</sub> background of STX1A. Thus, it is conceivable that the N-peptide deletions might have led to disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel–SV coupling, without effecting the fusogenicity of the vesicles. Consistently, N-peptide deletions in the LE<sub>Open</sub> conformation, which do not alter LE<sub>Open</sub>-dependent increase in vesicle fusogenicity, lead to an increase in PPR compared to that of LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation alone only at low external Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations. This suggests that when the vesicles are positioned at a greater distance to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels in the absence of N-peptide, the enhancement of fusogenicity governed by the opening of STX1A by LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation remains insufficient to increase the Pvr at low Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations. At higher Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration, on the other hand, the wider distance of the vesicles to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels becomes negligible and the LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation-dependent enhancement of vesicle fusogenicity dominates the Pvr and thus reduces PPR in the case of STX1A<sup>LEOpen+ΔΝ</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) as speculatively illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. This can also explain why the N-peptide deletions on STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> background slow down depression during the initial phase of the 10 Hz stimuli, while they affect the STP only at the late phase on STX1A<sup>WT</sup> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, our data reveal a new function of STX1 in synaptic transmission in that it controls global Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry into the presynapse as STX1 deficiency and LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation led to a decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This can be explained either by alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel gating and/or abundance. In fact, a direct interaction between STX1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachnoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheng et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wiser et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sajman et al., 2017</xref>) has been proposed to contribute to the overall Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the vesicular release machinery, where STX1 deemed an inhibitory role in baseline activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trus et al., 2001</xref>). However, we observe a general decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry also for higher numbers of AP elicited, not only after single AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This is evocative of the phenotype of loss of RIMs, which are tethering factors of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels to the AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brockmann et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is likely that decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx into the presynapse might be due to reduced number of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels at AZ in STX1-deficient neurons rather than due to an altered Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel gating.</p><p>In fact, it is known that STX1 clusters together with Munc18-1 and SNAP25 also outside of AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pertsinidis et al., 2013</xref>) and that it interacts with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) SNARE Sec22 at the ER-plasma membrane contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petkovic et al., 2014</xref>), both having potential functions in constitutive intracellular trafficking and regulation of the membrane lipid composition. In this regard, an impairment in general intracellular trafficking and/or membrane lipid composition as a result of loss of STX1, its presumed conformational change, and/or its deficient Munc18-1 binding imposed by LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation might potentially lead to a decreased number of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels. However, just as there is not always a direct correlation between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel abundance and the level of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry, there is not always a relationship between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry and the level of EPSC and Pvr. An example for that is the overexpression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel subunit α2δ also leading to overexpression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels in the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>). In these synapses, surprisingly however, a reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx has been observed together with an increase both in EPSC and Pvr – similar to the phenotype of STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that the increased SV fusogenicity might overcome the effect of low Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry into the synapse and still lead to an increased EPSC and Pvr when the SVs are localized at a proper distance to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels in STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Plausibly, on the other hand, if increased SV fusogenicity is accompanied by a greater SV-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel distance as thought for the case of STX1A<sup>LEOpen + ΔΝ</sup> neurons, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity and the amplitude of EPSCs might approach back to the WT-like levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Together, our data suggest that even though deletion of N-peptide potentially reduces the number of reactive SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhardt et al., 2008</xref>), which could explain the slower rate of the recovery of the RRP in neurons that express STX1A<sup>∆N2-19</sup> or STX1A<sup>∆N2-28</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the level of this reduction appears to be not enough to decrease the baseline neurotransmitter release in STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) but only in STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The increase in the apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the vesicular release in STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons has also been attributed to the increased number of SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2014</xref>), yet the increased fusogenicity of the SVs in those neurons beclouds this hypothesis. Whether or not reduced number of SNARE complexes can lead to the robust effect of N-peptide deletions on STP is not clear, but likely, as the longer N-peptide deletions showed a trend towards smaller absolute values of EPSCs throughout the high-frequency stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since N-peptide mutations do not significantly change the initial PPR, the effect during 10 Hz trains can also be explained by an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel–vesicle distance coupling and an accumulation of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the train. Therefore, whether the facilitation–hindrance of SNARE complex formation leads to changes in STP and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of vesicular release should be investigated in depth. However, STX1A<sup>ΔΝ2-9</sup> neurons did not show any difference in the initial EPSCs but only in the latter phase of STP by up to ~30% larger EPSCs compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and also no difference in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) of the vesicular release. This suggests that the regulation of STP might be an important function of STX1A’s N-peptide aa 2–9 independent of Munc18-1 because Munc18-1 mutants that cannot bind to the STX1’s N-peptide do not manifest any regulatory effect on STP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meijer et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal maintenance and generation of mouse lines</title><p>All procedures for animal maintenance and experiments were in accordance with the regulations of and approved by the animal welfare committee of Charité-Universitätsmedizin and the Berlin state government Agency for Health and Social Services under license number T0220/09.

Images were acquired using a 490 nm LED system (pE2; CoolLED) at a 5 Hz sampling rate with 25 ms of exposure time. The acquired images were analyzed offline using ImageJ (National Institute of Health), Axograph X (Axograph), and Prism 8 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Sample size estimation was done as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herman et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>High-pressure freezing and electron microscopy</title><p>The high-density cultured hippocampal neurons were co-transduced with <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase and with either STX1 WT or mutants at DIV 2–3 and high-pressure fixed under a pressure of 2100 bar in standard extracellular recording solution using an HPM 100 Leica or ICE Leica high-pressure freezer at DIV 14–16. Samples were then transferred into cryovials containing 1% glutaraldehyde, 1% osmium tetroxide, 1% ddH<sub>2</sub>0 (Millipore) in anhydrous acetone and processed in an AFS2 automated freeze-substitution device (Leica) followed by a temperature ramp from −90°C for 5 hr, from −90°C to −50°C (8°C/hr), from −50°C to −20°C (6°C/hr), for 12 hr at −20°C, from −20 to +20°C (10°C/hr). After the freeze-substitution step, samples were embedded in epoxy epon 812 (EMS). Finally, samples were placed into capsules filled with pure epoxy epon 812 and further polymerized for 48 hr at 60°C. Randomly selected areas of ~250 μm<sup>2</sup> containing neurons were ultracut into 40 nm thick slices using an Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica) and collected on 0.5% formvar-coated 200-mesh copper grids (EMS). Those sections were contrasted with 0.1% uranyl acetate for 1 hr and lead citrate (0.15 lead citrate, 0.12 m sodium citrate in ddH<sub>2</sub>O). Images were collected blindly in an FEI Tecnai G20 electron microscope operating at 200 keV and digital images taken with a Veleta 2k × 2k CCD camera (Olympus). Synapses were analyzed blindly using an analysis program developed for ImageJ and MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). AZs were defined as the membrane stretch directly opposite to the postsynaptic density, and docked vesicles were defined as those in direct contact with the plasma membrane. SV distribution was analyzed by calculating the shortest distance of each vesicle to the AZ membrane and binned with 5 nm. Sample size estimation was done as published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data in bar graphs present single observations (points) and means ± standard error of the mean (SEM; bars). Data in x–y plots present means ± SEM. All data were tested for normality with Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Data from two groups with normal or nonparametric distribution were subjected to Student’s two-tailed t-test or Mann–Whitney nonparametric test, respectively. Data from more than two groups were subjected to Kruskal–Wallis followed by Dunn’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test when at least one group showed a nonparametric distribution. For data in which all the groups showed a parametric distribution, one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test was applied. For STP measurements, two-way ANOVA test was used. All the tests were run with GraphPad Prism 8.3, and all the statistical data are summarized in the corresponding source data tables.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>None</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>none</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures for animal maintenance and experiments were in accordance with the regulations of and approved by the animal welfare committee of Charité-Universitätsmedizin and the Berlin state government Agency for Health and Social Services under license number T0220/09.

analysis of the different roles of the N-terminal domains and different Munc18 binding modes of Syntaxin-1. The complexity of the interaction between Munc18 and syntaxin and their isoforms in other species has led to a vexing complexity involving different interactions that appear to range from essential to dispensable in different experiments and contexts. This study compares many aspects of these interactions in the same neuronal system. The paper confirms previous observations, but also arrives at new conclusions. The authors show that the Habc-domain is essential for syntaxin's role in neurotransmitter release, while the N-peptide has a modulatory role. Disrupting both binding modes of Syntaxin-1 with M18 leads to strongly reduced levels of both proteins while neurotransmitter release can still occur.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Reexamination of N-terminal domains of Syntaxin-1 in vesicle fusion from central murine synapses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors attempt to address the reduced protein expression by titrating down WT levels by using only 1/12 of the viral load. Strikingly, reducing WT STX1A levels by almost 6-fold had no effect on synaptic transmission. This raises important questions. At which point does STX1A become rate-limiting? And how do these protein levels compare to endogenous STXA levels? The authors should show the expression levels of their mutants relative to endogenous STX levels. Furthermore, a previous paper from the same group concluded that titrating Synatxin1 did impact synaptic transmission (Arancillo et al., J Neurosci 2013). The authors should discuss how their expression levels and findings compare to the findings in their previous paper.</p><p>2. While the effect of the N-peptide on most release parameters is absent/small, a robust effect was observed on short-term plasticity: up to70% larger EPSC's at the end of a 10Hz train in N-peptide mutants. This substantial effect is undervalued by the authors. Regulation of STP could be an important function of this domain. The authors mention this effect only briefly in the abstract, but should discuss this biological relevance in the Discussion. Second, typical traces of trains in Figure 6 should be of higher resolution and zoomed in more to critically evaluate. For instance, the standing (asynchronous) current that usually develops during 10Hz trains in autapses seems to be absent. Why is this the case? Since N-peptide mutations do not change PPR, the most logical explanation of the effect during 10Hz trains is a difference in the accumulation of global Ca during the train. This is plausible given the (disputed) interaction of syntaxin with calcium channels. Ideally, the experiments should be repeated +/- EGTA-AM. In this same experiment, the author can examine the potential effect on Ca-dependent replenishment or increase in fusogenicity (measuring RRP size and fusogenicity before and after 10Hz trains). At the minimum, the observed effect should be more pointed out more clearly in the text.</p><p>3. The main hypothesis put forward for reduced Ca-sensitivity and impaired RRP recovery in N-peptide mutants is an impairment in SNARE complex formation. How does this reconcile with up to 70% larger EPSC's during 10 Hz trains? Please comment and discuss.</p><p>4. The data in figure 6 on the interaction between the two M18 binding modes of Stx1 are intriguing. However, different effects of N-peptide mutations in the WT and LE_Open background are difficult to reconcile, and not further addressed in the discussion. It is therefore difficult to interpret these data in the light of the N-peptide function. Please comment and discuss.</p><p>5. In Figure 6F the N-peptide mutations in Stx1 LE_Open slow down depression during the first few stimulations, but have no effect on STP at the end of the train. This is opposite from the effect found at the WT background, where these mutations affect STP at the end of the train (Figure 6A). How these seemingly different results can be reconciled should be addressed in the discussion.</p><p>6. Given the twofold higher EPSC amplitude and Pvr for Stx1 LE_Open, this mutant will most likely end up with similar EPSC amplitudes at the end of the train as for the WT. However, the LE_Open Δ_N mutants will have lower EPSC amplitudes at the end of the train. This could lead to different conclusions about the role of the N-peptide, especially when combined with similar experiments with these mutants as suggested in point 2.</p><p>7. It is interesting to see in Figure 6J that, for low external Ca, N-peptide mutations on a LE_open background rescue the paired-pulse ratio to WT levels, while for increasing external Ca levels this gradually reverts to the LE_open phenotype. This should be addressed in the discussion in the light of the different Ca sensitivities and fusogenicities for the different experimental groups.</p><p>8. If reduced Ca-influx explains reduced Ca affinity in LE_open mutant (Figure 6I), how does this reconcile with the LE_open-deltaN mutant, which has significant less Ca influx compared to WT (Figure 7E), but no significant difference in Ca sensitivity? Some explanation should be added to the Discussion.</p><p>9. The authors' interpretation that the effect of calcium influx relates to expression levels and survivability is somewhat challenged by the fact that the LE mutant has the strongest effect on calcium influx, while it is by far not the mutant with the lowest expression levels, nor is it experiencing a decrease in survivability. Please comment and discuss.</p><p>10. Throughout the manuscript, the authors quantify cell numbers as a measure of survival. Some mutations, for example syntaxin knockout and the DeltaHabc mutant rescue, strongly affect cell survival. For the interpretation of the synaptic physiology, a more meaningful parameter would be synapse numbers, especially for evaluating the relationship between docking (measured per synapse profile) and sucrose RRP (measured per cell). It appears possible, if not likely, that synapses are lost before cells die, and in this case correlating RRP and docking may be strongly confounded. The authors may have the data in mass cultures already, and it should be possible to quantify synapse numbers (for example via Bassoon puncta densities) in these existing data. This should be accompanied by a discussion of the systems used (mass cultures for morphology and autaptic cultures for electrophysiology). If synapse numbers are changed, the RRP charge and # of docked vesicles should not be directly correlated (as done in Figure 5E), because RRP charge strongly depends on synapse numbers, while the number of docked vesicles per synapse does not. The discussion should be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>11. The authors present the double mutation of opening syntaxin (LE mutant) and N-peptide deletion as &quot;interruption of both Munc18-1 binding modes&quot; (caption line 185, figure captions Figures 4 and 5). While we appreciate where the terminology for considering this a &quot;null for Munc18 binding&quot; comes from, it would be much better to stay closer to the experiments in the data presentation and use wording like &quot;opening of syntaxin combined with N-peptide deletion&quot; instead. As the authors discuss, Munc18-syntaxin interactions are complex, and most data suggest that Munc18 also binds to SNARE complexes (and open syntaxin) while they are being assembled. Opening syntaxin and deleting the N-peptide does unlikely fully abolish Munc18 binding, but biases binding of syntaxin to Munc18 alone towards binding of Munc18 to syntaxin as it is being incorporated into SNARE complexes. The authors should do justice to this point in figure captions, and should discuss it as such.</p><p>12. The effect of the LE mutant of syntaxin has been characterized by several biophysical methods that show that it shifts the conformational equilibrium towards the open state, but it still adopts the closed state upon Munc18 binding as observed by SAXS (Colbert et al. 2013) and single molecule FRET (Wang et al., EMBO J. 36, 816-, 2017). Moreover, the LE mutant only partially compensates for deletion of Munc13, i.e., the rescue is rather limited as observed in autaptic neuronal cultures and by single molecule FRET experiments (Lai et al., Neuron 95, 591-, 2017). Moreover, the results in Wang et al., 2017 suggest that the LE mutant interferes with proper Munc13 function (via its interactions with syntaxin), which may be related to the observed phenotypes of this mutant. Please discuss the experiments presented here in the context of these biophysical findings.<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study Vardar et al., use patch-clamp electrophysiology in autaptic neurons to provide a systematic analysis of the different roles of the N-terminal domains and different Munc18 binding modes of Syntaxin-1. The complexity of the interaction between Munc18 and Syntaxin has led to a long-standing controversy about the importance of certain interactions, ranging from absolutely essential to dispensable. This study is the first to compare all aspects in a side-by-side comparison in the same, native model system. The paper confirms previous observations but also arrives at new conclusions. The authors show that the Habc-domain is essential for Stx1's role in neurotransmitter release, while the N-peptide has a minor modulatory role. Disrupting both binding modes of Stx1 with M18 leads to strongly reduced levels of both proteins while neurotransmitter release can still occur.</p><p>This manuscript provides the most comprehensive study to date on the effects of mutant Syntaxin variants to assess their effects on synaptic transmission, -efficacy, and a lot of other synaptic determinants. The manuscript contains an extensive set of experiments of high-quality, which are clearly described and presented in the text and figures. All conclusions are justified and built on solid evidence. The main limitations of the current study are the strongly reduced expression levels of some mutants, an issue the authors also raise, which limit some of the interpretations, and the effects of N-peptide mutants which are underdeveloped. However, taken together, this study is of great interest to the synapse field and has all the ingredients to provide the final verdict on some controversial issues.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1.

And how do these protein levels compare to endogenous STXA levels? The authors should show the expression levels of their mutants relative to endogenous STX levels.

It probes the major molecular roles of syntaxin through mutational analyses of three of its key features: the N-terminal peptide interaction with Munc18 (using short deletions), the role of the Habc domain (using a larger deletion), and the role of a confirmational switch (using the established LE open mutation). It probes the synaptic functions of these features either on their own or in combination with one another in rescue experiments in cultured neurons of syntaxin-1A and 1B null mutants, assessing synaptic transmission and its constituents, synaptic ultrastructure and neuronal survival.</p><p>The main finding is that the N-terminal peptide interaction with Munc18 is dispensable, and its role is only revealed when combined with the LE open mutation. Another finding is that syntaxin function is quite resilient, as even combining mutations (for example LE open and N-peptide deletion) does not fully disrupt synaptic transmission. In general, the finding that the N-peptide deletion is dispensable is important as it differs from previous studies that have used different manipulations. A key strength is the systematic comparison of the various mutants alone and in combination upon syntaxin-1 ablation and the testing of a series of different N-terminal deletions. The authors provide a balanced discussion of their and previous results, how they relate to one another, and how discrepancies could be reconciled.</p><p>Weaknesses in the current methodology include that the manuscript does not distinguish well between effects on cell health, effects on synapse numbers, and effects on synaptic properties. Furthermore, some of the data presentation relies on assumptions in the field rather than directly relating to the experimental approach. For example, the data describing the LE mutant and the N-peptide deletion assume that these mutations together essentially reveal a &quot;complete loss-of-Munc18-binding&quot; phenotype, but this may not necessarily be that case.<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Vardar et al., investigated the role of different syntaxin I (STX1) domains in neurotransmitter release using a STX1-null mouse model system and exogenous reintroduction of STX1A mutants, the latter lacking either the N-peptide or the Habc domain of STX I. In addition, the STX1 mutant, which is present in the ‚open' conformation (LE open mutant) was examined with or without deletion of the N-peptide. The results show that the Habc domain is absolutely necessary for the stability or expression of STX1 and thus for neurotransmitter release. Moreover, it became clear, contrary to earlier work, that the N-peptide is dispensable for synaptic transmission, but assumes a regulatory role in controlling ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of vesicular release and generally in vesicle fusion when syntaxin is in the 'open' conformation. The manuscript provides a very comprehensive structure-function analysis using a wide variety of high-resolution techniques (e.g. HPF-EM, synaptic ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging). Remarkably, perturbation of the STXI-Munc18 interaction by interfering with the canonical interaction modes has surprisingly little effect on synaptic transmission. Several results in this present manuscript correct observations of previous studies that used less quantitative and systematic approaches in the attempt to unravel the molecular mechanisms of syntaxin-Munc18 interaction in ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven exocytosis.</p><p>In general, the combined set of data is particularly valuable and allows new insights into the complexity of neuronal transmission and its underlying components.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69498.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1.

Therefore, we have reduced the number of viral particles used for 35 mm well from ~400.000 (1X) to ~35.000 for STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and to ~ 65.000 for STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> and successfully reached the levels of STX1A<sup>LEOpen + ΔΝ2-28</sup>. At this point, we did not observe any influence of expression levels on the release parameters neither by using STX1A<sup>WT</sup> nor STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>. Therefore, we suggested that the reduction in the release parameters due to the N-peptide deletions on STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> background is not due to its relatively lower expression levels but rather due to a functional deficit.</p><p>However, we thank to the reviewers for their suggestion to compare the endogenous STX1A levels to the exogenous STX1A levels used in this study to solve a possible discrepancy between this study and our previous study (Arancillo et al., 2013). It is important to note that our mouse line has the genotype of STX1B<sup>FL/FL</sup>; STX1A<sup>-/-</sup>. We do not currently hold a mouse line with the genotype of STX1B<sup>FL/FL</sup>; STX1A<sup>+/-</sup> for breeding. Therefore, we cannot compare the endogenous and exogenous expression levels of STX1A using littermates. Because of that, we analyzed the endogenous STX1A levels in WT neurons in comparison to the lentiviral expression obtained with the help of 1X volume of lentiviral particles encoding STX1A in STX1-null neurons. However, we cultured both WT and the transgenic neurons on the same batch of astrocyte cultures and fixed them with PFA at the same DIV. We have observed that 1X volume of viral particles led to ~3 fold higher expression of STX1A compared to the endogenous levels (Figure 4 – Supplement 3). This shows that even the lowest expressing construct STX1A<sup>LEOpen+ΔN2-28</sup> reaches an expression level of ~60% of endogenous STX1A<sup>WT</sup>. This also suggests that with our down-titration experiment we have reached again 60% of endogenous levels. We have explained and discussed our new data in relation to our previous study (Arancillo et al., 2013) in lines 236-252.</p><p>It should be noted that the WT neurons also express STX1B. It is fair to interpret our data as such that our experiments do not fall within over expression studies, because the neurons used in this study do not contain STX1B. Therefore, a ~3 fold higher expression of STX1A in the absence of STX1B constitutes a total level of STX1 comparable to that in WT neurons. However, because the STX1A<sup>LEOpen+ΔN2-28</sup> do show a 60% expression of STX1A, we have removed our statement that ‘neurotransmitter release precedes normal even when both STX1A and Munc18-1 show a severely low expression’. Now, we have included our new interpretation that our down-titration experiments are insufficient to reach the rate-limiting level as determined by our previous study and that 60% of STX1A in the absence of STX1B is inadequate to rescue Munc18-1 levels (lines 242-249).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Now, we have discussed this issue also in our discussion with a greater emphasis (lines 520-538).</p><p>Secondly, we have now included zoomed-in example traces of absolute EPSCs for the first and last 5 stimuli for all the groups (Figure 6 – Supplement 2) for a better inspection, as suggested by the reviewers. It can also be observed in those zoomed-in traces that 10 Hz stimulation of autaptic neurons is not adequate for production of a measurable standing current. Usually, the currents elicited by 1 AP reach back the baseline in less than 100 ms, which is the time-interval for 10 Hz stimulation. Additionally, the decay-time of the EPSC affects the time required for the current to be back at baseline level and in autaptic neurons the bigger EPSCs can lead to longer decay-times and thus can contribute to the standing current (in-house information based on our previous experiments using low concentration of AMPA antagonists to produce smaller EPSCs). A reason for the effect of EPSC size on the decay-time and thus the standing current is the spill-over of glutamate because the autaptic neurons are not a fully-isolated system on the contrary of slice cultures. We understand that the reviewers would like to know the effect of N-peptide deletions and the LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation on asynchronous release. However, more elaborate experiments such as the usage of Strontium instead of Calcium in the extracellular solution (Friedmann and Regehr, 1999, Biophys J) would be required.</p><p>Finally, we would like to raise some of our concerns regarding the usage of EGTA-AM for high-frequency stimulation. First of all, EGTA-AM experiments require pre-incubation of the neurons in EGTA-AM before electrophysiological recordings and thus leads to poorly controlled concentration of this ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffer in the neurons which ultimately may contaminate the results of high-frequency stimulation. Whereas small differences in the intracellular EGTA-AM concentration among individual neurons of one group might be negligible when the differences in the ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the vesicular release and the RRP replenishment between two groups are high, they might greatly influence the interpretation of the data when those differences between two groups are small as in our study. Furthermore, increasing ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering leads to complex changes in ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients during the trains of APs. During the train, ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffer saturates and removal of ca<sup>2+</sup> through plasmalemmal pumps gets impaired leading to elevated intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup>-levels due to the extended time of the removal of ca<sup>2+</sup> through the pumps at the end of the train. This further complicates the interpretation of the 10 Hz data using EGTA-AM particularly when the purpose of the study is the dissection of the mechanisms leading to small changes in STP and RRP replenishment. Thus, we prefer not to utilize EGTA-AM to examine the potential effect on ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent replenishment or increase in fusogenicity. We would like to keep the focus of our study in that N-peptide is not indispensable for neurotransmitter release but rather regulates the STP and ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the vesicular release.</p><p>However, we have discussed the N-peptides’s role in STP more with with a greater emphasis (lines 520-538) as mentioned before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The main hypothesis put forward for reduced Ca-sensitivity and impaired RRP recovery in N-peptide mutants is an impairment in SNARE complex formation. How does this reconcile with up to 70% larger EPSC's during 10 Hz trains? Please comment and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank to the reviewers for raising this issue. We have calculated the net depression of EPSCs during 10 Hz trains for N-peptide deletions and saw that the responses recorded from STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons depress down to 60% of the initial EPSC size and EPSCs recorded from N-peptide mutants depress down to 80-90%. We also have plotted the absolute EPSCs and observed that the EPSCs recorded from STX1A<sup>ΔN2-19</sup> and STΧ1A<sup>ΔN2-28</sup> did not become larger but inclined to remain smaller compared to those recorded from STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons (Figure 6 – Supplement 1). However, because STX1A<sup>ΔN2-9</sup> had initial EPSC comparable to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and because those neurons showed short-term depression of only 20%, the absolute EPSCs became ~30 % larger compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup>. We have now discussed this issue in the light of their capability of SNARE complex formation and tuned down our interpretation (lines 520-529).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The data in figure 6 on the interaction between the two M18 binding modes of Stx1 are intriguing. However, different effects of N-peptide mutations in the WT and LE_Open background are difficult to reconcile, and not further addressed in the discussion. It is therefore difficult to interpret these data in the light of the N-peptide function. Please comment and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already discussed this issue in our discussion (lines 426-441, especially lines 437-441). In brief, the facilitation of the SNARE complex formation by N-peptide and the tightening of the Munc18-1 bound closed conformation by the absence of N-peptide are only minor (Burkhardt, 2008; Colbert, 2013). Furthermore, N-peptide’s effect might become negligible in a membranous environment when STX1’s TMR is present (Dawidowski and Cafiso, 2013).</p><p>We also propose that N-peptide regulates ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the vesicular release, which is a common phenotype of N-peptide deletions on the WT and LE<sub>Open</sub> background. However, we rather remain conservative for that issue and only speculate about this ‘newly discovered’ function of N-peptide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 6F the N-peptide mutations in Stx1 LE_Open slow down depression during the first few stimulations, but have no effect on STP at the end of the train. This is opposite from the effect found at the WT background, where these mutations affect STP at the end of the train (Figure 6A). How these seemingly different results can be reconciled should be addressed in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>STP behavior upon a high-frequency stimulus depends on the initial Pvr, fusogenicity, and the ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the SVs. We show in our study that deletion of N-peptide does not influence the fusogenicity of the vesicles neither on STX1A<sup>WT</sup> nor on STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> background (Figure 6). However, LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation increases the degree of the SV fusogenicity, which remains high also when N-peptide is deleted (Figure 6). Therefore, the STX1A<sup>LEOpen+ΔΝ</sup> mutants show a high degree of depression upon 10 Hz stimulation. On the other hand, we also show that N-peptide deletion decreases the ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the vesicular release both on STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and on STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> background (Figure 6). However, the decrease of the ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity on STX1A<sup>WT</sup> background is relatively minor compared to that on STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> background. This is also evident in that the decrease of the ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity on STX1A<sup>WT</sup> is not enough to significantly reduce the initial Pvr and EPSC. Therefore, it is plausible that the effect of global ca<sup>2+</sup>-accumulation in the presynapse can be observed only in the late phase of the stimulus, when N-peptide is deleted on STX1A<sup>WT</sup> background. However, STX1A<sup>LEOpen+ΔΝ</sup> mutants also show a high degree of fusogenicity and that might nullify the effect of reduced ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity at the end of the train of APs. Our interpretations regarding this issue can be found at lines 335-338, 348-350, and 473-491.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Given the twofold higher EPSC amplitude and Pvr for Stx1 LE_Open, this mutant will most likely end up with similar EPSC amplitudes at the end of the train as for the WT. However, the LE_Open Δ_N mutants will have lower EPSC amplitudes at the end of the train. This could lead to different conclusions about the role of the N-peptide, especially when combined with similar experiments with these mutants as suggested in point 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We already have shown the absolute values of EPSCs during a 10 Hz stimulus for STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and for all the mutants (Figure 6 – Supplement 1). Whereas STX1A<sup>∆N2-19</sup> and STX1A<sup>∆N2-28</sup> tended to remain to elicit smaller EPSCs throughout the high-frequency stimuli compared to those of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (Figure 6- supplement 1), EPSCs recorded from STX1A<sup>∆N2-9</sup> neurons became ~30 % larger at the end of the stimulus compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (lines 290-294). On the other hand, the EPSCs recorded from STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons by 10 Hz stimulation tended to be initially larger, but they declined further compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> mutant remained to produce smaller EPSCs throughout the high-frequency stimuli compared to those of both STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1) (lines 328-333).</p><p>These findings render the hypothesis likely that N-peptide deletions both on STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> background reduce the efficacy of SNARE complex formation and therefore leads to smaller EPSCs throughout the train. The exception for that observation is that STX1A<sup>ΔΝ2-9</sup> neurons show EPSCs initially comparable to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, which does not reconcile with the hypothesis that the ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of SVs and STP is affected by N-peptide deletions due to an impairment in SNARE complex formation. We have now discussed this issue more in detail in lines (520-535).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It is interesting to see in Figure 6J that, for low external Ca, N-peptide mutations on a LE_open background rescue the paired-pulse ratio to WT levels, while for increasing external Ca levels this gradually reverts to the LE_open phenotype. This should be addressed in the discussion in the light of the different Ca sensitivities and fusogenicities for the different experimental groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We already have discussed this issue in lines 348-350 and suggested that the observation that N-peptide deletion leads to an altered behavior only in the initial phase of the 10 Hz stimuli – when STX1A’s open conformation is facilitated – is consistent with the reduced ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity (Figure 6I) but unaltered fusogenicity (Figure 6F) of the vesicles. A cartoon illustrating a speculative model for the effects of fusogenicity, ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel-SV coupling, and ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of vesicular release can be found in Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. If reduced Ca-influx explains reduced Ca affinity in LE_open mutant (Figure 6I), how does this reconcile with the LE_open-deltaN mutant, which has significant less Ca influx compared to WT (Figure 7E), but no significant difference in Ca sensitivity? Some explanation should be added to the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to emphasize that our findings show that LE<sub>Open</sub> mutant does not reduce but enhances the ca<sup>2+</sup>-affinity of the vesicular release, which is in line with previous reports (Gerber, et al., 2008; Acuna et al., 2014). In Figure 6I, the ca<sup>2+</sup>-dose response curve of STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> deviates from that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> with a leftward shift showing that STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons release a bigger fraction of their release capacity at lower ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration, thus they have a higher ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity.</p><p>ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the vesicular release is a convoluted function of SV fusogenicity and ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel–SV distance coupling. Our sub-saturating sucrose application shows that STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> leads to a higher fusogenicity, which contributes to the higher apparent ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity. However, we cannot conclude from our experiments that the vesicles are docked and primed at a closer distance to ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels, which should be further investigated. Therefore, we argue that even though ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel concentration might be reduced in STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> neurons, which should be further corroborated with further experiments, ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity might be increased with adequate ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel–SV distance and increased SV fusogenicity.</p><p>On the other hand, STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N</sup> mutants might lead to an increase in the distance between docked/primed vesicles and the ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels, which is likely due to the loss of N-Peptide. Because those neurons retain high SV fusogenicity due to the ‘opening’ of STX1A, ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the SV fusion as a convoluted function of SV fusogenicity and ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel–SV distance coupling would approach back towards the WT-like level.</p><p>We have already had discussed this issue in our previous version of the manuscript (previous version 468-483). However, we incorporated a more elaborate discussion regarding the relationship between ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, fusogenicity, and ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity (lines 509-519) and we hope we could address your concern. Furthermore, a cartoon illustrating a speculative model for the effects of fusogenicity, ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel-SV coupling, ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, and ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of vesicular release can be found in Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The authors' interpretation that the effect of calcium influx relates to expression levels and survivability is somewhat challenged by the fact that the LE mutant has the strongest effect on calcium influx, while it is by far not the mutant with the lowest expression levels, nor is it experiencing a decrease in survivability. Please comment and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We haven’t directly related the expression levels of STX1A to the level of global ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, but rather proposed it as a possible hypothesis (lines 359-363). Therefore, we measured ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx from neurons expressing STX1A<sup>WT</sup> but at a level as reduced as STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> and found no difference. In this respect, we have interpreted our data that STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> reduces ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx due to a functional impairment rather than due to low expression level (lines 363-372). We are sorry if there was a confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Throughout the manuscript, the authors quantify cell numbers as a measure of survival. Some mutations, for example syntaxin knockout and the DeltaHabc mutant rescue, strongly affect cell survival. For the interpretation of the synaptic physiology, a more meaningful parameter would be synapse numbers, especially for evaluating the relationship between docking (measured per synapse profile) and sucrose RRP (measured per cell). It appears possible, if not likely, that synapses are lost before cells die, and in this case correlating RRP and docking may be strongly confounded. The authors may have the data in mass cultures already, and it should be possible to quantify synapse numbers (for example via Bassoon puncta densities) in these existing data. This should be accompanied by a discussion of the systems used (mass cultures for morphology and autaptic cultures for electrophysiology). If synapse numbers are changed, the RRP charge and # of docked vesicles should not be directly correlated (as done in Figure 5E), because RRP charge strongly depends on synapse numbers, while the number of docked vesicles per synapse does not. The discussion should be adjusted accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank to the reviewers for raising the point of a possible alteration of synapse number in STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> and STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> neurons as a possible reason for the reduction in their RRP. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed our VGlut1 immunocytochemical images of autaptic neurons using the images which were shown before in the Figure 4 – Supplement 2. We have found no difference in the synapse number nor in the synapse area among STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup>, and STX1A<sup>LEOpen+∆N2-28</sup> neurons. We have included our finding as Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and the numerical values can be found in the respective source data. Because we found no reduction in synapse number but in RRP, we have kept our initial comment for the correlation between the number of docked vesicles and the RRP charge. On the other hand, we noted that the vesicle docking is assessed in mass cultures whereas RRP charge is assessed in autaptic cultures. Our explanation of our finding of the synapse number can be found in lines 265-272.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The authors present the double mutation of opening syntaxin (LE mutant) and N-peptide deletion as &quot;interruption of both Munc18-1 binding modes&quot; (caption line 185, figure captions Figures 4 and 5). While we appreciate where the terminology for considering this a &quot;null for Munc18 binding&quot; comes from, it would be much better to stay closer to the experiments in the data presentation and use wording like &quot;opening of syntaxin combined with N-peptide deletion&quot; instead. As the authors discuss, Munc18-syntaxin interactions are complex, and most data suggest that Munc18 also binds to SNARE complexes (and open syntaxin) while they are being assembled. Opening syntaxin and deleting the N-peptide does unlikely fully abolish Munc18 binding, but biases binding of syntaxin to Munc18 alone towards binding of Munc18 to syntaxin as it is being incorporated into SNARE complexes. The authors should do justice to this point in figure captions, and should discuss it as such.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for using a terminology which might be misleading for the readers. We already have commented in our discussion that Munc18-1 is probably still bound to STX1A and/or SNARE complexes even when N-Peptide is deleted in STX1’s open conformation (lines 416-425). We have corrected the caption line 186 and the figure captions of Figures 4 and 5 as the reviewers suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The effect of the LE mutant of syntaxin has been characterized by several biophysical methods that show that it shifts the conformational equilibrium towards the open state, but it still adopts the closed state upon Munc18 binding as observed by SAXS (Colbert et al. 2013) and single molecule FRET (Wang et al., EMBO J. 36, 816-, 2017). Moreover, the LE mutant only partially compensates for deletion of Munc13, i.e., the rescue is rather limited as observed in autaptic neuronal cultures and by single molecule FRET experiments (Lai et al., Neuron 95, 591-, 2017). Moreover, the results in Wang et al., 2017 suggest that the LE mutant interferes with proper Munc13 function (via its interactions with syntaxin), which may be related to the observed phenotypes of this mutant. Please discuss the experiments presented here in the context of these biophysical findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already discussed that STX1A<sup>LEOpen</sup> binds to Munc18-1 in closed conformation (lines 418-422). We now included the references Wang, EMBO, 2017 and Lai, Neuron, 2017 into our discussion of this point (line 420). We also included these references into our discussion of Munc18-1 and Munc13’s roles as a template for SNARE complex formation (line 444-445). Additionally, we discussed the possible impairment of Munc13-STX1 interaction when STX1 includes LE<sub>Open</sub> mutation (lines 448-454).</p></body></sub-article></article>
