After the ingestion of a small number of bacteria (10–100), <italic>S. flexneri</italic> rapidly colonises the human intestinal epithelium. For this, <italic>S. flexneri</italic> uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) that injects bacterial effectors into the host cell to modulate key aspects of the infection process and to evade innate immune defences by the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schnupf and Sansonetti, 2019</xref>). Following uptake by host cells, <italic>S. flexneri</italic> breaks its vacuolar compartment to access the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ray et al., 2010</xref>). Here, the virulence factor IcsA enables <italic>S. flexneri</italic> to hijack host actin and polymerise comet tails that render bacteria motile to disseminate to neighbouring cells and spread in the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernardini et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egile et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Septins are highly conserved GTP-binding proteins that form heteromeric complexes (hexamers, octamers) that assemble into non-polar filaments, bundles, and rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martins et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Soroor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szuba et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Woods and Gladfelter, 2021</xref>). Septins are involved in many physiological cellular processes (e.g. cytokinesis, cilia formation) and play key roles during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mostowy and Cossart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robertin and Mostowy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spiliotis and Nakos, 2021</xref>). Septins form collar-like structures at the plasma membrane during bacterial invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boddy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mostowy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robertin et al., 2023</xref>) and ring-like structures surrounding membrane protrusions in cell-to-cell bacterial spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>). In the cytosol, septins are recruited to actin-polymerising bacteria, including <italic>S. flexneri</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic>, as cage-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>). In the case of <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, septins are recruited to μm-scale curvature at bacterial poles and the division site, which are enriched in the negatively charged phospholipid cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krokowski et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work has shown that IcsA promotes the recruitment of septins to <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, and that lipopolysaccharide inhibits <italic>S. flexneri</italic>-septin cage entrapment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lobato-Márquez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>). Septin cages prevent bacterial actin tail motility and therefore are considered as an antibacterial mechanism of host defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krokowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Intracellular infection is usually portrayed as a uniform, synchronised, and highly orchestrated process. However, infection assays performed in controlled laboratory environments with isogenic populations display a high level of complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Toniolo et al., 2021</xref>). It is particularly unknown how different subsets of bacteria (e.g. motile vs non-motile bacteria) can colonise distinct intracellular microenvironments and become targeted by multiple cell-autonomous immunity mechanisms (e.g. septin cages, autophagy). It has been proposed that this diversity of intracellular niches impacts bacterial physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Day et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutierrez and Enninga, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santucci et al., 2021</xref>). For example, it may affect individual bacterial ability to acquire nutrients, to be exposed to varying antibiotic concentrations, or to elicit different responses and signalling pathways within the host cell. While the concept of phenotypic heterogeneity in prokaryotic clonal populations is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>), the concept is also emerging in eukaryotic cells where non-genetic differences may, for instance, explain individual cell sensitivity and responses by cell-autonomous immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McDonald and Dedhar, 2024</xref>). In addition, previous high-content studies coupled with mathematical modelling have shown that host cell context (including local cell density, lipid composition at the plasma membrane, or previous infection status) affects their susceptibility to viral and bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Snijder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Voznica et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore paramount to study host and bacterial cells at the single-cell level, to assess the individual responses that collectively contribute to the infection process.</p><p>Here, to dissect the complexity of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection in epithelial cells, we use high-content high-resolution microscopy coupled to automated image analysis. High-content microscopy enables the automated acquisition of thousands of microscopy images and therefore is useful to capture the heterogeneity of individual host and bacterial cells during the infection process for quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aylan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodin and Christophe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deboosere et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dramé et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lensen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pylkkö et al., 2021</xref>). We analyse multiple parameters, such as morphological host cell features, the de novo synthesis of DNA, and proteins in both host and bacterial cells, as well as activation of the bacterial T3SS. To investigate the antimicrobial potential of septin-mediated immunity, we develop a deep learning-based approach to automatically identify septin-<italic>S. flexneri</italic> interactions.

We observed a mean of 11.5% of infected cells measured by fluorescence at 3 hr 40 min post infection (hpi) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 100:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These infected cells presented different burdens of bacteria following an exponential decay distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), reflective of the formation of infection foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ortega et al., 2019</xref>). With growing evidence of the cytosol being a non-homogeneous compartment containing concentration gradients, biomolecular condensates, protein complexes, and concentrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Tartwijk and Kaminski, 2022</xref>), we tested whether <italic>S. flexneri</italic> may be exposed to different intracellular microenvironments. For this, we measured the distance of bacteria to the centroid of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and observed a median distance of 8.74 µm. The median distance to the centroid of the cell significantly decreased with increasing bacterial burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that the microenvironment of bacteria is diverse and changes as bacteria replicate intracellularly and populate the central parts of host cytosol after uptake at the host cell periphery. To dissect the heterogeneity in host cells, we quantified an increase of 36.9% and 22.3% in the cellular and nuclear area of infected cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and I</xref>), which was dependent on the infection burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and J</xref>). In addition, the total amount of Hoechst fluorescence in the cell nucleus increased 29.4% in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating either an increase in nuclear volume or altered chromatin condensation. To test if this effect was due to morphological rearrangements during infection, we treated cells with latrunculin B to inhibit actin polymerisation. While cells treated with latrunculin B decreased their cellular area (but not their nuclear area) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), the drug did not abrogate the difference in size between infected and uninfected cells.

To study septin-associated bacteria using high-content microscopy, we designed a tailored analysis pipeline for the automatic and unbiased identification of SEPT7-bacteria interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). SEPT7 is a core component of septin hexamers and octamers and is historically used to identify septin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>). The analysis pipeline includes two deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are effective in solving classification tasks in computer vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nielsen, 2015</xref>). As septins can surround individual and also multiple bacteria simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we focused on individual bacteria. For this, we trained the first classification model to discriminate between ‘single’ bacteria and ‘clumps’.

Consistent with the ability of bacteria to manipulate the host cell cycle, <italic>S. flexneri</italic> has been shown to induce genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergounioux et al., 2012</xref>) and block the G2/M phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iwai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). We also observed a collective shutdown of protein expression, which happened in a bacterial burden-dependent manner. A recent report has shown that the OspC family of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> effectors ADP-riboxanates the host translation initiation factor 3, leading to translational arrest and the formation of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection induces host cell stress and arrests the progression of the cell cycle. In the natural <italic>S. flexneri</italic> niche of the human gut, such an arrest would prevent maturation and shedding of infected epithelial cells, thereby promoting efficient gut colonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iwai et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To understand how bacteria are targeted by cell-autonomous immune defences, such as septin cage entrapment, it is necessary to investigate phenotypic characteristics of targeted bacteria and the heterogeneous recruitment of cell-autonomous immune factors. While traditional image segmentation tools fail to enable this task, rapidly evolving developments in the field of computer vision are democratising the use of deep learning and CNNs for multiple applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">von Chamier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weigert et al., 2020</xref>), including infection biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fisch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Touquet et al., 2018</xref>). However, the analysis of complex datasets still requires a tailored approach, as shown here for bacterial interactions with the septin cytoskeleton (which is ubiquitous in the cell and forms diverse assemblies whose precise identification requires high resolution). We successfully implement a CNN-based approach for the automated classification of bacteria associated with SEPT7 assemblies using z-stacks projections, enabling the analysis of thousands of bacterial cells while saving time and preventing human bias. Building upon this work, future studies will improve use of 3D data for CNN re-training instead of z-stack projections, to allow more precise identification of <italic>S. flexneri</italic>-septin interactions, particularly when bacteria are placed perpendicular to the imaging plane.</p><p>A large dataset of images depicting <italic>S. flexneri</italic>-SEPT7 interactions was acquired to train the deep learning algorithm and to characterise the diversity of these structures. We observe that the most frequent septin assembly is in the form of rings transversally surrounding the bacterial surface. We also detected alternative morphologies, including homogeneous SEPT7 labelling surrounding the bacterial surface (tight vs loose), as well as the discrete recruitment of SEPT7 to one or two bacterial poles. While previous work has shown that septin cage assembly around <italic>S. flexneri</italic> can start with the discrete recruitment of septins to one or two bacterial poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krokowski et al., 2018</xref>), it is not yet known if the different septin assemblies we describe here correspond to different stages or fates of the same structure or whether it marks separate biological events. To fully address this question, follow-up studies should include time-lapse analysis of septin cage formation. We use deep learning analysis to interrogate intracellular bacteria and show that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> associated with SEPT7 presents heterogeneous DNA and protein synthesis. In addition, we show that bacteria associated with SEPT7 have increased T3SS activity (as compared to bacteria not associated with SEPT7). T3SS activity has been shown to be higher in motile bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell-Valois et al., 2014</xref>), which reinforces the antimicrobial role of septins in counteracting actin tail motility. Altogether, our deep learning tool to analyse septin-bacteria interactions opens the door to future studies on interactions between bacteria and components of cell-autonomous immunity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Heterogeneity in a controlled lab environment is only a small representation of the broader heterogeneity underlying the clinical infection process, considering the genetic background of the patient, interactions with microbiota, etc. In the future, our pipeline can be applied to investigate septin-bacteria interactions among different <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. or clinically relevant strains, as well as other intracellular bacteria (e.g. <italic>M. marinum, Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>). In addition, our pipeline can be adapted to identify and score other cytoskeletal structures (such as actin tails) or membrane organelles (such as autophagosomes) associated with intracellular bacteria. Ultimately, we envision that our automated microscopy workflows will help to screen pharmacologic or genetic libraries in a multiparametric manner and understand their impact on host and bacterial cells at the single-cell and population level. In this way, novel host and bacterial factors underlying heterogeneity and bacterial pathogenesis could be identified, leading to transformative therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial infection in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> srv. 5 a str.

Microscopy images were obtained using z-stack image series taking 32 slices. Confocal images were processed using Airyscan processing (Wiener filter) using ‘Auto Filter’ and ‘3D Processing’ options.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>5×10<sup>4</sup> individual bacterial cells were analysed using flow cytometry with an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

This fascinating assembly of eukaryotic proteins into complex structures restricts bacteria motility within the cytoplasm of host cells, thereby facilitating recognition by cytosolic sensors and components of the autophagy machinery. Given the different types of septin caging that have been described thus far, a single cell, unbiased approach to quantify and characterise septin recruitment at bacteria is important to fully grasp the role and function of caging. Thus, the authors have developed an automated image analysis pipeline allowing bacterial segmentation and classification of septin cages that will be very useful in the future, applied to study the role of host and bacterial factors, compare different bacterial strains or even compare infections by clinical isolates.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors developed a solid pipeline that has been thoroughly validated.

This fascinating assembly of eukaryotic proteins into complex structures restricts bacteria motility within the cytoplasm of host cells, thereby facilitating recognition by cytosolic sensors and components of the autophagy machinery. Given the different types of septin caging that have been described thus far, a single-cell, unbiased approach to quantify and characterise septin recruitment at bacteria is important to fully grasp the role and function of caging. Thus, the authors have developed an automated image analysis pipeline allowing bacterial segmentation and classification of septin cages that will be very useful in the future, applied to study the role of host and bacterial factors, compare different bacterial strains, or even compare infections by clinical isolates.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors developed a solid pipeline that has been thoroughly validated. When tested on infected cells, automated analysis corroborated previous observations and allowed the unbiased quantification of the different types of septin cages as well as the correlation between caging and bacterial metabolic activity. This approach will prove an essential asset in the further characterisation of septin cages for future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their positive comments, and for highlighting the strength of our imaging and analysis pipeline to analyse <italic>Shigella</italic>-septin interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As the main aim of the manuscript is to describe the newly developed analysis pipeline, the results illustrated in the manuscript are essentially descriptive. The developed pipeline seems exceptionally efficient in recognising septin cages in infected cells but its application for a broader purpose or field of study remains limited.</p></disp-quote><p>The main objective of this manuscript is the development of imaging and analysis tools to study <italic>Shigella</italic> infection, and in particular, <italic>Shigella</italic> interactions with the septin cytoskeleton. In future work we will provide more mechanistic insight with novel experiments and broader applicability, using different cell lines (in agreement with Reviewer 1), mutants or clinical isolates of <italic>Shigella</italic> and different bacteria species (eg. <italic>Listeria</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic>, mycobacteria).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript uses high-content imaging and advanced image-analysis tools to monitor the infection of epithelial cells by Shigella. They perform some analysis on the state of the cells (through measurements of DNA and protein synthesis), and then they focus on differential recruitment of Sept7 to the bacteria. They link this recruitment with the activity of the bacterial T3SS, which is a very interesting discovery. Overall, I found numerous exciting elements in this manuscript, and I have a couple of reservations. Please see below for more details on my reservations. Nevertheless, I think that these issues can be addressed by the authors, and doing so will help to make it a convincing and interesting piece for the community working on intracellular pathogens. The authors should also carefully re-edit their manuscript to avoid overselling their data (see below for issues I see there). I would consider taking out the first figure and starting with Figure 3 (Figure 2 could be re-organized in the later parts)- that could help to make the flow of the manuscript better.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The high-content analysis including the innovative analytical workflows are very promising and could be used by a large number of scientists working on intracellular bacteria. The finding that Septins (through SEPT7) are differentially regulated through actively secreting bacteria is very exciting and can steer novel research directions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their constructive feedback and excitement for our results, including our findings on T3SS activity and <italic>Shigella</italic>-septin interactions. In accordance with the Reviewer’s comments, we avoid overselling our data in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript makes a connection between two research lines (1: Shigella infection and DNA/protein synthesis, 2: regulation of septins around invading Shigella) that are not fully developed - this makes it sometimes difficult to understand the take-home messages of the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the manuscript is mostly technical and therefore some of our experimental observations would benefit from follow up mechanistic studies in the future. We highlight our vision for broader applicability in response to weaknesses raised by Reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear whether the analysis that was done on projected images actually reflects the phenotypes of the original 3D data. This issue needs to be carefully addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that characterizing 3D data using 2D projected images has limitations.</p><p>We observe an increase in cell and nuclear surface that does not strictly imply a change in volume. This is why we measure Hoechst intensity in the nucleus using SUM-projection (as it can be used as a proxy of DNA content of the cell). However, we agree that future use of other markers (such as fluorescently labelled histones) would make our conclusions more robust.</p><p>Regarding the different orientation of intracellular bacteria, we agree that investigation of septin recruitment is more challenging when bacteria are placed perpendicular to the acquisition plane. In a first step, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using 2D data, as it is easier/faster to train and requires fewer annotated images. In doing so, we already managed to correctly identify 80% of <italic>Shigella</italic> interacting with septins, which enabled us to observe higher T3SS activity in this population. In future studies, we will maximize the 3D potential of our data and retrain a CNN that will allow more precise identification of Shigella-septin interactions and in depth characterization of volumetric parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) To conclude that cell volume is indeed increased, the investigators should consider staining the cells with markers that demarcate cell boundaries and/or are confined to the cytosol, i.e., a cell tracker dye.</p></disp-quote><p>Staining using our SEPT7 antibody enables us to define cell boundaries for cellular area measurements (Novel Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A). However, we agree with the Reviewer that staining cells with additional markers (such as a cell tracker dye) would be required to conclude that cell volume is increased. We therefore adjust our claims in the main text (lines 107-115 and 235-246).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 27: I understand what is meant by &quot;recruited to actively pathogenic bacteria with increased T3SS activation.&quot; However, one could argue that there are many different roles of the intracytosolic bacteria in pathogenesis in terms of pathogenesis, not just actively secreting effectors.</p></disp-quote><p>T3SS secretion by cytosolic bacteria is tightly regulated and both T3SS states (active, inactive) likely contribute to the pathogenic lifestyle of <italic>S. flexneri</italic>. In agreement with this, we removed this statement from the manuscript (lines 27, 225 and 274).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 88: Please clarify in the text that HeLa cells are being studied.</p></disp-quote><p>We explicitly mention that the epithelial cell line we study is HeLa in the main text (line 93), in addition to the Materials and methods (line 328).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 97: is it possible to quantify the average distance of the nuclei from the cell perimeter? This would help provide some context as to what it means to be a certain distance from the nucleus, i.e., is there another way to point out that distance from nuclei correlates with movement inward post-invasion at the periphery?</p></disp-quote><p>To provide more context to the inward movement of bacteria to the cell centre, we provide calculations based on measurements in Figure 1G, I. If we approximate geometric shape of both cells and nucleus to a circle, the median radius of a HeLa cell is 31.1 µm<sup>2</sup> (uninfected cell) and 36.3 µm<sup>2</sup> (infected cell). Similarly, the median radius of the nucleus is 22.2 µm<sup>2</sup> (uninfected cell) and 24.57 µm<sup>2</sup> (infected cell).</p><p>However, we note that Figure 1F shows distance of bacteria to the centroid of the cell, which is the geometric centre of the cell, and which does not necessarily coincide with the geometric centre of the nucleus. We also note that nuclear area increases with infection (in a bacterial dose dependent manner). Finally, we note that these measurements are performed on max projections of 3D Z-stacks. In this case we cannot fully appreciate distance to the nucleus for bacteria located above it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Lines 212-213 - there is no Figure 9A, B - I think this should be Figure 7A, B.</p></disp-quote><p>Text has been updated (lines 216-217).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Testing the analysis pipeline as a proof-of-concept question such as the comparison of caging around the laboratory strain as compared to one or a few clinical isolates or mutants of interest would help stress the relevance of this new, remarkable tool.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their enthusiasm.</p><p>Future research in the Mostowy lab will capitalise on the high-content tools generated here to explore the frequency and heterogeneity of septin cage entrapment for a wide variety of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> mutants and <italic>Shigella</italic> clinical isolates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sentence in line 215 ends with &quot;in agreement with&quot; followed by a reference.</p></disp-quote><p>Text has been updated (line 219).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sentence in line 217 on the correlation between caging and T3SS is not very clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Text has been clarified (lines 221-223).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a typo in line 219 : &quot;protrusSions&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Text has been updated (line 223).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major points</p><p>The quantitative analysis approach in Figure 1 has multiple issues. Some examples:</p><p>(1) How was the cell area estimated? Normally, a marker for the whole cell (CellMask or similar) or cells expressing GFP would be good indicators. Here it is not clear to me what was done.</p></disp-quote><p>The cell area was estimated using SEPT7 antibody staining which is enriched under the cell cortex. CellProfiler was used to segment cells based on SEPT7 staining, using a propagation method from the identified nucleus based on Otsu thresholding. To provide more clarity on how this was performed, we now include a new figure (Figure 1- figure supplement 1A) showing a representative image of HeLa cells stained with SEPT7 and the corresponding cell segmentation performed with CellProfiler software, together with an updated figure legend explaining the procedure (lines 784–787).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors use Hoechst and integrated z-projections (Figure 1 S1) as a proxy to estimate nuclear volume. Hoechst staining depends on the organization of the DNA within the nucleus and I find that the authors need to do better controls to estimate nuclear size - this would be possible with cells expressing fluorescently labeled histones, or even better with a fluorescently tagged nuclear pore/envelope marker. The current quantification approach is misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand Reviewer #3’s concerns about using Hoechst staining as a proxy of nuclear volume, due to potential differences in DNA organisation within the nucleus.</p><p>Following the recommendation of Reviewer #3 in the following point 3, text has been updated (lines 107–115 and 235-246).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Was cell density assessed for the measurements? If cells are confluent, bacteria could spread between cells within 3 hrs, if cells are less dense, this does not occur. When epithelial cells are infected for some hours, they have the tendency to round up a bit (and to appear thicker in z), but a bit smaller in xy. My suggestion to the authors (as they use these findings to follow up with experiments on the underlying processes) would be to tone down their statements - eg, Hoechst staining could be simply indicated as altered, but not put in a context of size (this would require substantial control experiments).</p></disp-quote><p>Local cell density was not directly measured, but the experiment was set up to infect at roughly 80% confluency (cells were seeded at 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well 2 days prior to infection in a 96-well microplate, as described in the Materials and methods section) and to ensure bacterial spread between cells.</p><p>In agreement with Reviewer #3 we tone down statements in the main text (see response to point 2 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, I found Figure 1 (and parts of Figure 2) disconnected from the rest of the manuscript, and it may even be an idea to take it out of the manuscript (that could also help to deal with my feedback relating to Figure 1). I would suggest starting the manuscript with the current Figure 3 and building the biological story with a stronger focus on SEPT7 (and its links with T3 secretion and actively pathogenic bacteria) from there on. As it stands, the two parts of the manuscript are not well connected.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully considered this comment but following revisions we have not reorganised the manuscript. We believe that high-content characterisation of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection in Figure 1 and 2 provides insightful information about changes in host cells in response to infection. Following this, we move onto characterising intracellular bacteria (and in particular those entrapped in septin cages) in the second part of the manuscript (Figure 3-7). Similar methods were used to analyse both host and bacterial cells and results obtained offer complementary views on host-pathogen interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My major reservation with the experimental work of the current version of the manuscript relates to Figure 5: The analysis of the septin phenotypes in Figure 5 seems to be problematic - to me, it appears that analysis and training were done on projected image stacks. As bacteria are rod-shaped their orientation in space has an enormous impact on how the septin signal appears in a projection - this can lead to wrong interpretation of the phenotypes. The authors need to do some quantitative controls analyzing their data in 3D. To be more clear: the example &quot;tight&quot; (second row) shows a bacterium that appears short. It may be that it's actually longer if one looks in 3D, and the septin signal could possibly fall in the category &quot;rings&quot; or even &quot;two poles&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The deep learning training and subsequent analysis of septin-cage entrapment is done on projected Z-stacks, which presents limitations. Future work in the Mostowy lab will exploit this first study and dive deeper into 3D aspects of the data.</p><p>To address Reviewer #3’s concern, we include a sentence explaining that this analysis was performed using 2D max projections (lines 708 and 724), as well as acknowledging its limitations in the main text (lines 259-262).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>The scale bar in Fig 1 is very thin.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected the scale bar in Fig. 1 to make it more visible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could it be that Figure 1F is swapped with Figure1E in the description?</p></disp-quote><p>Descriptions for Figure 1E and F are correct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 27: what does &quot;actively pathogenic bacteria&quot; mean? I propose to change the term.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer #3 that “actively pathogenic bacteria” should be removed from the text. This update is also in agreement with Reviewer #1 (see Reviewer #1 point 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 28: &quot;dynamics&quot; can be confusing as it relates to dynamic events imaged by time-lapse.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we are making a snapshot of the infection process at 3 hpi, we capture asynchronous processes in both host and bacterial cells (eg. host cells infected with different bacterial loads, bacterial cells undergoing actin polymerisation or septin cage entrapment). We agree that we are not following dynamics of full events over time. However, our high content approach enables us to capture different stages of dynamic processes. To avoid confusion, we replace “dynamics” by “diverse interactions” (line 28), and we discuss the importance of follow-up studies studying microscopy timelapses (line 274).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Paragraph 59 following: the concept of heterogeneity was investigated in some detail for viral infection by the Pelkmans group (PMID: 19710653) using advanced image analysis tools. Advanced machine-learning-based analysis was then performed on Salmonella invasion by Voznica and colleagues (PMID: 29084895). It would be great to include these somewhat &quot;old&quot; works here as they really paved the way for high-content imaging, and the way analyses were performed then should be also discussed in light of how analyses can be performed now with the approaches developed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. These landmark studies have now been included in the main text (lines 71-74).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 181: I do not know what &quot;morphological conformations&quot; means, perhaps the authors can change the wording or clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We substituted the phrase “morphological conformations” by “morphological patterns” to improve clarity in the main text (lines 185).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim (eg in the abstract) that they are measuring the dynamic infection process.
