In this study, we utilized fluorescent pre- and postsynaptic markers to map synaptic organization in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal lobe, the first olfactory processing center. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) produce a constant synaptic density across different glomeruli. Each ORN within a class contributes nearly identical active zone number. Active zones from ORNs, projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons have distinct subglomerular and subcellular distributions. The correct number of ORN active zones and PN acetylcholine receptor clusters requires the Teneurins, conserved transmembrane proteins involved in neuromuscular synapse organization and synaptic partner matching. Ten-a acts in ORNs to organize presynaptic active zones via the spectrin cytoskeleton. Ten-m acts in PNs autonomously to regulate acetylcholine receptor cluster number and transsynaptically to regulate ORN active zone number. These studies advanced our ability to assess synaptic architecture in complex CNS circuits and their underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03726.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03726.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03726.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just as progress in science relies on researchers communicating their findings to other people working in their field, our bodies rely on neurons being able to communicate with other neurons.

Knowledge of these basic organizational principles, as well as the mechanisms for how they are achieved in a complex circuit, represents a critical goal for neuroscience. Historically, neuromuscular junctions have been model synapses for mechanistic studies because of their ease of access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keshishian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>). However, neuromuscular circuits display less complexity compared to neural circuits in the central nervous system (CNS). Serial-section electron microscopy (EM) has offered remarkable resolution in studying CNS synapses in the context of circuits, including the entire Caenorhabditis <italic>elegans</italic> nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">White et al., 1986</xref>), the mouse olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinds and Hinds, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">1976b</xref>), retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>), and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bock et al., 2011</xref>), and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). However, these approaches are labor intensive and not easily amenable to analysis following genetic perturbation, at varying developmental stages, or with intact samples. Indeed, even for well-known synaptic organizers like Neurexin and Neuroligin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chia et al., 2013</xref>), studies investigating their function were rarely carried out in an intact system with a resolution sufficient to reveal their detailed functions in synaptogenesis between defined neuronal types. As such, there is a need to examine CNS synapses in the intact brain, at the level of light microscopy in a system with sufficient complexity to reflect features of the CNS, but tractable enough to dissect connectivity and function using genetic tools. Current work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has sought to fulfill this need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kremer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christiansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger-Muller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system contains complex circuits that transform chemosensory input to the regulation of behavioral output. Olfactory information is received by first-order olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and is transmitted by ORN axons to the antennal lobe, the first olfactory processing center in the brain. There, the information is conveyed to the dendrites of second-order projection neurons (PNs) through class-specific ORN–PN synapses. PN axons carry signals to higher-order brain centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>). The local interneurons (LNs) innervate the antennal lobe extensively with their dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chou et al., 2010</xref>) and are involved in transforming ORN input to PN output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilson, 2013</xref>). These three groups of neurons have extensive interconnectivity and indeed, the antennal lobe has emerged as a model neural circuit for investigating the general principles of information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Twick et al., 2014</xref>). While many antennal lobe neurons have been examined electrophysiologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilson, 2013</xref>), there has been little analysis of their synaptic architecture: how many connections are made, where they are made in relation to other neurons in the circuit, and what molecules are required for their organization. Electron microscopy has been used to probe different genetic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acebes and Ferrus, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acebes et al., 2011</xref>) but could not definitively assign glomerular identity or cell type for individual synapses, highlighting the need for structural analysis at the level of light microscopy in three dimensions. Knowledge about synaptic organization is critical to understand how sensory information is received, processed, and relayed by this circuit. Thus, the fly olfactory circuit represents an excellent opportunity to assess synaptic organization in an intact system at the resolution of individual, defined neuronal classes, linking structure to physiology and function.</p><p>Here, we utilized an approach where presynaptic active zone and postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor proteins were tagged with fluorescent molecules to highlight and quantitatively describe the synaptic organization of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal lobe. We identified distinct rules that govern the number, density, and spatial organization of olfactory synapses for multiple classes of neurons. To understand how these rules are implemented at the molecular level, we investigated the function of the Teneurins, evolutionarily conserved type II transmembrane proteins recently shown to regulate synaptic partner matching and neuromuscular synaptic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>). We show that presynaptic Ten-a and postsynaptic Ten-m regulate central synapse number and active zone structure. These represent the first in vivo functions of Teneurins in organizing CNS synapses, which could contribute to their association with brain disorders such as bipolar disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Labeling presynaptic active zones using Bruchpilot-Short</title><p>To visualize synapses in vivo in genetically identifiable cells, we explored strategies to label active zones, sites of presynaptic neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhai and Bellen, 2004</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the primary unit of active zone architecture is an electron dense structure called the T-bar, a specialized formation that promotes vesicle docking and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wichmann and Sigrist, 2010</xref>) present at peripheral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jia et al., 1993</xref>) and central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Prokop and Meinertzhagen, 2006</xref>). The major structural components of the T-bar include Bruchpilot (Brp) and Rim-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), with Brp encoding the ‘table-top’ of the T-bar and Rim-binding protein comprising the ‘pedestal’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Widely used monoclonal antibodies (nc82) against Brp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco Redondo et al., 2013</xref>) label synaptic neuropil and discrete puncta corresponding to active zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>). However, these antibodies cannot distinguish synapses formed by a given class of neurons in complex CNS circuits. Therefore, to visualize active zones in genetically identifiable cells, we sought to label Brp with the GAL4/UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03726.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Measuring CNS synapses using Bruchpilot-Short.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram comparing full-length Bruchpilot and Bruchpilot-Short.

However, Bruchpilot-Short (Brp-Short), a nonfunctional 754-residue portion of Brp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), localizes to endogenous sites of full-length Brp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>) without deleterious effects. Thus, under the control of a binary expression system, Brp-Short can act as a reporter of endogenous active zones without disrupting morphology or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kremer et al., 2010</xref>). This strategy has been employed at neuromuscular synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>), in the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kremer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christiansen et al., 2011</xref>), and in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger-Muller et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We utilized Brp-Short to quantitatively measure the number of active zones, a key element of understanding synaptic organization. We expressed an mStrawberry-tagged version (Brp-Short-mStraw: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Owald et al., 2010</xref>) in Or67d ORNs that innervate the DA1 glomerulus. Coexpression with a known presynaptic protein, DSyd-1, revealed extensive colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel A), suggesting Brp-Short-mStraw correctly localizes to synapses. Further, RNAi against a portion of endogenous Brp not encoded by the Brp-Short transgene in those ORNs resulted in a loss of Brp-Short signal at ORN presynapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels B–C), though Brp-Short was still detectable in the cell body. This supports the hypothesis that Brp-Short requires endogenous Brp for proper localization to synapses; alternatively, Brp-Short could require endogenous Brp for proper trafficking to axon terminals. Finally, to confirm the veracity of the synaptic signal, we performed immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM) using antibodies to the GFP-tag (the mStraw tag is not amenable to immuno-EM) of a Brp-Short-GFP transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>) expressed in all ORNs via <italic>pebbled-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sweeney et al., 2007</xref>). With <italic>pebbled-GAL4</italic>, Brp-Short expression and localization was similar to that observed for ORN-class-specific GAL4 drivers (data not shown). While immuno-EM cannot be utilized as a quantitative strategy for determining the number of active zones (as the conditions needed to preserve the GFP epitope necessarily reduce the resolution of the technique to clearly discern all synaptic densities), it can be used to verify that Brp-Short localizes to electron-dense regions that are consistent with synaptic active zones. Indeed, 5-nm gold particles were observed to decorate putative active zone profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel D) in ultrathin sections of fly antennal lobes. 90.1% of Nano-Gold dots colocalized with synaptic densities (675 5-nm Nano-Gold particles out of 749 particles observed). Combined, these experiments demonstrate that Brp-Short localization is consistent with active zones in the fly CNS.</p><p>To determine the number of active zones produced by ORN axons that project to a given glomerulus, we expressed Brp-Short-mStraw in various ORN classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) together with <italic>UAS-mCD8-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>) as a general neurite label. Single optical sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, insets) revealed the punctate nature of the Brp-Short-mStraw signal. To quantify the number of Brp-Short puncta in these ORNs, we imaged individual glomeruli using high magnification confocal microscopy followed by image deconvolution and 3-D rendering (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). Image processing allowed us to calculate the number of Brp-Short puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E</xref>) as ‘Spots’ and the neurite volume by surface rendering of the membrane marker mCD8-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>). The numbers of Brp-Short puncta exhibited low variability for multiple classes of ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that neuronal classes form stereotyped numbers of active zones across animals. While extensive EM reconstruction is not available for the antennal lobe (and thus, absolute counts of olfactory synapses in each glomerulus for comparison), the recent use of labeled Brp in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system indicated that one Brp punctum is equivalent to one active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the Brp-Short label largely reflects actual active zone number.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video1" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03726-media1-v1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03726.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Three-dimensional rendering of a Brp-Short and mCD8-GFP in a DA1 glomerulus.</title><p>(related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) Animation of a three-dimensional rendering of the glomerulus shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>.

Moreover, the assay revealed sex-specific differences in synapse number for two glomeruli, DA1 and VA1lm, that coincide with known sex-specific differences in glomerular volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>).

These data suggested the existence of an organizational mechanism that controls synaptic density. In all, our results validated the use of Brp-Short as a quantifiable presynaptic active zone label in central neurons and revealed quantitative parameters that govern the synaptic contacts of ORNs: a stereotyped number of connections for each neuronal class from animal to animal and a constant synaptic density regardless of ORN class.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Each ORN contributes a discrete, nearly identical number of synapses to a glomerulus</title><p>In the olfactory system, individual ORNs of a particular class (as denoted by their odorant receptor expression) project to an identifiable glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>).

However, it is unknown whether each neuron contributes an equal number of synapses to the aggregate, stereotyped average or whether there is heterogeneity in synapse number at the level of individual neurons. Different results would suggest distinct rules for how individual neurons determine how many connections to form. To address this, we utilized MARCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>) to label the synapses and membranes of individual (or small subsets of) ORNs that innervate two glomeruli, DL4 and DM6.</p><p>Most frequently, we obtained 2–3 cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>), but we observed occurrences of single-cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels A–B) and large clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels C–D) that encompassed the entire glomerulus. Single neuron clones were readily discernible in confocal stacks; cell numbers could not be precisely assigned to larger than 2–3 cell clones, however, due to axon fasciculation. For all clones (<italic>n =</italic> 100 for DL4, 99 for DM6) except the largest 7 for DL4 and 9 for DM6, we quantified the number of Brp-Short puncta and the volume of the mCD8-GFP-labeled neurites as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and plotted the distribution of puncta number across all clones in histograms. For both DL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and DM6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), we observed that as clone size increased, the number of Brp-Short puncta appeared to increase in discrete steps of a similar size, suggesting that each individual neuron contributes an equal number of synapses to the glomerular average.

Each individual peak could be reliably fit using a single Gaussian relationship (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.98, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>, colored dashed lines), and the entire set of peaks could be fit by a sum of Gaussians (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). The DL4 relationship was best fit by a 4-term sum of Gaussians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, solid black line) with a value of 19.13 for the apex of the first peak, corresponding to the ‘single cell’ contribution of active zone puncta. This is in close agreement with our original data of 19.75 ± 0.68 puncta for single cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The DL6 relationship was best fit by a 5-term sum of Gaussians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, solid black line), with a value of 28.62 active zone puncta as the ‘single cell’ contribution, which is again in strong agreement with our original data of 29.06 ± 0.95 puncta for single cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, in both cases, a sum of Gaussians can accurately represent the observed peaks and predict single ‘quantum’ contributions similar to those observed for single cell clones. These ‘quantum’ values are consistent with the ‘step size’ of Brp-Short puncta measured in clones with increasing size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). Further, in comparing DL4 and DM6, the difference in the number of puncta per single cell clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) is consistent with the numerical relationship between the aggregate glomerular averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). All observed clones also displayed a nearly identical synaptic density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) regardless of their size, consistent with measurements in whole glomeruli.</p><p>To further test whether each ORN contributes the same number of synapses to the aggregate, we examined the spacing of the peaks. If the peaks were perfectly evenly spaced, the standard deviation in the distances (S) between each peak would be 0. Using the individual Gaussian relationships (colored dashed lines), we calculated an S value of 0.235 for DL4 and 2.26 for DM6. While visual assessment suggested uniformity, we used these values to more rigorously assess this. We used a resampling approach and calculated an S value for each simulation to test the null hypothesis that there is no periodic relationship between the peaks. A lower S value than that which was observed means that the simulation resulted in peaks that were more evenly spaced. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref> details these results. For distributions of DL4 or DM6, there was a low probability (&lt;0.00048 or &lt;0.05, respectively) of seeing peaks as evenly distributed as that observed. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis of no quantal relationship for both DL4 and DM6. In all, this approach demonstrates that the peaks have equal spacing in between, further supporting our assertion that each ORN contributes an equivalent number of active zones to the aggregate and that each class of ORNs has a characteristic ‘step size’ consistent with its aggregate average.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Brp-Short reveals subglomerular synaptic architecture in olfactory neurons</title><p>To better understand CNS synaptic organization, it is important to know not only how many connections are formed, but also where they form. Brp-Short allowed us to examine the spatial organization of active zones of any specific neuronal class within individual glomeruli. As an approximation of the complement of active zones for the DA1 glomerulus, we examined its component ORNs, PNs, and LNs. Using GAL4 drivers for the ORNs (<italic>Or67d-GAL4</italic>), PNs (<italic>Mz19-GAL4</italic>), and an LN line that includes most ipsilateral LNs (<italic>NP3056-GAL4</italic>), all of which innervate the DA1 glomerulus, we examined the localization of their synapses. For all classes, Brp-Short puncta colocalized with endogenous Brp staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels A–C) recognized by an antibody whose epitope is not contained within Brp-Short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>), demonstrating that Brp-Short recognizes endogenous active zones. These three classes of neurons, when combined, provide 3342 ± 99 Brp-Short puncta per glomerulus. When the endogenous number of active zones is quantified using an antibody to endogenous Brp using the same image-processing strategy, DA1 contains 3849 ± 80 active zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests that the majority of synapses in the DA1 glomerulus are indeed made by <italic>Or67d-GAL4</italic>+ ORNs, <italic>Mz19-GAL4</italic>+ PNs, and <italic>NP3056-GAL4</italic>+ LNs; the discrepancy may be contributed by synapses made by additional neurons, such as other classes of local interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chou et al., 2010</xref>), atypical projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lai et al., 2008</xref>), or potentially peptidergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ignell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlsson et al., 2010</xref>), or may represent a slight underestimation by the Brp-Short assay.</p><p>Using single optical sections within the DA1 glomerulus, we observed two levels of organization: (1) the location of neurites and Brp-Short puncta with respect to the glomerulus (the subglomerular distribution), and (2) Brp-Short puncta with respect to their own neurites for each class of neurons (the subcellular distribution). Of the three classes of neurons observed, ORNs contribute the majority of the Brp-Short puncta (1632 ± 22) and were widely distributed within the glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>), though with distinct voids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, asterisk) where the glomerulus lacked ORN neurites and Brp-Short puncta. PNs were the second major contributors of Brp-Short puncta within the glomerulus (1182 ± 24). These connections likely synapse onto PN and LN dendrites, as shown by electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kazama and Wilson, 2009</xref>), and are analogous to the dendrodendritic synapses between secondary dendrites of mitral cells and olfactory bulb interneurons in the vertebrate olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Urban and Arevian, 2009</xref>). These Brp-Short puncta showed a more even distribution throughout the glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref>), with smaller voids than those observed for ORNs despite reduced overall density. Finally, local interneurons (LNs) contribute the fewest Brp-Short puncta (528 ± 54) of the three classes. The LNs accessed by the <italic>NP3056-GAL4</italic> line make up the majority of ipsilateral LNs including most or all pan-glomerular projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chou et al., 2010</xref>), but may not be representative of all classes of LNs. Within the glomerulus, LN distribution was the most restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F</xref>). When examined at equivalent optical sections, these projections mostly filled the gaps in the ORN projection pattern, consistent with previously observed results for neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hummel and Zipursky, 2004</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03726.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Antennal lobe neurons display distinct subglomerular architecture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Single, high-magnification confocal optical sections through the center of the DA1 glomerulus in three animals where ORNs (<bold>A</bold>), PNs (<bold>B</bold>), or LNs (<bold>C</bold>) are expressing Brp-Short.

To quantify this distribution, we conducted a nearest neighbor distance (NND) analysis for Brp-Short puncta in each class of neurons, which has been informative in understanding spatial relationships between synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bleckert et al., 2013</xref>). We found that all three types of neurons had distinct mean NND values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>): ORNs had the closest puncta and LNs the furthest with PNs falling in between the two. To quantify the clusters observed, we defined clustered puncta as having an NND of 0.75 μm or less (an NND of 0.6 μm corresponds to directly touching). For ORNs, these large clusters amounted to 17% of puncta that fell within this range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). PNs lacked these large clusters, but had some smaller clusters, as well as extended regions of neuronal membrane devoid of Brp-Short puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Indeed, only 7.9% of PN puncta were clustered by this metric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Within LN neurites, Brp-Short puncta also displayed significant clustering (15%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). However, unlike ORNs and PNs, no extended regions of membrane were observed without synaptic puncta. This suggests a more even distribution for the remaining puncta, which is supported by the higher value for NND (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) and consistent with previous imaging using a synaptic vesicle marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chou et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, these results show distinct synaptic architecture, with respect to the glomerulus and the neurites themselves, made by three different types of olfactory neurons. Moreover, distinct parameters can be defined for each class in terms of how puncta are clustered and the minimum distance between puncta. Though some distances may be underestimated, these facets may represent additional rules that govern synaptic organization in the antennal lobe.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Teneurin-a is required presynaptically for normal ORN synapse number</title><p>Having utilized Brp-Short to determine aspects of presynaptic organization in olfactory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures 1–3</xref>), we next sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms that may underlie these rules. We began with genetic perturbations of candidate molecules, the Teneurins. Teneurins are type II transmembrane proteins involved in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Young and Leamey, 2009</xref>) and are disrupted in human neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldahmesh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Psychiatric GWAS Consortium Bipolar Disorder Working Group, 2011</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Teneurins, Ten-m and Ten-a, regulate synaptic partner matching in the olfactory and neuromuscular systems via homophilic interaction between elevated Teneurin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>). Basal levels of the Teneurins interact heterophilically at NMJ synapses to organize connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>). However, due to the absence of techniques for quantitatively examining central synapses in vivo, a role for the Teneurins in organizing central synapses has not been established. Due to the similarity in partner matching mechanisms between central and peripheral nervous systems, and the fact that both Ten-a and Ten-m are expressed at basal levels in all glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2012</xref>), we hypothesized that the CNS may use Teneurins similarly to the PNS for synaptic organization. Specifically, we hypothesized that olfactory neurons would utilize basal levels of Ten-a and Ten-m to control synaptic number.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we used Brp-Short to quantify active zone number in Or47b-positive ORNs innervating the VA1lm glomerulus. Ten-a is expressed at a basal level in this glomerulus, and therefore does not directly affect synaptic partner matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2012</xref>). Comparing wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and <italic>ten-a</italic> null mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we found that Or47b ORNs in the <italic>ten-a</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) had 23% fewer Brp-Short puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Notably, loss of <italic>ten-a</italic> did not alter ORN axon volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), despite affecting glomerular morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which is due to the loss of <italic>ten-a</italic> in neurons of the nearby DA1 glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2012</xref>). As such, synaptic density was similarly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To ensure that changes in glomerular morphology were not related to changes in synapse number, we also examined ORNs that innervate the DL4 glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We compared synapse number in ultrathin EM sections of wild-type and <italic>ten-a</italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Quantification of all synapses in a glomerulus (and thus a direct comparison to the Brp-Short assay) would require serial reconstruction of that entire glomerulus by EM. However, if the Brp-Short assay accurately reflects changes in synapse number following genetic perturbation, we reasoned that this should be evident in the change in the number of T-bar profiles in individual sections at the EM level. Indeed, quantification of T-bar profiles showed a 27% reduction in the number of T-bars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This is consistent with the results from the Brp-Short assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which shows a 23% reduction. The slight difference may reflect an under-report of the phenotype by our confocal-level analysis or may reflect the fact that the EM analysis does not differentiate between ORN, PN, and LN presynapses while the Brp-Short assay does. The largely similar magnitude of synapse reduction in EM and confocal studies supports the validity of the Brp-Short assay, and further substantiates that Ten-a is required for proper synapse number in the CNS.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03726.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Ultrastructural analysis of active zones in <italic>ten-a</italic> mutants.</title><p>Representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of active zones in control (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>ten-a</italic> null mutant antennal lobes (<bold>B</bold>).

To address these questions, techniques are needed to visualize synapses at the light microscopy level in an intact system that is amenable to genetic manipulation. Here, we identify parameters that govern synapse number, density, and subcellular organization using two fluorescently-tagged synaptic proteins expressed from single transgenes in combination with high-resolution confocal microscopy and image processing to visualize synapses in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system in vivo. We demonstrate that these methods are amenable to analysis in both individual neuronal classes and individual neurons. Our study provides a synapse-level analysis of innervation of olfactory receptor neurons, projection neurons, and local interneurons in the antennal lobe, which has emerged as a model circuit for analyzing principles of information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Twick et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, using these synaptic tagging assays, we show that the Teneurins are required for the proper synapse number in ORNs and PNs as well as the structure of the active zones themselves. This reveals a critical role for these transmembrane proteins in organizing central synapses, likely by regulating the cytoskeleton. These approaches can be broadly used to study synaptic organization of neurons for which genetic access is available, and to investigate the functions of any other proteins in the organization and development of CNS synapses.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Quantitative synaptic tagging assays to study central synapses</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, previous approaches to studying central synapses used tagged synaptic vesicle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ito et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>) to reveal putative synaptic sites. While consistent with synapses, they could also stain non-synaptic, trafficking vesicles. We utilized a structural active zone component, Brp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>). By expressing a truncated Brp transgene, Brp-Short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>), using the GAL4/UAS system, this approach can label synapses in any neurons with genetic access. Brp-Short expression requires endogenous Brp for proper localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and does not alter function or morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kremer et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it accurately reports endogenous active zones. Recently, an elegant technique, STaR, was developed, which tags an additional, BAC-sourced copy of Brp with an epitope tag whose expression is conditional upon FLP-recombinase-mediated excision of an intervening stop codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). An important advantage of STaR is that Brp expression is controlled by its endogenous promoter, thus guarding against mislocalization of Brp or perturbation of synaptic function due to overexpression. A caveat of Brp-Short is that it is controlled by GAL4 and thus the levels may be different from the endogenous level. While Brp-Short overexpression does not interfere with synaptic function, care must be taken not to overexpress it to a level that saturates the active zone localization machinery when utilized in new cell types. The advantages of Brp-Short over STaR are (a) that it does not require a cell type-specific FLP transgene, which is not as widely available as GAL4 lines, or a BAC-bearing copy of Brp, and (b) that it can be co-expressed with UAS-transgenes for rescue or RNAi for perturbation experiments, although STaR can also achieve this aspect by using a cell-type-specific GAL4 and an extra <italic>UAS-FLP</italic> transgene.</p><p>To examine putative postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor clusters, we use a GFP-tagged subunit, Dα7, to study cholinergic synapses in the antennal lobe.

Though false positives can be associated with full-length protein overexpression, our observation of endogenous Brp puncta apposed to these Dα7-GFP puncta suggests that these receptors are properly localized to endogenous synapses. This assay complements the Brp-Short presynaptic assay and can be adapted for other tagged postsynaptic receptor transgenes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Synaptic organization in the Drosophila antennal lobe</title><p>Though considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the wiring specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong and Luo, 2014</xref>) and physiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilson, 2013</xref>) of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory circuit in the antennal lobe, little is known about its synaptic organization. As this system has emerged as a model neural network, a detailed mapping of synaptic organizational principles is integral towards advancing the study of circuit dynamics. Indeed, the juxtaposition of distinct types of synapses between multiple neuronal classes in the antennal lobe provides a model to study complex synaptic interactions compared to a neuromuscular synapse that features only two synaptic partners: the motoneuron and the muscle. We utilized the Brp-Short and Dα7 assays to probe how synapses in ORNs, PNs, and LNs are organized in the antennal lobe with respect to their number, density, and location. This work offers the first comprehensive information on (1) the number of active zones made by each ORN within a glomerulus, (2) the stereotypy of synapse numbers between those individual ORNs, (3) the prominence of PN presynaptic inputs within a glomerulus, suggesting a robust feedback mechanism, and (4) the relatively small contribution of LN active zones to the antennal lobe circuit. Our analyses suggest distinct rules that govern the synaptic organization of antennal lobe neurons. ORNs, the primary input neurons of the olfactory system, are diverse in their olfactory receptor expression, ligand specificity, and glomerular targeting specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liang and Luo, 2010</xref>); we now show that they also differ in the absolute synapse number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, despite such differences, all five classes we examined (DA1, VA1d, VA1lm, DL4, and DM6 ORNs) have identical synaptic densities, suggesting that this represents a general rule for other ORN classes. This may further suggest that the primary job of the ORN is to convey information from the environment into the system as faithfully as possible, that all information is treated equally at this level, and that weighting computations occur downstream in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Masse et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilson, 2013</xref>). Indeed, our analyses indicate that each ORN makes an equivalent, discrete number of synapses within a given glomerulus with little variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), further supporting this hypothesis.</p><p>Interestingly, the density of postsynaptic receptors differs between glomeruli and even within the same glomerulus between sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This variation can be due to technical caveats, such as <italic>Mz19-GAL4</italic> does not label all PNs that innervate DA1 and VA1d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jefferis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liang et al., 2013</xref>), or that Dα7-GFP clusters do not reflect the absolute number of AChRs. As the relative numbers still show these differences, an interesting possibility suggested by these results is that postsynaptic PN AChRs already reflect a transformed olfactory representation compared to output synapses of ORNs. The difference in PN AChR density as compared to the constant density of ORN active zones suggests that different classes of PNs may modulate how information is received by regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors. This can thus contribute to the transformation of olfactory representation by antennal lobe neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilson, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Fine-scale analysis of synapse localization within projections of ORNs, LNs, and PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggested that these three types of neurons differ in their subglomerular organization. While occupying the vast majority of territory throughout the entire glomerulus, ORN processes and synapses leave distinct voids. A significant proportion of LNs form synapses in these voids, likely to other LNs or PNs. However, there is also overlap between LN and ORN processes and synapses, consistent with physiologically characterized ORN → LN and LN → ORN synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Olsen et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Root et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Root et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Root et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wilson, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">2013</xref>). Within their respective neurites, ORNs and PNs display uneven distributions and synaptic clusters to varying degrees while active zones in LNs are more evenly distributed throughout their processes.

Finally, the existence of synaptic organization parameters detailing number and location suggests molecular mechanisms designed to enforce those rules, both at cellular and circuit levels. Indeed, such analysis represents an integral part of neuronal circuit analysis, as recent work on retinal neurons has shown that accounting for synapse position is a critical aspect of modeling connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Central synapse density is regulated by a conserved Teneurin mechanism</title><p>Our data demonstrate that the Teneurins, a family of transsynaptic adhesion molecules, regulate one of these synaptic organizational paradigms: synapse number. Beyond molecules like RPTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Takahashi and Craig, 2013</xref>) and Wnts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Park and Shen, 2012</xref>), there is little known conservation between the organization mechanisms of central synapses and the NMJ. In vertebrates, previous studies have identified a number of synaptogenic signaling and cell adhesion molecules in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerrow and El-Husseini, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Missler et al., 2012</xref>), but in many cases, their roles at the NMJ are either minimal or unknown. Likewise, the roles of pathways including Rapsyn, Dok7, MuSK, and Tid1, which are well established at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wu et al., 2010</xref>), have no well-established roles at CNS synapses. Among the identified central synaptogenic molecules, no master controller of synapses, like Agrin, has been discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shen and Scheiffele, 2010</xref>). In the mammalian CNS, synaptic adhesion molecules like Neurexin and Neuroligin have demonstrated organizational roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sudhof, 2008</xref>) but their role (if any) at the NMJ is largely unknown. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, considerable work has been done at the NMJ to understand synapse formation and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Menon et al., 2013</xref>). For example, neuromuscular Neurexin and Neuroligin regulate synaptic development and assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banovic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Owald et al., 2012</xref>), but remain (as with many other identified molecules) largely untested in the CNS due to the absence of techniques for doing so.</p><p>Our approaches have now enabled such an examination, uncovering a strongly conserved synaptic organization function of the Teneurins from PNS to CNS. Recent work has shown that these evolutionarily conserved proteins are involved in synaptic partner matching between neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system and between muscles and motoneurons at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>). As there are marked differences between central and peripheral synapses (like the NMJ), it is further unclear whether the mechanisms would be conserved or if they would be wholly different. Here we find, as assayed by Brp-Short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), ultrastructural (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and Dα7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) analyses, that Teneurins in olfactory neurons are required for normal synapse number. Teneurin perturbation also reduces synaptic density, a parameter that is highly invariable for ORNs under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). We determined that presynaptic Ten-a in ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) likely functions with postsynaptic Ten-m in PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8,9</xref>) to regulate levels of the spectrin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our evidence is consistent with spectrin and the Teneurins functioning in the same genetic pathway to regulate synapse organization and density. The perturbation of active zone number in ORNs by knocking down <italic>ten-m</italic> in PNs further suggests that Teneurins regulate synapse number and organization in the CNS via a transsynaptic mechanism. This highlights further conservation between central and peripheral synapse organization in the use of Teneurins. There are, however, some differences between the CNS and the PNS regarding the Teneurins. While presynaptic <italic>ten-m</italic> has a minor role in synaptic organization at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>), our data suggests the lack of such a role in the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, these different systems may also use the Teneurins differently. Mammalian Teneurins organize the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leamey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antinucci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Young et al., 2013</xref>) and Ten-2 can serve as a ligand for Latrophilin and localize to synapses in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boucard et al., 2014</xref>). However, as proper synaptic function is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guilmatre et al., 2014</xref>) and human Teneurin-4 is associated with increased susceptibility to bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Psychiatric GWAS Consortium Bipolar Disorder Working Group, 2011</xref>), understanding how the Teneurins regulate central synapses is a question with clinical relevance. Studies in vivo will be important to determine how mammalian Teneurins regulate synaptic organization and whether the different Teneurins can have specific roles at synapses.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate a role for the Teneurins in regulating the number of central synapses and highlight mechanistic conservation between peripheral and central synapse formation.

Images were centered on the glomerulus in question and the Z-boundaries set according to the confines of the synaptic label (Brp-Short-mStraw or Dα7-GFP). System gain was set to minimize saturation but maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio. Selected raw image stacks are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/luolab/ALsynapse.shtml">http://web.stanford.edu/group/luolab/ALsynapse.shtml</ext-link>.</p><p>Raw image stacks for quantification were first deconvolved using AutoQuant X3 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD) on a custom-built computer (Digital Storm, Fremont, CA). Specifically, the images were deconvolved using 10 iterations with settings of medium noise, and a blind point spread function. Following deconvolution, images were visually inspected to ensure that striping, ringing, or discontinuity artifacts were not introduced. Further, each image was visually examined to ensure that the borders of puncta were sharpened by the deconvolution and that the membrane staining remained continuous. Following, images were imported into Imaris 7.4.1 (Bitplane AG, South Windsor, CT) for quantification. Though deconvolution improved the visual quality of the images, it was dispensable for accurate quantification of Brp-Short or Dα7 puncta.</p><p>The ‘Spots’ function was used to quantify Brp-Short or Dα7 puncta in Imaris. A region of interest was drawn around the glomerulus being quantified. For individually labeled glomeruli, the standard Imaris box was sufficient to mark the region of interest. Where multiple glomeruli were labeled and a single glomerulus was quantified, a freehand region of interest was drawn in each section using the neuropil staining as a guideline and a 3D region extrapolated by Imaris. The spot size (puncta diameter) was set at 0.6 μm for Brp-Short and 0.8 μm for Dα7, as determined by direct measurement of images and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kremer et al., 2010</xref>). Background subtraction was selected. Following automatic detection of puncta, the threshold was manually adjusted (usually within 5% among different samples) with visual inspection to ensure that all puncta were identified, minimal background staining or noise was recognized, and that individual puncta were not double-counted. In all, the resultant count was recorded as the number of puncta. The accuracy was assessed by comparing puncta detection figures to glomeruli that were counted by hand following 3D projection. In all cases, there was less than 5% difference, supporting the accuracy of the semi-automatic quantification method. In male <italic>Or67d-GAL4</italic> samples that did not express the synaptic label (normally have ∼1500 puncta), but were processed identically using primary and secondary antibodies, the number of puncta recognized by this method was &lt;30, suggesting that the ‘false positive’ rate was low. To ensure that user-introduced noise in threshold adjustment did not introduce significant bias, each image was quantified a second time, at a later time, without access to the prior quantification. If the difference exceeded 5%, the sample was discarded. Further, if the averages of an entire genotype were significantly different from each other (as determined by student's <italic>t</italic> test), the entire cohort was discarded and the experiment repeated.</p><p>For the nearest neighbor distance (NND) analysis, the ‘DistMin’ was calculated in Imaris using the ‘Spots to Spots Closest Distance XTension’ plug-in for Matlab. Cumulative frequency histograms were compiled in Prism 6.04 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). As each puncta is ∼0.6 μm in diameter, the minimum NND should be 0.6. Indeed, few measurements were seen below 0.6. Thus, ‘clustering’ was defined as puncta with an NND of less than 25% of the diameter. The ‘% Cluster’ was calculated by expressing the number of puncta with an NND value ≤0.75 divided by the total number of puncta.</p><p>To obtain neurite volume based on mCD8-GFP or mtdT labeling, the ‘Surfaces’ function was used. Regions of interest were drawn as above. Background subtraction was set to 3 μm and the smoothing to 0.2 μm; these settings optimally reflected actual neurite labeling. Automatic detection with a 10e5 threshold was then used to remove background, detecting only the glomerulus in question. For smaller objects (MARCM clones), a 10e1 threshold was used and only the specific objects that directly corresponded to mCD8-GFP labeling were selected and counted. Volume was then calculated by Imaris. Density was then expressed as the number of Brp-Short puncta divided by the neurite volume. For images involving a neurite co-stain, the Brp-Short-mStraw channel was masked in Imaris so that only the puncta within the neurite were identified and counted (not background puncta resulting from secondary antibodies, or image noise). Images were processed using Photoshop CS4 (Adobe, San Jose, CA) and levels or contrast adjusted identically for all cases of comparison. For cases of immunofluorescence comparison, brains were stained in parallel, imaged on the same slide in the same session, and processed identically. Statistical and graphical analyses were completed in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), Prism 6.04 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), and Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Adult brains were dissected in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and fixed at 4°C for 3 hr in 2.5% paraformaldehyde, 5% glutaraldehyde (vol/vol), and 0.06% picric acid (vol/vol) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer.

Dehydration, infiltration with resin, and staining with uranyl acetate were all done according to standard protocols. Antennal lobe regions were identified in thick section following 1% toluidine blue in 1% sodium borate staining and ultrathin sections taken from those regions. Sections were imaged on a JEM-1400 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) transmission electron microscope at X3,000 to X20,000 magnification.

Matlab was then used to generate 50,000 simulations selecting four peaks that fit those distributions.

Our model predicts that perturbing postsynaptic <italic>ten-m</italic> should reduce the number of presynaptic active zones. We found that this was indeed the case. This offers strong evidence for a transsynaptic Teneurin interaction in the CNS for regulating synapse organization, which has not been previously shown. This data is detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> with reagent validation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>B) Absence of a role for presynaptic <italic>ten-m</italic> in regulating synapse number: RNAi experiments revealed that knocking down <italic>ten-m</italic> (unlike <italic>ten-a</italic>) in presynaptic ORNs resulted in no synaptic phenotype. This is in contrast to previous findings from the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>) that showed a minor presynaptic role for <italic>ten-m</italic>. This data is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>C) Absence of a role for postsynaptic <italic>ten-a</italic> in regulating synapse number: postsynaptic rescue experiments using two binary expression systems (GAL4 and QF) allowed us to label ORN synapses while restoring Ten-a expression to postsynaptic projection neurons in a <italic>ten-a</italic> mutant background. This did not ameliorate the synaptic phenotype caused by the loss of <italic>ten-a</italic>, cementing a presynaptic role for Ten-a in synapse organization. This data is also now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>Below we offer point-by-point responses.</p><p><italic>1) Provide a detailed and rigorous comparison between UAS-Brp-short and endogenous Brp localization and numbers, based on preparations co-stained for both proteins. E.g., in DA1: in OSN, PN and LN terminals</italic>.</p><p>We have performed additional experiments and have expanded upon the quantifications of Brp-Short puncta in ORNs, PNs, and LNs within the DA1 glomerulus. We show that Brp-Short and endogenous Brp labeling colocalize in all three types of neurons. Moreover, we have added quantifications of Brp-Short puncta in all three classes of neurons, as well as of endogenous Brp puncta in DA1. The data strengthen our conclusions and are detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Provide a rigorous statistical treatment of the “quantal analysis” of OSN-presynatic puncta number, and a mathematically based estimate for “quantal size” in each case</italic>.</p><p>We have conducted an extensive statistical analysis of the ORN MARCM experiments detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and in Figure 2–figure supplements 2 and 3. The text now reflects our analysis, including fitting of sum of Gaussian relationships to the data, prediction of single cell contribution, assessment of significance using multiple tests and a resampling analysis to demonstrate the “quantal” nature of the observed data.</p><p><italic>3) Provide extensive details on the methodology in order to allow the reviewers to assess these methods better and, more importantly, allow them to be reproduced. Also, please place the original stacks used here on a server from where they can be freely downloaded.
