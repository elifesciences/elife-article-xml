formation can be the first step to speciation, but the genetic underpinnings of this process are poorly understood. Marine midges of the genus <italic>Clunio</italic> (Diptera) have recolonized Northern European shore areas after the last glaciation. In response to local tide conditions they have formed different ecotypes with respect to timing of adult emergence, oviposition behavior and larval habitat. Genomic analysis confirms the recent establishment of these ecotypes, reflected in massive haplotype sharing between ecotypes, irrespective of whether there is ongoing gene flow or geographic isolation. QTL mapping and genome screens reveal patterns of polygenic adaptation from standing genetic variation. Ecotype-associated loci prominently include circadian clock genes, as well as genes affecting sensory perception and nervous system development, hinting to a central role of these processes in ecotype formation. Our data show that adaptive ecotype formation can occur rapidly, with ongoing gene flow and largely based on a re-assortment of existing alleles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Clunio marinus</kwd><kwd>Clunio balticus</kwd><kwd>adaptive radiation</kwd><kwd>introgression</kwd><kwd>circalunar clock</kwd><kwd>circadian clock</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>802923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaiser</surname><given-names>Tobias S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaiser</surname><given-names>Tobias S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Baltic and Arctic ecotypes of the marine midge Clunio emerged from a recent adaptive radiation, which is based on standing genetic variation at many loci involved in time-keeping and nervous system development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genetic foundations for rapid ecological adaptation and speciation remain poorly understood. Decades of research have focused on identifying single or few major genetic loci in such contexts, with some notable successes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wu and Ting, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Phadnis and Orr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nosil and Schluter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Van’t Hof et al., 2016</xref>). However, many genome-wide association studies have now shown that quantitative trait phenotypes have usually a polygenic basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). This implies that also rapid natural adaptation should be expected to occur in a polygenic context, based on subtle allele frequency changes at many loci with small effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barton, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barghi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Le Corre and Kremer, 2012</xref>). A classic example for polygenic adaptation is human height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Turchin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>), and other examples from humans may include birth weight and female hip size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Field et al., 2016</xref>). However, powerful datasets to detect polygenic adaptations are still mostly limited to humans and agriculturally relevant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barghi et al., 2020</xref>), and examples of polygenic adaptation in natural populations are rare. To show that polygenic adaptation occurs in natural populations requires an exceptional biogeographic setting, as well as deep genomic and genetic analysis. One such example may be found in <italic>Midas</italic> cichlids, where a polygenic trait architecture was found to promote rapid and stable sympatric speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kautt et al., 2020</xref>). This finding is particularly interesting, since theoretical work suggested that under scenarios with gene flow the genetic architecture of adaptation may – compared to adaptation without gene flow – rather consist of fewer, tightly linked loci with larger effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011</xref>). Notably, the same study also suggested that the resulting large-effect QTL may often be composed of many tightly linked loci of smaller effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011</xref>). Without migration we expect an exponential distribution of allele effects, with few large effect loci and many loci of small effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barghi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Orr, 1998</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examine local adaptation and population divergence in another exceptional biogeographic setting, namely the postglacial evolution of new ecotypes in marine midges of the genus <italic>Clunio</italic> (Diptera: Chironomidae). In adaptation to their habitat, <italic>Clunio</italic> midges differ in oviposition behavior and reproductive timing, involving both circadian and circalunar clocks.</p><p>Circalunar clocks are biological time-keeping mechanisms that allow organisms to anticipate lunar phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neumann, 2014</xref>). Their molecular basis is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreatta and Tessmar-Raible, 2020</xref>), making identification of adaptive loci for lunar timing both particularly challenging and interesting. In many marine organisms, circalunar clocks synchronize reproduction within a population. In <italic>Clunio marinus</italic> they have additional ecological relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaiser, 2014</xref>). Living in the intertidal zone of the European Atlantic coasts, <italic>C. marinus</italic> requires the habitat to be exposed by the tide for successful oviposition. The habitat is maximally exposed during the low waters of spring tide days around full moon and new moon. Adult emergence is restricted to these occasions by a circalunar clock, which tightly regulates development and maturation. Additionally, a circadian clock ensures emergence during only one of the two daily low tides. The adults reproduce immediately after emergence and die few hours later. As tidal regimes vary dramatically along the coastline, populations of this <italic>Atlantic ecotype</italic> of <italic>C. marinus</italic> show local timing adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaiser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neumann, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>) for which the genetic underpinnings are partially known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kaiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kaiser and Heckel, 2012</xref>).</p><p>When <italic>Clunio</italic> expanded into the North after the regression of the ice shield, new ecotypes evolved in the Baltic Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Remmert, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Palmén and Lindeberg, 1959</xref>) and in the high Arctic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Neumann and Honegger, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pflüger and Neumann, 1971</xref>), which differ from the <italic>Atlantic ecotype</italic> of <italic>C. marinus</italic> in various ways (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for a summary of defining characteristics of the three ecotypes). In the Baltic Sea the tides are negligible and the <italic>Baltic ecotype</italic> oviposits on the open water, from where the eggs quickly sink to the submerged larval habitat at water depths of up to 20 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Remmert, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Endraß, 1976a</xref>). Reproduction of the <italic>Baltic ecotype</italic> happens every day precisely at dusk under control of a circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heimbach, 1978</xref>), without a detectable circalunar rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Endraß, 1976a</xref>). Near Bergen (Norway) the <italic>Baltic</italic> and <italic>Atlantic ecotypes</italic> were reported to co-occur in sympatry, but in temporal reproductive isolation. The <italic>Baltic ecotype</italic> reproduces at dusk, the <italic>Atlantic ecotype</italic> reproduces during the afternoon low tide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heimbach, 1978</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>Baltic ecotype</italic> is currently considered a separate species – <italic>C. balticus</italic>. However, <italic>C. balticus</italic> and <italic>C. marinus</italic> can be successfully interbred in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heimbach, 1978</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Northern European ecotypes of <italic>Clunio</italic> and their circalunar rhythms.</title><p>The <italic>Atlantic</italic>, <italic>Arctic</italic> and <italic>Baltic ecotypes</italic> of <italic>Clunio</italic> differ mainly in their circalunar rhythms (<bold>B–H</bold>), circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as their habitat and the resulting oviposition behavior (see ‘Assessment of oviposition behavior’ in Methods section).

During its reproductive season, the permanent light of polar day precludes synchronization of the circadian and circalunar clocks with the environment. Thus, the <italic>Arctic ecotype</italic> relies on a so-called tidal hourglass timer, which allows it to emerge and reproduce during every low tide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pflüger and Neumann, 1971</xref>). It does not show circalunar or circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pflüger and Neumann, 1971</xref>).</p><p>The geological history of Northern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Patton et al., 2017</xref>) implies the Baltic Sea and the high Arctic could only be colonized by <italic>Clunio</italic> after the last glacial ice shield regressed about 10,000 years ago. This inference is also supported by subfossil <italic>Clunio</italic> head capsules in Baltic Sea sediment cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hofmann and Winn, 2000</xref>). The new adaptations to the absence of tides in the Baltic Sea and to polar day in the high Arctic must therefore have occurred within this time frame. One strength of our model system is that we know the major adaptations specific to each ecotype, that is we know the major axes of recent selection. This makes <italic>Clunio</italic> a particularly interesting model system for studying the genetics of rapid adaptation. At the same time it promises to yield insights into the genetic pathways underlying the ecotype characteristics, including circadian and circalunar timing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Clunio</italic> ecotypes</title><p>Starting from field work in Northern Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we established one laboratory strain of the <italic>Arctic ecotype</italic> from Tromsø (Norway, Tro-tAR; see methods for strain nomenclature) and three laboratory strains of the <italic>Baltic ecotype</italic>, from Bergen (Norway, Ber-2AR), Sehlendorf (Germany; Seh-2AR) and Ar (Sweden; Ar-2AR).

In ADMIXTURE, the optimal number of genetic groups is six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), corresponding to the number of geographic sites, and there is basically no mixing between the six clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; K=6). Finally, there is isolation by distance (IBD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Second, the sympatric ecotypes in Bergen are genetically very similar. In PCA they are not separated in the first four principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>) and they are the only populations that share mitochondrial haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the ADMIXTURE analysis, they are only distinguished at K=7, a value larger than the optimal K. As soon as the two populations are distinguished, some individuals show signals of admixed origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; K=7), compatible with the assumption of ongoing gene flow and incomplete reproductive isolation. These observations question the species status of <italic>C. balticus</italic>, which was based on the assumption of temporal isolation between these two populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heimbach, 1978</xref>).</p><p>Third, the data suggest that after the ice age <italic>Clunio</italic> colonized northern Europe from a single source and expanded along two fronts into the Baltic Sea and into the high Arctic. The mitochondrial haplotype network expands from a single center, which implies a quick radiation from a colonizing haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; note that all sampled populations occur in areas under a former ice shield cover). There is also a large degree of shared nuclear polymorphisms. Thirty-four percent of polymorphic SNPs are polymorphic in all seven populations and 93% are polymorphic in at least two populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Separation of the Baltic Sea populations along PC1 and the Arctic population along PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggests that <italic>Clunio</italic> expanded into the high Arctic and into the Baltic Sea independently. Congruently, nucleotide diversity significantly decreases toward both expansion fronts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Postglacial establishment from a common source indicates that the <italic>Baltic</italic> and <italic>Arctic ecotypes</italic> have evolved their new local adaptations during this expansion time, that is, in less than 10,000 years.</p><p>Fourth, ADMIXTURE analysis reveals that sympatric co-existence of the <italic>Atlantic</italic> and <italic>Baltic ecotypes</italic> in Bergen likely results from introgression of <italic>Baltic ecotype</italic> individuals into an existing <italic>Atlantic ecotype</italic> population. At K=2 and K=3 the two Baltic Sea populations Seh-2AR and Ar-2AR are separated from all other populations and the two Bergen populations Ber-2AR and Ber-1SL show a marked genetic contribution coming from these Baltic Sea populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The Baltic genetic component is slightly larger for the <italic>Baltic ecotype</italic> Ber-2AR population than for the <italic>Atlantic ecotype</italic> Ber-1SL population. A statistical analysis via TreeMix detects predominantly an introgression from Seh-2AR into Ber-2AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>), suggesting that haplotypes that convey the <italic>Baltic ecotype</italic> have introgressed into a population of <italic>Atlantic ecotype</italic>, resulting in the now observed sympatric co-existence of <italic>Baltic</italic> and <italic>Atlantic ecotypes</italic> in Bergen. So far Bergen is the only site for which sympatric co-existence of the ecotypes is known. Further work will be required to see if there is a larger area of overlap, for example in the Skagerrak, and if we see similar signals of introgression or possibly secondary contact in other sympatric populations.</p><p>While our observation adds to the evidence for a role of introgression in adaptation and early speciation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Edelman and Mallet, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baack and Rieseberg, 2007</xref>), it also constitutes an excellent starting point for mapping loci that could be involved in the respective ecotype adaptations. Under the assumption that fast adaptation and ecotype formation are mostly based on frequency changes in standing variation, one expects that the respective haplotypes should be shared between ecotypes, especially when transferred via introgression.

Interestingly, the degree of lunar rhythmicity segregates within and between crossing families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting a heterogeneous multi-genic basis of lunar arrhythmicity. Genetic segregation in the cross implies that the weak rhythm observed in Ber-2AR is due to genetic polymorphism. The Ber-2AR strain seems to carry some lunar-rhythmic alleles, likely due to gene flow from the sympatric <italic>Atlantic ecotype</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and results below).</p><p>For QTL mapping, we then picked a set of F2 families, which all go back to a single parental pair (BsxBa-F2-34; n=272; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and designed a set of 23 SNP markers for QTL mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

However, QTL analysis with various algorithms did not reveal any significant QTL for lunar rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This absence of evidence may partially be due to the limited number of markers and individuals, as well as a specific shortcoming in the phenotyping. Arrhythmic individuals, which by chance emerge during the peak, are recorded as rhythmic. This leads to an inevitable phenotyping error for a fraction of individuals. However, in another study, we could show that this phenotyping error does not impede the detection of an oligogenic genetic architecture in QTL mapping for a comparable arrhythmic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briševac et al., 2022</xref>). As a control that in principle we had sufficient power for QTL mapping in this crossing family, we also mapped the sex determining locus, which was clearly detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

F1-31 and F1-34 differ in the degree of lunar rhythmicity, as do F2-31 and F2-34. When plotting the F2 families individually, it becomes apparent that in F2-31 all families are quite rhythmic. In contrast, in F2-34 there are highly rhythmic families (e.g. F2-34.10) and completely arrhythmic families (e.g. F2-34.3 and F2-34.4), suggesting that this F2 generation is segregating for rhythmicity alleles. The observation suggests that in the cross leading to F1-31/F2-31, the Ber-2AR parent carried a considerable fraction of rhythmic alleles (basically ‘Ber-1SL’ alleles), which rendered the resulting F1 and F2 generations largely rhythmic. The Ber-2AR parent for the F1-34/F2-34 cross seemed to carry largely arrhythmic alleles, as expected, which then segregate in the F2.

Pairwise differentiation between Ber-1SL and Ber-2AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) shows marked peaks on chromosome 1, most of which coincide with peaks in X<sup>t</sup>X and eBP<sub>mc</sub>. Notably, when assessing genetic differentiation of <italic>Baltic</italic> vs <italic>Atlantic ecotype</italic> (72 vs 72 individuals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>), there is not a single diagnostic variant (F<sub>ST</sub> = 1), and even variants with F<sub>ST</sub> ≥ 0.75 are very rare (n=63; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Genetic divergence (d<sub>xy</sub>), nucleotide diversity (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and local linkage disequilibrium (<italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic>) of the two Bergen populations do not show marked differences along or between chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). The cluster of ecotype-associated variants on chromosome 1 overlaps with three large blocks of long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>). This is also reflected in reduced linkage map length in our crossing mapping family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Reduced recombination may in part explain the clustering of divergent and ecotype-associated alleles in the middle of chromosome 1. However, the boundaries of the LD blocks do not correspond to the ecotype-associated region and differ between populations. LD blocks are not ecotype-specific. Local PCA of the strongly ecotype associated region does not reveal patterns consistent with a chromosomal inversion or another segregating structural variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">Figure 3—figure supplement 9</xref>). Thus, there is no obvious link between the clustering of ecotype-associated loci and structural variation. Notably, genetic differentiation is not generally elevated in the ecotype-associated cluster on chromosome 1, as would be expected for a segregating structural variant, but drops to baseline levels in between ecotype-associated loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these observations imply that numerous genomic loci – inside and outside the cluster on chromosome 1 – are associated with ecological adaptation and none of these are differentially fixed between ecotypes. In line with QTL mapping, this virtually excludes the possibility that only one or few loci have driven the new ecotype formation, suggesting instead that ecotype formation is based on a complex polygenic architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Support for adaptation from standing genetic variation</title><p>If, as assumed above, adaptation in these populations was indeed based mostly on standing genetic variation, one should find evidence of this in the data structure. We selected highly ecotype-associated SNPs (X<sup>t</sup>X &gt;1.152094, threshold obtained from randomized subsampling; eBP<sub>mc</sub> &gt;3; n=3,976; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s10">Figure 3—figure supplement 10A</xref>) and assessed to which degree these alleles are shared between the studied populations and other populations across Europe. Allele sharing between the Bergen populations is likely due to ongoing gene flow, and hence Bergen populations were excluded from the analysis. In turn, allele sharing between the geographically isolated Seh-2AR, Ar-2AR, Por-1SL, and He-1SL populations likely represents shared ancient polymorphism. Based on this comparison, we found that 82% of the ecotype-associated SNPs are polymorphic in both <italic>Atlantic</italic> and <italic>Baltic ecotypes</italic>, suggesting that the largest part of ecotype-associated alleles originates from standing genetic variation.

We found that 90% of the alleles associated with the Northern European ecotypes are also segregating in at least one of these southern populations, supporting the notion that adaptation in the North involves a re-assortment of existing standing genetic variation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Ecotypes differ mainly in the circadian clock and nervous system development</title><p>In the light of a polygenic architecture for ecotype formation, we can expect that usually several genes of relevant physiological pathways are affected.

Based on this confidence gene set, we then assessed the location of variants relative to genes, as well as the resulting mutational effects (SNPeff; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cingolani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s11">Figure 3—figure supplement 11</xref>; statistics in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

We transferred GO terms from other species to the <italic>Clunio</italic> confidence annotations based on gene orthology (5,393 genes; see Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). GO term enrichment analysis suggests that ecological adaptation prominently involves the circadian clock, supported by three of the top four GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In order to identify which genes drive GO term enrichment in the top 40 GO terms, we extracted the genes that harbour ecotype-associated SNPs (168 genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). We individually confirmed their gene annotations and associated GO terms. Clustering the resulting table by genes and GO terms reveals two dominant signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Many GO terms are associated with circadian timing and are driven by a small number of genes, which include almost all core circadian clock genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). As a second strong signal, almost half of the genes are annotated with biological processes involved in nervous system development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). GO term enrichment is also found for ecdysteroid metabolism, imaginal disc development, and gonad development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These processes of pre-pupal development are expected to be under circalunar clock control. The fact that circalunar clocks are responsive to moonlight and water turbulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neumann, 2014</xref>) renders the finding of GO term enrichment for ‘auditory behavior’ and ‘phototaxis’ interesting. Furthermore, many of the genes involved in nervous system development and sodium ion transport, also have GO terms that implicate them in light- and mechanoreceptor development, wiring or sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). With the exception of ‘response to hypoxia’ and possibly ‘sodium ion transmembrane transport’, there are very few GO terms that can be linked to the submerged larval habitat of the <italic>Baltic ecotype</italic>, which is usually low in salinity and can turn hypoxic in summer.

Additionally, major genes might be missed because they were not assigned GO terms. As a second line of evidence, we therefore selected variants with the highest ecotype-association by increasing the eBP<sub>mc</sub> cut-off to 10. This reduced the set of affected genes from 1,400 to 69 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9 supp10">Supplementary files 9 and 10</xref>). Additionally, we only considered genes with variants that are strongly differentiated between the ecotypes (F<sub>ST</sub> ≥ 0.75, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), leaving 13 genes in 8 distinct genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; numbered in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Most surprisingly, the two sympatric ecotypes that were considered different species turned out to be the most closely related populations in the sample, testifying the high power of ecology in generating differential adaptation in the face of gene flow. The data allowed further to infer a polygenic architecture for ecotype formation. We found that while ecotype-associated alleles differ in allele frequency, they are largely shared between ecotypes, which suggests that adaptation primarily involves standing genetic variation from many different loci. A similar re-use of existing regulatory variation has been found in ecotype formation in sticklebacks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kingman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Verta and Jones, 2019</xref> or mimicry in <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterflies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edelman et al., 2019</xref>. However, while in <italic>Heliconius</italic> alleles are shared over large evolutionary distances via introgression, <italic>Clunio</italic> ecotypes diverged recently from a common source, as is illustrated by massive and genome-wide shared polymorphism. Combined with the observation that many genes from the same biological processes have ecotype-associated alleles, this draws a picture of polygenic adaptation, involving many pre-existing alleles with probably small phenotypic effects. Particularly for adaptation in circadian timing this scenario is highly plausible. The ancestral <italic>Atlantic ecotype</italic> comprises many genetically determined circadian timing types that are adapted to the local tides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaiser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neumann, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kaiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kaiser et al., 2021</xref>). Existing genetic variants conveying emergence at dusk were likely selected or re-assorted to form the <italic>Baltic ecotype</italic>’s highly concentrated emergence at dusk.</p><p>Besides circadian timing, the ecotypes differ in circalunar timing and oviposition behavior. In our study, the vast majority of GO terms and candidate genes is consistent with these functions, leaving little risk for evolutionary ‘story-telling’ based on individual genes or GO terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pavlidis et al., 2012</xref>). We propose that good congruence between known phenotypic differences and detected biological processes could be a hallmark of polygenic adaptation, as only polygenic adaptation is expected to leave a footprint in many genes of the same ecologically relevant biological process.</p><p>Based on our genomic comparison of lunar-rhythmic and lunar-arrhythmic ecotypes, we propose three not mutually exclusive hypotheses on molecular pathways involved in the unknown circalunar clock. Firstly, <italic>Clunio</italic>’s circalunar clock is known to tightly regulate ecdysteroid-dependent development and maturation just prior to pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Neumann and Spindler, 1991</xref>). Congruently, our screen identified ecotype-associated genes in the development of imaginal discs and genital discs, and in ecdysteroid metabolism. Lunar arrhythmicity may rely on an escape of these processes from circalunar clock control. Secondly, it has been hypothesized that circalunar clocks involve a circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bünning and Müller, 1961</xref>) and such a mechanism has been experimentally confirmed in the midge <italic>Pontomyia oceana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Soong and Chang, 2012</xref>). Thus, the overwhelming circadian signal in our data might be responsible for both circadian timing adaptations and the loss of circalunar rhythms. Thirdly, <italic>Clunio</italic>’s circalunar clock is synchronized with the external lunar cycle via moonlight, as well as tidal cycles of water turbulence and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neumann, 2014</xref>). Our data suggests that sensory receptor development, wiring or sensitivity might differ between ecotypes. Interestingly, some <italic>Atlantic ecotype</italic> populations are insensitive to specific lunar time cues, either moonlight or mechanical stimulation by the tides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaiser, 2014</xref>). These pre-existing insensitivities may have been combined to form completely insensitive and hence lunar-arrhythmic ecotypes. This scenario would fit the general pattern of polygenic adaptation through a re-assortment of standing genetic variation, which emerges from our study.</p><p>In several species, genes involved in complex behavioral or ecological syndromes were found to be locked into supergenes by chromosomal inversions, for example in <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterfly mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joron et al., 2011</xref>) or reproductive morphs of the ruff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Küpper et al., 2016</xref>). While we observe a clustering of ecotype-associated alleles in <italic>Clunio</italic>, there is no obvious connection to an underlying structural variant (SV). Possibly, the SV is so complex that it did not leave an interpretable genomic signal. Alternatively, <italic>Clunio</italic>’s long history of genome rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kaiser et al., 2016</xref>) may have resulted in a clustering of ecologically relevant loci without locking them into a single SV. Clustering could be stabilized by low recombination, consistent with the observed three LD blocks, which – while not ecotype-specific – all overlap with the differentiated region. Epistatic interactions between the clustered loci and co-adaptation of alleles might further reduce the fitness of recombinants and lead to a concerted response to selection. Such an interconnected adaptive cluster might allow for more flexible evolutionary responses than a single, completely linked supergene. Further studies will have to show whether such a genome architecture exists, whether it facilitates adaptation and whether it might itself be selected for. Notably, a similar architecture with clustered, tightly linked loci was predicted to result from adaptation with gene flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011</xref>), a scenario which we found in the sympatric Bergen populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nomenclature of ecotypes</title><p>We expanded the existing naming convention of <italic>C. marinus</italic> timing types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kaiser et al., 2021</xref> to also include <italic>Baltic</italic> and <italic>Arctic ecotypes</italic>.

Therefore, in contrast to the Atlantic and Arctic ecotypes, the Baltic ecotype does not oviposit on exposed larval substrates, but on the water surface, from where the eggs sink to the bottom of the sea. This change in oviposition preference is accompanied by a specific behavioral change, namely the bending of the female’s abdomen down through the water surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Endraß, 1976b</xref>, which ensures that the egg masses are not caught in the water’s surface tension. In our laboratory culture, the animals are kept in plastic boxes with a constant water level, so that larval substrates are never exposed. Under these conditions, most of the Baltic ecotype’s egg masses will be found submerged at the bottom of the culture box, as expected. Very rarely egg masses are deposited on the walls or the lid of the box. The Atlantic and Arctic ecotypes will – in the absence of exposed larval substrates – also oviposit on the water surface. However, as they lack the characteristic banding of the female abdomen during oviposition, their egg masses will be trapped in the water’s surface tension and cannot sink to the bottom of the culture box. Their egg masses will always float on the water surface, usually with the female still sticking to the egg jelly. These floating egg masses often form aggregations on the water surface.

Based on the list of diagnostic markers, we picked eight evenly spaced regions (physical distance) on each chromosome for amplicon sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>). Multiplex PCR was performed with the QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Kit (206143) for each chromosome primer set separately (15 min at 95 °C; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 90 s and 72 °C for 90 s; 72 °C for 10 min). Sequencing libraries were prepared with standard Illumina protocols and sequenced with 150 bp paired-end on the Illumina HiSeq3000 sequencer by the Max Planck Genome Centre (Cologne, Germany). Sequencing reads from independent runs were first merged to one read file for forward and reverse reads. Those files were again subject to our genotyping pipeline (described below) with the exception that the mapped reads in SAM format undergone a coverage capping of 40 using a custom python script and the VCF was filtered for a minimum minor allele frequency of 0.25 ('--maf 0.25') and a maximum proportion of missing data per locus of 30% ('--max-missing 0.7'). All markers that were not diagnostic for the parents were removed. In case genotypes differed within an amplicon, a consensus amplicon genotype was called by majority.</p><p>For QTL mapping, the degree of rhythmicity of an individual was recorded as the number of days between its emergence day and day 9, which is the peak of emergence in the rhythmic strain (Ber-1SL). The phenotyping has a specific, inevitable shortcoming: Arrhythmic individuals can also emerge during the peak days by chance, so that this small fraction of individuals is phenotyped as rhythmic while actually being arrhythmic. As the phenotype is not normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality) it was treated as non-parametric. QTL scans were performed in the R package ‘qtl’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broman et al., 2003</xref>). The genome scans with different QTL models followed the calculation of conditional genotype probabilities in 5 cM distances and simulated genotypes from 64 imputations with the same distance. Both phenotypes (lunar rhythmicity, sex) were scanned for a single QTL model in the ‘scanone()’ function (method = ‘em’). Significance thresholds were set at top 5% of the logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for 1000 permutations. The ‘stepwise.qtl()’ function for identification of multiple and interacting QTLs returned a null QTL model for lunar rhythmicity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>DNA extraction and whole genome sequencing</title><p>For each of the seven populations, 24 field caught males (23 for Por-1SL, 25 for He-1SL) were subject to whole genome sequencing.

The fractions of genes with missing GO terms among the ecotype-associated genes and the total genes do not differ significantly (chi square test, p=0.12), suggesting both gene sets are equally affected by missing GO terms.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see, both expert reviewers like the topic and the system you have established, but have also significant concerns, mostly about interpretation, but some also regarding technical issues. The companion paper is clearly the stronger paper, but we would like nevertheless invite revision for the current paper as well, as the two papers complement each other.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Describe the power of the QTL analysis and clearly describe its limitation. State that it remains unclear how complex the genetic basis of rhythmic versus arrhythmic behavior is, and that a moderately complex genetic basis (vulgo oligogenic) cannot be excluded.</p><p>2) Be more open to the possibility that some of the apparent differentiation is due to demographic processes instead of adaptation only.</p><p>3) Be more conservative with the GO enrichment analyses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Introduction should set the scene better before moving on to Clunio. Other cases of polygenic adaptation should be mentioned. There should be some discussion of theoretical expectations for the distribution of effect sizes for adaptive traits (with or without gene flow – see Yeaman and Whitlock 2011, for example).</p><p>The interpretations are generally strong and the core points are interesting and significant for the field – the recent, polygenic adaption from standing variation, the genomic clustering and the identification of candidate pathways are all strong results. Evidence from the QTL analysis is least convincing – see specific comments below. The absence of evidence here is consistent with the results of the genome scan but that is about as far as one can go.</p><p>Absence of evidence for structural variants is also quite hard to interpret. I agree that the patterns do not obviously fit with a simple interpretation (such as a single polymorphic inversion) but there is remarkably strong LD over long distances. This might be explained by gene flow for the sympatric population pair but it appears to extend to other populations too. That said, I think the authors handle this well, leaving open the possibility that further work will reveal structural variants.</p><p>Argument for standing variation does seem good – question about maintenance – plausibly suggest LA within the ancestral Atlantic ecotype.</p><p>The GO enrichment results are very neat. A key strength is knowing the dominant axis of selection and being able to link that to genetic pathways likely to influence the relevant phenotypes (and so avoid 'story-telling'). These points are made in the Discussion but I think some of this could usefully be moved to a revised introduction, perhaps giving more emphasis to insights other than the polygenic nature of adaptation that can come from the unique features of this system.</p><p>Below I give further comments by line number:</p><p>15 – Not 'is' but 'can be' since speciation by other routes is possible and also because ecotype formation need not lead to speciation.</p><p>36 – In addition to these recent references, it would be good to recognise long-standing awareness of the role of polygenic adaptation. See, for example, Le Corre and Kremer 2012 – doi: 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05479.x</p><p>38 – A polygenic basis can be demonstrated by quantitative genetics methods such as 'regional heritability'. It is currently unclear whether this is included under 'deep genomic and genetic analysis'.</p><p>Figure 1 – The meaning of zero on the x-axis needs to be explained in the figure caption. The y-axis label (% emergence) seems to conflicts with the legend which says that these are plots of oviposition timings. Bergen is very far from the entrance to the Baltic – somewhere, the ecotype present in the Skagerrak needs to be mentioned.</p><p>118 – I am not sure why this is described as a contrast. The previous paragraph describes geographic rather than ecotype structure. That is surely confirmed by the observation that sympatric populations of different ecotypes are similar genetically.</p><p>154-164 – This inference should not be pushed too far since it is based on a single point in what is, presumably, a large area of overlap, perhaps with varying past and present mixes of the two ecotypes. So, the inferences apply to the specific sampled populations but may not generalise to the Atlantic-Baltic interaction at other locations. It also begs the question of whether this is a secondary contact, after an allopatric origin of the Baltic ecotype.</p><p>190 – How many topologies fit this pattern?</p><p>210 – Comparison to the SD locus only says that the number of loci for rhythmicity is likely to be &gt;1, and even this conclusion is questionable since sex is a binary phenotype with no environmental variance. Therefore, to conclude from the lack of detectable QTL that 'many' loci underlie rhythmicity is going too far. It may be possible to use simulation to get a better idea of the power of the QTL analysis and so the likely maximum effect size. If the vertical lines in Figure 4 represent marker loci (not specified in the legend) then the number is rather low and distribution rather uneven, perhaps making QTL detection in some parts of the genome difficult (including the important region in the centre of Chr1). I also wonder how good a measure of rhythmicity is provided by the emergence day (as an absolute deviate, if I understand correctly) for an individual. This seems like a difficult trait to handle since rhythmicity cannot easily be measured for any one individual.</p><p>280 – It is surprising that the cluster of outliers on Chr1 does not appear as a QTL, especially given the long-range LD in this area</p><p>Methods</p><p>543 – 8 markers per chromosome was on the low side. 'Evenly spaced' here was presumably in physical distance since the marker spacing on the genetic map looks far from even. This also tells us something about the distribution of recombination along the chromosomes, which may be relevant to the cluster of divergent loci on Chr1 but this connection is not made in the manuscript.</p><p>620 – The rapid decline in LD suggests that window sizes for some analyses (e.g. 100kb for population genetic statistics) was rather large. This could have influenced sweep detection, for example.</p><p>627 – It is not clear why it was necessary to down-sample to 6 individuals per population here. Using 50kb windows are, again, rather large (and adjusting windows to a number of SNPs is preferable generally for this type of analysis), but I doubt either will have impacted the results strongly.</p><p>Figure S4 – Too many decimal places are used for both distance and Fst. The comma separator in the distance should be replaced with a point (or probably the fractions of km simply ignored).</p><p>Figure S7 – TreeMix also provides a plot of %variance explained, which helps to determine the appropriate number of migration events. This could usefully be given here.</p><p>Figure S21 – Are numbers above marker lines just their IDs? It might be helpful to indicate their linkage map positions (cf comments above about even spacing on the physical vs the genetic map).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although I am enthusiastic about the promise of the system more generally and the importance of the questions posed, I have significant concerns about the manuscript and its conclusions. I am embedding my suggestions for new analyses with the descriptions of the issues above so that they are readable:</p><p>1) My primary concern in is in the design and interpretation of the QTL analysis. The QTL approach used here has low power, both due to the sample size and the number of markers used (it looks like ~8 per chromosome). The authors use an analysis of the sex determining locus as a &quot;control&quot; but because of the complete heritability of this trait in most systems it is more of a straw man to me. The authors conclude that the architecture of the trait is polygenic based on this, but we are missing key information to evaluate this. For example, what is the estimated heritability of the trait in this family and under laboratory conditions? I was also wondering if with the number of markers whether the authors might miss certain loci if the recombination rate is high.</p><p>2) There are some issues with the presentation and interpretation of the population genetic analyses. Many assumptions are made about whether introgression or ILS occurred and there are statements that are not accurate about it being &quot;impossible&quot; to distinguish between these scenarios. There are quite a lot of methods devoted to this problem, see e.g. (see Liu et al. PLoS Comp Bio 2014). Simpler tests like D-statistic and F4 ratio tests would add a lot of interpretability to these results.</p><p>3) Some of the analyses associated with ecological adaptation that follow on the QTL results struck me as ad hoc and with the potential to lead to spurious results. I am not familiar with the BayPass approach but since it is the approach that explicitly accounts for population structure it seems the one that would be most appropriate for the authors to focus on in a revised manuscript. The use of phylogenetic windows that associate with ecotype is concerning to me as given the level of ILS and gene flow that appears to be present in this system is would be very challenging to distinguish signal from noise. Related to this, in the companion manuscript the authors note that the chromosome 1 region has several inversions. I realize that the samples used in this manuscript are different but was unclear on how they excluded the possibility inversions were present on the chromosome 1 region that is highly differentiated in this analysis. This seems to be the primary region that distinguishes ecotypes in the BayPass analysis and thus is foundational to their conclusion that this signal is polygenic (since few other regions are significant in the BayPass analysis). I also noticed that there were not many QTL markers in this region of chromosome 1 regarding their previous analysis.</p><p>4) There were issues with the GO analysis that should be addressed. Because the gene universe used for GO enrichment is a subset of the full gene set, GO enrichment results will be biased. This will mostly lead to false positives (i.e. overrepresentation of a GO category due to evaluating a subset of genes that fall in that category). The authors should pair this with simulations or other analyses, or temper the strength of their claims.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82824.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Describe the power of the QTL analysis and clearly describe its limitation.

First, we conservatively only annotated orthologous genes with GO terms, avoiding false positives due to annotating duplicated genes (of essentially unknown function) with GO terms from their paralogs. Second, we think that the reviewer who is sceptic about our GO enrichment analysis has not fully appreciated the sophistication of our analysis. While details are given in the response below, briefly, we accounted for the GO term distribution of our reduced gene set when we specified the set of genes with GO terms as the custom background universe and only analyzed ecotype-associated genes with GO terms. The two subsets with GO terms are the same fraction of the respective full gene set, suggesting there are no biases in sub-setting. In our GO enrichment analysis, the Fisher’s exact test gives the exact hypergeometric probability under the null hypothesis for observing the degree of enrichment of a GO term given the custom gene universe, accounting for the potential differences in the representation of GO terms within the reduced gene set in comparison to the set of all genes. If there was any bias in the reduced gene universe, it would thereby have been accounted for in our analysis.</p><p>If the reviewer is concerned with the general stability of GO enrichment results between different subsets of a gene universe, we would like to highlight that Groß et al. have demonstrated that GO enrichment is surprisingly robust to changes in the GO term ontology and annotations (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/28/20/2671/204694), further suggesting that using a reduced gene universe should not pose major problems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The Introduction should set the scene better before moving on to Clunio.

The absence of evidence here is consistent with the results of the genome scan but that is about as far as one can go.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-written this paragraph, and now conclude that we can exclude a single or few strong-effect loci.

I agree that the patterns do not obviously fit with a simple interpretation (such as a single polymorphic inversion) but there is remarkably strong LD over long distances. This might be explained by gene flow for the sympatric population pair but it appears to extend to other populations too. That said, I think the authors handle this well, leaving open the possibility that further work will reveal structural variants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the evidence for SVs is hard to interpret.

A key strength is knowing the dominant axis of selection and being able to link that to genetic pathways likely to influence the relevant phenotypes (and so avoid 'story-telling'). These points are made in the Discussion but I think some of this could usefully be moved to a revised introduction, perhaps giving more emphasis to insights other than the polygenic nature of adaptation that can come from the unique features of this system.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the GO term enrichment results are neat, and hope that this helps to convince the other reviewer and the editor of the strength of the dataset (see detailed argumentation above and below).

However, as the method requires a pedigree and is thus not applicable to our data, we did not explicitly mention it here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 – The meaning of zero on the x-axis needs to be explained in the figure caption. The y-axis label (% emergence) seems to conflicts with the legend which says that these are plots of oviposition timings.

The zero label is on the y-axis (Emergence %).</p><p>The y-axis label does not conflict with the legend. The legend mentions “oviposition behavior” as one aspect in which the ecotypes differ. This was not listed in the figure, and may therefore have been misleading. We included “oviposition on exposed substrate” and “oviposition on water surface” in the figure. Otherwise, the legend clearly states that plots B-H are “lunar rhythms of adult emergence”.</p><p>Unfortunately, we have not sampled and we do not know any Clunio population from the Skagerrak.

The previous paragraph describes geographic rather than ecotype structure. That is surely confirmed by the observation that sympatric populations of different ecotypes are similar genetically.</p></disp-quote><p>The contrast referred to differentiated vs not differentiated populations. But this was indeed not clear from the context. So we removed the statement on this being a contrast (line 129).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>154-164 – This inference should not be pushed too far since it is based on a single point in what is, presumably, a large area of overlap, perhaps with varying past and present mixes of the two ecotypes. So, the inferences apply to the specific sampled populations but may not generalise to the Atlantic-Baltic interaction at other locations. It also begs the question of whether this is a secondary contact, after an allopatric origin of the Baltic ecotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our conclusions are drawn based on a single point, and we believe we have stated this clearly that we are only referring to Bergen. In order to further clarify this, we have added the statement that further work will be required to see if there is a larger area of overlap, and if so which evolutionary scenarios (introgression, secondary contact) apply there (lines 161-164).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>190 – How many topologies fit this pattern?</p></disp-quote><p>It is 357 topologies that fit the pattern. We have inserted the information in the text (line 200).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>210 – Comparison to the SD locus only says that the number of loci for rhythmicity is likely to be &gt;1, and even this conclusion is questionable since sex is a binary phenotype with no environmental variance. Therefore, to conclude from the lack of detectable QTL that 'many' loci underlie rhythmicity is going too far.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have rewritten the entire paragraph, delineating the shortcomings of the QTL mapping approach and concluding that the phenotype is not controlled by a single large-effect locus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It may be possible to use simulation to get a better idea of the power of the QTL analysis and so the likely maximum effect size.</p></disp-quote><p>While it might be possible to estimate the maximum effect size from simulations, we think that this effort goes beyond the scope of our manuscript and would actually be distracting. We have instead followed the editor’s suggestion and have clearly spelled out the limitations of the QTL analysis and have tempered our claims to say the trait is controlled by “more than one” locus (lines 203-229).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the vertical lines in Figure 4 represent marker loci (not specified in the legend) then the number is rather low and distribution rather uneven, perhaps making QTL detection in some parts of the genome difficult (including the important region in the centre of Chr1).</p></disp-quote><p>The vertical lines in Figure 4 represent marker loci, and we have added this information to the figure legend. We have also added the statement that the low marker number limits QTL mapping in the respective paragraph (lines 219-220). The uneven distribution of markers may make QTL detection difficult, but not for the important region in the center of Chr1 one, which is covered by the markers with low recombination at the left end of the linkage map. This in turn is important in the light of the reviewers comment below on lines 543-8, and we have therefore added this information to the manuscript (lines 264-269) and the “Figure 4—figure supplement 2”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also wonder how good a measure of rhythmicity is provided by the emergence day (as an absolute deviate, if I understand correctly) for an individual. This seems like a difficult trait to handle since rhythmicity cannot easily be measured for any one individual.</p></disp-quote><p>Rhythmicity is indeed a difficult phenotype and we have now clearly stated its specific problems in both the methods (lines 548-550) and the Results sections (lines 219-224). We can safely assume that individuals emerging outside the peak are arrhythmic. However, arrhythmic individuals which happen to emerge during the peak are scored as rhythmic, leading to a fraction of individuals with false phenotypes. We have come up with various phenotyping procedures, which are not reported here. This included the exclusion of days at the edges of the peak, which are particularly prone to phenotyping error. It also included an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that would assign phenotypes to the individuals in the peak based on the probability of being rhythmic and in a way so that the LOD score of the resulting phenotype panel, i.e. the probability of finding a significant QTL, is maximized. This algorithm successfully allowed QTL mapping based on rhythmicity in another case – see our preprint at https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.12.511720. In this preprint, the different scoring schemes and the EM algorithm converged to 1-3 detectable QTL for rhythmicity, notably based on smaller mapping families (but more markers) than used here. For the cross reported here, no scoring scheme led to detectable QTL and the EM algorithm did not converge to reproducible QTL. This may underscore that the genetic basis of arrhythmicity in the case we report here may be based on more than a few loci. But it may in part also be attributable to the difficult phenotype. Hence, in order not to over-analyze and over-interpret, we decided to only report the simplest phenotyping scheme and considerably temper our claims to say “more than one locus” contributes to the arrhythmic phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>280 – It is surprising that the cluster of outliers on Chr1 does not appear as a QTL, especially given the long-range LD in this area</p></disp-quote><p>It is surprising that the region does not show up as a QTL.

'Evenly spaced' here was presumably in physical distance since the marker spacing on the genetic map looks far from even.

We have also revised “Figure 4—figure supplement 2” (previously Supplementary Figure 21) to include the comparison between physical distance and genetic map distance. We have included the information that the divergent region on chr1 has low recombination, which may aid the clustering of divergent loci (lines 266-269).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>620 – The rapid decline in LD suggests that window sizes for some analyses (e.g. 100kb for population genetic statistics) was rather large.

Figure 6 (sweep detection) reports 10 kb windows with 1kb steps. We have added the information to the methods (lines 613-615) and the figure legend.

I am embedding my suggestions for new analyses with the descriptions of the issues above so that they are readable:</p><p>1) My primary concern in is in the design and interpretation of the QTL analysis. The QTL approach used here has low power, both due to the sample size and the number of markers used (it looks like ~8 per chromosome). The authors use an analysis of the sex determining locus as a &quot;control&quot; but because of the complete heritability of this trait in most systems it is more of a straw man to me. The authors conclude that the architecture of the trait is polygenic based on this, but we are missing key information to evaluate this. For example, what is the estimated heritability of the trait in this family and under laboratory conditions? I was also wondering if with the number of markers whether the authors might miss certain loci if the recombination rate is high.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our QTL analysis has limitations in terms of sample size, as well as number and distribution of markers. To fully acknowledge these limitations, we have now spelled them out in the results and methods section. We have also tempered our claims significantly, and now only state that QTL analysis suggests that the trait is controlled by more than one gene (lines 203-229). We have not included an estimate of heritability, as it is not straightforward to calculate it with the data we have at hand. Also, we do not over-emphasize the results of the QTL analysis – we rather acknowledge that it has limitations. Still, its results complement the whole analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are some issues with the presentation and interpretation of the population genetic analyses. Many assumptions are made about whether introgression or ILS occurred and there are statements that are not accurate about it being &quot;impossible&quot; to distinguish between these scenarios. There are quite a lot of methods devoted to this problem, see e.g. (see Liu et al. PLoS Comp Bio 2014). Simpler tests like D-statistic and F4 ratio tests would add a lot of interpretability to these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the f4 ratio test to our analysis and found that the genome-wide f4 ratio is significantly different from 0, i.e. there is some introgression. However, the signature of introgression is driven by only 775 SNPs, a small fraction of the total dataset. We have added this information in the manuscript and re-phrased our interpretation accordingly (lines 187-196).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some of the analyses associated with ecological adaptation that follow on the QTL results struck me as ad hoc and with the potential to lead to spurious results.</p></disp-quote><p>It would have been helpful if the reviewer had explicitly stated which analyses struck her/him as ad hoc. We assume it is the analyses referred to below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am not familiar with the BayPass approach but since it is the approach that explicitly accounts for population structure it seems the one that would be most appropriate for the authors to focus on in a revised manuscript. The use of phylogenetic windows that associate with ecotype is concerning to me as given the level of ILS and gene flow that appears to be present in this system is would be very challenging to distinguish signal from noise.</p></disp-quote><p>We present three different approaches to detect genomic regions associated with ecotype: phylogenetic windows, BayPass and F<sub>ST</sub> outliers. One of the strengths of our analysis is that the three approaches lead to very similar results, e.g. the clustering of ecotype-associated variants on chr1. Hence, we would not like to drop any of the analyses.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that BayPass is indeed the strongest approach. That is why in the manuscript we already focus on the BayPass results: After reporting on all three approaches (phylogenetic windows, BayPass and F<sub>ST</sub> outliers) in one paragraph each, the entirety of the downstream analyses (adaptation from standing variation, GO term analyses, highly associated loci) is based solely on the BayPass results.</p><p>While the phylogenetic approach has its weaknesses due to ILS and gene flow, we would still like to keep the single sentence reporting on it (lines 235-236), as the results are fully consistent with the other analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, in the companion manuscript the authors note that the chromosome 1 region has several inversions. I realize that the samples used in this manuscript are different but was unclear on how they excluded the possibility inversions were present on the chromosome 1 region that is highly differentiated in this analysis. This seems to be the primary region that distinguishes ecotypes in the BayPass analysis and thus is foundational to their conclusion that this signal is polygenic (since few other regions are significant in the BayPass analysis). I also noticed that there were not many QTL markers in this region of chromosome 1 regarding their previous analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We also report on putative inversions on chromosome 1 in this manuscript, represented by blocks of observed long-range LD (lines 264-266; “Figure 3—figure supplement 8”, previously Supplementary Figure 17). These putative inversions overlap with the divergent region on chromosome 1 and reduce recombination in that region, as can be seen from long-range LD, as well as the combination of physical markers distances with map length in our revised “Figure 4—figure supplement 2” (previously Supplementary Figure 21). However, we cannot find a 1:1 association of these putative inversions with the divergent region (the boundaries differ markedly), nor with ecotype (putative inversions are present in both ecotypes and rather population-specific than ecotype-specific). In a PCA of the divergent region, the individuals do not segregate in any pattern that would be typical for inversion haplotyopes (as is observed in the companion manuscript).</p><p>We would also like to point out that it is not the case that few other regions outside the chromosome 1 cluster are significant in BayPass. In our figure 3 the red dots are only the extreme outliers (p &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>), but black dots are already significant at p &lt; 0.001 (as is stated in the figure legend). Thus, ecotype associated SNPs are all over the genome, and this is foundational to the conclusion that the signal is polygenic.</p><p>The divergent region on chromosome 1 is actually covered by four out of eight markers on that chromosome. This may not have been clear in the previous version of our manuscript, and we have therefore revised “Figure 4—figure supplement 2” (previously Supplementary Figure 21) to make the connection between the linkage map and physical marker locations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There were issues with the GO analysis that should be addressed. Because the gene universe used for GO enrichment is a subset of the full gene set, GO enrichment results will be biased. This will mostly lead to false positives (i.e. overrepresentation of a GO category due to evaluating a subset of genes that fall in that category). The authors should pair this with simulations or other analyses, or temper the strength of their claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We see that our conservative approach to annotate only the subset of orthologous genes with GO terms produces an issue, namely that the genes without GO terms will be missing from the analysis, i.e. there are false negatives. In order to address this problem we have performed a second set of analysis which takes into account all genes with highly divergent SNPs irrespective of whether or not they are annotated with GO terms (lines 350-388). While we found that indeed many divergent genes are not annotated with GO terms, the functions we can assign to these genes by investigation of the relevant literature match the results from GO term analysis very well. This is the best we can do about false negatives.</p><p>The reviewer suggests there might be false positives in our analysis. We disagree with that for several reasons:</p><p>First, we think there might be a misunderstanding of the analysis due to insufficient information provided in the methods and we apologize for it. In our topGO analysis, the reduced dataset of 5,393 genes with GO terms was specified as the custom background gene universe. By specifying this reduced gene universe to topGO, with the parameter ‘allGenes’, any potential differences in the background frequencies of certain GO terms between our reduced gene set and the set of all genes will be statistically accounted for by the tool, through incorporation into the null hypothesis. 463 out of 1,400 ecotype-associated gene models were annotated with GO terms and only those were fed into the topGO analysis. The p-value returned by the Fisher’s exact test implemented in topGO calculates exactly the probability of observing at least the same amount of enrichment of a GO term when 463 genes are randomly selected out of the specified gene universe of 5,393 genes. Thus, if there is any bias in GO terms of our custom gene universe, this should have been accounted for. We also note that the fraction of genes with GO terms among the ecotype-associated genes and among the total genes is not significantly different (chi-squared test, p=0.12), indicating that both sets of genes are affected in the same way by the lack of GO term annotations.</p><p>Second, the reviewer asks for simulations to support our claims. If the reviewer is concerned with the ‘Open World Assumption’ that is inherent in Gene Ontology, namely that we have made statements about whether or not enrichment is true without knowing all observations (i.e. all GO terms for all genes) and would like us to perform simulations to evaluate the impact of using varying subsets of the gene universe on the stability of enrichment results -- Here we can say that Groß et al. have investigated the difference in results of functional analyses using GO annotations in both primates and rodents from different GO versions (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/28/20/2671/204694), i.e. different Gene universes and levels of completeness. Their conclusions are that enrichment results are surprisingly stable to changes in ontology and annotation. Hence, we conclude that our reduced gene universe will very likely not cause major issues to the reliability of the conducted enrichment analysis.</p><p>In order to avoid these possible misunderstandings, we have inserted the respective information in the methods section (lines 670-681).</p><p>We also want to point out that the other reviewer considers our GO term enrichment results particularly strong.</p></body></sub-article></article>
