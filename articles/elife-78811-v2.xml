activity, yet the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. The developmental transition has important functional consequences, as the latter state is thought to allow for more efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of information. Here, we show that, in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), neural activity during the first two postnatal weeks decorrelates following specific spatial patterns. This process is accompanied by a concomitant tilting of excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratio toward inhibition. Using optogenetic manipulations and neural network modeling, we show that the two phenomena are mechanistically linked, and that a relative increase of inhibition drives the decorrelation of neural activity. Accordingly, in mice mimicking the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, subtle alterations in E-I ratio are associated with specific impairments in the correlational structure of spike trains. Finally, capitalizing on EEG data from newborn babies, we show that an analogous developmental transition takes place also in the human brain. Thus, changes in E-I ratio control the (de)correlation of neural activity and, by these means, its developmental imbalance might contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>E-I ratio</kwd><kwd>decorrelation</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>neural network

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural activity in the developing brain has several unique traits, such as discontinuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chini and Hanganu-Opatz, 2021</xref>), extremely low firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shen and Colonnese, 2016</xref>), a loose temporal coordination of excitation and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dorrn et al., 2010</xref>), and weak modulation by behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cirelli and Tononi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chini et al., 2019</xref>). These patterns of early activity have been described in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vanhatalo and Kaila, 2006</xref>) as well as in disparate model organisms ranging from fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avitan et al., 2017</xref>) to flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akin et al., 2019</xref>), and from rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Khazipov et al., 2004</xref>) to brain organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Trujillo et al., 2019</xref>). As brain networks mature, they gradually evolve into exhibiting motives with adult-like spatiotemporal properties. Oscillatory events become more rhythmic, increasing their amplitude and average frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bitzenhofer et al., 2020</xref>), oscillation patterns become more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Trujillo et al., 2019</xref>), the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory conductances (E-I ratio) decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), excitation and inhibition tighten on a temporal scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dorrn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moore et al., 2018</xref>), and brain activity decorrelates and sparsifies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golshani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rochefort et al., 2009</xref>). The relationship between decorrelation and E-I ratio has been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical work in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhou and Yu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shew et al., 2014</xref>). Decorrelated and sparse activity is a hallmark of adult spike trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olshausen and Field, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vinje and Gallant, 2000</xref>) and artificial neural networks alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cun et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frankle and Carbin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cogswell et al., 2016</xref>). This activity pattern bears important functional and behavioral relevance, as it allows for efficient storing and retrieval of information, while minimizing energy consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olshausen and Field, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cun et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frankle and Carbin, 2019</xref>). However, it is still unknown whether changes in E-I ratio underlie the developmental decorrelation of brain activity. The (patho)physiological relevance of this process is underscored by the hypothesis that altered E-I ratio is the hallmark of later-emerging neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Trakoshis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao and Penzes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Medendorp et al., 2021</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao and Penzes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferguson and Gao, 2018</xref>), diseases that have also been linked to disruption of correlated activity in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Luongo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hamm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zick et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>E-I ratio is controlled by the interplay between pyramidal neurons (PYRs) and interneurons (INs). Throughout development, both populations of neurons migrate into the cortex following an ‘inside-out’ sequence that corresponds to their birthdate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sidman and Rakic, 1973</xref>). This process is guided by cues provided by PYRs, which populate the cortical layers at an earlier time point than INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lim et al., 2018</xref>). The functional integration of INs into the cortical circuitry is a slow process that is initiated by the establishment of transient circuits. During the first postnatal week, mouse inhibitory circuits are dominated by somatostatin-positive (SST<sup>+</sup>) INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tuncdemir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marques-Smith et al., 2016</xref>). At later time points, parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) INs are also integrated into local networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tuncdemir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marques-Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guan et al., 2018</xref>). In rodents, the development of inhibitory synapses is not complete until postnatal day (P)30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gour et al., 2021</xref>). It is thus conceivable that the developmental strengthening of inhibitory synapses and the ensuing tilting of E-I ratio toward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) might underlie the decorrelation of neural activity. In favor of this hypothesis, chronic manipulation of IN activity in the murine barrel cortex results in altered temporal and spatial structure of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Che et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Modol et al., 2020</xref>). However, direct evidence linking E-I ratio and the strengthening of inhibition with the developmental decorrelation of brain activity is still lacking. Further, it is still debated whether GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, actually exerts an inhibitory effect also during early development. It has long been thought that, in the rodent neocortex, GABA might act as an excitatory neurotransmitter for the first 2 postnatal weeks, and only subsequently ‘switch’ to an inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalemaki et al., 2021</xref>). These findings have been called into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Che et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kirmse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Murata and Colonnese, 2020</xref>), but the argument remains open.</p><p>Here, we combined in vivo extracellular electrophysiological recordings and optogenetics with neural network modeling to systematically explore the relationship between E-I ratio and the decorrelation of neural activity in the developing rodent and human brain. In the murine medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain area where E-I ratio is of particular relevance in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Trakoshis et al., 2020</xref>), we show that GABA inhibits neural activity from the very first postnatal days, and that an increase in the strength of the exerted inhibition progressively decorrelates the prefrontal spike trains. Using neural network modeling and bidirectional optogenetic manipulation of IN activity, we further uncover how the inhibition increase drives the change in the correlation structure. Moreover, in a mouse model of impaired neurodevelopment, we report that excessively low E-I ratio causes impaired spike train correlations. Finally, we investigate two different EEG datasets and illustrate the translational relevance of these findings by providing first insights into analogous developmental processes that take place in newborn babies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The patterns of prefrontal activity dynamically evolve with age</title><p>To investigate the relationship between E-I ratio and the decorrelation of neural activity that occurs throughout development, we interrogated a large dataset (<italic>n</italic>=117 mice) of multi-site extracellular recordings of local field potential (LFP) and single unit activity (SUA) from the prelimbic subdivision of the mPFC of unanesthetized P2-12 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Across this developmental phase, the LFP evolves from an almost complete lack of activity (silent periods) to uninterrupted (continuous) activity, passing through intermediate stages in which silent periods alternate with bouts of neuronal activity (active periods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To quantify this transition, we calculated the proportion of active periods over the recording and found that it monotonically increases over age (age slope = 0.88, 95% CI [0.84; 0.93], p&lt;10<sup>–50</sup>, generalized linear model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The increase in the proportion of active periods resulted from the augmentation of both number and duration of individual active periods until continuous activity was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Accompanying these high-level changes in activity dynamics, the maximum amplitude of active periods, the broadband LFP power, and the SUA firing rate exponentially increased over age (age slope = 0.24, 0.47, and 0.21, 95% CI [0.18; 0.30], [0.40; 0.53], and [0.15; 0.27], p&lt;10<sup>–9</sup>, p&lt;10<sup>–23</sup>, p&lt;10<sup>–11</sup>, respectively, generalized linear model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Active periods and local field potential (LFP) properties of the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) across the first 2 postnatal weeks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Claudi et al., 2021</xref>) of extracellular recordings in the mPFC of P2-12 mice (left), and representative LFP traces from P3, P6, P9, and P12 mice (right).

In particular, a relative increase in inhibition is thought of leading to a steeper PSD slope (higher 1/f exponent), whereas the opposite occurs when E-I ratio shifts toward excitation. Given that INs have a more protracted integration into cortical circuits than PYRs, this process might be accompanied by a developmental shift of the E-I ratio toward inhibition. In line with this hypothesis, the PSD slope grew steeper over age, as readily observed when the PSD was normalized by the area under the curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To quantify this observation, we parameterized the PSDs using a recently published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>), and confirmed that the 1/f exponent increases with age (age slope = 0.12, 95% CI [0.11; 0.14], p&lt;10<sup>–27</sup>, linear model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the monitoring of age-dependent dynamics of prefrontal LFP and SUA let us propose that, throughout development, E-I ratio tilts toward inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>E-I ratio controls pairwise spike train correlations in a neural network model</title><p>To explore the relationship between the 1/f exponent, E-I ratio, and the (de)correlation of neuronal spike trains, we simulated a neural network of 400 interconnected conductance-based leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Both neuron types received input noise and PYRs received an additional external excitatory Poisson stimulus with a constant spike rate of 1.5 spikes/s (see Materials and methods for details on the model). We parametrically varied the AMPA and GABA conductances on both PYRs and INs and defined the network’s net inhibition strength as the ratio between the inhibitory and excitatory conductances. The network was simulated for 60 s for each parameter combination. The network’s LFP was defined as the sum of the absolute values of all synaptic currents on PYRs, which was shown to be a reliable proxy of experimental LFP recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Trakoshis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mazzoni et al., 2008</xref>).

To test the role of inhibition in generating the population dynamics, we systematically varied the <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>rev</italic></sub> driving the inhibitory post-synaptic currents. Analogously to what has been previously shown, excitatory and depolarizing GABA both resulted in runaway excitation and average firing rates that were in the 100–1000 Hz range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>rev</italic></sub> that were at least 5 mV lower than <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>rest</italic></sub> resulted in stable networks, but only <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>rev</italic></sub> that were 10 mV or lower than <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>rest</italic></sub> were able to fully recapitulate the population trajectories that we experimentally observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>).</p><p>Thus, while the network excitation derived from IN inhibition increased throughout development, the dynamics with which the PYR-IN network responds to IN inhibition did not change during the first 2 postnatal weeks.

The dataset was obtained from extracellular recordings of SUA from the mPFC of P4-10 control and dual-hit genetic-environmental (GE) mice. GE mice mimic the etiology (combined disruption of <italic>Disc1</italic> gene and maternal immune activation) and cognitive impairment of schizophrenia, showing already at neonatal age reduced excitatory activity in the superficial layers of the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). On the flipside, deep layers of the mPFC are not affected. Therefore, we hypothesized that GE mice have lower STTC values than controls (i.e. mice lacking the abnormal genetic background and influence of environmental stressor). Considering the layer specificity of the deficits identified in the mPFC of GE mice, we reasoned that this effect should be present in spike trains from neurons in the superficial layers. Overall, GE mice had lower spike train correlations when compared to controls (main condition effect, p=0.032, 1 s lag, linear mixed-effect model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Here, we show that, even though INs inhibit neuronal activity already in the first postnatal week, the relative strength of the exerted inhibition increases with age, leading to a decrease of E-I ratio. This developmental process contributes to a transition in brain dynamics from early highly synchronous activity patterns to decorrelated neural activity later in life. We further show that an early imbalance in E-I ratio in the mPFC results in altered temporal neural dynamics. Last, leveraging two EEG datasets recorded in newborn babies, we provide evidence for analogous developmental processes taking place in the human cortex.</p><p>Inhibitory synaptogenesis is an exquisitely specific process that is orchestrated by distinct molecular programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Favuzzi et al., 2019</xref>) and neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>). Its timeline is protracted and it extends to early adulthood in the mouse somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gour et al., 2021</xref>). PYRs are thought of playing an instructive role in this process, by providing molecular cues guiding IN migration and by regulating their survival in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). Inhibitory circuits during the first postnatal week have several peculiarities, including a predominance of inhibitory synapses by SST<sup>+</sup> INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tuncdemir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marques-Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guan et al., 2018</xref>) and the presence of hub neurons that control the formation of functional assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cossart, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Picardo et al., 2011</xref>). One of the unique traits of early inhibitory circuits that has garnered much attention is the hypothesis that GABA might act as an excitatory neurotransmitter. This excitatory action of GABA has been most intensively investigated at single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garaschuk et al., 2000</xref>) and has been proposed to result from the low expression of KCC2, a potassium chloride cotransporter extruding chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>), which leads to high intracellular chloride concentration in immature neurons. The ‘GABA-switch’ from an excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitter has been suggested to take place between the first and the second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>). Refuting this hypothesis, recent studies have shown that, already during the first postnatal week, GABAergic transmission, while depolarizing on single neurons, exerts an inhibitory action on population activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Che et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kirmse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Murata and Colonnese, 2020</xref>). In line with this latter interpretation, the present study provides SUA-level evidence of the inhibitory effect of GABA in vivo already in the first postnatal days. This is of particular interest considering that the PFC is a brain area whose development is thought of being more protracted than sensory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chini and Hanganu-Opatz, 2021</xref>), where the early effects of GABA have been more intensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Che et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kirmse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Murata and Colonnese, 2020</xref>). We show that optogenetic inhibition of cortical INs results in a widespread increase of SUA firing rates and, conversely, increasing their activity leads to a reduction of neuronal activity. While the strength of the inhibition exerted by INs increases throughout development, the network effects generated by INs do not qualitatively change with age. Already during the first postnatal week, optogenetic inhibition of INs leads to a paradoxical increase in their firing rate. This dynamics is characteristic of ISNs that have a high degree of recurrent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sadeh and Clopath, 2020</xref>), a regime that has been proposed to emerge at later developmental phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rahmati et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we find experimental and computational evidence that the mPFC might operate in an ISN regime already shortly after birth. Neural network modeling suggests that this is only possible in the presence of a strong hyperpolarizing chloride drive at inhibitory synapses. Of note, we only observed a paradoxical effect, the signature of ISN networks, in response to optogenetic inhibition and not stimulation of INs. This apparent discrepancy is most likely the result of the approach that we employed to express an inhibitory opsin in INs. The combination of two mouse lines (see Materials and methods) targeted a larger proportion of neurons than the approach that combined a mouse line with viral injections (see Materials and methods) and has been used to express the inhibitory opsin. The proportion of activated/inhibited neurons is a critical factor in determining whether a paradoxical response is elicited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sadeh and Clopath, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sanzeni et al., 2020</xref>). Similar discrepancies between the two different targeting approaches have been previously reported for the adult cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sanzeni et al., 2020</xref>). Further, in neural network models, the paradoxical effect is more readily observed in response to IN inhibition than IN stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sadeh and Clopath, 2020</xref>). Thus, while the effects of GABA might differ within brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Murata and Colonnese, 2020</xref>), our data supports the notion that, in the mPFC, GABA has an inhibitory role already at P2 and that even in the first postnatal days, the cortex operates in an ISN regime.</p><p>As the brain develops and inhibitory synaptogenesis progresses, the temporal coordination between excitatory and inhibitory transmission tightens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dorrn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moore et al., 2018</xref>) with a relative strengthening of inhibition with respect to excitation (i.e. a decrease in E-I ratio) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). While E-I ratio is thought of being a critical feature of healthy neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moore et al., 2018</xref>), the functional consequences of the developmental E-I ratio decrease are still poorly understood. Individually, E-I ratio imbalances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Trakoshis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao and Penzes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Medendorp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferguson and Gao, 2018</xref>) and altered correlational structure of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Luongo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hamm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zick et al., 2018</xref>) have both been linked to mental disorders. Studying how these two processes are linked to each other is therefore likely to be insightful for understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders. To address this knowledge gap, we explored the impact of varying E-I ratio in a biologically plausible neural network model. In line with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Trakoshis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gao et al., 2017</xref>), we show that E-I ratio can be indirectly tracked by measuring the 1/f exponent, a notion that we leveraged to show that there is an E-I ratio decrease in the mouse and human mPFC. We further show that, in a neural network model, a relative increase in inhibition results in decreased pairwise correlations of spike trains. Confirming the modeling results, we report that, in the mouse mPFC, the inferred E-I ratio decrease taking place across the first two postnatal weeks is accompanied by a reduction in pairwise spike trains correlations, as previously described in sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golshani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rochefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cutts and Eglen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>). To further strengthen the link between the two processes, we bidirectionally manipulated the activity of prefrontal INs by light. In line with our hypothesis, optogenetic stimulation of INs (i.e. decreasing E-I ratio) results in reduced correlations among spike trains. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of INs (i.e. increasing E-I ratio) increases correlations among spike trains. IN inhibition results in increased spike train correlations even though, in the last portion of the optogenetic protocol, IN displays a paradoxical increase in firing rate. This might indicate that even a transient reduction in inhibition strength might be sufficient to increase neural correlations. Both the age-dependent as well as IN manipulation-induced effects on activity correlations do not impact all spike train pairs in a uniform manner. Rather, neuron pairs that are close to each other are more severely affected than those that are farther apart. While an IN subtype-specific dissection of the mechanisms accounting for neural activity decorrelation is beyond the scope of this study, this effect might be explained by the fact that PV<sup>+</sup> INs preferentially provide local inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>) and have a particularly protracted integration into the prefrontal cortical circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bitzenhofer et al., 2020</xref>). PV<sup>+</sup> INs generally provide inhibition at the soma and the axon initial segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>), a position that is particularly suited to inhibit the spiking output of PYRs and thereby reduce pairwise spiking correlations. The progressive embedment of PV<sup>+</sup> INs in the rodent prefrontal circuitry has also been suggested to be responsible for the increase in the average frequency of the LFP oscillations that are generated by layer 2/3 PYRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bitzenhofer et al., 2020</xref>). Future studies might shed light on whether this process is related to the decorrelation of brain activity.</p><p>In the adult brain and modern artificial neural networks, most neurons are only sparsely active and correlations between neurons are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olshausen and Field, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cun et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frankle and Carbin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>). The relationship between correlations, network activity, and behavioral performance is complex and has been reviewed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kohn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, correlated activity has been proposed as limiting the amount of information that can be encoded and as being energy-inefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olshausen and Field, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lennie, 2003</xref>). Conversely, theoretical and experimental work has shown that correlated neural activity can also enhance the robustness of information transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Valente et al., 2021</xref>). In sensory cortices, the decorrelated adult activity patterns result from a developmental sparsification process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golshani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rochefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Modol et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cutts and Eglen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mizuno et al., 2021</xref>). Along the same lines, neural activity has also been shown to become less global and more local throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wosniack et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we describe that a similar transition also occurs in a higher-order brain area such as the mPFC. Several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have been proposed, such as a transition in synaptic plasticity rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wosniack et al., 2021</xref>), changes in NMDA receptor composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mizuno et al., 2021</xref>), a decrease in the input resistance of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golshani et al., 2009</xref>), or a combination of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rahmati et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we propose that an increase in inhibition also plays a role in the decorrelation of neural activity.</p><p>Further, we show that the 1/f exponent derived from LFP recorded from the mouse mPFC increases along the first two postnatal weeks. Similarly, the 1/f exponent derived from the frontal derivations of EEG recorded from human babies increases between the 36th and the 45th PCW (from ~2 weeks preterm birth to ~7 weeks after birth, when considering 38 weeks as the average length of human pregnancy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jukic et al., 2013</xref>). This is the opposite of processes taking place in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>), between childhood and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">He et al., 2019</xref>), and even from the 1st to the 7th month of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schaworonkow and Voytek, 2021</xref>). The decline in the 1/f exponent (indicative of increased E-I ratio) occurring between childhood and elderliness can be explained by the decline of brain GABA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hermans et al., 2018</xref>) and cortical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lissemore et al., 2018</xref>). This is however unlikely to explain the discrepancy between the current study and the effect reported for babies of 1–7 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schaworonkow and Voytek, 2021</xref>), an age range that borders the one that we investigated. In age-matched mice, a wave of interneuronal cell death takes place around this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wong et al., 2018</xref>) and might induce an early shift from E-I ratio decrease to E-I ratio increase. Whether a similar process occurs in humans too and might explain the discrepancy between the two studies is still unknown and, due to the ethical and technical limitations of invasive recordings in humans, difficult to address. Directly investigating pairwise spike train correlations is not feasible without resorting to invasive intracranial recordings. It is however noteworthy that, albeit at a different spatial and temporal resolution, the density of phase and amplitude EEG spatial correlations decreases between the last trimester of pregnancy and the first weeks of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Omidvarnia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tokariev et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, an impaired structure of frontal correlations at birth, such as the one induced by birth prematurity, is predictive of impaired neurological performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tokariev et al., 2019</xref>). Future work should address whether changes in E-I ratio also underlie the developmental maturation of these high-level EEG spatial correlations.</p><p>Several studies have reported E-I imbalances in the mPFC of mouse models of mental disorders and in patients affected by these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Trakoshis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Medendorp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferguson and Gao, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hamm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zick et al., 2018</xref>). Following this stream of evidence, we investigated a dataset previously obtained from in vivo electrophysiological recordings from the mPFC of a mouse mimicking the etiology of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bitzenhofer et al., 2021</xref>), generated by combining two mild stressors, a genetic and an environmental one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Their synergistic combination results in severe deficits affecting PYRs that reside in the superficial layers of the mPFC. These neurons display a simplified dendritic arborization, a severe reduction in spine density and firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, GE mice have a reduced E-I ratio in the mPFC superficial layers, which leads to diminished STTC values among spike trains. While in sensory areas correlation might limit information carrying capacity, in associative brain areas, like the mPFC, correlations are thought of improving signal readout, and increased correlations have been linked to improved behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Valente et al., 2021</xref>). This data support the hypothesis that imbalances in E-I ratio might be a possible unifying framework for understanding the circuit dysfunction characterizing neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>). In this perspective, it is relevant that the development of E-I ratio can also be quantified, albeit indirectly, also from EEG recordings of newborn babies. The fact that two different EEG datasets yield similar estimations for the age-dependent changes in the 1/f exponent supports the notion that this parameter might be a robust biomarker of E-I ratio development with potential translational relevance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>LFP and SUA data that were newly generated for this study are available at the following open-access repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gin.g-node.org/mchini/development_EI_decorrelation">https://gin.g-node.org/mchini/development_EI_decorrelation</ext-link>.</p><p>Code supporting the findings of this study is available at the following open-access repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mchini/Chini_et_al_EI_decorrelation">https://github.com/mchini/Chini_et_al_EI_decorrelation</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chini, 2021</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental models and subject details</title><p>All experiments were performed in compliance with the German laws and following the European Community guidelines regarding the research animals use.

The procedure was carried out under isoflurane anesthesia (induction: 5%; maintenance: 1–3%, lower for older pups, higher for younger pups). Neck muscles were cut to reduce muscle artifacts.

To detect and quantify the properties of active periods, we developed a novel detection algorithm. For this, the extracellular signal was band-pass filtered (4–20 Hz) and downsampled to 100 Hz, before being averaged across recording electrodes. The average signal (raw and z-scored) was then passed through a boxcar square filter (500 ms) on which a hysteresis threshold was applied. Active periods were firstly detected as oscillatory peaks exceeding an absolute or relative threshold (100 µV or four standard deviations, respectively) and subsequently extended to all neighboring time points that exceed a lower threshold (50 µV or two standard deviations, respectively). The combination of absolute and relative thresholding makes this approach suitable to a wide range of signals, from the highly discontinuous brain activity of P2 mice, to the nearly continuous brain activity of P11-12 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Neighboring active periods whose inter-active period interval was shorter than 1 s were merged.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sampsa Vanhatalo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript by Chini et al., investigates emergent dynamics of neural activity during brain development, focusing on differences in the relative strength of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Using a combination of in vivo recordings and optogenetic experiments with computer modelling, the authors show that inhibition is functionally present in newborn frontal areas. They also describe how this process is dysfunctional in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder. The work challenges the simplified view of the switch in GABAergic excitation to inhibition. By phenomenologically comparing rodent and human infant EEG data, the manuscript may provide translational bridges with significant impact for clinical studies.</p><p>While there was overall consensus on the value of the study, issues arise in particular with the points listed below. We all agree that you will need to address these points specifically to warrant publication. Please, note that the next review round should reach a consensus.</p><p>(1) An issue related with EEG human data and in particular regarding how are they generated and analyzed. First, we are unclear about the real N and the type of recordings obtained from these infants. Second, we need to understand the selection of the frequency band (1-40Hz), since most data suggest that neonates have most of their signal power at &lt;1Hz and there is very little contribution for &gt;20Hz. We feel you should adhere to the most commonly used standards. Finally, we are surprised about the increase in slope with early maturation, which is not in agreement with earlier publications. Importantly, addressing these points is critical for your manuscript to advance to the next step. While we will be open to discuss the option of leaving human data out of the revised version, we feel they represent an important addition that increases the impact.</p><p>(2) A second concern is with optogenetic data in Figure 4. We have difficulties in understanding the number of units per mice and per group, as they refer to age. We feel the ranges of ages used should provide a consistent number of samples. We are also unclear about the statistical design, whether it is running longitudinally or not. We would like to see these parts clarified and improved and an appropriate statistical contrast for nested design implemented.</p><p>(3) We are unclear about the paradoxical effects of optogenetic activations of INs. This point will require clarification and possibly additional analysis.</p><p>(4) Finally, regarding the model we are not completely clear about the assumptions made, in particular regarding lognormal distribution of synaptic connection strengths. We feel that testing the effect of other distributions may improve the conclusion and better support the model.</p><p>Please, also go over the specific points raised in the individual reviews and address them all in your revised version and rebuttal letter.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall this is a nice paper which does a good job of exploring an important question using a broad range of different approaches. The focus on PFC and cross-species analysis are particularly novel and important. There are a few points which I feel could be clearer and some issues surrounding data in Figure 4 where a better picture of how the experiments were performed and analysed would be beneficial. Code is made available via GitHub in keeping with open access policy of the journal.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>Claim that mechanism behind decorrelation of activity unknown is not strictly accurate, numerous factors have been shown to contribute, including sensory input, synaptic changes and developmental alterations in EGABA</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Claim that SOM integrate before PV is not accurate. See, Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011; Anastasiades et al., 2016; Daw et al., 2007. They make a similar claim in the discussion &quot;Early inhibitory circuits have several peculiarities, including a predominance of inhibitory synapses by SOM+ INs&quot;. Again this is not supported by the data. SOM interneurons certainly have an important and unique role in early development. But this is not to say that PV synapses are less numerous or weaker (in fact one of the papers they cite shows that they are much stronger at P12 and have a 20% higher connection probability than SOM cells).</p><p>Results:</p><p>In the model of the local network do they include changes in GABAergic driving force (i.e reversal potential) or just the conductance? Although they provide evidence that GABA does not appear excitatory during early development, it does not mean that it may not be depolarizing and that EGABA may change across this period. This change could influence their results. Others have shown developmental changes in EGABA within the developing PFC and so this should be taken into account.</p><p>Could differences in baseline firing across P4-12 make it harder to detect inhibition at early ages due to a floor effect? Could this contribute in part to their observation?</p><p>Were any recordings made at P4 in Figure 4? If not, why not state P5-6 rather than P4-6?</p><p>In terms of the mice recorded at different ages. Were mice recorded at all ages in each time window? For example, at P11 there are 2 mice who show a very low modulation index but at P12 all the units seem to be strongly modulated, but there are only 2 data points plotted vs 4 at P11 and 7 at P10. Were only 2 mice recorded at P12, or do the data points overlap at certain ages? Overall, how many mice were recorded at each age?</p><p>In the methods for Figure 4 they state that laser power was &quot;adjusted until it gave the desired response&quot; how was this defined? Was there a difference in laser power across the different ages, could this account for differences in inhibition?</p><p>Figure S3B How were positive neurons quantified? Is this per slice or per animal?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>While the strength of the inhibition exerted by INs increases throughout development, the ability of INs to control cortical inhibition does not qualitatively change with age. Already during the first postnatal week, inhibition of INs leads to a paradoxical increase in their firing rate.</p><p>This sentence could be a little clearer.</p><p>IN inhibition results in increased spike-train correlations even though, in the last portion of the optogenetic stimulation, IN display a paradoxical increase in firing rate. As could this. Is there a way that you could rephrase? Stimulation typically means to activate cells, whereas you are suppressing them. Even though there is a paradoxical increase in firing this occurs at the network level, this is not due to the direct effect of light and so the term &quot;optogenetic stimulation&quot; is not accurate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. As mentioned in the weakness, the authors should go into more details about the paradoxical effect. Why is not seen for optogenetic activations of INs, only for the optogenetic inactivations? Also, it would be good to bring in some citations of experimental and theoretical work (Sanzeni et al. <italic>eLife</italic>, Sadeh et al. J Neuro 2017).</p><p>2. The authors should really put their work in the context of other studies who have measured and analyzed spontaneous activity and discussed how it evolves over time. For e.g. the Lohmann lab proposes the existence of L and H events (low and high participation rate events observed in the primary visual cortex), see Siegel et al. 2012. In a modeling study with the Gjorgjieva lab (Wosniack et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2021), they proposed a different mechanism that can lead to the desynchronization (or sparsification) of activity during development, where L events increase in frequency while H events increase. This should be at least discussed. In Leighton et al. (Curr Biol 2021) the Lohmann lab also talked about the role of inhibition (from SOMs) in development. Finally, an interesting study that should be discussed is Rahmati et al. (Sci Rep 2017) which also presents results on sparsification of neural activity in development and the connection to inhibition stabilization.</p><p>3. Can the authors discuss the use of lognormal weights in the model? What happens if they are constant or taken from a lognormal distribution? I don't doubt they come from a lognormal distribution in the real circuit, but it would be important for the model to point out why this is important, as many other modeling papers ignore this fact.</p><p>4. The authors should present a more extensive discussion of why decorrelation is something that the network might strive to archive and how this relates to the onset of sensory experience and the efficient processing of sensory information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My review at this phase will only focus on the few items that I hope would help the authors strengthen the work:</p><p>(1) In your introduction, you note that E-I ratio is important in your context because it &quot;is the hallmark of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or schizophrenia&quot;. Please note that you are mixing periods in the lifespan: your work is on neonatal brain development, while those disorders are about toddler age (autism) or much much later in life (schizophrenia).</p><p>(2) The work is very strong with the case on early inhibition. I find it a bit confusing how the work starts from making a case why the slope of PSD curve (1/f exponent) should be taken as a relevant measure of E-I.</p><p>Why not move this part towards the end, just before you introduce the human data? After all, this component appears to have value mainly because it allows you to link your findings on inhibition to the human dataset.</p><p>(3) I find it a bit perplexing that you show increase in slope with early maturation. This is opposite to what has been published earlier, and what is the general finding among clinicians. The early EEG (from prematurity to the end of neonatal period) is characterized by a rapid/robust decline in the lowest frequency power -&gt;this translates directly to a decrease of slope.</p><p>So there is something unexpected here?</p><p>(4) I would also like to understand why you select to analyse 1-40Hz while recent papers have clearly indicated that (i) neonates have most of their signal power &lt;1hz, and (ii) there is very little to be found &gt;20hz.</p><p>(5) The human dataset is elusive: You tell that you had N=1100 and N=42 infants (Figure 8 N=1110?`). This would be the by far largest newborn dataset ever published. BUT the papers you cite only have 71+42+40=153 EEG recordings (assuming that they are from different infants). Also, there is no information about the kind of recordings done from these infants.</p><p>So, in brief, the information about human data is virtually missing; please elaborate.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An increase of inhibition drives the developmental decorrelation of neural activity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>– Regarding human data: while we were overall positive, we still feel the human data may require some clarification in view of the previous concerns. We appreciated your argument that there is no change of slope caused by contribution at 20-40Hz, but they were based on mouse data only (Figure 1-FS1). If you could provide some sort of additional/control analysis on human data as supplementary material, we feel that could help. We would like to stress this is just advice that we leave to your consideration. Importantly, we feel that it would be useful to discuss your observations on changes in slope with early maturation in the context of earlier publications. Please, be sure you add text to the discussion addressing these and previously raised issues and caveats regarding human results.</p><p>– In terms of the optogenetic data in Figure 4, we feel some additional clarification is required specifically regarding the way data is represented (per trial not per mice), and potential issues of low N.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors seem to have addressed my previous comments on an earlier version of this manuscript. I still think their statements regarding the predominance and importance of SST cells are a little strong, and largely unnecessary given they don't study them in this paper, but I guess it is still a matter of debate within the field.</p><p>In terms of the optogenetic data in Figure 4, their explanation makes sense. It does however seem a little strange to plot 2 trials from the same animal as separate data points. Their analysis seems to account for this, but it does mean that the N is a little low for some time points. That said their new analysis accounting for only the top 50% of active units seems to show a very robust effect consistent with their observations and overall model of inhibition's role in the early network.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have appropriately addressed all of my, and the other reviewers', comments. There are still a few typos which I'm sure will be fixed in the final version (e.g. line 707 in the version with tracked changes &quot;such AS a transition in synaptic plasticity rules&quot;, line 653 the word In's should be INs (all capital)). Overall, this is a very nice paper that people in the field will enjoy reading.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An increase of inhibition drives the developmental decorrelation of neural activity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Please, consider this point carefully when providing a revised version. We specifically ask for the issues raised by the non-responding reviewer to be explicitly addressed in the manuscript.

We feel you should adhere to the most commonly used standards. Finally, we are surprised about the increase in slope with early maturation, which is not in agreement with earlier publications. Importantly, addressing these points is critical for your manuscript to advance to the next step. While we will be open to discuss the option of leaving human data out of the revised version, we feel they represent an important addition that increases the impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion created by the wrong reference that references only part of the open access dataset. We corrected the reference.</p><p>We clarified that for the EEG analysis, we already only considered the 1-20 Hz band, whereas 1-40 Hz band was used only for LFP data. We agree with the observation that in the immature brain, most of the PSD power resides at ultra-slow frequencies. However, we do not quantify the PSD power, but rather estimate the slope of the PSD. For this measure, it is less relevant, where most PSD power resides. On the contrary, it has been suggested to choose frequency bands that are “uncorrupted by oscillatory peaks” (Gao et al., 2017). Further, as shown in Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, there is no change in the slope between 20 and 40 Hz. Thus, the 1/f slope estimation is not biased by the specific frequency range that we chose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A second concern is with optogenetic data in Figure 4. We have difficulties in understanding the number of units per mice and per group, as they refer to age. We feel the ranges of ages used should provide a consistent number of samples. We are also unclear about the statistical design, whether it is running longitudinally or not. We would like to see these parts clarified and improved and an appropriate statistical contrast for nested design implemented.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we added the required information (see reply to reviewers). We have also provided additional analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D) and a figure (Figure 1) for the reviewers that addresses some of the criticism that was raised with respect to the optogenetic experiments / analyses.</p><p>To analyze these experiments, we used a generalized linear mixed-effect model (logit link) with mouse as random effect, and estimated the overall effect that age has on the proportion of units that increase/decrease their firing rate in response to optogenetics. Compared to ANOVAs, generalized linear mixed-effect models estimate the regression coefficients while explicitly taking in consideration the nested nature of the data (i.e. multiple single units per mouse), while allowing more freedom with respect to missing datapoints and the distribution of the data (in this case, since it is not normally distributed as it is bounded between 0 and 1, we used a logit link).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) We are unclear about the paradoxical effects of optogenetic activations of INs. This point will require clarification and possibly additional analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided further modeling analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 1G-J) that strengthens the conclusions of the manuscript with respect to this point. Further, we have expanded the discussion of the paradoxical effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Finally, regarding the model we are not completely clear about the assumptions made, in particular regarding lognormal distribution of synaptic connection strengths. We feel that testing the effect of other distributions may improve the conclusion and better support the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified our reasoning behind some of the assumptions that went into the model and have provided a figure for the reviewers that highlights how the effects that we report do not depend on the lognormality of the synaptic weights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please, also go over the specific points raised in the individual reviews and address them all in your revised version and rebuttal letter.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall this is a nice paper which does a good job of exploring an important question using a broad range of different approaches.

We have rephrased it to better reflect the fact that, while a lot of what explain the developmental decorrelation of neural activity still remains to be understood, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely unknown (lines 30-31).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>Claim that SOM integrate before PV is not accurate. See, Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011; Anastasiades et al., 2016; Daw et al., 2007. They make a similar claim in the discussion &quot;Early inhibitory circuits have several peculiarities, including a predominance of inhibitory synapses by SOM+ INs&quot;. Again this is not supported by the data. SOM interneurons certainly have an important and unique role in early development. But this is not to say that PV synapses are less numerous or weaker (in fact one of the papers they cite shows that they are much stronger at P12 and have a 20% higher connection probability than SOM cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased the sentences in Introduction and Discussion (lines 79-81, 605-607) to highlight that the statement on the predominance of SOM<sup>+</sup> INs holds true for the first postnatal days (the beginning of the developmental phase that we investigated in this study). At this early stage, SOM+ interneurons have much larger synapses and higher connectivity than PV+ INs (Gao et al., 2017). Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011 reports no (FS) PV-PYR connectivity until P4, and little connectivity also at P5-6. Daw et al., 2007 reports no functional recruitment of (FS) PV+ INs until P6-7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>In the model of the local network do they include changes in GABAergic driving force (i.e reversal potential) or just the conductance? Although they provide evidence that GABA does not appear excitatory during early development, it does not mean that it may not be depolarizing and that EGABA may change across this period. This change could influence their results. Others have shown developmental changes in EGABA within the developing PFC and so this should be taken into account.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment that has spurned us to extend our modeling analysis. As depicted in the novel Figure 4—figure supplement 1G-J, we show that in our model both depolarizing (chloride reversal potential between the resting membrane potential and the action potential threshold) as well as excitatory (chloride reversal potential more positive than the action potential threshold) GABA result in runaway excitation. Further, we also show that even a chloride reversal potential that is equal to or only slightly more negative to the resting membrane potential fails to replicate the population trajectories that we empirically observed in the optogenetic experiments. Only a chloride reversal potential that is 10 mV or more negative than the resting membrane potential fully recapitulates the experimental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could differences in baseline firing across P4-12 make it harder to detect inhibition at early ages due to a floor effect? Could this contribute in part to their observation?</p></disp-quote><p>In line with the reviewer’s suggestion, we tested whether a floor effect might have partially explained our results. When we limited the analysis to neurons that were in the top 50% for spikes fired during the optogenetic protocol, the proportion of inhibited units as a function of age was higher than when considered the entire dataset. Therefore, a floor effect as cause of the described results seems unlikely. We added the novel analysis to the manuscript (lines 285-288) and displayed the results in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were any recordings made at P4 in Figure 4? If not, why not state P5-6 rather than P4-6?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, no mouse was recorded at P4. We corrected the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of the mice recorded at different ages. Were mice recorded at all ages in each time window? For example, at P11 there are 2 mice who show a very low modulation index but at P12 all the units seem to be strongly modulated, but there are only 2 data points plotted vs 4 at P11 and 7 at P10. Were only 2 mice recorded at P12, or do the data points overlap at certain ages? Overall, how many mice were recorded at each age?</p></disp-quote><p>As specified in Materials and methods (lines 759-771), each mouse has been acutely recorded and only once.</p><p>Of the 19 mice that were recorded for the Chr2 experiments: 2 mice were recorded at P5, 3 mice were recorded at P6, 1 mouse was recorded at P7, 3 mice were recorded at P8, 3 mice were recorded at P9, 4 mice were recorded at P10, 2 mice were recorded at P11, 1 mouse was recorded at P12. The individual dots (some were indeed overlapping) do not refer to single mice but rather to individual optogenetic stimulations. The optogenetic protocol was applied twice in each mouse, on the two outmost shanks of the 4-shank electrode (corresponding to superficial and deep layers of the mPFC). We added the missing information to the legend of Figure 4, 5, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and Materials and methods (lines 781-784).</p><p>Of note, the statistical modeling (generalized linear mixed-effect model with mouse as nesting factor) explicitly takes the nesting of the data into account and estimates the parameter of the model (and its significance) on an individual mouse level. We limited the statistical analysis to the estimation of the main effect of age, thereby rending unnecessary recording a large number of mice at every individual postnatal day.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the methods for Figure 4 they state that laser power was &quot;adjusted until it gave the desired response&quot; how was this defined? Was there a difference in laser power across the different ages, could this account for differences in inhibition?</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased the sentence and specified that the “desired response” was reliable light-induced spiking (lines 778-779). Two pieces of evidence let us assume that it unlikely that different laser power across ages accounts for the differences in inhibition: (i) across the two optogenetic conditions, laser power showed a weak and non-significant (main age effect=-0.23, 95% C.I. [-0.50; 0.04], p=0.10; linear mixed-effect model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), trend towards decreased intensity as a function of age. This weak trend, if anything, should work against the increase in inhibition that we report; (ii) laser power and optogenetic effect (% of neurons with increased firing rate) were entirely uncorrelated (main laser power effect=-0.03, 95% C.I. [-0.18; 0.18], p=0.74 for ChR2 experiments; main laser power effect=0.03, 95% C.I.

As could this. Is there a way that you could rephrase? Stimulation typically means to activate cells, whereas you are suppressing them.

The authors should really put their work in the context of other studies who have measured and analyzed spontaneous activity and discussed how it evolves over time. For e.g. the Lohmann lab proposes the existence of L and H events (low and high participation rate events observed in the primary visual cortex), see Siegel et al. 2012. In a modeling study with the Gjorgjieva lab (Wosniack et al. eLife 2021), they proposed a different mechanism that can lead to the desynchronization (or sparsification) of activity during development, where L events increase in frequency while H events increase. This should be at least discussed. In Leighton et al. (Curr Biol 2021) the Lohmann lab also talked about the role of inhibition (from SOMs) in development. Finally, an interesting study that should be discussed is Rahmati et al. (Sci Rep 2017) which also presents results on sparsification of neural activity in development and the connection to inhibition stabilization.</p></disp-quote><p>Already in the previous version of the manuscript, a substantial part of the Introduction and Discussion has been dedicated to put the new results into the context of previous studies done by Rochefort, Lohmann, Colonnese and Khazipov labs. As suggested, we extended the discussion of the mentioned studies, highlighting the developmental decorrelation of neural activity and other potential underlying mechanisms (lines 673-686).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Can the authors discuss the use of lognormal weights in the model? What happens if they are constant or taken from a lognormal distribution? I don't doubt they come from a lognormal distribution in the real circuit, but it would be important for the model to point out why this is important, as many other modeling papers ignore this fact.</p></disp-quote><p>Abundant literature data have shown that synaptic weights are log-normally distributed in the adult mammal brain (reviewed in Barbour et al., 2007; Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014; Scheler, 2017) and, while evidence is not yet conclusive, this log-normality does not seem to arise from activity-dependent processes (Hazan and Ziv 2020). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that synaptic weights are log-normally distributed also in early development. We therefore chose to use log-normally distributed synaptic weights to use biologically plausible parameter choices. We added this explanatory note to the manuscript (lines 173-174).</p><p>Further, to verify that the results do not depend on a specific parameter choice, we performed additional modeling simulations with normally distributed synaptic weights.

Please note that you are mixing periods in the lifespan: your work is on neonatal brain development, while those disorders are about toddler age (autism) or much much later in life (schizophrenia).</p></disp-quote><p>We previously showed that, while the disease-related symptoms emerge during later development, the disturbance of neural circuits is initiated already at neonatal age (Hartung et al., 2016; Chini et al., 2020). As suggested, we rephrased the sentence to better highlight this aspect (lines 71-72).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The work is very strong with the case on early inhibition. I find it a bit confusing how the work starts from making a case why the slope of PSD curve (1/f exponent) should be taken as a relevant measure of E-I.</p><p>Why not move this part towards the end, just before you introduce the human data? After all, this component appears to have value mainly because it allows you to link your findings on inhibition to the human dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the optogenetic experiments (Figure 3 and 4) strengthen the hypothesis that E-I ratio shifts towards inhibition during development that was proposed in line with the 1/f results presented in Figure 1. However, taken in isolation, we do not think that they are sufficient to make a strong case for the developmental E-I ratio shift. The results in Figure 3-4 suggest that inhibition increases throughout development. This is not the same as a shift in E-I ratio (relative strengthening of inhibition with respect to excitation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I find it a bit perplexing that you show increase in slope with early maturation. This is opposite to what has been published earlier, and what is the general finding among clinicians. The early EEG (from prematurity to the end of neonatal period) is characterized by a rapid/robust decline in the lowest frequency power -&gt;this translates directly to a decrease of slope.</p><p>So there is something unexpected here?</p></disp-quote><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is only one other paper (Schaworonkow and Voytek, 2021) that has been published on the development of the 1/f exponent at such early stages. Of note, even this paper investigates a later developmental phase (1 to 7 months) when compared to the time window of 1-month prematurity to 1-month of age investigated in the present study. The Discussion includes several hypotheses as to why the two studies might diverge (lines 694-698).</p><p>Further, the fact that the slope becomes steeper over this period does not contradict the observation that the early EEG is characterized by a robust decline at the lowest frequency range. Our data solely indicate that the steepness of this decline increases over the two months that are covered by the two datasets. The entire range (1-month prematurity to 1-month of age) can be categorized as (very) early EEG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I would also like to understand why you select to analyse 1-40Hz while recent papers have clearly indicated that (i) neonates have most of their signal power &lt;1hz, and (ii) there is very little to be found &gt;20hz.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the observation that in the immature brain, most of the PSD power resides at ultra-slow frequencies. Therefore, we do not quantify the PSD power, but rather estimate the slope of the PSD. For this measure, it is not important to include frequencies at which most power resides. On the contrary, it has been suggested to choose frequency bands that are “uncorrupted by oscillatory peaks” (Gao et al., 2017).
