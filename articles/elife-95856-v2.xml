However, <italic>Dux</italic>-knockout embryos produce fertile mice, suggesting that ZGA is redundantly driven by an unknown factor(s). Here, we present multiple lines of evidence that the multicopy homeobox gene, <italic>Obox4</italic>, encodes a transcription factor that is highly expressed in mouse two-cell embryos and redundantly drives ZGA. Genome-wide profiling revealed that OBOX4 specifically binds and activates MERVL LTRs as well as a subset of murine endogenous retroviruses with lysine tRNA primer (MERVK) LTRs. Depletion of <italic>Obox4</italic> is tolerated by embryogenesis, whereas concomitant <italic>Obox4</italic>/<italic>Dux</italic> depletion markedly compromises embryonic development. Our study identified OBOX4 as a transcription factor that provides genetic redundancy to preimplantation development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>zygotic genome

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanism by which zygotes acquire totipotency is a major question in developmental biology. Following fertilization, the zygote must build a de novo conceptus with a transcriptionally quiescent genome. The genome rapidly undergoes zygotic genome activation (ZGA), during which epigenetic reprogramming and expression of nascent transcripts enforce the replacement of parental infrastructures by their zygotic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Completion of metazoan ZGA results in blastomeres, a collection of cells that are totipotent enough to reflect their potential to individually produce both embryos and extraembryonic appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tarkowski, 1959a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tarkowski, 1959b</xref>). Totipotency lasts until the first cell fate decision takes place, following which it is remolded into pluripotency in cells destined for the embryonic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suwińska et al., 2008</xref>), to which embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) correspond. In placental mammals, ZGA is characterized by the massive reactivation of transposable elements (TEs) and epigenome remodeling, predominantly implemented by a collection of ZGA genes that have adapted long terminal repeats (LTRs) of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) as stage-specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Svoboda et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Homeodomains are DNA-binding amino acid motifs encoded by a class of conserved genomic sequences termed homeoboxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGinnis et al., 1984b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carrasco et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGinnis et al., 1984a</xref>). Homeodomains are prevalent transcription factors that regulate development because of their ability to bind chromatin in a sequence-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scott and Weiner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gehring and Hiromi, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gehring, 1987</xref>). Among all homeobox-containing genes, Paired-like (PRD-like) homeobox class genes are particularly associated with ZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lewin et al., 2021</xref>). Studies have shown that the PRD-like homeobox gene, double homeobox (<italic>Dux</italic>), plays an important role in preimplantation embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Töhönen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madissoon et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Dux</italic> is conserved throughout placentalia and is highly expressed during ZGA. In humans and mice, DUX specifically binds and activates endogenous retroviruses with leucine tRNA primer (ERVL) LTR-derived promoters, resulting in the expression of downstream ZGA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Iaco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendrickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whiddon et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Dux</italic> expression induces a two-cell-embryo-like (2C-like) state in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Iaco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendrickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whiddon et al., 2017</xref>), whereas <italic>Dux</italic>-knockout (KO) undermines mouse blastocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Iaco et al., 2017</xref>). However, subsequent studies have revealed that mouse embryogenesis is compatible with the loss of <italic>Dux</italic>, suggesting a redundant pathway of ZGA that is controlled by uncharacterized transcription factor(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Zhang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Iaco et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bosnakovski et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we sought to identify the redundant transcription factor that drives ZGA in the absence of <italic>Dux</italic>. We discovered that the multicopy homeobox gene, oocyte-specific homeobox 4 (<italic>Obox4</italic>), promotes <italic>Dux</italic>-less ZGA. <italic>Obox4</italic> is abundantly expressed in mouse 2C-embryos, 2C-like mESCs, and totipotent blastomere-like cells (TBLCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2021</xref>). Mechanistically, OBOX4 promotes ZGA by binding to the LTRs of murine endogenous retroviruses with leucine tRNA primer (MERVL) and murine endogenous retroviruses with lysine tRNA primer (MERVK), and thereby affecting the deposition of active epigenetic modifications. Concomitant, but not respective, depletion of <italic>Obox4</italic> and <italic>Dux</italic> severely compromises ZGA and preimplantation development. Taken together, our findings substantiate a preimplantation development model, in which the ZGA is redundantly promoted by <italic>Dux</italic> and <italic>Obox4</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression profiling identifies transcription factor candidates</title><p>Genetic redundancy is commonly observed among genes that share sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wagner, 1996</xref>). Because <italic>Dux</italic> is a homeobox gene, we speculated that its redundant factors are homeobox genes. We examined the expression profiles of all mouse homeobox genes during preimplantation embryogenesis using published single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2014</xref>). Clustering analysis defined a collection of 45 homeobox genes, whose transcript levels reached a maximum before the late 2C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then sought to identify bona fide ZGA factors from this collection by looking for genes whose transcripts were of zygotic origin, instead of ones that were parentally inherited. TBLCs have recently been established as an in vitro model of 2C-embryos, which are derived from splicing-inhibited mESCs, and hence, are free of parentally inherited transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2021</xref>). Analysis of published RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data showed that the expression of four homeobox genes, <italic>Duxf3</italic>, <italic>Emx2</italic>, <italic>Hoxd13</italic>, and <italic>Obox4</italic>, was 10 times higher in TBLCs than in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Using published RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Zhang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Iaco et al., 2020</xref>), we found that only the expression of the multicopy gene <italic>Obox4</italic> was partially affected in <italic>Dux</italic> knockout embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>OBOX4 is expressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mouse homeobox genes that are specifically expressed during ZGA.

Immunofluorescence staining using these antibodies confirmed that endogenous OBOX4 was expressed in zygotes and highly abundant in 2C-embryos and 2C-like mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), which is consistent with translatome profiles captured by Ribo-seq that detects OBOX4 translation at the 2C stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Mouse ZGA is characterized by the surging activity of genes that specifically express at the 2C stage (2C-gene), many of which have co-opted MT2_Mm, the LTR of MERVL, as stage-specific promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macfarlan et al., 2011</xref>).

Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN) leverages antibody-targeted cleavage of proximal DNA to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Skene and Henikoff, 2017</xref>). To examine this technique, we performed CUT&amp;RUN against triple FLAG-tagged DUX (3×FLAG-DUX) expressed in mESCs using a high-affinity anti-FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>) and confirmed that the DUX binding pattern revealed by CUT&amp;RUN recapitulated the published HA-tagged DUX ChIP data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendrickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We then proceeded with characterizing the genomic footprint of OBOX4 by performing CUT&amp;RUN against 3×FLAG-OBOX4 expressed in mESCs and discovered ~24,000 peaks, among which 39.5% were located in the gene promoter regions that covered 26.8% (273/1019) of the 2C-genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). De novo motif discovery using the top 500 CUT&amp;RUN signal peaks predicted CTGGGATYWRMR as the top OBOX4 binding motif, which is enriched in the promoter regions of 2C-genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Collectively, OBOX4 and DUX targeted 48.1% (490/1019) of the 2C-genes with a considerable overlap (36.3% for OBOX4 and 31.3% for DUX), which covered many important ZGA genes, including <italic>Dppa2</italic>, <italic>Sp110</italic>, and <italic>Zscan4d</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The overlap was substantiated by the observation that MERVL LTR MT2_Mm was among the top 10 LTR targets of both OBOX4 and DUX, based on loci coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Notably, while DUX strongly prefers MT2_Mm, OBOX4 binding was biased toward MERVK LTRs, namely RLTR9 and RLTR13 elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), which also demonstrated a 2C-specific expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).

In mice, it has been reported that the transcription factor DUX accesses and opens condensed chromatin of the MERVL LTR loci, which results in the activation of downstream ZGA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Iaco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendrickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whiddon et al., 2017</xref>). However, the establishment of fertile <italic>Dux</italic> knockout mice suggests that ZGA is redundantly driven by other transcription factor(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Zhang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Iaco et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bosnakovski et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Obox</italic> transcripts were first discovered in gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rajkovic et al., 2002</xref>) and were later found to be highly abundant in mouse 2C-embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ge, 2017</xref>). Despite being important regulators of ZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2023</xref>), the biological significance of distinct <italic>Obox</italic> genes remains elusive. The <italic>Obox</italic> family has 67 members clustered in the sub-telomeric region of mouse chromosome 7 and is further divided into six subfamilies: <italic>Obox1</italic>, <italic>Obox2</italic>, <italic>Obox3</italic>, <italic>Obox4</italic>, <italic>Obox5</italic>, and <italic>Obox6</italic>, with <italic>Obox4</italic> constituting nearly 60% (39 of 67) of the family population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong and Holland, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilming et al., 2015</xref>). The role of <italic>Obox4</italic> is particularly mysterious as it remains to be determined whether <italic>Obox4</italic> is a functional protein-coding gene. In the present study, we found that <italic>Obox4</italic> is a bona fide multicopy protein-coding gene that encodes a homeodomain-containing protein that potently induces ZGA gene expression. Using multiple genetic knockout models, we showed that concomitant depletion of <italic>Dux</italic> and <italic>Obox4</italic> was hardly compatible with embryogenesis as <italic>Dux</italic>/<italic>Obox4</italic> double knockout mESCs subjected to SCNT failed to produce pups, and <italic>Dux</italic>/<italic>Obox4</italic> double knockout mouse was produced at a sub-Mendelian ratio. Consistently, <italic>Obox4</italic>/<italic>Dux</italic> DKD markedly compromised preimplantation development, but single knockdown of either gene was tolerated. DKD embryos exhibited severely dysregulated transcriptomes, characterized by MERVL and ZGA gene activation defects. We also characterized the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological significance of <italic>Obox4</italic> as well as its relevance to <italic>Dux</italic>. OBOX4 directly binds to MERVL (the target of DUX) and MERVK loci and activates specific MERVL and MERVK elements in a <italic>Dux</italic>-independent manner. In summary, our results highlight that OBOX4 is a transcription factor that is functionally redundant to DUX during ZGA.</p><p>Despite the narrow time window, ZGA takes place as a stepped program. A wave of mild and promiscuous transcription of ‘minor ZGA’ is commenced first, followed by ‘major ZGA’ characterized by transcriptional bursting of a more defined set of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). While major ZGA in large mammals usually launches multiple cell cycles after minor ZGA, it is worth noting that mouse ZGA adopts an unique ‘early genome activator’ strategy where the timing of minor and major ZGA converges at the early two-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Svoboda, 2018</xref>). Overlapping minor and major ZGA right after fertilization allows prompt initiation of the zygotic program and accelerated preimplantation development – a potentially favorable reproductive advantage in rodents. Multiple shared features of <italic>Dux</italic> and <italic>Obox4</italic> imply that these genes have adapted to this particular developmental scheme to serve redundantly as key ZGA factors. Qualitatively, the functional redundancy between DUX and OBOX4 buffers sporadic mutations or defects that could arise during ZGA. Their lack of introns enables the earliest possible translation under ZGA-associated splicing deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2021</xref>). Quantitatively, both genes are tandemly arrayed in clusters, which assures rapid accumulation of their transcripts. Taken together, it seems that mouse ZGA may represent an evolutionary innovation where the first embryonic program shows surprising plasticity, likely supported by the expression of multiple <italic>Obox</italic> family members throughout peri-ZGA stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Indeed, concomitant loss of <italic>Dux</italic> and nearly all <italic>Obox4</italic> copies only partially compromises the ZGA transcriptome, demonstrating that mouse ZGA is so strongly canalized that even such a potent perturbance in genes makes very little difference to the phenotype.</p><p>Unlike <italic>Dux</italic>, which is structurally and functionally conserved throughout placentalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leidenroth and Hewitt, 2010</xref>), the ancestral locus of the <italic>Obox</italic> family appears to have undergone mouse-specific duplication and generated a gene cluster that is collectively syntenic to the <italic>Tprx2</italic> locus in other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maeso et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the distal homology between <italic>Obox4</italic> and <italic>Tprx2</italic>, it has been recently reported that human <italic>TPRX2</italic> is expressed in eight-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madissoon et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, TPRX2 was shown to cause defective ZGA upon embryonic depletion and bind important ZGA genes in hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zou et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>Tprx2</italic> locus might have undergone functionally convergent evolution despite its divergent genetic context. However, due to the distinction of minor and major ZGA timing across species, whether <italic>TPRX2</italic> plays a similar role in humans to <italic>Obox4</italic> in mice regarding the redundancy to <italic>Dux</italic> (<italic>DUX4</italic> in humans) warrants careful examination. Nevertheless, considering that LTR domestication is functionally convergent in preimplantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2024</xref>), it might be helpful to speculate that homeobox gene-mediated LTR activation is a common principle of ZGA. Meanwhile, because the repressive epigenetic landscape is barely established during minor ZGA, this may allow transcription factors like DUX and OBOX to potently shape the zygotic transcriptome by activating LTR elements. However, ZGA gene induction and epigenetic reprogramming can only partially recapitulate the 2C transcriptome in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Posfai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that ZGA is a collective outcome of specific parental, zygotic, and epigenetic factors that may or may not be present in pluripotent stem cells. Indeed, OBOX4 is equally potent as DUX at activating a 2C::tdTomato reporter but less potent at inducing 2C-genes in mESCs, which may suggest that the repressive epigenetic landscape is less permissive to OBOX4 than to DUX. Thus, attempts to model ZGA in vitro need to be carefully formulated to address these fundamental distinctions between embryos and cultured cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key resources</title><p>The sequences of primers, ASOs, and sgRNAs used in this study are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11 supp12">Supplementary files 11 and 12</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Lori Sussel as the Senior Editor. We invite you to revise the manuscript to address the comments from the reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. As Obox cluster KO (PMID: 37459895) gives sound evidence for the role of Obox family proteins in ZGA, comparisons of Obox4 KO and Obox4/Dux DKO with the previous Obox cluster KO will greatly benefit the community. It is essential to perform a comparative analysis to identify similar and/or differentially affected genes between these two studies, using your data and the publicly available data as indicated by Reviewer 2.</p><p>2. It will be good to compare how Obox4 and Dux regulate ZGA and 2C genes using the single and double KO models already in hand as indicated by Reviewer 2.</p><p>3. Please discuss the several points outlined by Reviewer 1, which could strengthen the manuscript greatly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The work has been carefully done and I do not have any suggestions as it seems that the message authors convey is sufficiently supported by multiple lines of evidence. My comments thus concern primarily the interpretation of data and discussion, which I think could be strengthened if the following points would not be overlooked.</p><p>1) I think authors should point out the uniqueness of the murine zygotic genome activation because the &quot;minor ZGA&quot; at the 1-cell stage is apparently largely overlapping with the major ZGA at the 2-cell stage, at least when it comes to genes activated during the major ZGA. At the same time, naïve chromatin matures to the transcriptionally repressive state until the late 2-cell stage, which provides an opportunity for Dux and OBOX4 to activate transcription through LTR enhancers.</p><p>2) Because of (1), I believe that lessons about ZGA program when induced (inefficiently) in ESCs and activated (100% efficiently) in zygotes should be carefully formulated when it comes to the activation of this program, which is under physiological conditions triggered via maternally provided TFs, which may or may not be expressed in ESCs.</p><p>3) The nature of Dux &amp; Obox4 genes should be brought up as both have features implying adaptations for their role and further supporting that they are indeed the key factors of ZGA. In both cases, there are tandemly arrayed genes = this assures rapid accumulation of their transcripts in the earliest phases of the genome activation. They also do not have coding sequences interrupted in introns. As the minor ZGA has been accompanied with deficient splicing, this feature would enable the earliest possible translation of Dux and Obox4 transcripts – clearly a desirable feature in an &quot;early activator&quot; like mouse.</p><p>4) Phylogenetic history of the coding sequences and tandem arrays of Dux and Obox4 as well as of MuERV-L suggests that mice represent one evolutionary solution of a surprisingly plastic activation of the first embryonic expression program. In this sense, it might be helpful to speculate what may be common principles and species-specific adaptations of mammalian ZGA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Following are specific comments:</p><p>1) There are some inconsistent outcomes among different approaches used to perturb Obox4 and Dux. It appears that ASOs and SCNT cause more severe phenotypes as no embryos form blastocysts, or blastocysts with good morphology (Figure 4k, 4b-c). However, Obox4 and Dux DKO embryos can survive at least to the weaning age, suggesting that Obox4/Dux DKO is not 100% penetrant. Could authors discuss what may cause the inconsistencies? Are there any abnormalities associated with the Obox4/Dux DKO mouse? Did authors observe more DKO mice after manuscript submission? Are the Obox4/Dux DKO mice fertile?</p><p>2) I fully agree with the statement that &quot;it is critical to examine the functional requirement of OBOX4 and DUX in genetic knockout models&quot; (line 137). Thus, I recommend authors comparing how Obox4 and Dux regulate ZGA and 2C genes using the single and double KO models they already generated instead of focusing on ASO-mediated KD. The genetic KO models are much more convincing than ASO-mediated KD.</p><p>3) The authors should compare how Obox4/Dux DKO vs. Obox cluster KO in regulating 2C repeats and ZGA genes. It seems to me that Obox4/Dux double KD or KO causes less severe ZGA defects than Obox cluster KO. For example, Obox/Dux DKD causes ~175 genes down-regulated at 2-cells stage (Figure 5) (this info is missing for the DKO), however, Obox cluster KO causes downregulation of ~530 major ZGA genes (Ji et al., Figure 3). I highly recommend authors performing a comparative analysis to identify similar and/or differentially affected genes between these two studies.</p><p>4) Figure 1b, what about expression levels of other Obox genes in TBLCs vs. ESC?</p><p>5) Line 79, Obox4 should be partially affected by Dux KO based on Figure 1c and the legend.</p><p>6) Figure S1b, it seems that Dux is not expressed in overexpressed cells. Is this due to that Dux is quickly degraded?</p><p>7) Figure 2, How similar or different for Obox4 OE vs. Obox3 and 5 OE as reported by Ji et al? Are MT2C_Mm and MT2B2 also induced upon Obox4 OE?</p><p>8) Figure 2h, does Dux also induce other Obox genes in addition to Obox4?</p><p>9) Figure S3b. Why much fewer peaks (~10%) of Dux CUT&amp;RUN peaks vs. ChIP-seq peaks? Are the missing peaks false negatives?</p><p>10) Obox1/3/5 seem also bind to B1/B2 elements in addition to ERVL. How about Obox4? Since ESCs chromatin structure is very different from 2-cell embryos. The authors may consider profiling Obox4 binding in embryos.</p><p>11) Since one Obox4 copy with ORF was not depleted according to the KO design, the authors should perform immunostaining to confirm whether Obox4 protein is gone in Obox4 KO embryos.</p><p>12) Figure 4i is confusing, why very few Dux-Het/Obox4KO embryos reach to blastocyst at 4.5 dpc? In theory, Dux-Het/Obox4KO should show no embryonic arrest based on Figure 4e-g.</p><p>13) Since Obox4 has a high identity to other Obox proteins (Figure S11), authors should demonstrate the antibody specificity.</p><p>14) Line 231-233. &quot;However, whether and how other Obox family members contribute to ZGA remains unclear&quot;. This is not true, because Ji et al. has showed that Obox is critical in regulating ZGA.</p><p>15) Line 56-57. &quot;Nr5a2 that triggers ZGA by activating short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) B1 family&quot;. The authors should be cautious about this statement because it has been shown that Nr5a2 had a minimal role in ZGA by maternal-zygotic KO mouse model (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.16.524255).</p><p>16) I feel that only a few representative genotyping gel images are sufficient. The authors do not need to show all the raw genotyping gels. In addition, Figure 5b (A+B) gel is noisy and it's difficult to locate the target bands.</p><p>17) Typo in Figure S3a, it should be Dux instead of Obox?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95856.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1.

It appears that ASOs and SCNT cause more severe phenotypes as no embryos form blastocysts, or blastocysts with good morphology (Figure 4k, 4b-c).

Are there any abnormalities associated with the Obox4/Dux DKO mouse? Did authors observe more DKO mice after manuscript submission? Are the Obox4/Dux DKO mice fertile?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. There are multiple factors that potentially contribute to the more severe phenotype observed in vitro. Some technical concerns could be intrinsic to the adopted technique (e.g. injection induced damage), the material used (ESCs derived from inbred strain, epigenetic barrier), or environmental. However, with the proper controls and by employing multiple techniques to minimize technical biases, the consistency between different in vitro techniques suggest that the phenotype is truly a result of DUX/OBOX4 depletion. Nevertheless, perhaps one of the biggest factors that is inevitable was the culture condition. Even the best in vitro culture condition only partially recapitulates the in utero environment, which is the most critical external factor for embryogenesis. In fact, it has long been recognized in the reproductive field that in vitro culturing elicits a strong stress response and compromises blastocyst formation (DoI: 10.1530/REP-16-0391). While some adverse effects can be ameliorated (e.g. culture under hypoxia instead of normoxia), faithful recapitulation of the in vivo development is still impossible. Due to limitation in equipment, all embryos were cultured under normoxia in our study, which causes oxidative stress. Considering even healthy embryos are susceptible to oxidative stress (DoI: 10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.07.013), the likelihood of blastocyst formation could be much lower in ASO knockdown and SCNT embryos than the knockouts produced by natural mating.</p><p>Regarding the Obox4/Dux DKO mouse, unfortunately, despite repeated attempts, we only obtained one DKO mouse in the early generation. We would love to produce more, if it is possible, DKO mice for phenotypic study but the huge colony size required may saturate our mouse production capacity before a mating pair can be obtained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I fully agree with the statement that &quot;it is critical to examine the functional requirement of OBOX4 and DUX in genetic knockout models&quot; (line 137). Thus, I recommend authors comparing how Obox4 and Dux regulate ZGA and 2C genes using the single and double KO models they already generated instead of focusing on ASO-mediated KD. The genetic KO models are much more convincing than ASO-mediated KD.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer and wish we could perform in-depth transcriptome analysis using genetic KO models. Because DKO mating pairs are not available, it seems that the practical way left to perform such analysis is to collect individual 2C embryos produced by heterozygotic knockouts, separate the two blastomeres, use one of the blastomeres for genotyping and the other for scRNA-seq so that the genotypes can be associated with the transcriptomes (as illustrated in Figure 4—figure supplement 4D). We managed to profile 31 blastomere pairs and pool their scRNA-seq as pseudo-bulk and found that 79 and 5 2C-genes and are downregulated in DuxKO/Obox4Het and DKO versus DuxKO/Obox4WT blastomeres, respectively. MERVL is only downregulated in DKO blastomeres (Figure 4J, Figure 4—figure supplement 4E, and Figure 4—figure supplement 3).</p><p>However, due to the extreme technical difficulty, the quality of such an experiment is sub-optimal and only provides a coarse snapshot of the transcriptome of the DKO based on following metrics:</p><p>- First, our RNA-seq quality control showed that inter-sample variance between of DKO is sub-optimal. Normally we deem a coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) greater than 0.95 as a good indicator of the consistency between biological replicates. The R<sup>2</sup> of DKO RNA-seq is 0.740 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1a</xref>), while for DKD RNA-seq the number is 0.988 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1b</xref>). Although it is believed that genetic knockout models are theoretically superior at resolving the molecular phenotype, in this experiment the quality control suggested that the DKO RNA-seq is more likely to introduce statistic artifacts than those of the DKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1c</xref>). Unfortunately, repeating this experiment is unlikely to improve the data, as these issues stem from the method itself, such as the low sample number, handling of live separated blastomeres, and the nature of single-cell RNA sequencing etc.</p><p>- Second, despite that the RNA-seq of DUX KO 2C show discrepancies between different samples, our ASO KD RNA-seq is highly consistent with these KO RNA-seq, suggesting that the ASO KD approach can reproduce the molecular phenotype of genetic KO studies (DoI: 10.1038/s41588-019-0418-7 and 10.1038/s41422-019-0238-4, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1c</xref>).</p><p>Based on these observations, we concluded that our ASO mediated KD faithfully recapitulated genetic KO models while providing a higher resolution of the transcriptome for in-depth analysis. This became the rationale of using ASO-mediated KD for the comparative analysis.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of transcriptome data in different KO and KD experiments.</title><p>a) Correlations between biological replicates of <italic>Dux</italic>/<italic>Obox4</italic> DKO pseudo-bulk scRNA-seq (left panel) and ASO mediated Dux/Obox4 DKD RNA-seq (right panel).

It seems to me that Obox4/Dux double KD or KO causes less severe ZGA defects than Obox cluster KO. For example, Obox/Dux DKD causes ~175 genes down-regulated at 2-cells stage (Figure 5) (this info is missing for the DKO), however, Obox cluster KO causes downregulation of ~530 major ZGA genes (Ji et al., Figure 3). I highly recommend authors performing a comparative analysis to identify similar and/or differentially affected genes between these two studies.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point raised by the reviewer, which is highly relevant to the reviewer’s comment 2. We agree that DKO would be the ideal model for addressing this point, but since DKO mating pairs are currently unavailable, we performed a comparative analysis of our Obox4/Dux DKD and the Obox cluster KO. We found minimal overlap between genes regulated by <italic>Dux</italic>/<italic>Obox4</italic> and other <italic>Obox</italic> family members. This suggests that <italic>Obox4</italic> is a distinct <italic>Obox</italic> family member that promotes ZGA primarily through providing redundancy to <italic>Dux</italic>. Note that the definitions of “ZGA genes” and “2C-genes” are distinct, thus the number of genes belonging to these two categories cannot be compared directly (175 2C-genes vs. 530 major ZGA genes). The concept of ZGA gene denotes a gene that is activated, but does not necessarily only express, during ZGA. Accordingly, in the paper by Ji <italic>et al.</italic>, ZGA genes are designated by having FPKM &gt; 5 and greater than threefold upregulation at 1C or 2C comparing to oocytes (DoI: doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06428-3, Methods). On the other hand, to be deemed a 2C-gene, a gene needs to only highly express at the 2C stage. In our study, we do not set expression level and foldchange thresholds when defining 2C-genes. Instead, we use Z-score to examine fluctuation of gene expression and perform k-means cluster analysis to identify genes whose high expressions are exclusive to the 2C stage (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and Supplementary File 1). We believe examining the effects of stage-specific transcription factors on 2C-genes better captures the dynamic impacts caused by these transcription factors. In our analysis, <italic>Obox</italic> mzKO caused a down-regulation of 203 2C-genes, which is only a slightly greater number than the 175 caused by <italic>Dux</italic>/<italic>Obox4</italic> DKD. However, considering that <italic>Obox</italic> mzKO and <italic>Dux</italic>/<italic>Obox4</italic> DKO both caused 2C arrest, we speculate that <italic>Dux</italic>/<italic>Obox4</italic> and other <italic>Obox</italic> family members collectively provide broader coverage of ZGA gene activation than individually. Losing either <italic>Dux</italic>/<italic>Obox4</italic> and <italic>Obox1/2/3/5/6/7</italic> axis will compromise a significant portion of ZGA program, which cannot be rescued by the other. We have included results of the analysis in a new figure and supplementary tables with detail comparison of genes/TEs affected by <italic>Dux</italic>, <italic>Obox4</italic>, and other <italic>Obox</italic> family members (Figure 6 and Supplementary File 8,9; revised manuscript line #197-210).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1b, what about expression levels of other Obox genes in TBLCs vs. ESC?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point.

The reason for a weak DUX band is likely synthetic. Degradation is one possibility.

By comparing <italic>Obox3</italic>/<italic>Obox5</italic> (representing zygotic and maternal <italic>Obox</italic>, respectively) induced genes reported by Ji <italic>et al.</italic> with our data, we found that while genes induced by <italic>Obox3</italic> and <italic>Obox5</italic> exhibit a strong overlap, the majority of their targets cannot be induced by <italic>Obox4</italic> (Author response image 3a).

This contradicts the analysis using the same data by Ji <italic>et al.</italic> that concludes “Obox genes, apart from Obox4, were not or only moderately affected by Dux overexpression in mES cells<sup>16</sup> and Dux knockout in embryos<sup>20</sup> (Extended Data Figure 10c,d)” (DoI: doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06428-3). In our own mESC RNA-seq (unpublished), we also observed strong induction of <italic>Obox1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>/<italic>3</italic>/<italic>6</italic> by <italic>Dux</italic> overexpression. Excluding multiple mapping reads from the analysis does not affect the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure S3b. Why much fewer peaks (~10%) of Dux CUT&amp;RUN peaks vs. ChIP-seq peaks? Are the missing peaks false negatives?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern on the coverage of the DUX CUT&amp;RUN data. Here are a few considerations about the cause of fewer peaks compared with the previous ChIP-seq data:</p><p>- First, because our DUX CUT&amp;RUN served as a proof-of-principle of profiling homeobox DNA binding by CUT&amp;RUN with an anti-FLAG antibody, only a snapshot would be enough for de novo consensus motif discovery. Hence, we decided to run our DUX CUT&amp;RUN at a sequencing depth significantly shallower than the previously reported ChIP by Hendrickson <italic>et al.</italic> (~11.3M read pairs vs. ~48.1M read pairs + 48.6M read pairs). Fewer peaks in accordance with fewer reads is within our expectation, as read depth significantly affects discover power in DNA binding profiling experiments (DoI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003326).</p><p>- Second, as a proof-of-principle, we did not include biological/technical replicate in our DUX CUT&amp;RUN experiment. This further lowered discover power.</p><p>- Third, we performed our CUT&amp;RUN experiments using two different controls: (i) a non-immune mouse IgG in <italic>Obox4</italic> induced mESCs, and (ii) anti-FLAG antibody in WT mESCs. The DUX CUT&amp;RUN data were normalized to both controls for increased peak calling stringency, which lead to reduced number of peaks called.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Obox1/3/5 seem also bind to B1/B2 elements in addition to ERVL. How about Obox4? Since ESCs chromatin structure is very different from 2-cell embryos. The authors may consider profiling Obox4 binding in embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>Our CUT&amp;RUN data showed that OBOX4 barely binds B1/B2 elements, at least in mESCs. True, the 2C embryo represents a unique stage where chromatin is highly accessible, and thus profiling 2C embryos would theoretically better capture the DNA binding property of OBOX4. Regretfully, in our practice, the single cell/low input profiling technique (scCUT&amp;Tag) does not generate enough high-quality data (data not shown). We have included a table containing OBOX4 coverage of transposable element loci by family (Supplementary Table 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Since one Obox4 copy with ORF was not depleted according to the KO design, the authors should perform immunostaining to confirm whether Obox4 protein is gone in Obox4 KO embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers concern and agree that the percentage of loci left does not necessarily correlate with the overall expression. However, considering the complex interplay between <italic>Dux</italic> and <italic>Obox4</italic> where the two factors express in a mutually inductive fashion, the depletion of OBOX4 should be examined in a concomitant DUX depletion setting. Unfortunately, because DKO mating pairs are unavailable, we had to focus on the characterization of our DKD model. As a reference, our data showed that OBOX4 protein cannot be detected by immunostaining under ASO knockdown, where the <italic>Obox4</italic> transcript level was reduced to roughly 15% of that in scramble ASO injected embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 4i is confusing, why very few Dux-Het/Obox4KO embryos reach to blastocyst at 4.5 dpc? In theory, Dux-Het/Obox4KO should show no embryonic arrest based on Figure 4e-g.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point raised by the reviewer. We think this is related to the reviewer’s comment 1 where DUX/OBOX4 depletion caused more severe phenotype in vitro than in vivo. As mentioned in our response to reviewer’s comment 1, in vitro culturing represents a major challenge to preimplantation embryogenesis, particularly to blastulation. Our theory is that while dosage effect of mono-allelic <italic>Dux</italic> in the Dux-Het/Obox4KO embryos can support ZGA to some extent to allow development beyond 2C stage, the ZGA is too crippled to overcome the adversary of in vitro culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Since Obox4 has a high identity to other Obox proteins (Figure S11), authors should demonstrate the antibody specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,D: OBOX4 has the lowest amino acid sequence homology to other OBOX family members. In Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, the specificity of our monoclonal antibodies was extensively tested against OBOX2, the closest though still distal, paralog of OBOX4. The specificity is further demonstrated by the KD experiment, where ASO targeting a unique sequence of <italic>Obox4</italic> was used (Figure 4—figure supplement 5A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Line 231-233. &quot;However, whether and how other Obox family members contribute to ZGA remains unclear&quot;. This is not true, because Ji et al. has showed that Obox is critical in regulating ZGA.</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence is removed from the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Line 56-57. &quot;Nr5a2 that triggers ZGA by activating short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) B1 family&quot;. The authors should be cautious about this statement because it has been shown that Nr5a2 had a minimal role in ZGA by maternal-zygotic KO mouse model (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.16.524255).</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate the reviewer’s reminder. This is consistent with the recent publication by Lai <italic>et al.</italic> who demonstrated <italic>Nr5a2</italic> knockout is compatible with ZGA (DoI: 10.1038/s41422-023-00887-z). The original remark is removed from the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) I feel that only a few representative genotyping gel images are sufficient. The authors do not need to show all the raw genotyping gels. In addition, Figure 5b (A+B) gel is noisy and it's difficult to locate the target bands.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s considerate remark. We have adjusted the figure to increased readability. Considering the complexity of the knockout experiments involving two multi-copy tandem repeat gene clusters, we would like to keep the complete array of genotyping image in case some of the readers are curious about the experimental design.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Typo in Figure S3a, it should be Dux instead of Obox?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the correction, the typo is fixed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
