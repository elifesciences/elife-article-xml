However, in the context of legume–rhizobium symbiosis, the role of rhizobial effectors in regulating plant symbiotic pathways remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that NopT, a YopT-type cysteine protease of <italic>Sinorhizobium fredii</italic> NGR234 directly targets the plant’s symbiotic signaling pathway by associating with two Nod factor receptors (NFR1 and NFR5 of <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>). NopT inhibits cell death triggered by co-expression of NFR1/NFR5 in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. Full-length NopT physically interacts with NFR1 and NFR5. NopT proteolytically cleaves NFR5 both in vitro and in vivo, but can be inactivated by NFR1 as a result of phosphorylation. NopT plays an essential role in mediating rhizobial infection in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>. Autocleaved NopT retains the ability to cleave NFR5 but no longer interacts with NFR1. Interestingly, genomes of certain <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> species only harbor <italic>nopT</italic> genes encoding truncated proteins without the autocleavage site. These results reveal an intricate interplay between rhizobia and legumes, in which a rhizobial effector protease targets NFR5 to suppress symbiotic signaling. NFR1 appears to counteract this process by phosphorylating the effector. This discovery highlights the role of a bacterial effector in regulating a signaling pathway in plants and opens up the perspective of developing kinase-interacting proteases to fine-tune cellular signaling processes in general.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>legume–rhizobium symbiosis</kwd><kwd>rhizobial effector</kwd><kwd>Nod factor receptors</kwd><kwd>NopT</kwd><kwd><italic>Lotus japonicus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0904700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yangrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32090063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yangrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2662022SKYJ002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yangrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2662021JC010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yangrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Plant Genome Research Program 2048410</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stacey</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The rhizobial effector NopT and two Nod factor receptors of <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>, NFR1 and NFR5, mutually interact to precisely regulate rhizobial symbiosis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The legume–rhizobium symbiosis stands as one of the most crucial and intricate mutualistic interactions in nature. Its significance goes beyond the supply of nitrogen fixed by rhizobia, which influences plant growth and ecosystem sustainability, as this symbiosis is a pivotal model for investigating plant–microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). The orchestration of this symbiosis involves the perception of rhizobial signal molecules such as lipo-chitooligosaccharidic Nod factors (NFs) and surface polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Madsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tirichine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawaharada et al., 2015</xref>), along with the secretion of proteins, including type three protein secretion system (T3SS) effectors translocated into host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugawara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Plant receptor heterocomplexes consisting of two Lysin-motif receptor kinases (LYKs) play a central role in recognizing various microbial poly- and oligosaccharide molecules. In non-legumes such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtLYK5 and AtCERK1 (Chitin elicitor receptor kinase) are required for perception of chitin, and thereby trigger plant immunity to combat fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). In legumes, structurally similar Nod factor receptors (NFRs) such as NFR1 and NFR5 in <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> are vital for recognition of rhizobial NFs and initiation of symbiotic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broghammer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozsoki et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>nfr1</italic> and <italic>nfr5</italic> knockout mutants are almost completely unable to form nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Madsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Radutoiu et al., 2003</xref>). Over-expression of either NFR1 or NFR5 can activate NF signaling, resulting in formation of spontaneous nodules in the absence of rhizobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ried et al., 2014</xref>). The intricate action of NFRs is highlighted by the elicitation of a hypersensitive cell death response when NFR1/NFR5 are simultaneous over-expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madsen et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, defense-like responses in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> nodules were observed upon over-expression of MtNFP (NF perception, the ortholog of NFR5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moling et al., 2014</xref>), perhaps reflecting a potential role of MtNFP-interacting LYKs involved in plant–pathogen associations. It can therefore be expected that the protein abundance of NFRs must be tightly controlled to avoid resistance responses, thereby ensuring optimal root infection by rhizobia.</p><p>T3SS effectors of phytopathogenic Gram-negative bacteria play a critical role in suppressing pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). To avoid diseases, specific resistance (R) genes are employed to directly or indirectly recognize effectors translocated into host cells. Recognition of such avirulence (Avr) effectors often results in effector-triggered immunity (ETI), a much stronger immune response which is usually associated with programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). In contrast to the well-studied effector functions of phytopathogenic bacteria in suppressing immunity through various mechanisms, it is largely unknown how T3SS effectors from symbiotic rhizobia contribute to mutualistic interactions.</p><p>T3SS effectors of the YopT-type family, such as YopT of <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, AvrPphB of <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>phaseolicola</italic> and rhizobial NopT proteins, are evolutionary related cysteine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>). YopT cleaves Rho family GTPases leading to their inactivation to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton of human host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 2003b</xref>). AvrPphB can proteolytically cleave <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase family proteins including PBS1, PBS1-like proteins and BIK1, to suppress PTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shao et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Cleavage of PBS1 kinase by AvrPphB can be regarded as a ‘decoy strategy’ as it is associated with RPS5 (RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE5)-mediated ETI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shao et al., 2003a</xref>). Depending on the host legume, the NopT effector protease of <italic>Sinorhizobium fredii</italic> NGR234 can have an opposite function in regulating symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kambara et al., 2009</xref>). The heterologous expression of NopT from NGR234 in <italic>S. fredii</italic> USDA257 severely blocks nodulation in soybean cultivar Nanfeng 15 but not in other soybean cultivars tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2022</xref>), implying that NopT might act as an Avr effector. In contrast, NopT positively regulates nodule formation in the interaction between <italic>S. fredii</italic> HH103 and soybean cultivar Suinong 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2023</xref>). NopT from <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> sp. ORS3257 promotes rhizobial infection in nodules of <italic>Aeschynomene indica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Teulet et al., 2019</xref>). NopT proteases have been biochemically characterized. Some exhibit autocleavage activity and are subsequently acylated at the newly formed N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dowen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kambara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fotiadis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2022</xref>). Recently, soybean PBS1-1 and two proteins in <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> were identified as NopT targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2023</xref>). However, at the molecular level, it remains largely unknown how NopT modulates rhizobial infection and whether NopTs from different rhizobial strains differ in their effector activities.</p><p>A challenge in the investigation of rhizobial effectors lies in the availability of suitable assays and plants with which effector activities can be characterized. In this study, we took advantage of the observation that ectopic expression of NFR1 and NFR5 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves induces programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madsen et al., 2011</xref>). We hypothesized that this response could be modulated by co-expressed rhizobial effectors. Among the 15 known or putative T3SS effectors of <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234, only NopT could suppress NFR1/NFR5-induced cell death. This observation suggested that NopT is an effector associated with NFRs. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that NopT interacts with both NFR1 and NFR5 at the plasma membrane and proteolytically cleaves NFR5 at the juxtamembrane (JM) domain to suppress NF-mediated host responses. NFR1 phosphorylates the full-length NopT, thereby inactivating its protease activity. However, the autocleaved NopT form of <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 retains the ability to cleave NFR5 but loses its ability to interact with NFR1. Intriguingly, various <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> strains possess only truncated versions of NopT (related to autocleaved NopT of NGR234) which might evade the inactivation by NFR1. We present in this study a model of mutual regulation, in which the rhizobial effector NopT directly targets NFR5 to dampen symbiotic signaling, whereas NFR1-mediated phosphorylation of NopT counteracts NFR5 cleavage. Our work provides essential insights into the intricate interplay between legumes and rhizobia and shows an example of how a rhizobial effector fine-tune NF signaling by directly targeting NFRs, and how an NFR inactivates the enzymatic activity of the effector through phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NopT expression in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> suppresses the NFR1/NFR5-induced cell death response</title><p>To examine the role of effector proteins in regulating rhizobial infection, 15 effector genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimbrel et al., 2013</xref>) were cloned from <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234, a strain with an exceptionally broad host range. Initial experiments were performed to screen the effector proteins for their ability to suppress or enhance the NFR1/NFR5-triggered cell death response of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. In this experiment, each effector was co-expressed with NFR1/NFR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Only NopT, a cysteine protease belonging to the YopT family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>), could suppress NFR1 and NFR5-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Interestingly, NopT reduced protein abundance of the intact NFR5 when co-expressed with NFR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that NopT might promote proteolytic degradation of NFR5. Cys-93 of NopT is an amino acid residue known to be essential for the protease activity of this effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kambara et al., 2009</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we replaced the JM with the SUMO tag to create SUMO-NFR5<sup>KC</sup>-HA (KC, kinase domain and C-terminal tail region, a modified NFR5<sup>CD</sup> without the JM) for proteolytic assay. Indeed, immunoblot analysis showed that co-expressed NopT was unable to cleave SUMO-NFR5<sup>KC</sup>-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The JM domain of NFR5 was then fused to SUMO and GFP to create a recombinant protein, SUMO-NFR5<sup>JM</sup>-GFP. In an in vitro cleavage assay with recombinant proteins from <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, GFP was immunodetected in the flow though sample when SUMO-NFR5<sup>JM</sup>-GFP was incubated with NopT but not with NopT<sup>C93S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The interaction between NopT<sup>C93S</sup> and SUMO-NFR5<sup>JM</sup>-GFP was confirmed by an in vitro pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, these data strongly indicate that the cleavage site of NFR5 for NopT is located in its JM domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The cleavage of NFR5 by NopT is dependent on multiple residues of the JM domain</title><p>The ‘DKLLSGV’ motif in the JM domain of NFR5 (residues Asp-288 to Val-294; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) shows highest similarity with the autocleavage region of NopT (DKMGCCA). However, a protein variant of NFR5<sup>CD</sup> in which the ‘DKLLSGV’ motif was replaced by seven alanine residues could still be cleaved by NopT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Similar to NopT, the AvrPphB effector of <italic>P. syringa</italic> has an autocleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shao et al., 2003a</xref>). We therefore also examined a version of NFR5<sup>CD</sup> in which the ‘DKLLSGV’ motif was replaced by that of AvrPphB. In the cleavage assay with <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, AvrPphB did not cleave NFR5<sup>CD</sup>. However, the modified NFR5<sup>CD</sup> form with the seven residues from AvrPphB was cleaved by AvrPphB and the cleavage product had a lower molecular weight than that formed by NopT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). These findings indicated that the cleavage site for NopT is located upstream of the ‘DKLLSGV’ motif in NFR5.</p><p>As mentioned above, NopT undergoes autocleavage but it is not clear whether this is due to inter- or intramolecular proteolysis. In addition to Cys-93, His-205, and Aps-220 of NopT are conserved catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kambara et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, NopT forms lacking these catalytic residues were co-expressed with NopT in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. The immunoblot analysis showed that NopT could not proteolyze NopT<sup>C93S</sup>, NopT<sup>H205A</sup>, or NopT<sup>D220A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>), suggesting that NopT autocleavage is due to intramolecular proteolysis. Hence, the residues at the autocleavage site of NopT may not help to predict the cleavage site of NopT substrates.</p><p>In an attempt to define the NopT cleavage site in NFR5, we created a series of modified NFR5 forms covering the JM domain of NFR5 (Val-269 to Cys-320) and the first seven amino acid residues of the kinase domain (Lys-321 to Tyr-327). Initially, 17 variants of NFR5<sup>CD</sup> were created in which three adjacent amino acids in the JM domain were replaced with three alanine residues. When these proteins were co-expressed with NopT in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, all 17 NFR5<sup>CD</sup> variants could be cleaved by NopT but not NopT<sup>C93S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C–F</xref>). In a similar experiment, we created seven NFR5<sup>CD</sup> forms which contained a deletion in the JM domain of 10 residues each. Surprisingly, cleavage products were still observed for all seven examined proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4G</xref>). These results suggest that the JM domain may have multiple sites that can be cleaved by NopT, which is different from the specific cleavage site identified for AvrPphB. In another experiment, recombinant His-SUMO-NFR5<sup>CD</sup>-GST protein was co-expressed with NopT in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and its cleavage product was subjected to N-terminal protein sequencing using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis. Based on alignment of identified peptides, the NopT cleavage site in NFR5 was mapped to four basic amino acids in the JM domain (RRKK; amino acid residues 271–275) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). However, this result was not consistent with the observation that NopT expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells could still proteolyze a co-expressed NFR5<sup>CD</sup> form in which the residues from Tyr-268 to Leu-277 were deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4G</xref>). Overall, the experiments performed suggest that NopT preferentially proteolyzes NFR5 at the RRKK motif, but other sites in the JM domain can also be cleaved by NopT. Since NFR5 belongs to a subfamily of LYK family proteins that lacks kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2022</xref>), we wondered whether NopT could proteolyze other LYK proteins of this subfamily, which might be helpful to characterize the biochemical function of NopT. We therefore investigated whether the CDs from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtLYK5, <italic>L. japonicus</italic> LjLYS11, and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> MtNFP expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells can be proteolyzed by NopT. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, NopT, but not NopT<sup>C93S</sup>, was able to cleave the CDs of AtLYK5 and LjLYS11. Replacement of the JM domain in NFR5<sup>CD</sup> with the JM domain from either AtLYK5 or LjLYS11 resulted in cleavage by NopT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). These data show that NopT cleaves AtLYK5 and LjLYS11 at their JM domains. Based on sequence analysis of the JM region of NFR5 and its homologous proteins, five conserved residues (Ser-283, Gly-294, Tyr-304, Ala-310, and Thr-311) were identified and mutated as NFR5<sup>CD-5m</sup> for the proteolytic assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, NFR5<sup>CD-5m</sup>, a NFR5<sup>CD</sup> variant with point mutations of S283Y, G294Q, Y304S, A310I, and T311Y, could not be cleaved by NopT. Interestingly, NopT could not proteolyze MtNFP<sup>CD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We then swapped the JM domains in NFR5<sup>CD</sup> and MtNFP<sup>CD</sup>, generating NFP<sup>JM</sup>-NFR5<sup>KC</sup> and NFR5<sup>JM</sup>-NFP<sup>KC</sup> (KC stands for the kinase domain and the C-terminal tail region). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, NopT could proteolyze NFP<sup>JM</sup>-NFR5<sup>KC</sup> but not NFR5<sup>JM</sup>-NFP<sup>KC</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. In an in vitro cleavage assay, the cleavage product of SUMO-NFP<sup>JM</sup>-GFP proteolyzed by NopT was detected in the flow though sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). These data suggest that the cleavage of NFR5 by NopT depends on the conformational structure of NFR5<sup>KC</sup> and/or other specific amino acids in NFR5<sup>KC</sup>. We then investigated whether two additional recombinant proteins with large swapping regions in NFR5<sup>CD</sup> and NFP<sup>CD</sup> (NFR5<sup>268-445</sup>-NFP<sup>458-595</sup> and NFP<sup>270-457</sup>-NFR5<sup>456-595</sup>) could be cleaved in the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteolysis test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>). Notably, both proteins were cleaved by NopT, suggesting that a specific conformation of the NopT substrate is required for proteolysis. Taken together, we concluded from our experiments that NopT can proteolyze NFR5 at the JM domain and that multiple nonadjacent residues in NFR5<sup>JM</sup> in combination with a specific KC conformation are required for proteolysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>NopT phosphorylated by NFR1 is proteolytically inactive</title><p>The perception of rhizobial NFs by the heterocomplex of NFR1 and NFR5 involves trans-phosphorylation events from the NFR1 kinase to the pseudo-kinase NFR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madsen et al., 2011</xref>). Since NopT is associated with both NFR1 and NFR5, we hypothesized that NopT is a phosphorylation target of NFR1, which may interfere with transphosphorylation events between the two receptors.

NFR5<sup>CD</sup> and a kinase-inactive NFR1<sup>CD</sup> form (NFR1<sup>CD-K351E</sup>; Lys-351 is a conserved residue required for ATP binding) were included into these experiments. When NFR1<sup>CD</sup> was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, extracted NopT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>) and NFR5<sup>CD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) exhibited retarded migration on SDS–PAGE gels, suggesting that NFR1 was able to phosphorylate both proteins. A band shift was observed when the phosphorylated full-length NopT was in vitro dephosphorylated by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP). However, the CIAP treatment caused no obvious band shift of the autocleaved NopT form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The phosphorylation sites of NopT were then identified using an in vitro phosphorylation assay followed by LC–MS analysis. Several serine and threonine residues in NopT were identified to be phosphorylated by NFR1<sup>CD</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Taken together, these results showed that full-length NopT is a phosphorylation target of the NFR1 kinase.</p><p>Finally, we wondered whether NopT phosphorylation by NFR1 influences its proteolytic activity.

Aspartate substitutions at three phosphorylation sites of NopT (Thr-97, Ser-119, and Thr-257) resulted in the loss of the autoproteolytic activity, as well as the ability to cleave NFR5<sup>CD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, corresponding NopT proteins with alanine substitutions retained autocleavage activity and the ability to proteolyze NFR5<sup>CD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Taken together, these data indicate that the protease activity of NopT, its phosphorylation status and the proteolysis of the NFR5 target are important for the regulation of rhizobial infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>NopT from other <italic>S. fredii</italic> strains also cleave NFR5</title><p>Since NopT of <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 (NopT<sub>NGR234</sub>) cleaves NFR5, we wondered whether homologs from other rhizobial species also possess such a proteolytic activity.

However, the role of rhizobial T3SS effectors in regulating the mutualistic symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to gain essential insights into the regulation mechanisms by which rhizobial effectors act directly on symbiotic signaling pathways to promote or dampen infection of host cells.</p><p>Understanding how plants recognize different microbes as ‘friends’ or ‘foes’ is a central question in biology. The perception of microbial signals by plant receptor proteins is essential for triggering specific signaling pathways to resist invading pathogens or to establish symbiosis with beneficial microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zipfel and Oldroyd, 2017</xref>). Direct targeting of these receptors by T3SS effectors represents an efficient strategy of phytopathogenic bacteria to suppress PTI and promote bacterial infection. In the well-studied <italic>Arabidopsis–P. syringae</italic> interaction, T3SS effectors target plant flagellin receptor FLS2and its coreceptor BAK1 (BRI1-[Brassinosteroid insensitive1]-associated receptor kinase 1) to suppress flagellin-induced PTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zipfel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). For example, AvrPto targets FLS2 and HopB1 cleaves BAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, AvrPtoB, an E3 ligase in <italic>P. syringae</italic>, targets FLS2 to promote its degradation and suppress PTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Göhre et al., 2008</xref>). Despite the evolutionary importance of T3SS effectors in targeting host receptors, we were surprised to find that NopT, a rhizobial member of the C58 protease effector family, can directly target NFRs and manipulate the symbiotic signaling pathway in legumes. The interaction between NopT of <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 and NFRs of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> was identified by using a unique screening system, in which co-expression of NFR1/NFR5 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves leads to cell death. NopT, but not other effectors of NGR234, could suppress this cell death response. Consistent with these initial observations, inoculation of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> with the <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234<italic>ΔnopT</italic> mutant resulted in increased infection of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> roots. Moreover, over-expression of NopT in the roots was found to reduce rhizobial infection by <italic>M. loti</italic>. The interaction between NopT and NFR1/NFR5 was verified by BiFC, Split-LUC, and co-IP experiments.</p><p>Interestingly, using different assays, we found that NopT cleaves NFR5 at the JM domain. However, the efficiencies of NopT cleavage of NFR5 in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> were slightly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), which could be related to the uncontrollable activation of NFRs in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> or phosphorylation of NopT by another kinase leading to decreased proteolytic activity. The modification of five conserved residues in the JM domain and the replacement of NFR5<sup>KC</sup> by NFP<sup>KC</sup> resulted in NFR5<sup>CD</sup> forms that were resistant to proteolysis by NopT in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. These results suggest that cleavage of NFR5 depends on both the JM domain and the KC region. Although belonging to the same protease family, the NopT cleavage site in NFR5 was found to be polybasic as in the YopT substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmidt, 2011</xref>), whereas the cleavage site of AvrPphB substrate is canonical with seven adjacent amino acids involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). These differences reflect a broad variety of YopT-type effector proteases and their substrates in host cells. Our study shows that NopT targets the NFR1/NFR5 complex thus reduces NF signaling and formation of nodule primordia in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>. NopT–NFR interactions may reflect a regulation mechanism to prevent rhizobial hyperinfection in host species other than <italic>L. japonicus</italic>.</p><p>Similar to the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> effector AvrPphB, NopT of <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 is able to cleave soybean PBS1-1 and expression of this effector in <italic>S. fredii</italic> USDA257 negatively influences symbiosis with certain soybean cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, NopT of NGR234 acts as an Avr effector in some nonhost plants. Transient expression of NopT of strain NGR234 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco triggers strong immune responses and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimbrel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, NopT-induced cell death was found to be dependent on the PBS1-1 kinase and the resistance protein RPS5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2022</xref>). Likewise, when constitutively expressing NopT and NopT<sup>C93S</sup> in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, we only obtained stable transgenic lines expressing NopT<sup>C93S</sup>, indicating that the protease activity of NopT had a negative effect on plant development. In contrast, generation of hairy roots expressing NopT was possible. Such differences may be explained by different NopT substrates in roots and aerial parts of the plant. Indeed, our study shows that NopT not only cleaves NFR5 but is also able to proteolyze <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtLYK5 and <italic>L. japonicus</italic> LjLYS11. These two receptors possess chitin-binding affinities and trigger PTI responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gysel et al., 2021</xref>). NFR5, AtLYK5, and LjLYS11 are kinase-dead LYKs belonging to the same LYK subfamily. Thus, NopT appears not only to suppress NF signaling, but may also interfere with signal transduction pathways related to plant immunity. Depending on the host legume species, NopT could suppress PTI or induce ETI, thereby modulating rhizobial infection and nodule formation. Interactions between NopT and proteins related to the plant immune system may represent an important evolutionary driving force for host-specific nodulation and explain why the presence of NopT in NGR234 has a negative effect on symbiosis with <italic>L. japonicus</italic> but a positive one with other legumes.</p><p>The regulation of kinase-dead pseudokinases in plants may be more complex compared to the well-studied control of protein kinase activities by phosphorylation. The cleavage of receptor-like protein kinase may be an overlooked strategy to regulate their function in plant biology. Regulation of protein activities by cleavage is well studied in animals, for example, for Notch signaling, where proteolysis of Notch molecules leads to downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> BAK1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage, which is important for both brassinosteroid signaling and induction of PTI responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Whereas, HopB1 cleaves immune co-receptor BAK1 at the kinase domain to inhibit plant defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016</xref>). NFR5 is a pseudokinase that is essentially required for the activation of NF signaling. However, the mechanisms of how the pseudokinase domain of NFR5 mediates symbiotic signaling transduction remains unclear. Our work indicates that NopT proteolytically cleaves NFR5 and suppresses NF signaling. Such a fine-tuning process could be advantageous for the symbiosis in host plants other than <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, for example to prevent hyperinfection. However, the precise function of NFR5 cleavage by NopT and the fate of the released cytoplasmic domain remain to be clarified.</p><p>Mutual regulation between T3SS effectors and host target proteins has been investigated for various plant–pathogen interactions. For example, the conserved <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> effector AvrPtoB can directly ubiquitinate the key components of plant immunity to promote bacterial virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Göhre et al., 2008</xref>). However, the activity of AvrPtoB in promoting virulence could either be enhanced or dampened by host proteins. AvrPtoB can be phosphorylated by SnRK2.8 to promote its virulence activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lei et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, the plant lectin receptor-like kinase LexRK-IX.2 and the Pto kinase phosphorylate AvrPtoB to inactivate its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and undermine the effector’s ability to suppress PTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ntoukakis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). A similar strategy is used by NFR1 to inhibit the protease activity of NopT via phosphorylation. NFR1 expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells phosphorylates full-length NopT of <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 at several residues. Three NopT forms with a phosphomimic substitution (i.e., NopT<sup>T97D</sup>, NopT<sup>S119D</sup>, and NopT<sup>T257D</sup>) lacked autoproteolytic activity and the ability to cleave NFR5. The expression of these NopT variants in the NGR234<italic>ΔnopT</italic> mutant showed little effects in comparison with expression of wild-type NopT. These data suggest that <italic>L. japonicus</italic> utilizes NFR1 to phosphorylate NopT in order to dampen its catalytic activity and protect NFR5 from cleavage, which favors rhizobial infections. However, NopT<sup>ΔN50</sup>, which is similar to autocleaved NopT, retained the ability to interact with NFR5 but not with NFR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, full-length NopT, but not autocleaved NopT, migrated slower on gels when NFR1<sup>CD</sup> was co-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, suggesting that autocleaved NopT may escape being phosphorylated and inactivated by NFR1. Future studies are required to explore the interactions between acylated NopT and NFR1. When expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, GFP-tagged NopT forms lacking their autocleavage site (and thus non-acylated) were found to be localized within the cytoplasm, whereas NopT was targeted to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, NopT without acylation sites showed weaker interactions with NFRs in our study, suggesting that acylation of NopT, leading to plasma membrane location, promotes NopT–NFR interactions.</p><p>NopT homologs vary in different <italic>S. fredii</italic> strains. USDA257 and HH103 produce truncated NopT versions different from NGR234 due to a 19-bp deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, NopT of these strains lacks autocleavage and acylation sites and possess a different N-terminal secretion signal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akeda and Galán, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, NopT<sub>HH103</sub> is a functional T3SS effector as mutant analysis indicated a symbiosis-promoting role in certain soybean cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to NopT<sub>NGR234</sub>, NopT<sub>USDA257</sub>, and NopT<sub>HH103</sub> were able to cleave NFR5 in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Since NopT<sub>USDA257</sub> and NopT<sub>HH103</sub> cannot be acylated, they likely accumulate in the cytoplasm of host legumes and are therefore less efficient in cleaving plasma membrane-bound NFR5 in comparison to acylated NopT<sub>NGR234</sub>. This could also explain why NopT<sub>USDA257</sub> was unable to suppress cell death triggered by NFR1/NFR5 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. It can be expected that NFR1 does not interact with and phosphorylate NopT<sub>USDA257</sub> or NopT<sub>HH103</sub>, as these effectors are similar to NopT<sup>ΔN50</sup> of NGR234, which cannot interact with NFR1. Consistent with these findings, expression of NopT<sub>USDA257</sub> in NGR234<italic>ΔnopT</italic> did not alter the infection phenotype of NGR234<italic>ΔnopT</italic>. It can be hypothesized that the host targets of these truncated NopT effectors might be different from those of NopT<sub>NGR234</sub>. <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> NopT effectors are also different from NopT<sub>NGR234</sub>, as NopT of <italic>B. diazoefficiens</italic> USDA110 was unable to cleave NFR5. NopT effectors may play a crucial role in <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic>–legume interactions. A <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> sp. ORS3257 mutant deficient in NopT production induced only ineffective nodules on roots of <italic>A. indica</italic> and most of the formed nodules were not infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Teulet et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, these findings indicate versatile functions of NopT homologs in different strains and suggest that NopT controls different regulation processes in specific host cells.</p><p>We present here a model of mutual regulation, in which NopT proteolyzes NFR5 to suppress NF signaling, whereas protease activity of full-length NopT is suppressed by NFR1 via phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). NopT impairs the function of the NFR1/NFR5 receptor complex. Cleavage of NFR5 by NopT reduces its protein levels. Possible inhibitory effects of NFR5 cleavage products on NF signaling are unknown but cannot be excluded. Inactivation of NopT protease activity via phosphorylation by kinases such as NFR1 appears to be a countermeasure of the host to enable symbiotic signaling and rhizobial infection. Such feedback regulation could be the result of evolutionary pressure to produce ‘improved’ NFRs, which are resistant to cleavage by NopT and have an increased capacity to phosphorylate NopT. On the other hand, suppression of NopT protease activity by NFRs may drive broad-host-range strains such as NGR234 to produce higher levels and structurally modified NFs.</p><p>The negative regulation of plant symbiotic signaling by NopT is detrimental to rhizobial infection, which appears paradoxical from an evolutionary perspective. Two possible scenarios will be discussed. One possibility is that NopT may have originated from its homologs, such as AvrPphB, and possesses a pathogenic feature by proteolyzing immune receptors to disrupt the plant immune pathway. However, due to sequence similarity, NFR5 is also proteolyzed by NopT. Expression of NopT leading to strong cell death in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also suggests that NopT might be recognized as Avr effector to trigger strong immunity. Another possibility is that the presence of NopT serves as a strategy for rhizobia to evade detection by plant immunity, which may be activated by rhizobial overinfection. The negative effects on symbiosis by cleaving NFR5 is then inhibited by NFR1 via a direct phosphorylation. In a parallel study, <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 NopM was also identified to interact with and mediate the ubiquitination of NFR5, stabilizing NFR5 levels and thereby promoting rhizobial infection and nodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, both <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 NopT and NopM target the same protein and appear to antagonistically regulate rhizobial symbiosis; however, the exact role of NopT in nodulation needs to be elucidated in future research.</p><p>Taken together, this study provides insights into a legume–rhizobium interaction, in which the bacterium deploys an effector protease to dampen symbiotic signaling, while the host plant counteracts by phosphorylating the effector, leading to its inactivation. Our findings highlight the function of a bacterial effector protease in regulating a symbiotic signaling pathway in legumes. This opens up the perspective of developing specific kinase-interacting proteases to reprogram and fine-tune cellular signaling processes in general.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Germination and growth of <italic>L. japonicus</italic></title><p><italic>L. japonicus</italic> (ecotype Gifu B-129) was provided by the Center for Carbohydrate Recognition and Signaling (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://lotus.au.dk/">https://lotus.au.dk/</ext-link>), and used as wild-type for nodulation assays.

The identification of a truncated NopT variant in certain Sinorhizobium species adds an interesting dimension to the study. These data try to bridge the gaps between classical Nod-factor-dependent nodulation and T3SS NopT effector-dependent nodulation in legume-rhizobium symbiosis. Overall, the research provides interesting insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic interactions between rhizobia and legumes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript nicely demonstrates NopT's proteolytic cleavage of NFR5, regulated by NFR1 phosphorylation, promoting rhizobial infection in L. japonicus. Intriguingly, authors also identify a truncated NopT variant in certain Sinorhizobium species, maintaining NFR5 cleavage but lacking NFR1 interaction. These findings bridge the T3SS effector with the classical Nod-factor-dependent nodulation pathway, offering novel insights into symbiotic interactions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) In the previous study, when transiently expressed NopT alone in Nicotiana tobacco plants, proteolytically active NopT elicited a rapid hypersensitive reaction. However, this phenotype was not observed when expressing the same NopT in Nicotiana benthamiana (Figure 1A). Conversely, cell death and a hypersensitive reaction were observed in Figure S8. This raises questions about the suitability of the exogenous expression system for studying NopT proteolysis specificity.</p><p>(2) NFR5 Loss-of-function mutants do not produce nodules in the presence of rhizobia in lotus roots, and overexpression of NFR1 and NFR5 produces spontaneous nodules. In this regard, if the direct proteolysis target of NopT is NFR5, one could expect the NGR234's infection will not be very successful because of the Native NopT's specific proteolysis function of NFR5 and NFR1. Conversely, in Figure 5, authors observed the different results.</p><p>(3) In Figure 6E, the model illustrates how NopT digests NFR5 to regulate rhizobia infection. However, it raises the question of whether it is reasonable for NGR234 to produce an effector that restricts its own colonization in host plants.</p><p>(4) The failure to generate stable transgenic plants expressing NopT in Lotus japonicus is surprising, considering the manuscript's claim that NopT specifically proteolyzes NFR5, a major player in the response to nodule symbiosis, without being essential for plant development.</p><p>Comments on the revised version:</p><p>My concerns regarding the potential function of NopT during nodule symbiosis have been adequately addressed in the revised manuscript. Therefore, I have no further questions about this version, aside from a few minor suggestions:</p><p>(1) Please carefully check the text formatting throughout the manuscript to ensure consistency with scientific conventions and the journal's standards. For example, Line 105-117 and line119-131.</p><p>(2) The term &quot;detrimental&quot; in line 624 may not accurately describe the function of NopT in rhizobial infection. Since the authors propose that NopT proteolytically cleaves NFR5 and suppresses NF signaling as a potential fine-tuning mechanism for legume symbiosis, a more precise term may be needed.</p><p>(3) Lines 632-634 are somewhat unclear. If NopT serves as a strategy for rhizobia to evade detection by plant immunity, then knocking out NopT should, in theory, inhibit rhizobial infection. Clarification on this point would be beneficial.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97196.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>Hanbin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yanan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Haoxing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lei</surname><given-names>Yutao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wadood</surname><given-names>Syed F</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Staehelin</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stacey</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Shutong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yangrong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Bacterial effectors that interfere with the inner molecular workings of eukaryotic host cells are of great biological significance across disciplines.

This is particularly interesting in Nicotiana in the absence of Nod factor that could trigger NFR1 kinase activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments regarding the cleavage of NFR5 by NopT and its functional implications. We acknowledge that our immunoblots indicate only a relatively small proportion of the NFR5 cleavage product. Possible explanations could be as follows:</p><p>(1) The presence of full-length NFR5 does not preclude a significant impact of NopT on function of NFR5, as NopT is able to interact with NFR5. In other words, the NopT-NFR5 and NopT-NFR1 interactions at the plasma membrane might influence the function of the NFR1/NFR5 receptor without proteolytic cleavage of NFR5. In fact, protease-dead NopT<sup>C93S</sup> expressed in NGR234<italic>ΔnopT</italic> showed certain effects in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> (less infection foci were formed compared to NGR234<italic>ΔnopT</italic> Fig. 5E). In this context, it is worth mentioning that the non-acylated NopT<sup>C93S</sup> (Fig. 1B) and NopT<sub>USDA257</sub> (Fig. 6B) proteins were unable to suppress NFR1/NFR5-induced cell death in <italic>N. benthamina</italic>, but this could be explained by the lack of acylation and altered subcellular localization.</p><p>(2) In the cleavage assay, only small portion of NFR5 could be detected for cleavage by NopT. However, this cleavage might be sufficient to suppress signaling pathways, leading to the observed phenotypic changes (loss of cell death in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>; altered infection in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>). We do believe this is a great point, therefore, we carefully revised the conclusion about this point. Throughout the paper, we stated that the cleavage of NFR5 suppresses symbiotic signaling but not disrupt the symbiotic signaling. We also removed the conclusion that cleavage of NFR5 by NopT results in the function loss of NFR5.</p><p>(3) <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> co-expressing NFR1/NFR5 leads to strong cell death, which suggest that the NFR1 kinase activity might be constitutively active even in the absence of Nod factors. But why co-expression of symbiotic receptor leads to cell death and how kinase activity is active in the absence of Nod factor are not clear, which is of great interest to be studied.</p><p>(4) The proteolytic activity of NopT may be reduced by the interaction of NopT with other proteins such as NFR1, which phosphorylates NopT and inactivates its protease activity.</p><p>In our revised manuscript version, we provide now quantitative data for the efficiency of NFR5 cleavage by NopT in different expression systems used (Figure 3 and Supplemental Fig. 16). We have also improved our Discussion in this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The presentation of the figures and the language has greatly improved and the specific mistakes pointed out in the last review have been corrected. I especially appreciate the new images used to illustrate the observed mutant phenotypes, which are much clearer and easier to understand. The pictures used to illustrate the mutant phenotypes seem to be of more comparable root regions than before. Overall, the requested changes have been implemented, with some exceptions described below.</p><p>• Figure 1: New representative images are shown for BAX1 and CERK1. These pictures are more consistent with the phenotype seen in other treatments, but since the data has not changed, I presume the data from leaf discs (where the leaf discs for these treatments looked very different) previously shown is still included. The criteria for what was considered cell death is in my opinion still not described in the legend. The cell death/total ratio has been added for all leaf discs, as requested.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for carefully pointing out this. Cell death in leaf disc results in the formation of necrotic plaques, which restrains pathogens within deceased cells. These plaques commonly manifest as leaf dehydration, frequently accompanied by a translucent appearance. Brown and shriveled leaf discs serve as indicators of cell death. We have added these descriptions in the figure legend of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 2: the discussion of the figure now emphasizes direct protein interaction. There is still no size marker in 2D or a description of size in the figure legend, making it difficult to compare the result to Figure 3. If I understand the rebuttal comments correctly, there are other bands on the blot, including non-specific bands. This does not negate the need to include the full blot as a supplemental figure to show cleaved NFR5 as well as other bands. I do not see any other clarifications on this subject in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have included the kDa range for all proteins detected in Figure.2D. The full blot of Co-IP assay was shown in Fig S2 (a new supplemental data). Yes, we detected some smaller bands after immunoblot, but we cannot give clear conclusion of what these bands are based on the current study. Interestingly, these smaller bands were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG beads, suggesting that these bands are some truncated peptides from NFR5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 5: From the pictures, it is now easier to understand what is meant by &quot;infection foci&quot;. Although there is no description in the methods of how these were distinguished from infection threads, I believe the images are clear enough.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful comment. In the revised manuscript, we have added the descriptions about this experiment in the method section and in the legend in Figure 5A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 6: The changes in the discussion are appreciated, but panel E still misrepresents the evidence in the paper, as from the drawing it still seems that the cleaved NFR5 is somehow directly responsible for suppressing infection when this was not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comments. We appreciate your suggestion to the schematic model to illustrate the cleavage of NFR5 to suppressing rhizobia infection. In the revised manuscript, we have changed the model in Figure 6E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents data demonstrating NopT's interaction with Nod Factor Receptors NFR1 and NFR5 and its impact on cell death inhibition and rhizobial infection. The identification of a truncated NopT variant in certain Sinorhizobium species adds an interesting dimension to the study. These data try to bridge the gaps between classical Nod-factor-dependent nodulation and T3SS NopT effector-dependent nodulation in legume-rhizobium symbiosis. Overall, the research provides interesting insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic interactions between rhizobia and legumes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript nicely demonstrates NopT's proteolytic cleavage of NFR5, regulated by NFR1 phosphorylation, promoting rhizobial infection in L. japonicus. Intriguingly, authors also identify a truncated NopT variant in certain Sinorhizobium species, maintaining NFR5 cleavage but lacking NFR1 interaction. These findings bridge the T3SS effector with the classical Nod-factor-dependent nodulation pathway, offering novel insights into symbiotic interactions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) In the previous study, when transiently expressed NopT alone in Nicotiana tobacco plants, proteolytically active NopT elicited a rapid hypersensitive reaction. However, this phenotype was not observed when expressing the same NopT in Nicotiana benthamiana (Figure 1A). Conversely, cell death and a hypersensitive reaction were observed in Figure S8. This raises questions about the suitability of the exogenous expression system for studying NopT proteolysis specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your attention to these plant-specific differences. Previous studies showed that NopT expressed in tobacco (<italic>N. tabacum</italic>) or in specific <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ecotypes (with PBS1/RPS5 genes) causes rapid cell death (Dai et al. 2008; Khan et al. 2022). Khan et al. 2022 reported recently that cell death does not occur in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> unless the leaves were transformed with PBS1/RPS5 constructs. Our data shown in Fig. S17 confirm these findings. As cell death is usually associated with induction of plant protease activities, we considered <italic>N. tabacum</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants as not suitable for testing NFR5 cleavage by NopT. In fact, no NopT/NFR5 experiments were not performed with these plants in our study. In response to your comment, we now better describe the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> expression system and cite the previous articles_._ Furthermore, we have revised the Discussion section to better emphasize effector-induced immunity in non-host plants and the negative effect of rhizobial effectors during symbiosis. Our revisions certainly provide a clearer understanding of the advantages and limitations of the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> expression system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) NFR5 Loss-of-function mutants do not produce nodules in the presence of rhizobia in lotus roots, and overexpression of NFR1 and NFR5 produces spontaneous nodules. In this regard, if the direct proteolysis target of NopT is NFR5, one could expect the NGR234's infection will not be very successful because of the Native NopT's specific proteolysis function of NFR5 and NFR1. Conversely, in Figure 5, authors observed the different results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, which points out that we did not address this aspect precisely enough in the original manuscript version. We improved our manuscript and now write that <italic>nfr1</italic> and <italic>nfr5</italic> mutants do not produce nodules (Madsen et al., 2003; Radutoiu et al., 2003) and that over-expression of either <italic>NFR1</italic> or <italic>NFR5</italic> can activate NF signaling, resulting in formation of spontaneous nodules in the absence of rhizobia (Ried et al., 2014). In fact, compared to the <italic>nopT</italic> knockout mutant NGR234<italic>ΔnopT</italic>, wildtype NGR234 (with NopT) is less successful in inducing infection foci in root hairs of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> (Fig. 5). With respect to formation of nodule primordia, we repeated our inoculation experiments with NGR234<italic>ΔnopT</italic> and wildtype NGR234 and also included a <italic>nopT</italic> over-expressing NGR234 strain into the analysis. Our data clearly showed that nodule primordium formation was negatively affected by NopT. The new data are shown in Fig. 5 of our revised version. Our data show that NGR234 infection is not really successful, especially when NopT is over-expressed. This is consistent with our observations that NopT targets Nod factor receptors in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> and inhibits NF signaling (<italic>NIN</italic> promoter-GUS experiments). Our findings indicate that NopT might be an “Avr effector” for <italic>L. japonicus</italic>. However, in other host plants of NGR234, NopT possesses a symbiosis-promoting role (Dai et al. 2008; Kambara et al. 2009). Such differences could be explained by different NopT targets in different plants (in addition to Nod factor receptors), which may influence the outcome of the infection process. Indeed, our work shows that NopT can interact with various kinase-dead LysM domain receptors, suggesting a role of NopT in suppression or activation of plant immunity responses depending on the host plant. We discuss such alternative mechanisms in our revised manuscript version and emphasize the need for further investigation to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the observed infection phenotype and the role of NopT in modulating symbiotic signaling pathways. In this context, we would also like to mention the new figures of our manuscript which are showing (i) the efficiency of NFR5 cleavage by NopT in different expression systems (Figure 3), (ii) the interaction between NopT<sup>C93S</sup> and His-SUMO-NFR5JM-GFP (Supplementary Fig. 5), and (iii) cleavage of His-SUMO-NFPJM-GFP by NopT (Supplementary Figs. S8 and S9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 6E, the model illustrates how NopT digests NFR5 to regulate rhizobia infection. However, it raises the question of whether it is reasonable for NGR234 to produce an effector that restricts its own colonization in host plants.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for mentioning this point. We are aware of the possible paradox that the broad-host-range strain NGR234 produces an effector that appears to restrict its infection of host plants. As mentioned in our answer to the previous comment, NopT could have additional functions beyond the regulation of Nod factor signaling. In our revised manuscript version, we have modified our text as follows:</p><p>(1) We mention the potential evolutionary aspects of NopT-mediated regulation of rhizobial infection and discuss the possibility that interactions between NopT and Nod factor receptors may have evolved to fine-tune Nod factor signaling to avoid rhizobial hyperinfection in certain host legumes.</p><p>(2) We also emphasize that the presence of NopT may confer selective advantages in other host plants than <italic>L. japonicus</italic> due to interactions with proteins related to plant immunity. Like other effectors, NopT could suppress activation of immune responses (suppression of PTI) or cause effector-triggered immunity (ETI) responses, thereby modulating rhizobial infection and nodule formation. Interactions between NopT and proteins related to the plant immune system may represent an important evolutionary driving force for host-specific nodulation and explain why the presence of NopT in NGR234 has a negative effect on symbiosis with <italic>L. japonicus</italic> but a positive one with other legumes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The failure to generate stable transgenic plants expressing NopT in Lotus japonicus is surprising, considering the manuscript's claim that NopT specifically proteolyzes NFR5, a major player in the response to nodule symbiosis, without being essential for plant development.</p></disp-quote><p>We also thank for this comment. We have revised the Discussion section of our manuscript and discuss now our failure to generate stable transgenic <italic>L. japonicus</italic> plants expressing NopT. We observed that the protease activity of NopT in aerial parts of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> had a negative effect on plant development, whereas NopT expression in hairy roots was possible. Such differences may be explained by different NopT substrates in roots and aerial parts of the plant. In this context, we also discuss our finding that NopT not only cleaves NFR5 but is also able to proteolyze other proteins of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> such as LjLYS11, suggesting that NopT not only suppresses Nod factor signaling, but may also interfere with signal transduction pathways related to plant immunity. We speculate that, depending on the host legume species, NopT could suppress PTI or induce ETI, thereby modulating rhizobial infection and nodule formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>This version has effectively addressed most of my concerns. However, one key issue remains unresolved regarding the mechanism of NopT in regulating nodule symbiosis. Specifically, the explanation of how NopT catabolizes NFR5 to regulate symbiosis is still not convincing within the current framework of plant-microbe interaction, where plants are understood to genetically control rhizobial colonization.</p><p>While alternative regulatory mechanisms in plant-microbe interactions are plausible, the notion that the NRG234-secreted effector NopT could reduce its own infection by either suppressing plant immunity or degrading the symbiosis receptor remains unsubstantiated. I believe further revisions are needed in the discussion section to more clearly address and clarify these findings and any lingering uncertainties.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your positive comments on the reason why NopT catabolizes NFR5 to regulate symbiosis. NopT belongs to pathogen effecftors YopT family and also cleavage <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtLYK5 and <italic>L. japonicus</italic> LjLYS11 which trigger immunity responses in plants. NFR5, AtLYK5 and LjLYS11 has the conserved amino acid motif at the juxtamembrane domain, leading to cleaving NFR5 by NopT during symbiosis. Besides, in plant-microbe interaction, effector HopB1 cleaves immune co-receptor BAK1 at the kinase domain to inhibit plant defense. The effect on cleavage of receptor may be positive or negative. NopT suppressing symbiosis may avoid preventing hyperinfection in the specific interaction between rhizobia and legumes. In the revised manuscript, we have emphasized this point more clearly in why NopT could reduce its own infection by either suppressing plant immunity in discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Evaluation of the author's responses to the reviewer comments during the first review round</p><p>Reviewer's Comment:</p><p>Regardless of whether Nicotiana leaf cells or Lotus root cells are used as the test platform, the Western blots indicate that only a small proportion of NFR5 is cleaved when co-expressed with NopT, and most of the NFR5 persists in its full-length form (Figures 3A-D).
