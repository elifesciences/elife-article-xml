shown to affect inner ear sensory hair cells in a variety of deleterious manners, including damaging the stereocilia core. The damaged sites can be visualized as ‘gaps’ in phalloidin staining of F-actin, and the enrichment of monomeric actin at these sites, along with an actin nucleator and crosslinker, suggests that localized remodeling occurs to repair the broken filaments. Herein, we show that gaps in mouse auditory hair cells are largely repaired within 1 week of traumatic noise exposure through the incorporation of newly synthesized actin. We provide evidence that Xin actin binding repeat containing 2 (XIRP2) is required for the repair process and facilitates the enrichment of monomeric γ-actin at gaps. Recruitment of XIRP2 to stereocilia gaps and stress fiber strain sites in fibroblasts is force-dependent, mediated by a novel mechanosensor domain located in the C-terminus of XIRP2. Our study describes a novel process by which hair cells can recover from sublethal hair bundle damage and which may contribute to recovery from temporary hearing threshold shifts and the prevention of age-related hearing loss.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair cells</kwd><kwd>stereocilia</kwd><kwd>repair</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>mechanosensation</kwd><kwd>hearing

exposed to continuous mechanical stimulation from noise and head movement, which can, in some cases, be harmful to the sensitive structures of the cells, including the apical mechanosensitive apparatus known as the hair bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wagner and Shin, 2019</xref>). The hair bundle, composed of filamentous (F)-actin-based stereocilia arranged in a staircase-like format, is deflected in response to mechanical stimulation, which causes the opening of mechanotransduction (MET) channels at stereocilia tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hudspeth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fettiplace, 2017</xref>). Intense stimulation, such as from loud noise, can cause damage to the stereocilia F-actin cores, which is visible by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as disorganization of the paracrystalline structure of negatively stained actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tilney et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engström et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liberman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liberman and Dodds, 1987</xref>) or by confocal light microscopy as ‘gaps’ in phalloidin-labeled F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avinash et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyantseva et al., 2009</xref>). This damage is likely to decrease the rigidity of the bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saunders et al., 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duncan and Saunders, 2000</xref>), which could lead to reduced MET. In order to preserve hair cell function, an active repair mechanism would be needed to repair any damage to stereocilia F-actin. Passive repair through actin treadmilling is unlikely to be sufficient, because, unlike in most F-actin-based structures, F-actin turnover in stereocilia is mostly restricted to a dynamic zone at stereocilia tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyantseva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrade, 2015</xref>) found that monomeric β- and γ-actin, as well as the actin-associated factors cofilin and espin, are enriched at phalloidin-negative gaps in stereocilia F-actin. The presence of monomeric actin, along with espin, which can crosslink actin filaments, and cofilin, which has actin severing activity and can nucleate F-actin assembly at high concentrations, led the authors to suggest that localized actin remodeling occurs at these sites to repair the damage. It was also shown that inner hair cell (IHC) stereocilia in mice lacking γ-actin develop gaps in the absence of overstimulation. Therefore γ-actin is likely important for the repair of gaps or in the prevention of their formation. However, they did not conclusively show that this damage can be repaired or how repair might occur.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the number of noise-induced gaps in murine hair cell stereocilia actin cores decreases to baseline levels within 1 week of exposure and that newly synthesized actin is incorporated into the stereocilia core in this time frame, suggesting that the damage is repaired through localized F-actin remodeling. We further provide evidence for an involvement of Xin actin binding repeat containing 2 (XIRP2) in this repair process. XIRP2 expression is enriched in hair cells where it colocalizes with F-actin-based structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Francis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scheffer et al., 2015</xref>). XIRP2 is expressed in two main isoforms: a long isoform that includes a known F-actin binding domain encoded by exon 7, and a short isoform that lacks exon 7, but includes a LIM domain and an uncharacterized C-terminal domain (CTD). The long isoform primarily localizes to the cuticular plate and cell junctions, while the short isoform is enriched in stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Francis et al., 2015</xref>). XIRP2 knockout mice have normal hair bundle development, but F-actin core disruption is visible as early as P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scheffer et al., 2015</xref>) and stereocilia degeneration is detectable by P12, leading to hearing loss by 7 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Francis et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with a role in stereocilia repair, we find that XIRP2, mediated by its CTD, localizes to stereocilia F-actin gaps. We further show that in fibroblasts, XIRP2’s CTD is recruited to laser-induced stress fiber strain sites, reminiscent of a subset of LIM domain proteins that were previously implicated in F-actin repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uemura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Our study thus provides evidence for a novel stereocilia repair process, in which XIRP2 senses F-actin lesions in a force-dependent manner, and subsequently orchestrates an actin remodeling process to repair the lesion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exposure to loud noise causes reversible damage to the stereocilia F-actin core</title><p>As was previously reported in guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avinash et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyantseva et al., 2009</xref>), exposure to prolonged loud noise causes damage to the core of sensory hair cell stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), visualized as ‘gaps’ in phalloidin labeling of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), which are most easily observed in the tallest row stereocilia of IHCs.

We chose to focus on IHCs in this part of the study both because noise damages IHC bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liberman, 1987</xref>) and because of their relative ease of visualization with light microscopy compared to OHCs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Noise-induced lesions in the F-actin cores of stereocilia is repaired by actin remodeling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon showing cross section of the organ of Corti.

In order to determine whether gaps are repaired, we quantified gap frequency (determined as the percent of IHCs with gaps) in a time course following traumatic noise exposure (2 hr, 120 dB broadband noise). Following an initial increase in gap frequency from 4.89±1.97% to 21.39±4.29% in mice 1 hr following noise (*, p=0.013), the percent of IHCs with gaps decreased to 12.80±4.76% by 8 hr post noise (n.s., p=0.312) and to 4.00±1.76% by 1 week post noise (**, p=0.008). Gap frequency 1 week following noise exposure was no longer significantly different from the baseline level (n.s., p=0.998), suggesting that noise-induced gaps are largely repaired within this time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To address the possibility that the decrease in gap frequency was due to the death of damaged cells, we quantified the amount of IHC death at each timepoint before and after noise exposure.

Another potential explanation for the decrease in gap frequency was the shedding of damaged stereocilia. However, we also did not observe any significant change in IHC tallest row stereocilia number following noise exposure (No Noise vs 1 hr, p&gt;0.999, No Noise vs 8 hr, p=0.969, No Noise vs 1 week, p=0.969) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), consistent with repair being the primary cause of the decrease in gap frequency.</p><p>We hypothesized that gaps repaired by localized remodeling would incorporate newly synthesized actin. Therefore, as an alternative approach to demonstrate the repair of gaps, we examined the localization of actin synthesized following noise exposure. C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-tdTomato,Actb/EGFP)1Erv/J mice (Jackson Laboratories strain #029889, common name FLEx-β-actin-EGFP) were crossed to the tamoxifen-inducible Cre line B6.Cg<italic>-Ndor1<sup>Tg(UBC-cre/ERT2)1Ejb</sup>/1</italic>J (Jackson Laboratories strain # 007001, common name Ubc-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>), to create the FLEx-β-actin-EGFP+;Ubc-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>+mice.

Four days following tamoxifen injection, to provide time for maximal Cre recombination, we exposed FLEx-β-actin-EGFP+;Ubc-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>+mice to traumatic noise (2 hr, 120 dB broadband) and allowed the mice to recover for 1 week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), during which time gaps were repaired in our previous experiment. Due to minimal actin turnover in stereocilia, when unexposed to noise, EGFP-β-actin is localized only to stereocilia tips in these mice as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–L</xref>, red arrows). However, if newly synthesized β-actin is incorporated into gaps during repair, we would expect to see patches of EGFP-β-actin at discrete sites along the length of stereocilia with intact phalloidin staining in addition to the staining at the stereocilia tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Consistent with this, we see areas of enrichment of newly synthesized β-actin in stereocilia following noise exposure which are likely sites of repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–L</xref>, yellow arrows). Due to low Cre recombination rates (~10% of IHCs) and dim EGFP-β-actin fluorescence, quantification of the occurrence of these ‘repaired gaps’ was not possible, but their presence supports the complementary evidence that noise-induced stereocilia core damage is repaired.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>XIRP2 is enriched at gaps and is required for their repair</title><p>Monomeric β- and γ-actin and several actin-associated factors have been shown to be enriched at gaps, where they likely contribute to the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyantseva et al., 2009</xref>).

We therefore hypothesized that the short form-specific LIM domain and the CTD might be required for XIRP2’s role in the hair bundle, including its recruitment to gaps. To test this possibility, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), we made a mouse in which the LIM domain and CTD are removed. Due to the overlapping but differing reading frames in the C-termini of long and short isoforms of XIRP2, it was impossible to specifically delete the LIM domain and the CTD of short XIRP2 without affecting long XIRP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Previous work has shown that in vitro fluid jet overstimulation of the hair bundle causes a decrease in bundle stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saunders et al., 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saunders et al., 1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duncan and Saunders, 2000</xref>) without breakage of interstereociliary links (including the tip links), which was proposed to be due to damage to the stereocilia core or to the rootlet where the stereocilia is inserted into the cuticular plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duncan and Saunders, 2000</xref>). Consistent with our observed repair of stereocilia cores through actin remodeling, recovery of bundle stiffness was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saunders et al., 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duncan and Saunders, 2000</xref>), dependent on hair cell metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saunders et al., 1986a</xref>). The recovery occurred on a faster time scale than that which we observed, but it is possible that the intensity of damage was less severe due to the in vitro nature of the experiment or that recovery time is variable between species. Additionally, we cannot rule out repair of damage to the stereocilia rootlet, which was difficult to evaluate with confocal microscopy, contributed to stiffness recovery in their experiments. Further investigation of the actin core ultrastructure will be necessary to evaluate this possibility.</p><p>The vulnerability of stereocilia cores is compounded by the extremely slow turnover of F-actin. In many actin-based structures actin is continuously turned over by a process known as treadmilling, in which actin monomers are added to the plus-end of the filament at the same rate as they are removed from the minus end, maintaining the filament at a constant length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">dos Remedios et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, stereocilia actin is stable, except for a small dynamic region at the very tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>), preventing the damaged region from being replaced passively through turnover and necessitating an active repair mechanism to restore bundle rigidity and MET function. Actin monomers, an actin crosslinker, and an actin nucleator, which could serve as building blocks for new F-actin assembly, were found to be enriched at phalloidin-negative gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyantseva et al., 2009</xref>), supporting this possibility. Combined with the decrease in gaps we found after recovery from noise exposure and incorporation of β-actin synthesized following noise exposure in discrete patches along the stereocilia shaft, we posit that these factors are recruited to gaps to facilitate the assembly of new actin polymers to replace the damaged filaments. Although we do observe newly synthesized β-actin in repaired gaps, it is possible that depolymerized actin from damaged filaments is also recycled during the repair process, which, together with the low Cre recombination rate, might explain the low frequency at which were able to observe repaired gaps harboring newly synthesized actin and the dim signal at these sites compared to stereocilia tips. As we did not observe EGFP-labeled β-actin along the whole length of the stereocilia following noise, we propose that short filaments spanning the length of the gap are synthesized and attached to existing undamaged regions of the actin core through direct annealing, which has been described in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murphy et al., 1988</xref>). Although actin polymerization at the minus end of the filament is less energetically favorable than at the plus end, another possibility is that actin monomers are added on to filaments on both sides of the gap to fill in the damaged region and then the pieces are annealed together, possibly supported by the split staining of XIRP2 on either side of some gaps.</p><p>Actin monomers and the actin crosslinker espin appear to be recruited to gaps in an XIRP2-dependent manner, as demonstrated by the decrease in β-actin,γ-actin, and espin gap enrichment in <italic>Xirp2</italic> knockout mice. We also found that heterologously expressed XIRP2 interacts with both monomeric β- and γ-actin and this interaction is presumably important for their recruitment to gaps. The decrease in monomeric actin gap localization is potentially the primary reason for the lack of gap repair that we observe in <italic>Xirp2</italic> knockout mice, as evidenced by increased gaps in <italic>Xirp2</italic> knockout mice in the absence of noise trauma and lack of decrease in gaps following noise exposure.</p><p>We previously reported that among the multiple XIRP2 isoforms expressed in hair cells, short XIRP2 (Genbank ID KM273012) specifically and exclusively localizes to the hair bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Francis et al., 2015</xref>). Immunostaining with isoform-specific antibodies demonstrated that only short XIRP2 is enriched at gaps in phalloidin staining. In contrast to the long XIRP2 isoform, short XIRP2 contains a LIM domain followed by the CTD. Our studies on the <italic>Xirp2<sup>ΔLIM/CTD</sup></italic> mice, where the LIM domain and CTD of the short isoform are removed, demonstrated the importance of these domains for targeting XIRP2 to the F-actin lesion sites.</p><p>Our efforts to identify the mechanism by which XIRP2 is recruited to the lesion sites were guided by an emerging concept in the field of mechanobiology. It has long been appreciated that extrinsic forces can modify the interaction between F-actin and its binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jégou and Romet-Lemonne, 2021</xref>). The interaction of F-actin with proteins such as the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Risca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pandit et al., 2020</xref>), ADF-cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pavlov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mizuno et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wioland et al., 2019</xref>) and alpha-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mei et al., 2020</xref>) is modified (‘tuned’) by mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun and Alushin, 2022</xref>). A subset of LIM domain proteins, however, is unique in that their affinity to F-actin is ‘switched on’ by binding to strained F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Winkelman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sala and Oakes, 2021</xref>). These proteins have been previously shown to recruit repair proteins to these strain sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uemura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2020</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that XIRP2 might be recruited to F-actin lesion sites and facilitate repair in a similar manner. While previous studies have suggested that strain recognition requires multiple LIM domains in series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Winkelman et al., 2020</xref>), the first LIM domain from the protein testin was recently shown to recognize strained F-actin on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sala and Oakes, 2021</xref>). Surprisingly, however, it was the isolated CTD of XIRP2 that we found was sufficient for recruitment to these strain sites. Interestingly, mechanosensitivity is not found in the full-length XIRP2 protein, suggesting that XIRP2’s mechanosensitivity is regulated, potentially in an autoinhibitory manner, reminiscent of the reported behavior of testin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sala and Oakes, 2021</xref>).</p><p>It is our leading hypothesis that the CTD of XIRP2 constitutes a novel class of mechanosensitive protein domain. Further in vitro studies with purified proteins are needed to demonstrate that the mechanosensitivity of XIRP2’s CTD is an intrinsic property, and not mediated by an interacting protein. The CTD consists of ~470 aa, spanning half the length of the short isoform of XIRP2, and lacks any predicted peptide domains. Future studies will determine the exact mechanosensitive domain, and the structural features that mediate force-dependent interaction with F-actin. The CTD also helps recruit additional repair factors including monomeric actin and the crosslinker espin to gaps, suggesting that XIRP2 functions not only as a damage sensor, but also as an organizer of the subsequent actin remodeling efforts.</p><p>A crucial question lingers concerning the applicability of force-dependent repair mechanisms observed at stress fibers to stereocilia actin repair. Stress fibers, characterized by their contractile nature and exposure to tensile forces, differ from the F-actin core of stereocilia, where such force conditions have not been reported. Nonetheless, it is plausible that high frequency and amplitude deflection of hair bundles induces localized stress along the shafts of stereocilia, causing focal destabilization and depolymerization of actin. Consequently, this process may cause bending or torsion of the remaining actin fibers, providing a binding signal for XIRP2.</p><p>Interestingly, XIRP2 appears to remain at damaged sites after they have been repaired, as we see XIRP2 co-enriched with patches of newly synthesized EGFP-β-actin at presumed sites of repair and the number of XIRP2-enriched sites following noise exposure remains elevated, despite the decrease in gaps during this time period. One possibility for XIRP2’s continued presence might be that gaps are not fully repaired over the 1-week period following noise exposure, but this is unlikely unless there is very minor damage remaining which cannot be observed with the resolution of light microscopy. However, if this is not the case, it may indicate that XIRP2 has a further role following the repair of the actin core, possibly in reenforcing the structure at vulnerable sites.</p><p>The <italic>Xirp2<sup>ΔLIM/CTD</sup></italic> mouse allowed us to partially separate XIRP2’s function in gaps from its other, as of yet uncharacterized, roles in hair cells. Truncated short XIRP2 is still expressed in these mice and still appears to be localized normally in the hair bundle, except it is no longer enriched in gaps. If, as we suspect, XIRP2-ΔLIM/CTD is still able to perform the other functions of XIRP2, the build-up of unrepaired gaps in the <italic>Xirp2<sup>ΔLIM/CTD</sup></italic> mouse likely leads to the development of hearing loss in these mice, even in the absence of noise trauma. However, the mild hearing phenotypes suggest that the role of XIRP2 in undamaged regions of the stereocilia core may also play an important role in the maintenance of hearing function.</p><p>The connection between repair of gaps and hearing loss is also supported by the progressive increase in hearing thresholds in <italic>Xirp2</italic> knockout mice. The build-up of unrepaired gaps in the absence of XIRP2 may lead to the worsening phenotype, suggesting that gap repair could be necessary for the prevention of age-related hearing loss. Interestingly, the phenotype seems to be exacerbated when the <italic>Xirp2</italic> mutation was backcrossed to the C57Bl/6J strain, which harbors a mutation in the tip-link protein, CDH23. An intriguing possibility is that weakened or non-functional tip links make hair cells more sensitive to the development of gaps and intensify the effect of the loss of XIRP2.</p><p>We also propose here that repair of gaps may contribute to partial recovery from noise-induced hearing loss. Repair of other hair bundle structures like tip links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Indzhykulian et al., 2013</xref>), which are broken following noise exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pickles et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Husbands et al., 1999</xref>), has been hypothesized to contribute to the decrease in hearing thresholds following an initial large TTS. The increased susceptibility of <italic>Xirp2</italic> knockout mice to permanent noise-induced hearing loss is consistent with actin core repair also contributing to this threshold recovery. Although the initial TTS was unexpectedly smaller in <italic>Xirp2</italic> knockout mice compared to WT, the recovery over the 2-week period following noise exposure was dampened in <italic>Xirp2</italic> knockouts, leading to mildly, but significantly, elevated hearing thresholds. The relatively small difference between genotypes was unsurprising, however, if repair of gaps is only one of many factors contributing to this recovery, most of which we do not predict to be altered in the absence of XIRP2.</p><p>Despite our functional data demonstrating progressive hearing loss and a reduced ability to withstand noise damage in <italic>Xirp2</italic> knockout mice, it is difficult to directly address the effects of gap formation and repair on hearing function because we do not have a method to specifically induce stereocilia core damage in vivo without damaging other hair cell structures. Much research on age-related and noise-induced hearing loss focuses on hair cell death and damage to the stria vascularis, which maintains the ion concentrations necessary for MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). However, there is evidence to suggest that unrepaired damage to the hair bundle, possibly including actin core lesions, also plays a role in the development of noise-induced hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liberman and Dodds, 1987</xref>). More recently, a human cadaver analysis from the Liberman lab concluded that hearing performance in humans might better correlate with hair bundle morphology than hair cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu and Liberman, 2022</xref>), further highlighting the significance of hair bundle damage for understanding progressive hearing loss. This study also implied that hair cells might persist with damaged hair bundles in a hypo-functional state, opening up a treatment window for strategies to boost hair bundle repair and function.</p><p>This study sheds further light on the importance of repair of sublethal damage to hair cells in order to preserve hearing function following traumatic noise exposure and in aging animals. Due to the inability of mature mammalian hair cells to regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Groves, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burns and Corwin, 2013</xref>), repair mechanisms are necessary to restore MET and prevent hearing loss. Herein, we add stereocilia actin cores to the growing list of hair cell structures, including tip links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Indzhykulian et al., 2013</xref>), and controversially, synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shi et al., 2013</xref>), capable of recovery in mammalian hair cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care and handling</title><p>The care and use of animals for all experiments described conformed to NIH guidelines.

To induce maximal stereocilia core damage for experiments in which gaps were quantified or newly synthesized actin incorporation localization was analyzed, mice were exposed to 2 hr of broadband (1–22 kHz) noise at 120 dB. Following noise exposure mice were allowed to recover for 1 hr, 8 hr, or 1 week. To induce a mild permanent hearing threshold shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paquette et al., 2016</xref>), mice were exposed to 105 dB octave band (8–16 kHz) noise for 1 hr. ABRs were assessed 1 day before,1 day after, and 2 weeks after noise exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Gap quantification</title><p>Inner ears were collected and fixed prior to fine dissection of organs of Corti and utricles. For each experiment in which gaps were quantified in auditory hair cells, three images were collected for each whole-mounted cochlea at specified positions in the cochlear apex (5%, 20%, and 40% of full cochlear length). Each image contained ~15 IHCs. The percent of cells with gaps was calculated for each cochlea. For experiments in which gaps were quantified in vestibular hair cells, four images were collected for each whole-mounted utricle (two in the striola, one in the medial extrastriola, and one in the lateral extrastriola). Each extrastriolar image contained ~80 hair cells and each striolar image contained ~60 hair cells. Confocal stacks were taken at each site spanning the length of the hair bundle with a 0.40 µm step size. The number of gaps in tallest row IHC stereocilia or utricle hair bundles and the cell number was quantified for each image and the percent of cells with gaps was quantified for each utricle or cochlea.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cell death and stereocilia number quantification</title><p>Using the same images collected for quantification of gaps following noise exposure (three images per cochlea at defined apical regions), the number of dead IHCs was quantified to calculate the percentage of dead IHCs per cochlea. The same images were also used to quantify changes in stereocilia number following noise exposure. The number of tallest row stereocilia for each IHC was quantified, ensuring that the counted stereocilia were attached to the cuticular plate at the rootlet. The average number of stereocilia per IHC was calculated for each cochlea.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification of gap enrichment immunostaining</title><p>For vestibular hair cell quantification, both utricles were collected from each of four mice and four images were taken from each utricle (two striolar, one medial extrastriolar, and one lateral extrastriolar). For IHC quantification after noise exposure, both organs of Corti were collected 1 hr after 4 hr broadband noise exposure (described above). Three images at defined locations in the cochlear apex were taken from each organ of Corti. For each phalloidin negative gap, a line scan of fluorescence intensity was generated for the phalloidin and XIRP2, <italic>β-actin</italic>, γ-actin, or espin. At the center of the gap (defined by the point with lowest phalloidin fluorescence intensity) and the edge of the gap (defined as the point where phalloidin signal begins to decrease), the fluorescence intensity was determined for XIRP2, <italic>β-actin</italic>, γ-actin, or espin. The intensity at the center of the gap was divided by the intensity at the edge of the gap to get the enrichment ratio. The average XIRP2, <italic>β-actin</italic>, γ-actin, or espin gap enrichment ratio was calculated for each utricle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Live cell imaging</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were obtained from ATCC (CRL-252, authenticated).

Briefly, prior to initiation of a time lapse, a 5 μm linear region was drawn in Slidebook over the SFs that were to be damaged. Cells were imaged for 3 min and 30 s, alternating between the actin and XIRP2 channels, with images taken approximately every 2 s. After 30 s of imaging the steady state, the marked 5 μm region was illuminated with the 405 laser at a power of 370 μW for 1.5 s to induce a strain site via photoablation. The remainder of the time lapse was then imaged. Images were analyzed in Python. Each time lapse was first broken into two stacks representing the EGFP (XIRP2 constructs) channel and the mApple-actin channel. Each stack was first flat-field corrected and photobleach corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jost and Waters, 2019</xref>). The EGFP-XIRP2 channel was then registered using the whole image via an efficient sub-pixel registration algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guizar-Sicairos et al., 2008</xref>). The calculated registration shifts from the EGFP-XIRP2 channel were then applied to the mApple-actin channel, and both channels were cropped to a region of 121×121 pixels (∼21×21 μm<sup>2</sup>) centered on the ablation region. For each channel, an average intensity image was created by averaging the frames in the stack before the ablation event. A relative difference was determined at each time point by subtracting the reference image from a given frame, and then dividing by the reference image. A mask of the brightest 5% of points relative to the reference image in the EGFP-XIRP2 channel was created for each time point. The average value of the masked points in each channel was then plotted as a function of time to create a trace of the normalized fluorescence intensity for each video. Average traces were created by averaging the traces from multiple videos and plotting the mean ± the standard deviation for each time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>NIH-3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1658). To minimize passage numbers, cells were banked after receiving the cells from ATCC, and experiments were performed using subcultures that were passaged less than 10 times and less than a year old since initial purchase from ATCC. Cells are tested every 6–8 weeks for absence of mycoplasma contamination. NIH-3T3 cells were seeded on six-well plates and allowed to grow to 70% confluency at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies).

Thirty µl of 2× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Novex by Life Technologies) was added to the samples. Ten µl of each sample and 3% input of each cell lysate was loaded on a 4–12% Bis-Tris pre-cast SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) for 30 min at RT and incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4°C overnight in TBST with 5% BSA: monoclonal mouse GFP antibody (B-2: sc-9996, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, 1:500), polyclonal pan-XIRP2 antibody (custom generated [see above], Proteintech, 1:1000), monoclonal mouse IgG<sub>1</sub>γ-actin antibody (1–24: sc-65635, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, 1:1000), and mouse monoclonal β-actin antibody (AC-15: sc-69879, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, 1:1000).

This study provides mechanistic insight into the process by which the mechanosensitive stereocilia of the hair cells can recover from damage-induced gaps in their actin core, possibly allowing for the rescue of transient hearing loss after noise exposure. This manuscript will be of considerable interest to the inner ear field as well as readers with a broader interest in actin cytoskeleton dynamics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72681.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/052gg0110</institution-id><institution>University of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Alushin</surname><given-names>Gregory M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0420db125</institution-id><institution>The Rockefeller University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.10.455815">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.10.455815v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gregory M Alushin (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the reviewers stated that additional experiments are needed to identify the mechanism of action of XIRP2. In particular, the claim made that XIRP2 likely employs a mechanism similar to other LIM domain-containing proteins for repairing mechanical damage to actin bundles is not well supported by the data. Evidence should be provided to show that XIRP2 LIM domains bind to stressed, strained or damaged actin and that XIRP2 recruits G-actin to breaks in noise-damaged stereocilia (and that this process is absent in XIRP2 knock-out mice).

We nevertheless believe this story overall represents a satisfactory advance suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, pending revision to address the major and minor concerns outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors make a significant analogy throughout the paper of XIRP2-mediated repair to zyxin/paxillin-mediated stress fiber repair, proposing that it's LIM domain-containing isoform may recognized tensed actin. Almost all mechano-responsive families of LIM domain proteins contain multiple tandem LIM domains, which bind to tensed actin at Stress Fiber Strain Sites (SFSS) by a cumulative mechanism (Sun et al., PMID 33058779; Winkelman et al., PMID 32989126). This activity is clearly conserved, as a yeast LIM domain protein homologous to paxillin localized to SFSS in mammalian cells (Winkelman et al.)</p><p>The authors' sequence analysis only identified a single predicted LIM domain in the short isoform of XIRP2, which would be incompatible with the requirement for tandem LIM domains. However, Sala and Oakes (PMID 34038160) recently reported that individual LIM domains excised from the protein testin rapidly localize to SFSS, which was also observed for the protein PDLIM1 by Sun et al., albeit with substantially delayed kinetics, suggesting recognition of a mark other than strained actin.</p><p>Based on the current evidence in the literature, it is thus unclear whether XIRP1 is likely to be using a similar mechanism to strained actin binding by tandem LIM proteins. The authors could address this point by expressing fluorescently labeled short-isoform XIRP2 in tissue culture cells (e.g. Mouse Embroynic Fibroblasts or U2OS cells), and observing whether it localizes to SFSS marked by co-expression with zyxin. This would substantially strengthen the authors case for a strained-actin binding mechanism.</p><p>2) By introducing a STOP codon before the LIM domain of short XIRP2 in mice IHCs, the authors demonstrate that this truncated variant of short XIRP2 acts as a separation of function mutant that phenocopies Xirp2 knockout mice in γ-actin recruitment deficiency, but still localizes to stereocilia F-actin cores. The authors then proceed to claim that this is consistent with previously reported LIM domain proteins recognizing tensed actin. Based on the sequence diagram of short XIRP2 in Figure 6. A-C, the authors' XIRP2-ΔCterm construct appears to truncate over half of short XIRP2. While the authors address the alternative hypothesis that the non-LIM domain-containing C-terminus could also recognize gaps in stereocilia, I am concerned about the choice to truncate over half of the protein as a method to ablate the LIM domain of short XIRP2 in vivo. The authors could demonstrate that the LIM domain of short XIRP2 is required for gap localization/repair by overexpressing either WT short XIRP2, or ΔLIM short XIRP2 in XIRP2-ΔCterm mice IHCs. While this is not endogenous expression, it overcomes the challenge of introducing mutations also impact the long isoform. If this is not technically feasible, ectopic expression in tissue culture cells and monitoring SFSS localization as described above would be a suitable alternative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Gamma-actin immunolabeling is unexpectedly absent from stereocilia shaft (Figure 5A, C; Figure 6J). However, to my knowledge, previous labeling of both β- and γ-actin showed signal along the whole stereocilium (Belyantseva PNAS 2009, or for example Zhang Nature 2012). The antibody used appears to be a Santa Cruz commercial reagent. Was it validated previously, and is there an explanation for why it would not label F-actin? As this antibody appears different from the one(s) used previously, could it detect only monomeric actin? If this is the case, how was this conclusion established? These questions are pertinent as this product is used to generate image panels and quantifications that are directly relevant to the main conclusions of the study.</p><p>2) The Xirp2 DelCter strain is a very elegant way to address the specific role of the short isoform and the LIM domain during gap repair. This strain has the powerful potential to directly link gap repair to ABR threshold shits, as the truncated DelCter short isoform protein is still at stereocilia shafts, but missing at gaps, and the long isoform is intact. However key results are missing to verify that DelCter animals indeed have an excess of gaps, as the full KO, and as expected if the short isoform is the protein enriched there via the LIM domain. Currently, the DelCter strain is only used to show loss of XIRP2 and γ-actin enrichment at gaps (Figure 6). Along the same lines, the TTS rescue in Figure 7 would be more powerful if it included the DelCter and not (only) the full KO strain. This would ideally substantiate the claim that poorer threshold recovery in Xirp2 mutant(s) is linked to lack of repair at gaps.</p><p>3) Experimental details are generally limited in the current manuscript on several levels. This is reflected both in figure legends and Methods sections.</p><p>The number of cells analyzed is often not clear, and in some cases, other unexpected units are used instead. For example, in Figure 3J, n (=21) is &quot;images&quot; and there appears to be 21 points on the graph, but how exactly is &quot;enriched sites per HC&quot; (Y axis) derived from one image? This also applies to Figure 1D-G, Figure 4 and others. In some cases, n is a number of organ of Corti, but the uncertainty is the same, as Y axis represents a % of cells, of # gaps per cell. It would be best to use n as the total number of cells analyzed while keeping information about organ and animal number. In addition, the corresponding analysis method(s) to derive Y values from images could be more detailed in Methods.</p><p>In the text, gap quantification changes from #gaps/hair cell (line 87: 0.08 before noise) to % of HC with gaps (line 94: 4.89% before noise). If there is a good rationale to switch between these two formulations, it would be useful to clarify and discuss why. Do rare HCs with gaps have more than one gap? Does it mean that having one gap makes a HC more susceptible to get more?</p><p>According to Methods, statistical tests are either t-tests for paired comparisons or 2-way ANOVA for ABRs. I do not pretend to be an expert, but many graphs in the study compare 3 or 4 conditions, for example &quot;no noise&quot; with 1h post noise and 1-week post-noise (e.g Figure 2J, Figure 4E-G and others). I wonder if one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons would be more appropriate and stringent in these cases. For ABR graphs, it would be preferable to have multiple p values that indicate significance by frequency, as in some cases significance must differ (Figure 6L; Figure 7). This can be done with a multiple comparison post-hoc test like Sidak.</p><p>There is no supplementary material in the current manuscript, and it is likely that data generated already might be useful to bolster the conclusion of the study and make it more transparent. That includes negative results when obtained, or validation and additional characterization of the mouse strains generated in this study, especially the powerful Xirp2 DelCter, for example.</p><p>Methods include a de-noising process, but its goal is not stated. Was it used to visualize gaps? In general, a section about image acquisition and processing might be useful. How were samples mounted and imaged to quantify gaps? Were confocal stacks taken? Are images projections from stacks?</p><p>4) The hearing results would benefit from a more detailed discussion. Compared to C57BL/6J, the CBA background does not show threshold shifts at 11-12 week, and shows much milder shifts at 20 and 40 week (Figure 7). This suggests that early hearing defects in the full KO are largely caused by a modifier locus in C57BL/6J, and also suggests that threshold shifts in the DelCter strain at 20 month ( Figure 6L) are unlikely to be caused by defective short XIRP2 protein alone.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>Figure 2A, B: the phalloidin and XIRPs panels must have been switched by mistake for the utricle</p><p>Figure 1I: the tamoxifen caption looks wrong &quot;2x &lt;;:;Tamoxifen&quot;?</p><p>Figure H: please use same terminology for Β-actin-Egfp throughout the text and figures.

I have three concerns.</p><p>– The first is that there is very little evidence that XIRP2 can bind to G-actin. Although actin immunoprecipitates with GFP-XIRP2, the association could be indirect. In addition, washing with 30 mM MgCl2 is not a common way of disassembling F-actin. Are there additional references using this approach or experimental evidence of effectiveness? Even so, it would still be possible that F-actin bound to XIRP2 is resistant to disassembly. A better approach would be to show direct binding of purified XIRP2 to G-actin using an in vitro binding assay.</p><p>– One strength of the noise damage approach is that breaks are clearly shown to be induced, so they don't just result from damage during dissection. The same cannot be said for breaks in utricular stereocilia, which are long and might easily be broken during dissection. Is it possible that XIRP2 mutant stereocilia are more fragile? In that case breaks lacking γ-actin may have arisen when tissue was dissected and fixed before the normal repair complex was recruited. The idea that XIRP2 recruits G-actin to breaks would be more compelling if this were also deficient in XIRP2 KO IHC stereocilia, particularly a week after noise damage when the number of breaks is increased from baseline.</p><p>– The loss of γ-actin at breaks in mutant XIRP2 stereocilia could be indirect, stemming from changes to the structure of the stereocilia core (known to be disordered in the KO) and not the loss of XIRP2 at breaks. The δ-C-term mutant mouse is a nice approach that may well answer this question, but this mouse needs additional characterization before it is possible to interpret whether loss of γ-actin or mutant XIRP2 from breaks is due to loss of the LIM domains or just defects in the core. Characterization could include comparing stereocilia height, width, and possibly F-actin organization to WT and KO mice. The more critical experiment is measuring the number of breaks in XIRP2 δ-C-term IHC stereocilia before and after noise, and assessing γ-actin levels in those IHC stereocilia breaks.</p><p>The second part of the hypothesis is that XIRP2 is recruited to breaks via its LIM domains. The description of SFSS and LIM domains in the introduction was such an interesting comparison that it was disappointing not to see a direct test of whether XIRP2 LIM domains bind to stressed, strained, or damaged F-actin. Along those lines, it would be interesting if LIM domains from other proteins that do bind strained actin would detect stereocilia breaks when used as probes. Either finding would strengthen the paper considerably, though both are challenging experiments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Repair of Noise-Induced Damage to Stereocilia F-actin Cores is Facilitated by XIRP2 and its Novel Mechanosensor Domain&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Andrew King (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining minor issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below in the comments from Reviewer #1, before we can make a final decision:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors conducted additional experiments to support their claims that XIRP2 (1) is mechanoresponsive like other LIM domain-containing proteins but uses a distinct non-LIM mediated localization mechanism, and (2) binds monomeric γ-actin. Strikingly, their laser ablation experiments in fibroblasts revealed that it is not the LIM domain of XIRP2 that is mechanoresponsive to laser-induced stress fiber strain sites, but rather the structurally uncharacterized C-terminal domain (CTD). Their new results support a mechanism by which XIRP2 is recruited to sites of damage within F-actin core through its CTD to mediate repair in inner hair cells (IHCs). The additional data substantially strengthen their paper and reveal new insights into the mechanism of XIRP2-mediated repair of stereocilia. Furthermore, the authors' identification of a mechanism for rapid recruitment to mechanically damaged actin structures that does not depend on LIM domains is a very exciting development that is sure to stimulate additional work in the field.</p><p>We believe the authors' revisions have addressed our previous concerns and the paper is now suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, pending minor textual revision to address the points below:</p><p>1. In line 431, the authors include vinculin as one of the proteins modified (&quot;tuned&quot;) by mechanical forces on F-actin, citing Mei et al. (2020). In that paper, only ɑ-catenin was observed to display force-activated F-actin binding, while vinculin was found to be insensitive to forces along F-actin. Thus, the authors should not include vinculin in this sentence.</p><p>2. Lines 426-451: In a generally balanced fashion, the authors write that future work is necessary to determine the exact mechanosensitive domain in XIRP2's C terminus and the structural features that mediate its force-dependent interactions with F-actin. Aligned with this, we note that to our knowledge neither the individual LIM domains of testin nor XIRP2's force-responsive domain have been shown to directly bind tensed F-actin, which would require in vitro experiments with purified proteins. Some of the language in the discussion implies that this is the case. While it is of course very reasonable to speculate that this is true, we suggest that the authors be careful with their wording to make clear that this is currently a (leading) hypothesis.</p><p>2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72681.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the reviewers stated that additional experiments are needed to identify the mechanism of action of XIRP2.

We collaborated with Patrick Oakes’ lab to conduct the experiments, and the results fully support our hypothesis that XIRP2 is recruited to strained actin sites in a force-dependent manner. Surprisingly, the recruitment to laser-induced stress fiber strain sites was independent from the predicted LIM domain, but dependent on the uncharacterized C-terminal domain (CTD) of XIRP2. This marks the discovery of a novel mechanosensor domain. As Dr. Alushin writes in his recent review, the interaction of a variety of proteins with F-actin is tuned by strain, but so far, only a subset of LIM domains were ascribed a on-off switch-like recruitment to strained actin. Our data show that the CTD of XIRP2 behaves in such manner. Interestingly, the mechanosensitivity of the C-terminal domain is masked in the full length XIRP2, suggestive of a yet unknown regulatory mechanism. In addition to its relevance for hair cell biology, the discovery of this domain will help better understand the molecular and structural basis of F-actin’s mechanosensitivity.</p><p>The additional data support our proposed model of stereocilia F-actin repair, according to which mechanical stress (induced e.g. by noise) creates a partial depolymerization of F-actin that leaves the remaining actin fibers under increased strain. XIRP2, through its CTD, is then recruited to the lesion in a force-dependent manner and mediates its repair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) By introducing a STOP codon before the LIM domain of short XIRP2 in mice IHCs, the authors demonstrate that this truncated variant of short XIRP2 acts as a separation of function mutant that phenocopies Xirp2 knockout mice in γ-actin recruitment deficiency, but still localizes to stereocilia F-actin cores. The authors then proceed to claim that this is consistent with previously reported LIM domain proteins recognizing tensed actin. Based on the sequence diagram of short XIRP2 in Figure 6. A-C, the authors' XIRP2-ΔCterm construct appears to truncate over half of short XIRP2. While the authors address the alternative hypothesis that the non-LIM domain-containing C-terminus could also recognize gaps in stereocilia, I am concerned about the choice to truncate over half of the protein as a method to ablate the LIM domain of short XIRP2 in vivo. The authors could demonstrate that the LIM domain of short XIRP2 is required for gap localization/repair by overexpressing either WT short XIRP2, or ΔLIM short XIRP2 in XIRP2-ΔCterm mice IHCs. While this is not endogenous expression, it overcomes the challenge of introducing mutations also impact the long isoform. If this is not technically feasible, ectopic expression in tissue culture cells and monitoring SFSS localization as described above would be a suitable alternative.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of our finding that the C-terminal domain, and not the LIM domain of XIRP2, is responsible for recruitment to strained actin, we believe that the phenotype found in the <italic>XIRP2-ΔCterm</italic> mice (now called <italic>Xirp2-ΔLIM/CTD</italic> mouse<italic>)</italic> lacking the LIM and CTD, fully supports our conclusions. Although technically possible with gene gun transfection, transfecting hair cells with overexpressed mutant constructs is not very efficient and overexpression artifacts are expected.

This paper also showed images where the antibody predominantly labeled monomeric γ-actin at gaps. They suggested that the lack of labeling of the rest of the stereocilia core could be due to poor penetration of the primary and secondary antibodies into the highly compact F-actin.</p><p>Additionally, the observed staining pattern with this antibody appears very similar to those used in Belyantseva PNAS 2009. Like was shown in this paper, we do see labeling of whole stereocilia in some hair cells. However, in most cases, the antibody primarily labels enriched staining in gaps, with minimal staining along the rest of the stereocilium. Although not discussed in Belyantseva 2009, their antibody also appeared to predominantly label gaps in some vestibular hair cells, with weak/absent staining in the rest of the bundle, pictured in their Figure 3A-F and described here:</p><p>“In the course of characterizing the localization of the cytoplasmic actins, we observed occasional gaps in phalloidin staining of F-actin cores of vestibular hair cell stereocilia (Figure 3A–C). The gaps were most frequently observed at the base and along the length of stereocilia in the tallest row (Figure 3D). Using our γ<sub>cyto</sub>-actin specific antibodies, which recognize both globular (G) and filamentous (F) forms of actin (see SI Text), we found that gaps were enriched in γ<sub>cyto</sub>-actin. This actin population is likely to be predominantly monomeric, because phalloidin recognizes only filamentous actin (Figure 3 A–D). Usually gap staining was much more intense relative to that along the length of stereocilium (Figures 3 A–D and 3 F–M), which may be caused by enhanced antibody accessibility within the gaps. Alternatively, intense gap staining could be partially explained by the redistribution of γ<sub>cyto</sub>-actin to F-actin gaps from a pool of available non-filamentous actin within a stereocilium. A similar redistribution to F-actin gaps was also seen for β<sub>cyto</sub>-actin (Figure S3). It is likely that β<sub>cyto</sub>-actin is also recruited to the gaps from a pool of non-filamentous actin, as staining intensity along a stereocilium with a gap was not different from the intensity of staining along a stereocilium without gaps (Figure S3B). The same pattern of staining was also observed for DNase I (Figure 3E), a marker for monomeric actin (G-actin) (21), and espin (Figure 3F), an actin bundling protein essential for stereocilia formation, which is reported to have both F- and G-actin binding sites (22).”</p><p>Like they describe, we presume that the antibody is predominantly labeling monomeric γ-actin because of the lack of phalloidin staining at these sites. To support this conclusion, we co-labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-DNaseI, which binds specifically to monomeric actin (see Figure 5A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Xirp2 DelCter strain is a very elegant way to address the specific role of the short isoform and the LIM domain during gap repair.

I do not pretend to be an expert, but many graphs in the study compare 3 or 4 conditions, for example &quot;no noise&quot; with 1h post noise and 1-week post-noise (e.g Figure 2J, Figure 4E-G and others). I wonder if one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons would be more appropriate and stringent in these cases. For ABR graphs, it would be preferable to have multiple p values that indicate significance by frequency, as in some cases significance must differ (Figure 6L; Figure 7). This can be done with a multiple comparison post-hoc test like Sidak.</p></disp-quote><p>In cases where more than two groups were being compared, we reanalyzed the data using one-way ANOVA.

Compared to C57BL/6J, the CBA background does not show threshold shifts at 11-12 week, and shows much milder shifts at 20 and 40 week (Figure 7). This suggests that early hearing defects in the full KO are largely caused by a modifier locus in C57BL/6J, and also suggests that threshold shifts in the DelCter strain at 20 month ( Figure 6L) are unlikely to be caused by defective short XIRP2 protein alone.</p></disp-quote><p>These results were described in more detail in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>Figure 2A, B: the phalloidin and XIRPs panels must have been switched by mistake for the utricle.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1I: the tamoxifen caption looks wrong &quot;2x &lt;;:;Tamoxifen&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>The caption has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure H: please use same terminology for Β-actin-Egfp throughout the text and figures.

In addition, washing with 30 mM MgCl2 is not a common way of disassembling F-actin. Are there additional references using this approach or experimental evidence of effectiveness? Even so, it would still be possible that F-actin bound to XIRP2 is resistant to disassembly.

The same cannot be said for breaks in utricular stereocilia, which are long and might easily be broken during dissection. Is it possible that XIRP2 mutant stereocilia are more fragile? In that case breaks lacking γ-actin may have arisen when tissue was dissected and fixed before the normal repair complex was recruited. The idea that XIRP2 recruits G-actin to breaks would be more compelling if this were also deficient in XIRP2 KO IHC stereocilia, particularly a week after noise damage when the number of breaks is increased from baseline.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that XIRP2 mutant stereocilia are more fragile than those in WT mice, but to address that possibility that we were inducing breaks during the dissection process, all temporal bones were fixed before dissecting out organs of Corti and utricles, making it unlikely that the lack of γ-actin at gaps is due to lack of time for recruitment. Quantification of gaps in XIRP2 knockout utricles was also repeated in P20 samples to reflect this change in dissection process. Additionally, the reduction of γ-actin enrichment in gaps was also observed in gaps in inner hair cells following noise exposure (see updated results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The loss of γ-actin at breaks in mutant XIRP2 stereocilia could be indirect, stemming from changes to the structure of the stereocilia core (known to be disordered in the KO) and not the loss of XIRP2 at breaks. The δ-C-term mutant mouse is a nice approach that may well answer this question, but this mouse needs additional characterization before it is possible to interpret whether loss of γ-actin or mutant XIRP2 from breaks is due to loss of the LIM domains or just defects in the core. Characterization could include comparing stereocilia height, width, and possibly F-actin organization to WT and KO mice. The more critical experiment is measuring the number of breaks in XIRP2 δ-C-term IHC stereocilia before and after noise, and assessing γ-actin levels in those IHC stereocilia breaks.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further characterization of the XIRP2-∆Cterm strain would strengthen our study. Unfortunately, we have had difficulty in obtaining enough XIRP2-∆Cterm mice due to unexplained breeding issues including infrequent litters and small litter sizes. Therefore, we prioritized determining whether the baseline level of gaps is elevated in XIRP2-∆Cterm mice. As we would expect if XIRP2 is no longer able to be recruited to gaps to facilitate their repair, we found an elevated percentage of cells with gaps in both auditory and vestibular organs in these mice (see updated Results). Temporal bones were fixed before fine dissection of the organ of Corti and utricle to prevent the breakage of potentially weakened stereocilia during the dissection process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second part of the hypothesis is that XIRP2 is recruited to breaks via its LIM domains. The description of SFSS and LIM domains in the introduction was such an interesting comparison that it was disappointing not to see a direct test of whether XIRP2 LIM domains bind to stressed, strained, or damaged F-actin. Along those lines, it would be interesting if LIM domains from other proteins that do bind strained actin would detect stereocilia breaks when used as probes. Either finding would strengthen the paper considerably, though both are challenging experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to reviewer #1 in this matter.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining minor issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below in the comments from Reviewer #1, before we can make a final decision:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors conducted additional experiments to support their claims that XIRP2 (1) is mechanoresponsive like other LIM domain-containing proteins but uses a distinct non-LIM mediated localization mechanism, and (2) binds monomeric γ-actin. Strikingly, their laser ablation experiments in fibroblasts revealed that it is not the LIM domain of XIRP2 that is mechanoresponsive to laser-induced stress fiber strain sites, but rather the structurally uncharacterized C-terminal domain (CTD). Their new results support a mechanism by which XIRP2 is recruited to sites of damage within F-actin core through its CTD to mediate repair in inner hair cells (IHCs). The additional data substantially strengthen their paper and reveal new insights into the mechanism of XIRP2-mediated repair of stereocilia. Furthermore, the authors' identification of a mechanism for rapid recruitment to mechanically damaged actin structures that does not depend on LIM domains is a very exciting development that is sure to stimulate additional work in the field.</p><p>We believe the authors' revisions have addressed our previous concerns and the paper is now suitable for publication in eLife, pending minor textual revision to address the points below:</p><p>1. In line 431, the authors include vinculin as one of the proteins modified (&quot;tuned&quot;) by mechanical forces on F-actin, citing Mei et al. (2020). In that paper, only ɑ-catenin was observed to display force-activated F-actin binding, while vinculin was found to be insensitive to forces along F-actin. Thus, the authors should not include vinculin in this sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>In line 431, I removed the word “vinculin”, as it is not mechanosensitive on its own, as correctly pointed out by reviewer #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Lines 426-451: In a generally balanced fashion, the authors write that future work is necessary to determine the exact mechanosensitive domain in XIRP2's C terminus and the structural features that mediate its force-dependent interactions with F-actin. Aligned with this, we note that to our knowledge neither the individual LIM domains of testin nor XIRP2's force-responsive domain have been shown to directly bind tensed F-actin, which would require in vitro experiments with purified proteins. Some of the language in the discussion implies that this is the case. While it is of course very reasonable to speculate that this is true, we suggest that the authors be careful with their wording to make clear that this is currently a (leading) hypothesis.</p><p>2.</p></disp-quote><p>It is our leading hypothesis that the CTD of XIRP2 constitutes a novel class of mechanosensitive protein domain. Further in vitro studies with purified proteins are needed to demonstrate that the mechanosensitivity of XIRP2’s CTD is an intrinsic property, and not mediated by an interacting protein. The CTD consists of ~470 amino acids, spanning half the length of the short isoform of XIRP2, and lacks any predicted peptide domains. Future studies will determine the exact mechanosensitive domain, and the structural features that mediate force-dependent interaction with F-actin. The CTD also helps recruit additional repair factors including monomeric actin and the crosslinker espin to gaps, suggesting that XIRP2 functions not only as a damage sensor, but also as an organizer of the subsequent actin remodeling efforts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
