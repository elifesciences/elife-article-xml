vaccine that elicits protective antibodies is understanding the developmental pathways that result in desirable antibody features. The development of antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is particularly relevant because such antibodies have been associated with HIV protection in humans. We reconstructed the developmental pathways of six human HIV-specific ADCC antibodies using longitudinal antibody sequencing data. Most of the inferred naive antibodies did not mediate detectable ADCC. Gain of antigen binding and ADCC function typically required mutations in complementarity determining regions of one or both chains. Enhancement of ADCC potency often required additional mutations in framework regions. Antigen binding affinity and ADCC activity were correlated, but affinity alone was not sufficient to predict ADCC potency. Thus, elicitation of broadly active ADCC antibodies may require mutations that enable high-affinity antigen recognition along with mutations that optimize factors contributing to functional ADCC activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nearly four decades after the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV for short) was first identified, the search for a vaccine still continues. An effective immunisation would require elements that coax the human immune system into making HIV-specific antibodies – the proteins that can recognise, bind to and deactivate the virus.</p><p>Crucially, antibodies can also help white blood cells to target and destroy cells infected with HIV. This ‘antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity’ could be a key element of a successful vaccine, yet it has received less attention than the ability for antibodies to directly neutralize the virus. In particular, it is still unclear how antibodies develop the ability to flag HIV-infected cells for killing. Indeed, over the course of an HIV infection, an immune cell goes through genetic changes that tweak the 3D structure of the antibodies it manufactures. This process can improve the antibodies' ability to fight off the virus, but it was still unclear how it would shape antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.</p><p>To investigate this question, Doepker et al. retraced how the genes coding for six antibody families changed over time in an HIV-carrying individual. This revealed that antibodies could not initially trigger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The property emerged and improved thanks to two types of alterations in the genetic sequences. One set of changes increased how tightly the antibodies could bind to the virus, targeting sections of the antibodies that can often vary. The second set likely altered the 3D structure in others ways, potentially affecting how antibodies bind the virus or how they interact with components of the immune system that help to kill HIV-infected cells. These alterations took place in segments of the antibodies that undergo less change over time. Ultimately, the findings by Doepker et al. suggest that an efficient HIV vaccine may rely on helping antibodies to evolve so they can bind more tightly to the virus and trigger cellular cytotoxicity more strongly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>antibody development</kwd><kwd>ADCC</kwd><kwd>SHM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

we can learn from the processes that lead to potent antibody responses in natural infection to inform immunogen design. For this reason, there have been several detailed studies of the evolutionary pathways of potent and broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonsignori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonsignori et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doria-Rose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Landais et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacLeod et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simonich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). These studies highlight the critical role of somatic hypermutation (SHM), particularly in complementary determining regions (CDRs) of antibody heavy chains, in driving the breadth and potency of HIV bnAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwong and Mascola, 2018</xref>). One recent study also highlighted that maturation of the antibody light chain, too, can be critical for breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simonich et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these studies have provided important insights into the specific mutations that drive maturation of antibody lineages and specificities of bnAbs.</p><p>The keen interest in HIV bnAbs stems in part from a plethora of compelling studies that demonstrate the efficacy of bnAbs in protection of macaques from experimental SHIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pegu et al., 2017</xref>). The data are less convincing for sterilizing protection by HIV-specific non-neutralizing antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the same experimental animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fouts et al., 2015</xref>), where the functional interactions of antibodies are harder to test due to species differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bournazos et al., 2017</xref>). However, they have been implicated in protection from HIV-infection in humans in several settings. In the only partially effective HIV vaccine trial to date, antibodies that mediate ADCC were associated with protection, whereas neutralizing antibodies were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haynes et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, in the setting of mother-to-child transmission, ADCC antibodies have been associated with both decreased transmission risk and disease progression in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mabuka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milligan et al., 2015</xref>). For these reasons, ADCC antibodies, which have the potential to eliminate infected cells, have been increasingly recognized as important to consider for vaccine design and prevention efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, nothing is known about the process of SHM required for HIV specificity and ADCC function of antibodies.</p><p>In light of the relevance of ADCC antibodies in human infections, we deep sequenced the antibody repertoire of an individual who developed potent ADCC antibodies to the HIV envelope (Env) gp120 and gp41 proteins. We used computational methods that were specifically developed to study antibody evolutionary pathways to infer the naïve precursors and resolve chronological lineage intermediates leading to six different mature ADCC-mediating IgG1 antibodies that have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2019</xref>). Among the six lineages, most inferred naïve antibodies did not mediate ADCC. To develop ADCC functionality, inferred naive antibodies required CDR-localized SHM in one or both chains. In five of six cases, enhancement of ADCC potency to mature levels required mutations in framework regions (FWR), either alone or alongside additional CDR mutations. Interestingly, in one lineage, the developing antibodies first gained the capacity to bind HIV Env and then subsequently acquired ADCC activity due to additional SHM. Overall, binding affinity for Env and facilitation of ADCC were correlated, but we observed cases where binding affinity was similar amongst two antibodies within the same lineage but they differed in their ADCC capacity, suggesting that affinity alone is not sufficient for an antibody to mediate ADCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Longitudinal sequencing of six ADCC HIV-1 antibody lineages</title><p>We previously reported the isolation of six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), each with potent antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, from a sample collected 914 days post-infection (D914) from a clade A-infected Kenyan woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2019</xref>). All these mAbs derived from distinct B cell lineages, with four targeting two distinct gp41 Env epitopes (006, 016, 067, 072), and the other two targeting distinct gp120 Env epitopes (105, 157). One of the gp120 targeting mAbs (105) also had modest capacity to neutralize cell-free virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the others were non-neutralizing. To infer the ontogeny of these six mAbs, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to sequence full-length antibody variable region genes from five longitudinal blood samples collected from the subject, spanning from pre-infection (D-119) to over 4 years post-infection (D1512). Amongst the different antibody chains and timepoints sequenced, the sequencing libraries ranged widely in their sample coverage, between 6 and 409% with an average of 100% coverage, based on estimated B cell frequencies within the available peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). It is important to note that, despite the name ‘deep sequencing’, NGS-sampled datasets are relatively shallow compared to the entire repertoire. This is for two reasons: (1) each 10 mL PBMC sample is only ~0.22% of the subject’s whole-body circulating blood volume (~4.5 L), not counting lymphoid organs or peripheral tissue and (2) circulating human memory B cell repertoires fluctuate over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horns et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laserson et al., 2014</xref>), making it difficult to accurately track clonal B cell families. Despite these limitations inherent to studies of this type, our sequencing efforts successfully returned clonal sequences for all six lineages of interest.</p><table-wrap id="table1"

For the remaining five, the alternative method inferred the same naive sequence as the original method. When tested, the alternative naïve sequences did not alter antigen binding or function in five of six antibody lineages when compared to the original naïve mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

For each chain, we chose lineage intermediates with high relative confidence that were chronologically near the middle of the inferred lineage, paired them together (see Materials and methods), and performed preliminary experiments to determine whether antigen binding or ADCC gain-of-function occurred before or after these ‘middle’ intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). If the middle intermediate had function, we focused on pre-middle inferred intermediates, if available within the computationally-inferred lineages. If the middle intermediate lacked function, we focused on post-middle inferred intermediates. Selected heavy and light chain sequences, were paired together in all possible combinations, roughly chronologically (i.e. increasing SHM and within per-chain resolved chronologies), to reveal per-chain mutations contributing to mAb function. Because we did not use paired sequencing methods, these pairings do not necessarily reflect true biological intermediates, but, instead, allowed us to identify ordered steps within each chain’s maturation that conferred HIV binding and/or ADCC activity. For clarity, we are reporting only the pairings that revealed steps in gain-of-function for the six lineages.

The mAbs were screened using a library displaying gp41 and V3 peptides from HIV strains BG505.W6M.C2 (clade A), BF520.W14M.C2 (clade A), and C.ZA.1197MB (clade C). Both naive and mature 105 lineage mAbs enriched (i.e. bound to) wild-type peptides generated in the backgrounds of BG505.W6M.C2 and C.ZA.1197MB Env, but not peptides of the BF520.W14M.C2 Env background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).

There was little evidence of strong selection pressure on the 105 epitope of Env between 21 dpi and 1729 dpi. The only sweeping mutation (H308R) emerged at 189 dpi (50% frequency) and swept the population by 560 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). We infer that this substitution enabled the initial activation of the 105 lineage because this lineage prefers R308 over H308, as aforementioned, and it is known that 105 mAbs cannot mediate ADCC against autologous transmitted founder QA255.21P.A17 gp120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2015</xref>), which contains H308. Except for a subset of Q315R viruses present at 189 dpi and 560 dpi, all 308–316 residues remain stable until 1729 dpi, when substitutions are observed in 7/10 clones at either residue 308 or 316, with A316T present in 50% of 1729 dpi clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Overall, analyses of sequence variation in the 067, 072, and 105 lineages suggest limited selection pressure for escape from ADCC antibodies in this subject.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Renewed interest in ADCC-capable antibodies as important to HIV vaccine responses has highlighted the need for a better understanding of their natural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forthal and Finzi, 2018</xref>). Here, we report the evolution of six ADCC antibody lineages within a single HIV-infected individual. The inferred naïve precursors of these ADCC lineages varied in their abilities to bind HIV antigen, a finding that agrees with studies of HIV-neutralizing antibody lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stamatatos et al., 2017</xref>). To achieve potent ADCC activity, most lineages required mutations in both their heavy and light chains. There was also evidence that some of these changes contributed to greater breadth. Generally, ADCC function was achieved through mutations in CDRs, while increased ADCC potency required additional mutations in FWR. ADCC activity accompanied antigen binding in all lineages except one; in the exception, the V3/gp120-targeting 105 lineage demonstrated binding capacity prior to developing ADCC functionality. Although there was some evidence that binding affinity was not solely responsible for ADCC capability or potency, binding affinity and ADCC activity were largely correlated. In sum, this study presents six examples of developmental pathways taken by ADCC-mediating antibodies, highlighting that there are common themes in the ontogeny of HIV-specific ADCC antibodies, but that each evolutionary pathway has unique features.</p><p>Although not widely applied, antibody lineage studies require robust inference methods that account for statistical uncertainty if we are to be confident in their conclusions. This is highlighted in this study by the different properties displayed by two very similar inferred naïve precursors of the 157 lineage. The development of the 157 lineage was ambiguous: computational uncertainty in two CDRL3 residues resulted in multiple probable naive antibodies with different properties. In these different scenarios, the 157 naïve Ab was either fully capable of both antigen binding and potent ADCC, or it required two CDRL3 substitutions to achieve both functions. In the other five lineages, our use of multiple, tailored computational approaches allowed us to report results with high confidence, since the uncertainties present in computational inference of those lineages did not affect functional characteristics.</p><p>Three gp41-specific antibody lineages were not capable of binding HIV Env by their inferred naïve precursors, as measured by BLI; they developed this ability through mutation. The lack of detectable antigen binding by inferred naïve precursors is not altogether surprising as this has been observed for a number of HIV bnAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stamatatos et al., 2017</xref>). Binding capacity was gained in two of the gp41-directed lineages (006 and 067) through limited mutations localized in the CDRs of single antibody chains (either heavy or light, respectively). The other gp41-directed lineage, 016, which targets a similar epitope as the 006 lineage, required many mutations amongst the CDRs and FWRs of both chains, highlighting that the gain of activity by different lineages can vary even if they are targeting the same epitope. As is true for all studies of this type, it is possible that our methods were not sensitive enough to detect low level binding or that, despite our best efforts, the inferred naïve sequences were inaccurate. Gp41-directed antibodies have been found to recognize self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verkoczy and Diaz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Verkoczy et al., 2014</xref>) and this, or its response to another antigen, could explain how the 016 lineage emerged before gaining HIV-specificity.</p><p>We chose the RFADCC assay because RFADCC signal has been repeatedly correlated with disease outcome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dhande et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mabuka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Madhavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milligan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>), thus making it relevant to understanding the development of potentially protective responses. Additionally, we previously demonstrated that the BL035.W6M.C1 strain of gp120 used here yields RFADCC results representative of activity against seven different strains of various clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milligan et al., 2015</xref>). There was evidence that the 072 lineage had ADCC function from inception, although the amount of ADCC was low. The remaining lineages required an average of 1.2% SHM to gain detectable ADCC function (ranging 0.1–4.3% SHM). For augmentation of ADCC function to &gt;50% of mature activity, the lineages required an average of 2.2% SHM (range 0.6–4.8% SHM). NGS-sampled sequences that were present at 462 dpi displayed high function with 5.3% SHM (006 lineage), and developmental inferences for the 006-VH, 067-VH and 105-VH chains were informed by clonal sequences from only the 462 dpi time point, suggesting that the fully functional VH intermediates inferred for these lineages were likely present prior to 462 dpi. This is not surprising, as ADCC responses to HIV can develop within the first few months of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dugast et al., 2014</xref>). Low mutation levels to achieve potent ADCC are promising for ADCC vaccine efforts, especially since these six characterized lineages have desirable characteristics for combating HIV, such as potent ADCC activity, cross-clade ADCC breadth, highly conserved epitopes, and potential to help clear infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, these levels of mutation are easily attainable by vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schramm and Douek, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, most lineages required FWR mutations in one or both chains to achieve potent ADCC functionality, with or without additional CDR mutations. Although they can cost thermostability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henderson et al., 2019</xref>), FWR mutations are known to contribute to the properties of HIV-specific bnAbs, predominantly by altering Ab conformation in ways that allow conserved epitopes to be bound with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kepler and Wiehe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ovchinnikov et al., 2018</xref>). FWR residues contribute to the structure of the Ab and, though they do not usually directly contact the antigen, they can affect binding affinity indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foote and Winter, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, since they indeed affect Ab structure, FWR mutations could confer favorable Ab flexibility or an orientation that mediates better Fc receptor dimerization and ADCC potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2014</xref>). FWR mutations in Fab ‘elbow’ regions can affect conformational flexibility and paratope plasticity during bnAb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henderson et al., 2019</xref>). Here, the 006-1<sub>VH</sub> lineage intermediate caused ADCC gain-of-function and it contained, among other mutations, a CDRH3 elbow mutation Y111F. Future structural studies are warranted to explore how FWR mutations affect Ab structure and function in these lineages.</p><p>Binding affinity has been implicated in the regulation of ADCC in several studies on tumor-specific Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). Here, while binding affinity correlated with ADCC function, it was not solely responsible for ADCC potency. In one lineage, binding capacity preceded detectable ADCC function. Notably, we found that half of the lineages contained clonally-related antibodies with similar binding affinity to one another but markedly different ADCC potencies. Conversely, mAbs within the two gp120-targeted lineages exemplify that there can be dramatic differences in binding affinity among mAbs that mediate equivalent, potent ADCC activity. Thus, ADCC function cannot be predicted based on affinity alone. These data support the notion that factors such as epitope specificity, binding mode, and other antibody-antigen interaction dynamics contribute to ADCC potency, as other studies have emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orlandi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tolbert et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Amongst Env sequences collected over ~4.5 years of HIV infection in subject QA255, we observed little directional escape in the C-C’ loop and V3 epitopes targeted by the 067, 072, and 105 antibody lineages, and only at later stages of infection. This finding could indicate that selective pressure exerted by ADCC antibodies is often not enough to drive escape, although there is evidence that escape can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isitman et al., 2012</xref>). There are at least two possible explanations for limited escape from ADCC antibodies in an infected individual: one is that the activity of ADCC antibodies is insufficient to drive escape because they have limited impact on infection dynamics; the other is that the targeted killing of infected cells leads to less pressure for escape compared to the process of blocking virus entry mediated by neutralizing antibodies. If the latter is true, ADCC could be particularly useful components of vaccines responses and therapeutic tools.</p><p>Our study offers a granular understanding of how ADCC functionality developed in six human Ab lineages. The results of this study are relevant to rational vaccine design, especially as technologies for guiding Ab development continue to emerge through reverse vaccinology efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rappuoli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schramm and Douek, 2018</xref>). Additionally, the reliance on FWR mutations to achieve high ADCC functionality could inform mAb optimization strategies for therapeutic uses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(human, female)</td><td>FreeStyle 293 F cells</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat#R790-07;

The sequences from our NGS replicates were merged either cumulatively or on a per-timepoint basis, as appropriate, to achieve the highest depth possible for each analysis. Sequences were then deduplicated and annotated with partis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/psathyrella/partis">https://github.com/psathyrella/partis</ext-link>) using default options including per-sample germline inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ralph and Matsen, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ralph and Matsen, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ralph and Matsen, 2019</xref>; ). Sequences with internal stop codons or CDR3 regions that were out-of-frame or had mutated codons at the start or end were removed. Indel events were identified, tracked, and reversed for alignment purposes. We did not exclude singletons in an attempt to retain very rare or undersampled sequences. Sequencing run statistics are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

As an additional measure to ensure highest accuracy for inferred naïve sequences, the uncertainty on each inferred naive sequence was visualized both with the partis --<monospace>view-alternative-annotations</monospace> option and by comparing these results to the most likely naive sequences inferred by linearham software (see next section). The comparison revealed only the minor differences that would be expected based on linearham’s method, which uses a more detailed model to infer more accurate naive sequences for individual clonal families. For the unseeded clustering, each dataset was subsampled to 50–150K sequences for computational efficiency. For each dataset, three random subsamples were analyzed and compared to ensure that our subsampling was sufficient to minimize statistical uncertainties. Seeded analyses were not subsampled.</p><p>Due to the lack of D genes and much shorter non-templated regions in light-chain rearrangements, computational clustering analyses artifactually overestimate clonality in light chain families, that is they cluster together sequences that did not originate from the same rearrangement event, but which come from almost identical naïve rearrangements. This caveat, affecting all unpaired antibody chain sequencing studies, ultimately reduces accuracy in inferring true light chain clonal families and their maturation pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Alternative naive inference</title><p>Alternative naïve sequences were inferred by applying a Bayesian phylogenetic Hidden Markov Model approach using the linearham software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/matsengrp/linearham">https://github.com/matsengrp/linearham</ext-link>), using the partis-inferred clonal family clusters for each lineage as input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhar et al., 2020</xref>). Linearham samples naive sequences from their posterior distribution rather than providing a single naive sequence estimate, like other software programs do. The most probable linearham-predicted naïve sequences were compared to the most probable partis-predicted naïve sequences. In families with largely symmetric phylogenetic trees, the two methods return similar results, whereas with highly imbalanced trees, linearham is much more accurate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Antibody lineage reconstruction</title><p>Antibody lineages were inferred as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simonich et al., 2019</xref>).

This allowed clonal families to be reduced to the 75–100 sequences most relevant to inferring the lineage history of the antibody chain of interest (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/matsengrp/cft/blob/master/bin/prune.py">https://github.com/matsengrp/cft/blob/master/bin/prune.py</ext-link>), which was then analyzed with RevBayes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Höhna et al., 2016</xref>) using an unrooted tree model with the general time-reversible (GTR) substitution model. All settings for RevBayes runs were customized to ensure likelihood and estimated sample sizes were &gt;100 for each lineage. MCMC iterations ranged from 10,000 to 200,000, with thinning frequencies between 10 and 200 iterations and number of burn-in samples between 10 and 190. All RevBayes runs were done in technical duplicate (i.e. specifying different starting trees) and duplicates were all confirmed to agree on lineage chronology.

Since most insertion-containing clonal NGS sequences (136 of 142) encoded serine at the insertion site (amino acid position 94), we inserted S94 into 016-2<sub>VL</sub> instead of N94 that would correspond to the mature 016-VL sequence. For thoroughness, the inferred_5_789 016-VL intermediate (which precedes inferred_7_712) was synthesized both without (016-1<sub>VL</sub>) and with (016-2<sub>VL</sub>) the S94 insertion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Identification of lineage-like NGS sequences</title><p>To determine if the computationally-inferred naïve and ancestor sequences were observed in the NGS data, we performed the following procedure for each lineage (implemented in a script found here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.io/Je7Zp">https://git.io/Je7Zp</ext-link>). A local BLAST database was created for each seeded clonal family and queried for sampled sequences that had high nucleotide sequence identity to lineage members using the ‘blastn’ command (Biopython package). E-value of 0.001 was used; other settings were default. Blastn matches for each lineage member were sorted according to their percent nt identity and alignment length.

Middle intermediate chains were paired with partner naïve, middle, and mature chains and tested for antigen binding and ADCC function. Based on preliminary results using middle intermediates, ADCC-focused lineages were chosen from remaining pre-middle inferred intermediates or post-middle intermediates depending on whether the middle intermediate chain contributed to ADCC activity. If multiple relevant intermediate choices were available within the pertinent (early or late) portion of an inferred lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>), we selected sequences that had amino acid substitutions that were concentrated in CDRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and, whenever possible, we selected intermediates that were validated by NGS-sampled sequences, as aforementioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). For 067-VH, 067-VK, 072-VH, and 105-VH lineages, early mutations were implicated in ADCC gain-of-function, but we lacked early lineage resolution and therefore could not select early inferred intermediates to study. Instead, we selectively incorporated CDR substitutions from the middle intermediate sequence into the inferred naïve sequence. Non-conservative FWR3 substitutions were also incorporated into the 067-VH early lineage. For each lineage, intermediate sequences were numbered consecutively based on their position in the developmental pathway between naïve (0) and mature (m). Heavy and light chain pairings for lineage intermediates were based on chronology, which reflected levels of mutation. Each chain was paired with several partner chains for functional assessment.</p><p>Ultimately, developmental lineages featuring the minimal number of mAbs to study ADCC development were defined based on levels of mAb mutation and ADCC activity. For each lineage, the minimal antibodies included (1) the inferred naïve, (2) the most mutated intermediate(s) that lacked ADCC activity, if available, (3) the least mutated intermediate(s) that gained detectable ADCC function, and (4) the least mutated intermediate(s) that demonstrated ADCC activity comparable to the mature antibodies (&gt;50%).

To mitigate differences in activity observed with different PBMC donors and between experiments, ADCC activity for each sample was normalized to monoclonal positive control mAbs: 167-D (NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Cat #11681) for gp41-targeted Abs and C11 (NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Cat #7374) for gp120-targeted Abs. The activity of an unrelated antibody, FI6v3, that recognizes influenza hemagglutinin protein was used to define the limit of detection. For each replicate experiment, samples were categorized in the following manner: positive (sample &gt;2*FI6v3), indeterminate (1*FI6v3 ≤ sample ≤2*FI6v3), negative (sample &lt;1*FI6v3). Experiments were excluded if FI6v3 signal was &gt;10% of monoclonal positive control signal. Background (uncoated cells) and negative-control (1*FI6v3) signal was subtracted from each sample’s activity and the resultant values were averaged across experimental replicates, normalized to the respective lineage’s mature mAb activity, and plotted in Prism v8.0c (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). A designation of indeterminate was also assigned in cases where samples were negative in the majority of experimental replicates, but indeterminate or positive in any replicate(s). In such cases, average activity was reported as usual.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Biolayer interferometry</title><p>QA255 monoclonal antibody binding to monomeric gp120 or gp41 was measured using biolayer interferometry on an Octet RED instrument (ForteBio, Fremont, CA). Antibodies diluted to 8 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> in a filtered buffer solution of 1X PBS containing 0.1% BSA, 0.005% Tween-20, and 0.02% sodium azide were immobilized onto anti-human IgG Fc capture biosensors (ForteBio). C.ZA.1197MB or BL035.W6M.C1 gp41 was diluted to 250 nM, or as indicated, in the same buffer (above) and a series of up to six, two-fold dilutions were tested as analytes in solution at 30°C. The kinetics of mAb binding were measured as follows: association was monitored for 180 s, dissociation was monitored for 180 s, and regeneration was performed in 10 mM Glycine HCl (pH 1.5). For experiments in which dilution series were run, binding-affinity constants (K<sub>D</sub>; on-rate, K<sub>on</sub>; off-rate, K<sub>dis</sub>) were calculated using ForteBio’s Data Analysis Software 7.0. Responses (nanometer shift) were calculated and background-subtracted using double referencing against the buffer reference signal and non-specific binding of biosensor to analyte. Data were processed by Savitzky-Golay filtering prior to fitting using a 1:1 model of binding kinetics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Epitope mapping with phage-DMS</title><p>Profiling of escape mutations was done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garrett et al., 2020</xref>). We utilized a deep mutational scanning (DMS) phage display library containing wildtype and mutant peptides that tile across the gp41 and V3 portions of three Envelope strains (BG505.W6M.C2, BF520.W14M.C2, and C.ZA.1197MB). Peptides in the library are 31 amino acids long and contain every possible single amino acid mutation at the central position, with peptides overlapping by 30 amino acids. Immunoprecipitation was performed in technical duplicate by incubating 10 ng of antibody sample with 1 mL of gp41/V3 Phage-DMS library at a concentration representing 200,000 pfu/mL of each unique clone. Antibody and phage were allowed to form complexes by rocking overnight at 4°C in 96-deep-well plates that had been pre-blocked with 3% BSA in TBST. To isolate phage-antibody complexes, 20 uL each of Protein A and Protein G Dynabeads were added and incubated at 4°C for 4 hr. Beads were magnetically separated, washed 3x with 400 µL wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1% [vol/vol] NP-40, pH 7.5), resuspended in 40 µL of dH2O before lysis (95°C for 10 min), and stored at −20°C. PCR and deep sequencing of the enriched phage was done as previously described. Briefly, sequences were amplified to add Illumina barcodes (two rounds) and then pooled and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with 1 × 125 bp single-end reads (BioProject accession PRJNA685289). Enrichment and scaled differential selection were calculated as previously described, with analysis performed and plots generated using RStudio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9scode1">Figure 9—source code 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source datas 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata3">3</xref>). Two biological replicates were run, using the same antibody preps but distinct peptide library preps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>The QA255 longitudinal antibody deep sequencing datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and Phage-DMS sequencing data sets generated during this study are publicly available at BioProject SRA, accessions PRJNA639297 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA639297/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA639297/</ext-link>] and PRJNA685289 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA685289">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA685289</ext-link>].

Using NGS-based variable region repertoire sequencing, computational sequence reconstruction of antibody intermediates, and measurements of affinity and ADCC efficiency, the authors provide insights into how binding affinity and ADCC capability likely change during antibody clone diversification over time. Similar to studies that have investigated HIV-specific neutralising antibodies, this analysis provides clues to the evolutionary pathways of ADCC-functional antibody development. While antibody binding was correlated with ADCC activity, antibodies with similar affinity exhibited ADCC activity with different potencies. Mutations in complementary determining regions were needed for ADCC activity, with additional mutations in framework regions generally providing enhanced potency. The study was rigorously conducted, and addresses an important question with well-supported conclusions. Some issues that need to be addressed are identified below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The ordering of mutations is not fully resolved and thus some claims about ordering are not well supported. As an illustrative example, Figure 3A shows that several mutations were acquired between 0<sub>VH</sub>0<sub>VL</sub> and 1<sub>VH</sub>0<sub>VL</sub> that improved both ADCC and affinity. The ordering of these mutations and thus the ordering of improvements to ADCC and affinity are not resolved. Similarly, further mutations in 1<sub>VH</sub>1<sub>VL</sub> dramatically improved both ADCC and affinity. But again the ordering is not resolved. Similar arguments can be made for most of the antibody clones in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Thus, it seems misleading to claim that mutations first improve affinity, then later mutations improve ADCC, as implied in the Abstract. Several places elsewhere in the text also imply that the ordering of mutations has been resolved (e.g. &quot;Thereafter, six light chain mutations among CDRL1, CDRL3, and FWRL2 augmented gp41 binding and ADCC potency in 006-1<sub>VH</sub>1<sub>VL</sub>&quot;). Is there any evidence supporting this ordering? In the absence of evidence, it seems quite likely that these mutations happened in an interlaced fashion. This should be clarified in the text.</p><p>2) The fidelity of pairing between heavy and light chains is a key issue and should be clarified. In this study, the heavy and light chain sequences are reconstructed separately based on the mature antibody sequences. The experimental results hinge significantly on correct identification of corresponding heavy and light chains. The results would be more easily interpreted and perhaps better supported if the authors could estimate the fidelity of this strategy of computational pairing, possibly using a &quot;ground truth&quot; from paired heavy-light chain sequencing data sets. Otherwise, the authors should acknowledge this caveat, ideally in the main text.</p><p>3) Again, because the authors have reconstructed the mutation histories of heavy and light chains separately, we have no direct information about the co-occurrence of heavy and light chain mutations. Thus, the pairing of heavy and light chain sequences and the mutations they carry is arbitrary and may not represent actual combinations of mutations that were present together in a true intermediate. Ideally, the authors would validate or estimate the fidelity of the relative timing or co-occurrence of the mutations. This could perhaps be achieved using a paired heavy-light chain sequencing data set, as above. Otherwise, the authors should clarify in the text that the reconstructed intermediates (e.g. 1<sub>VH</sub> 1<sub>VL</sub>, 1<sub>VH</sub> 2<sub>VL</sub>, and 2<sub>VH</sub> 2<sub>VL</sub> in Figure 3B) are arbitrarily paired and may not represent the combinations of mutations in true intermediates.</p><p>4) A major concern is the lack of analysis of the native antibody Fc region over time given the central nature of this part of the antibody to ADCC functions. It may that there are no changes or no insights that can be drawn from this. However that would be an important finding in of itself and show the importance of the Fab analyses. Such an analysis would make the manuscript much stronger.</p><p>5) The first time point sampled is quite late at over 400 days. Comments about putative changes earlier would be useful.</p><p>6) There is interest in potential escape from ADCC antibodies as an argument about the pressure applied by these responses – with their evolution studies and knowledge of the epitopes the authors may be able to draw inferences on ADCC escape, and comments regarding this issue would be useful.</p><p>7) It would strengthen the argument to include assessment of the breadth of ADCC activity and how it fits into the evolutionary pathways.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63444.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The ordering of mutations is not fully resolved and thus some claims about ordering are not well supported.

Several places elsewhere in the text also imply that the ordering of mutations has been resolved (e.g. &quot;Thereafter, six light chain mutations among CDRL1, CDRL3, and FWRL2 augmented gp41 binding and ADCC potency in 006-1<sub>VH</sub>1<sub>VL</sub>&quot;). Is there any evidence supporting this ordering? In the absence of evidence, it seems quite likely that these mutations happened in an interlaced fashion. This should be clarified in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>To address points 1, 2, 3 and 5, that raise concerns about claims of developmental chronology and pairing choices amongst heavy and light chain intermediates, we’d like to offer clearer explanations of our approaches (here) as well as amendments to the text based (listed per point).</p><p>For longitudinal antibody sequencing, we prioritized depth rather than per-sequence accuracy because we already had “ground truth” pairing information from our six biologically-isolated ADCC antibodies and our focus was to infer likely ancestral sequences (nodes) between naïve and mature sequences within each clonal phylogeny. Our choices of sequencing and analysis methods were also driven by the characteristics of our unique, precious, and old samples: they derive from the pre-ART time period, which is important but means they have been in -80°C storage for ~20 years. With more abundant samples, we would have been eager to perform multiple sequencing approaches, such as both bulk unpaired and paired sequencing, but that was not the case here.</p><p>To achieve the highest depth possible with our longitudinal samples, we performed unpaired bulk sequencing with a well-established protocol rather than paired sequencing, which severely curtails depth and was not a well-practiced approach at the time this study began. As described and validated in a previous study of ours (Simonich et al., 2019), we designed our analysis to handle the challenges coming from sparsely-sampled noisy data. Specifically, we used Bayesian phylogenetics to infer ancestral sequences while allowing for uncertainty in the tree, rather than using ancestral sequence reconstructions from a single maximum-likelihood tree, which does not acknowledge tree uncertainty that can be quite significant. The chronology (ordering) of these ancestral sequences is resolved as clearly as the sequencing data and analyses allow; some pathways are resolved to 1-2 AA substitutions per ordered step, while others lack fine resolution and big leaps containing many AA substitutions occur between inferred ancestral sequences. The resolution of each lineage is viewable in Figure 4—figure supplements 1-3, with a main text example now included as Figure 4.</p><p>A strength of our approach is that we developed specific tools to enable confident reconstruction of the ordering of ancestral sequences (and, thus, the mutations occurring between them) even though our biological samples are quite old. In other words, we did not use off-the-shelf computational methods developed for other biological problems and adapt them for antibody sequence studies. This is exciting, indeed; if we had had more samples, we wouldn’t have had to work so hard to this end. All in all, with the bulk longitudinal sequencing data we acquired, we made as many confident conclusions about which mutations came before others as we could and those intermediate sequences are what we paired together into mAbs and tested.</p><p>Since this approach inferred the most likely development routes taken by individual antibody chains (heavy and light, independently), our inferred ancestral sequences are indeed unpaired, as emphasized by the reviewers’ points 1, 2, and 3. As outlined below, we added text to more explicitly explain that our experimental pairings do not reflect true biological intermediates. Indeed, we did not set out to define with certainty the paired intermediates that led to antibody ADCC function. Rather, our goal was to define biologically-informed minimal mutations (ideally in the form of a highly-likely computationally inferred ancestral sequence) that are needed for antibody lineages to gain ADCC function. Ultimately, we used the sequencing data and computational analysis to learn what is probable in terms of antibody development over time and, in the end, the findings from this approach are what drive this story – namely that both CDR and FWR mutations are needed to achieve potent ADCC and binding affinity is not exclusively responsible for ADCC potency. Moreover, this is the first study of stepwise ADCC antibody development ever, and we find it frankly remarkable that we found themes among the six lineages under investigation.</p><p>Changes to the text in response to points 1, 2, and 3:</p><p>– Clarified explanations of our methods which determined the chronology of highly probable ancestral sequences within single chains (heavy or light), though not each individual mutation per chain (Introduction, Results, Discussion and Materials and methods).</p><p>– Amended text that was inaccurately implying chronology between heavy and light chain mutations (Abstract, Results and Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The fidelity of pairing between heavy and light chains is a key issue and should be clarified. In this study, the heavy and light chain sequences are reconstructed separately based on the mature antibody sequences. The experimental results hinge significantly on correct identification of corresponding heavy and light chains. The results would be more easily interpreted and perhaps better supported if the authors could estimate the fidelity of this strategy of computational pairing, possibly using a &quot;ground truth&quot; from paired heavy-light chain sequencing data sets. Otherwise, the authors should acknowledge this caveat, ideally in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>These concerns are addressed above in response to points 1, 2, 3, and 5, including the list of changes to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Again, because the authors have reconstructed the mutation histories of heavy and light chains separately, we have no direct information about the co-occurrence of heavy and light chain mutations. Thus, the pairing of heavy and light chain sequences and the mutations they carry is arbitrary and may not represent actual combinations of mutations that were present together in a true intermediate. Ideally, the authors would validate or estimate the fidelity of the relative timing or co-occurrence of the mutations. This could perhaps be achieved using a paired heavy-light chain sequencing data set, as above. Otherwise, the authors should clarify in the text that the reconstructed intermediates (e.g. 1<sub>VH</sub> 1<sub>VL</sub>, 1<sub>VH</sub> 2<sub>VL</sub>, and 2<sub>VH</sub> 2<sub>VL</sub> in Figure 3B) are arbitrarily paired and may not represent the combinations of mutations in true intermediates.</p></disp-quote><p>These concerns are addressed above in response to points 1, 2, 3, and 5, including the list of changes to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A major concern is the lack of analysis of the native antibody Fc region over time given the central nature of this part of the antibody to ADCC functions. It may that there are no changes or no insights that can be drawn from this. However that would be an important finding in of itself and show the importance of the Fab analyses. Such an analysis would make the manuscript much stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on literature in this field, the Fc region of antibodies (actually the whole constant region, part of which is included in the Fab portion), remains stable in human antibodies. Specifically, the constant region in antibodies lacks mutations because the AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) enzyme responsible for somatic hypermutation does not gain access to the constant regions of Ig genes (Longerich et al., 2005; Peled et al., 2008) even though AID is required for class switch recombination, which takes place upstream of the 5’ ends of each constant heavy chain gene (Muramatsu et al., 2000; Stavnezer, Guikema and Schrader, 2008). With these notions in mind, we chose to perform full length variable region sequencing, which included enough sequence into the constant region to determine antibody isotype. This approach allowed us to determine the effect of AID-mediated somatic hypermutation on ADCC development in antibody lineages and, indeed, our data demonstrate that variable region mutations affect ADCC function even though ADCC activity is an Fc-mediated process.</p><p>However, we hear and completely agree with your point that ADCC activity is Fc-mediated and information about the Fc portions of these antibodies is of interest (sequence, binding angle, isotype and subclass). We have clarified that all these antibodies are IgG1 subclass in the Introduction. Despite the abovementioned dogma about constant regions remaining unmutated through antibody lineage evolution, we regret that we lack enough samples to fully sequence the constant regions of these lineages, because, if we found mutations in these regions, it would indeed be an important and extremely surprising and novel finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The first time point sampled is quite late at over 400 days. Comments about putative changes earlier would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>In the above response to points 1, 2, 3, and 5, we clarify the extent of our abilities to predict ordered changes based on clonal antibody sequences from various time points. In response to this comment, specifically, we have added time point information to the NGS hits (green and yellow stars) within pathways presented in Figure 4—figure supplements 1-3. Thus, readers may infer which inferred ancestral sequences were possibly present at/after distinct time points post-infection. Though we cannot confidently dissect the order of mutations that occurred earlier than day 462 post-infection any further than we already have, we have added text in the Discussion to note that three VH clonal families (006, 067, and 105) contain only D462 NGS sequences (Table 2) and thus all developmental inferences for these three families likely occurred prior to D462 (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There is interest in potential escape from ADCC antibodies as an argument about the pressure applied by these responses – with their evolution studies and knowledge of the epitopes the authors may be able to draw inferences on ADCC escape, and comments regarding this issue would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added data to the Results section on the (lack of) evidence for longitudinal mutational Env escape from lineages 067, 072, and 105, which all have linear peptide epitopes. The 067 and 072 epitopes are entirely stable between 21 dpi and 1729 dpi. For lineage 105, we finely mapped the epitope of both the inferred naïve mAb and the mature mAb, finding that the residue positions comprising the epitope remain stable, and that there is little evidence for strong selective pressure on these residues between 21 dpi and 1729 dpi. In adding the additional section on 105 lineage epitope mapping, we have also added Meghan Garrett as an author of the paper for her contributions to this work. Unfortunately, lineages 006, 016, and 157 target discontinuous epitopes, so we cannot comment on escape here without significant additional experimentation.</p><p>Changes to the text: Results, Discussion, Materials and methods, Figure 9, Figure 9—figure supplements 1-2, Figure 9—source data 1, Figure 9—source data 1-3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It would strengthen the argument to include assessment of the breadth of ADCC activity and how it fits into the evolutionary pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an assessment of developing ADCC breadth in the two gp120-targeted lineages as possible, given their mature breadth profiles (Williams et al., 2015). Specifically, we added data for RFADCC against two (lineage 105) or five (lineage 157) additional HIV strains, including the autologous transmitted founder virus (lineage 157 only). Changes to the text include the addition of Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and in the Results, Discussion and Materials and methods. The results indicate that full breadth developed after initial ADCC activity by both lineages. These data indeed strengthen the study; thank you for the suggestion. We maintain confidence in BL035 gp120 as the primary RFADCC coat protein for gp120-targeted antibodies in this study because we previously demonstrated that this strain is representative of RFADCC results among seven different gp120s of various clades (Milligan et al., 2015). This experimental choice is now clarified in the Discussion.</p><p>Unfortunately, RFADCC breadth studies are not possible for gp41-targeted lineages. There are very limited gp41 coat proteins available for experimental use and early attempts with MN gp41 yielded no RFADCC signal. As of yet, C.ZA.1197MB gp41 ectodomain is the only effective RFADCC coat protein available for gp41-targeted lineages.</p><p>References:</p><p>Longerich, S., Tanaka, A., Bozek, G., Nicolae, D., and Storb, U.
