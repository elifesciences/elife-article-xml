renal disease in children and young adults. Currently, no targeted therapy is available for this disease. <italic>INVS/NPHP2</italic> is one of the over 25 NPHP genes identified to date. In mouse, global knockout of <italic>Invs</italic> leads to renal fibrosis and cysts. However, the precise contribution of different cell types and the relationship between epithelial cysts and interstitial fibrosis remains undefined. Here, we generated and characterized cell-type-specific knockout mouse models of <italic>Invs</italic>, investigated the impact of removing cilia genetically on phenotype severity in <italic>Invs</italic> mutants and evaluated the impact of the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) on <italic>Invs</italic> mutants. Epithelial-specific knockout of <italic>Invs</italic> in <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> mutant mice resulted in renal cyst formation and severe stromal fibrosis, while <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Foxd1-Cre</italic> mice, where <italic>Invs</italic> is deleted in stromal cells, displayed no observable phenotypes up to the young adult stage, highlighting a significant role of epithelial-stromal crosstalk. Further, increased cell proliferation and myofibroblast activation occurred early during disease progression and preceded detectable cyst formation in the <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> kidney. Moreover, concomitant removal of cilia partially suppressed the phenotypes of the <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> mutant kidney, supporting a significant interaction of cilia and <italic>Invs</italic> function in vivo. Finally, VPA reduced cyst burden, decreased cell proliferation and ameliorated kidney function decline in <italic>Invs</italic> mutant mice. Our results reveal the critical role of renal epithelial cilia in NPHP and suggest the possibility of repurposing VPA for NPHP treatment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the most common causes of kidney failure in children and young adults is nephronophthisis. This genetic disease causes cysts and tissue scarring in the kidneys, leading to excessive urine production and extreme tiredness. Unfortunately, there is no targeted therapy available for this condition.</p><p>Scientists do not fully understand how genetic mutations lead to these symptoms. Previous research in mice showed that blocking the gene for a protein called INVS recreated signs similar to nephronophthisis. However, it is not clear how the different cell types in the kidneys are involved. Previous results suggest that cilia, the hair-like projections on the surface of cells, could be involved in developing cysts in nephronophthisis.</p><p>To understand how the disease is driven, Li, Xu et al. created a range of genetically modified mice with INVS missing in different cell types. When INVS was removed from cells that line the kidney tubules, the mice developed scarring and cysts. By contrast, there were no symptoms when connective tissue cells were lacking INVS. When Li, Xu et al. removed the cilia from the cells, it helped to reduce the negative impact of the loss of INVS. In addition, a drug called valproic acid reduced the cysts and tissue scarring, and slowed kidney decline in the mutant mice, suggesting the possibility of repurposing this drug for nephronophthisis treatment.</p><p>These results could help researchers to study other conditions that are influenced by the health of cilia. Future work on nephronophthisis will be needed to understand how INVS causes the disease and the mechanism for the benefits of valproic acid.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>nephronophthisis NPHP</kwd><kwd>nphp2/Inv</kwd><kwd>polycystic kidney disease PKD</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>histone deacetylase inhibitor HDACI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK113135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Zhaoxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD093608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Zhaoxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35HL145249</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brueckner</surname><given-names>Martina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and chemical genetic analysis pinpoint defective epithelial cells as the driver for NPHP like phenotypes in <italic>Invs</italic> mutants, demonstrate genetic interaction between <italic>Invs</italic> and <italic>Ift88</italic> and identify the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid as a suppressor for <italic>Invs</italic> mutant phenotypes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary cilia are widely distributed cell surface organelles that function as signaling hubs for almost all vertebrate cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lancaster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huangfu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haycraft et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corbit et al., 2008</xref>). Ciliary dysfunction is associated with an array of human disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies, that include obesity, mental retardation, retinal degeneration, and polycystic kidney disease (PKD), among many others (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hildebrandt et al., 2009</xref>). In renal epithelial cells, cilia protrude into the lumen of tubules, exposed to both mechanical and chemical signals carried by extracellular fluid flow. Disruption of cilia biogenesis almost inevitably leads to the formation of epithelium-lined fluid filled kidney cysts in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pazour et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoder et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Polycystin 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2), encoded by the autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) genes <italic>Pkd1</italic> and <italic>Pkd2</italic>, respectively, are targeted to cilia and this specific trafficking highly correlates with their in vivo function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr and Sternberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pazour et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshiba et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, although both cilia biogenesis and polycystin mutants develop cystic kidney, concomitant removal of cilia ameliorates cyst progression triggered by polycystin inactivation, demonstrating that intact cilia are required for cyst growth in ADPKD models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these results, it was postulated that polycystins function to inhibit a novel and uncharacterized cilia-dependent cyst activating (CDCA) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). This hypothesis implies the existence of a separate cyst-inhibiting (CDCI) pathway mediated by cilia, inactivation of which, together with CDCA, underlies the milder renal cyst formation in cilia biogenesis mutants compared to polycystin mutants. Renal fibrosis is also frequently observed in cystic kidney diseases; but is often considered as secondary to cyst formation and the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.</p><p>Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is a recessive renal cystic disease with cysts mostly confined in the corticomedullary junction region in the juvenile form of the disease, and more widely distributed across the kidney in the infantile form. Since multiple NPHP proteins are localized to cilia, basal bodies and/or show functional involvement in cilia biogenesis and/or signaling, NPHP is considered as a ciliopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fliegauf et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Otto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Otto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shiba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shiba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winkelbauer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Won et al., 2011</xref>). Compared with other types of renal ciliopathies, a prominent feature of NPHP is the severity of interstitial fibrosis. Genetically NPHP is highly heterogenous and at least 25 genes have been identified for the classic form of this disease (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Srivastava et al., 2017</xref>). However, mouse mutants of NPHP genes do not always show obvious renal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Won et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ronquillo et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Invs</italic>, the homolog of which is associated with both infantile and juvenile NPHP in human, was discovered as a novel gene inactivated in a mouse mutant with reversed internal organ asymmetry along the left-right body axis and was originally named as <italic>Inversin</italic> (<italic>Invs</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yokoyama et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mochizuki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgan et al., 1998</xref>). This whole-body knockout model additionally displays kidney cysts in both the medulla and cortex and renal fibrosis at the neonatal stage, resembling the renal phenotypes of infantile NPHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillips et al., 2004</xref>). However, the functional significance of <italic>Invs</italic> in different renal cell types is undefined. Moreover, the progression of renal fibrosis and its relationship with cyst formation remains to be characterized.</p><p>Here, to dissect tissue-specific function of <italic>Invs</italic> and the mechanism of interstitial fibrosis resulting from defective <italic>Invs</italic>, we generated two conditional mouse knockout models: (1) targeting <italic>Invs</italic> deletion in epithelial cells of the distal nephron (<italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> mice), and (2) deleting <italic>Invs</italic> in stromal cells (<italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Foxd1-Cre</italic> mice). We found that the infantile NPHP-like phenotypes in mutant kidneys arise from abnormal signaling specifically within and from renal epithelial cells. Further, we investigated the relationship between cyst formation and interstitial fibrosis. Our results suggest that the fibrotic response and abnormal increase of cell proliferation precede and therefore could initiate independently of cyst formation in this model. Mechanistically, we find that removal of cilia reduces the severity of <italic>Invs</italic> phenotypes, suggesting that, similar to polycystins, INVS inhibits a cilia-dependent cyst and fibrosis activating pathway. Finally, we show that the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) valproic acid (VPA) reduces cell proliferation, suppresses cyst expansion, and preserves kidney function in <italic>Invs</italic> mutant mice, suggesting VPA, and perhaps other HDACIs, as a potential candidate drug for treating NPHP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inactivation of <italic>Invs</italic> in renal epithelial cells of the distal nephron leads to progressive cystic kidney disease in mouse</title><p>To dissect tissue-specific function of <italic>Invs</italic>, we obtained embryonic stem cell clones generated by the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program (EUCOMM).

Currently directed therapy is lacking for NPHP. In previous studies, we found that HDACIs could partially suppress kidney cyst formation and renal fibrosis caused by inactivation of polycystins or the cilia biogenesis gene <italic>Arl13b</italic> in model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate whether HDACIs could be used to suppress the phenotypes of NPHP models, we treated <italic>Invs</italic> mutant mice with the pan HDACI valproic acid (VPA). Since the <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Cdh16-Cre</italic> model develops disease phenotypes very rapidly at the neonatal stage, posing technical challenges for drug administration, we generated <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Pkhd1-Cre</italic> mice. <italic>Pkhd1-Cre</italic> directs Cre expression in the collecting duct starting at E14.5, later than the onset of <italic>Cdh16-Cre</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Pkhd1-Cre</italic> mice, mutant kidneys were enlarged and cystic, with a significantly increased KBW ratio, cystic index and BUN level in both male and female mice and decreased body weight at P28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>). We analyzed body weight change of <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Pkhd1-Cre</italic> mice in more detail and compared it to <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> mice.

Mutant and control mice were intraperitoneal (IP) injected with VPA from P10 to P28. Results showed that this regiment of VPA treatment decreased the size of the mutant kidney, but had no impact on body weight, in comparison to vehicle-treated mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, B). In addition, the KBW ratio, cystic index of kidneys and the BUN level in mutant mice were reduced significantly by VPA treatment in comparison to vehicle-treated mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>). Moreover, VPA treatment led to a more moderate level of myofibroblast activation in the cortex region of the mutant kidney, as indicated by the level of SMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). By contrast, the kidney size, KBW ratio, cystic index and BUN level were not significantly affected by the same VPA treatment in control mice, suggesting that mutant mice are selectively sensitive to VPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B, D and E</xref>). However, the reduced body weight phenotype in mutant mice was not suppressed by VPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We cannot rule out the possibility that the side effects of VPA contributed to weight loss in treated mice. In addition, VPA may reduce body weight through inhibiting HDAC during the growth period: the HDACI Trichostatin A was shown to inhibit adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lv et al., 2021</xref>). We then investigated the impact of VPA treatment on cell proliferation. The number of PCNA positive cells in the collecting duct labeled by DBA and the interstitium outside of tubular regions outlined by anti-laminin signal was reduced significantly by VPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). This result was further validated by western blot using kidney lysates.

It is possible that defective <italic>Invs</italic> in epithelial and stromal cells caused epithelial cysts and interstitial fibrosis, respectively, in this model. Alternatively, abnormal epithelial-stromal cross-talks, resulting from defective tissue-specific <italic>Invs</italic> function, might have triggered the phenotypes observed in those previous studies.</p><p>In this study, we generated a floxed allele of <italic>Invs</italic> and used <italic>Cdh16-Cre</italic> to specifically inactivate <italic>Invs</italic> in epithelial cells in the distal nephron and <italic>Foxd1-Cre</italic> to drive <italic>Invs</italic> deletion in the renal stroma. Significantly, inactivation of <italic>Invs</italic> in the distal nephron leads to cyst formation throughout the cortex and medullar region by P21, accompanied by interstitial fibrosis, recapitulating the main phenotypes of infantile NPHP. By contrast, inactivation of <italic>Invs</italic> in the renal stroma caused no observable phenotypes in the kidney at least up to week 8, even though the onset of <italic>Foxd1-Cre</italic> expression in the developing metanephros occurs at the same time as that of <italic>Cdh16-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shao et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shao et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Humphreys et al., 2010</xref>). Combined, our results suggest that defective epithelial cells are the main driver of NPHP phenotypes in <italic>Invs</italic> mutants, highlighting the significance of epithelial-stromal cross-talks in the development and progression of interstitial fibrosis in this model. However, our result does not rule out functional significance of interstitial cells once a pro-cystic and fibrotic response is triggered in mutant epithelial cells.</p><p>PKD is frequently accompanied by renal fibrosis. In our previous study, we found that inactivation of the cilia biogenesis gene <italic>Arl13b</italic> in mouse leads to kidney cysts and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2016</xref>). However, since the onset of fibrosis and cyst formation overlap in the <italic>Arl13b<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> model, it is difficult to address whether interstitial fibrosis is solely secondary to epithelial cyst formation through, for example, mechano-stress exerted by expanding cysts. We therefore performed a detailed time course analysis of cyst formation and the fibrotic response in the <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> kidney. Our results showed that SMA and vimentin is already upregulated at P7, before detectable cyst formation, suggesting that the fibrotic response is triggered before cyst formation by signals from defective epithelial cells in this model. Mechano-stress on stromal cells impinged by cysts, and additional signals from cystic epithelial cells could amplify the progression of fibrosis at later stages. Interestingly, we detected an abnormal increase of proliferating cells at the pre-cystic stage in both the collecting duct and interstitium of the <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> kidney. An attractive model is that INVS functions to signal terminal differentiation of renal epithelial cells and <italic>Invs</italic> mutant cells fail to exit cell cycle to enter the quiescent stage. Currently, the precise nature of the signals from mutant cilia and epithelial cells remains unknown. Previous studies on the fibrotic response triggered by kidney injury detected upregulation of multiple developmental pathways, including TGFβ, WNT, notch, and SHH (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Humphreys, 2018</xref>), providing ample candidate pathways for future analysis.</p><p>Previous work suggests that INVS is specifically localized to a proximal segment of the cilium dubbed the Inversin compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shiba et al., 2009</xref>). Super-resolution imaging revealed that INVS is localized to a novel fibril-like structure in the Inversin compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, INVS interacts with multiple infantile NPHP proteins, including NPHP3, ANKS6 and NEK8; and is required for concentrating these proteins to the Inversin compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shiba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Czarnecki et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, INVS is dispensable for cilia biogenesis and is also found in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillips et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nürnberger et al., 2002</xref>), mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nürnberger et al., 2004</xref>) and stress granule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Estrada Mallarino et al., 2020</xref>). It therefore remains possible that INVS functions outside of the cilium. To test the relationship between cilia and INVS, we removed cilia genetically in the <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> model by generating <italic>Ift88<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> double knockout mouse. Significantly, <italic>Ift88</italic> inactivation partially reduced cell proliferation, suppressed the severity of renal cyst and fibrosis, and improved kidney function in <italic>Invs</italic> mutants. This result suggests that, similar to polycystins, INVS functions to inhibit a cilia-dependent pro-cystic and pro-fibrotic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Although cilia-dependent, the downstream pathway could potentially operate outside of cilia and receive parallel signals from both ciliary activity and INVS. Interestingly, genes encoding Inversin compartment components seem to form a unique functional module among the many NPHP genes. In human, mutations in Inversin compartment genes are associated with the infantile form of NPHP. In mouse, <italic>Anks6</italic>, <italic>Invs</italic>, <italic>Nphp3,</italic> and <italic>Nek8</italic> mutants develop kidney cysts, while mutants of several other NPHP genes show no obvious kidney phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Won et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ronquillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillips et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Czarnecki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Omran et al., 2001</xref>). Our results exclude the ciliary localization of PC2 as a potential mechanism for the INVS mediated pathway. However, whether this pathway is related or distinct from the polycystin-mediated CDCA pathway is currently unresolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Understanding the Inversin compartment could provide critical clues to the molecular mechanisms linking cilia, polycystins, cyst formation, and fibrosis.</p><p>NPHP is a major cause of ESRD in children and young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hildebrandt et al., 2009</xref>). Although the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists OPC31260 and Tolvaptan have been shown to partially suppress phenotypic progression in <italic>Nphp3<sup>pcy</sup></italic> mutant mice, no directed therapy has been established for this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aihara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gattone et al., 2003</xref>). Epithelial cysts and macrophages have become the focus in efforts to identify novel treatment for cystic diseases. The early and severe fibrotic response in <italic>Invs</italic> mutants suggest that stromal cells might also serve as an important target. In this study, we show that the pan HDACI VPA reduces cell proliferation, slows down the progression of disease phenotypes and partially preserves renal function in <italic>Invs</italic> mutant mice. Although the expression of many genes is changed by HDACIs, clinical treatment window for these compounds exists. For example, at least four new HDACIs have been approved by FDA to treat lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cappellacci et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, VPA is a drug that has been used to treat epilepsy with a known safety profile. Because of the broad target range of pan HDACIs, the precise target(s) contributing to the phenotypic improvement in <italic>Invs</italic> mutants remains unknown. It is attractive to speculate that a broad inhibition of multiple pathways, among them cell cycle control, by HDACIs might contribute to the effectiveness of this treatment. In the meantime, it will be informative to investigate whether the impact of HDACI treatment is HDAC type specific, thus narrowing down the list of potentially relevant targets. It is important to note that VPA could affect targets other than HDACs and testing newly approved HDACIs will provide useful insights.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Martin Pollak as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide an explanation for why the Nphp2 mutants in Figure 7, regardless of treatment status, have body weights that are significantly lower than the controls, with treated mutants even trending lower than their untreated mutant counterparts.</p><p>2) Please provide more details on how you controlled for possible genetic background effects as this factor could be an important confounder for the interpretation of your genetic interaction and valproic acid treatment studies.</p><p>3) Please acknowledge that the mechanism by which VPA is exerting its effects is not certain in this study as VPA has been reported to have numerous pharmacologic effects and targets and your study provides no direct evidence in support of any one specifically.</p><p>4) Please explain how your double knock-out studies &quot;support a significant role of cilia in Nphp2 function in vivo&quot; and can exclude that ciliary activity is operating in an Nphp2-independent, parallel fashion that modulates some common downstream pathways.</p><p>5) While most of the issues can either be addressed by more explanation or editing, the reviewers have asked for more data to support several of your conclusions. This could be in the form of additional data from timepoints later than 28 days to support your conclusions that Nphp2 loss in stromal cells is not important to cystic kidney disease or kidney fibrosis, since late cyst formation has been reported in mice with stromal inactivation of Pkd1. Alternatively, you can compare the effects of global activation of Nphp2 to epithelial cell-specific inactivation of Nphp2 to support your conclusion that stromal loss of Nphp2 has no effect on early, severe cystic disease.</p><p>6) Although this is not required, it would strengthen the paper to include more timepoints and data supporting their conclusion that fibrosis precedes cyst development in the Nphp2 epithelial cell ko model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General comment: This is a solid study but its results and impact are quite modest. The study's impact would be greatly strengthened if it provided some insight into the nature of the mutant epithelial cell-&quot;normal&quot; stomal cell signaling, how impaired ciliogenesis ameliorates disease (beyond the reduction in cellular proliferation and fibrosis), or a more mechanistic understanding of the effects of VPA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few comments that might be addressed or discussed further to improve the interpretations of underlying mechanisms of Nphp2 function in renal homeostasis.</p><p>First, as the authors allude to the nature of the NPHP-regulated cilia-dependent pathway is related or distinct from the polycystin-mediated CDCA pathway is currently unresolved. The lack of PC2 trafficking in Nphp2 mutants suggests that the CDCA pathway might not at all be activated in the Nphp2 mutants. Rather NPHP2 could be functioning independently in regulating cystogenesis from PKD-regulated CDCA. Testing double mutants of Nphp2 with Pkd1/2 might resolve this issue.</p><p>Second, an independent interpretation of Nphp2 lack-induced cystogenesis being reduced partially from ciliary disruption is that the lack of Nphp2 or cilia regulates independent pathways with relation to fibrosis and epithelial regulation. Late assessment of phenotypes such as epithelial and stromal proliferation by the authors shows partial restorative effects. In fact, the authors show partial inhibition of stromal proliferation in Nphp2 loss from epithelial lack of cilia which is very interesting. As an early indicator of Nphp2 inactivation is stromal fibrosis and proliferation, does parallel cilia disruption prevent such early phenotypes? Does cilia disruption itself cause fibrosis at earlier stages? Such early assessment of phenotypes might be more insightful in the cilia single mutants and double mutants.</p><p>Third, as NPHP2 interacts with multiple infantile NPHP proteins, including NPHP3, ANKS6, and NEK8 in the inversin compartment, one way of ruling out if Nphp2 function is in cilia, would be to compare/discuss phenotypes with other mutants that disrupt these interacting genes. As NPHP2 is localized to a novel fibril-like structure in the inversin compartment in cilia, the elephant in the room is the lack of our current understanding of the inversin compartment's role in the ciliary composition. Such understanding could provide important mechanistic clues and might also provide insights into the role of inversin compartment in regulating L-R asymmetry.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Using a newly established floxed model of Nphp2, the authors show convincing data that Nphp2 loss in the kidney epithelium is critical to kidney cyst formation and fibrosis. In addition, the authors show compelling data that cilia loss in the setting of epithelial Nphp2 loss reduces kidney cyst severity. This cilia-dependent idea of PKD has been previously published in the setting of ADPKD, but remained unexplored for NPHP. No additional, or novel mechanistic insight is shown in the manuscript. The authors also suggest that Nphp2 loss in stromal cells is not important to cystic kidney disease or kidney fibrosis, but that data is underdeveloped. Lastly, the authors perform a preclinical trial using a broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor, in their model, which shows efficacy in slowing disease. This experiment seems disconnected from the rest of the paper.</p><p>Ksp-cre model characterization: (1) It would be important to compare the Ksp-cre results to a global knockout of Nphp2 (CAGGc-cre) in terms of PKD severity. The authors stress the possible importance of epithelial-stromal communication. To better define this a comparison of epithelial versus global knock-out is needed. (2) It would be helpful to have a Kaplan-Meyer curve of the model. (3) Could the authors comment on what percentage of DBA or THP-positive tubules are cystic in the model? (4) The data supporting that fibrosis precedes cysts is underdeveloped. The SMA staining at P7 seems more intense than at P14 which is surprising (P14 and later is not quantified – cystic versus non-cystic regions), and vimentin is not analyzed at the later stages. (5) The data that epithelial Nphp2 loss results in higher proliferation in the interstitium are interesting; however, the authors provide no experiments/speculations on why that may be. Further, these analyses are done only at P7, and it is unclear how it pertains to stages when cysts develop/are present. And, it is unclear why for all other figures examining proliferation, the authors performed PCNA staining and western blotting of essential proteins, but not for this one.</p><p>Foxd1-cre model characterization: (1) The characterization of this model is underdeveloped. Animals need to be aged much longer to assure no phenotype is observed. (2) The experiments performed in Figure 4I are not intuitive. Based on the mouse model shown in Figure 1A it is unclear where eGFP expression should come from. (3) While this is intrinsically an issue with the Foxd1-cre model, the observation that was made that only 60% of all stromal cells lost Nphp2 (Figure 4J) is concerning to make such a strong conclusion that NPHP2 in the stromal compartment is not important to the NPHP phenotype (fibrosis or cysts).</p><p>NPHP2 and Cilia: (1) While the finding that the CDCA may be critical to NPHP, as well as ADPKD, is novel, the provided data is only descriptive. It would improve the paper drastically if the authors could provide data suggesting whether NPHP2 functions in the same pathway as PC1 or PC2 or a different one. (2) For their cell analyses, the authors should show successful loss of NPHP2 in their CRISPR clones as well as also analyze PC1. (3) Fibrosis was not analyzed.</p><p>HDAC preclinical trial: This data is not connected to anything else within the manuscript. It utilized a different cre than for all the other experiments and is not mechanistically linked to the story of whether NPHP2 function in epithelial or stromal cells is important to pathogenesis. Unless the authors can link the stories better or highlight why the HDAC function is important to the observations, this reviewer would suggest removing Figure 7.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82395.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide an explanation for why the Nphp2 mutants in Figure 7, regardless of treatment status, have body weights that are significantly lower than the controls, with treated mutants even trending lower than their untreated mutant counterparts.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined the time course of body weight change more carefully and added Figure 7—figure supplement 1 to present the results. Although <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Pkhd1-Cre</italic> mice displayed reduced body weight at P28 in comparison to controls, this reduction was more moderate than that of <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> mice (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A). Notably, the trend of body weight difference started at around P21 in both <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Pkhd1-Cre</italic> and <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> mice, coinciding with weaning (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). It is possible that mutants with compromised kidney function were less capable to thrive and gain weight at around this transition time. In terms of VPA treatment, body weight trended down in both wild type and mutant mice subjected to the treatment, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (Figure 7B). We cannot rule out the possibility that the side effects of VPA contributed to weight loss in treated mice. In addition, VPA may reduce body weight through inhibiting HDAC: the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A was shown to inhibit adipogenesis (PMID: 34232916) and 4-hexylresorcinol, another HDAC inhibitor, reduced body weight in treated rats (PMID: 34445640). To include the additional data and references, we added the following in the Results section:</p><p>&quot;We analyzed body weight change of <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Pkhd1-Cre</italic> mice in more detail and compared it to <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> mice.

This could be in the form of additional data from timepoints later than 28 days to support your conclusions that Nphp2 loss in stromal cells is not important to cystic kidney disease or kidney fibrosis, since late cyst formation has been reported in mice with stromal inactivation of Pkd1. Alternatively, you can compare the effects of global activation of Nphp2 to epithelial cell-specific inactivation of Nphp2 to support your conclusion that stromal loss of Nphp2 has no effect on early, severe cystic disease.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding comparing epithelial-specific and global knockout models, for an interpretable comparison, it is essential that the stage and knockout efficiency in epithelial cells are matched between the two models. However, <italic>Cdh16-Cre</italic> is expressed in the distal nephron specifically, sparing epithelial cells in other segments, while epithelial cells in all segments would be affected by <italic>Cagg-Cre</italic>. In addition, global knockout of <italic>Invs</italic> leads to peri-natal lethality. Inducible <italic>Cagg-Cre</italic> could potentially be used to bypass earlier functional requirements. But matching stage and knockout efficiency in renal epithelial cells between <italic>Cdh16-Cre</italic> and inducible <italic>CaggCre</italic> mediated knockout remains challenging. These factors make a direct comparison problematic. Finally, our results revealed the role of defective epithelial cells in triggering the phenotypes but did not rule out a role of interstitial cells once abnormal signaling is initiated in epithelial cells. To clarify this point, we added &quot;However, our result does not rule out functional significance of interstitial cells once a pro-cystic and fibrotic response is triggered in mutant epithelial cells.&quot; to the Discussion section.</p><p>In addition, we followed the first suggested approach and expanded our analysis to 8-week-old mice. We now show that <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Foxd1-Cre</italic> mice displayed normal kidney weight, KBW ratio, kidney function and histology at P56. By comparison, <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16-Cre</italic> kidneys were already cystic at P14. The new P56 results are presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and described in the Results section.

At P14, <italic>Invs<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cdh16Cre</italic> kidneys were already cystic. At P7, the increase of SMA and vimentin was modest. We therefore analyzed kidneys at P9, a timepoint between P7 and P14, in more detail. Results showed normal KBW ratio and normal kidney morphology at P9. However, vimentin signal was increased, in addition to the increase of SMA signal detected previously. A caveat of this result is that mild tubule dilation could be detected at P9. We added the new results in Figure 2 and the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have a few comments that might be addressed or discussed further to improve the interpretations of underlying mechanisms of Nphp2 function in renal homeostasis.</p><p>First, as the authors allude to the nature of the NPHP-regulated cilia-dependent pathway is related or distinct from the polycystin-mediated CDCA pathway is currently unresolved. The lack of PC2 trafficking in Nphp2 mutants suggests that the CDCA pathway might not at all be activated in the Nphp2 mutants. Rather NPHP2 could be functioning independently in regulating cystogenesis from PKD-regulated CDCA. Testing double mutants of Nphp2 with Pkd1/2 might resolve this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that testing double mutants of <italic>Invs</italic> and <italic>Pkd1/2</italic> will provide important insight. Although this is a research direction we are interested in pursuing, we feel it ultimately is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, an independent interpretation of Nphp2 lack-induced cystogenesis being reduced partially from ciliary disruption is that the lack of Nphp2 or cilia regulates independent pathways with relation to fibrosis and epithelial regulation. Late assessment of phenotypes such as epithelial and stromal proliferation by the authors shows partial restorative effects. In fact, the authors show partial inhibition of stromal proliferation in Nphp2 loss from epithelial lack of cilia which is very interesting. As an early indicator of Nphp2 inactivation is stromal fibrosis and proliferation, does parallel cilia disruption prevent such early phenotypes? Does cilia disruption itself cause fibrosis at earlier stages? Such early assessment of phenotypes might be more insightful in the cilia single mutants and double mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that analyzing double mutants at earlier timepoints potentially could lead to interesting findings. Technically, cilia abrogation due to the loss of IFT genes is a slow process (PMID: 23892607). Our current system, in which knockout of <italic>Invs</italic> and <italic>Ift88</italic> was driven by the same <italic>Cdh16-Cre</italic>, was not particularly suitable for this analysis as cilia would persist at earlier timepoints. In the revision, we analyzed markers of myofibroblast activation and fibrosis via immunostaining and Western Blot at P21 and showed a reduction of these markers in double mutants. In addition, our results showed that at P21, the increase of SMA, vimentin and collagen I was more moderate in <italic>Ift88</italic> mutants than in <italic>Invs</italic> mutants. The new results were added to Figure 5 and described in Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, as NPHP2 interacts with multiple infantile NPHP proteins, including NPHP3, ANKS6, and NEK8 in the inversin compartment, one way of ruling out if Nphp2 function is in cilia, would be to compare/discuss phenotypes with other mutants that disrupt these interacting genes. As NPHP2 is localized to a novel fibril-like structure in the inversin compartment in cilia, the elephant in the room is the lack of our current understanding of the inversin compartment's role in the ciliary composition. Such understanding could provide important mechanistic clues and might also provide insights into the role of inversin compartment in regulating L-R asymmetry.</p></disp-quote><p>Following reviewer suggestion, we added &quot;Interestingly, genes encoding Inversin compartment components seem to form a unique functional module among the many NPHP genes. In human, mutations in Inversin compartment genes are associated with the infantile form of NPHP. In mouse, <italic>Anks6</italic>, <italic>Invs</italic>, <italic>Nphp3</italic> and <italic>Nek8</italic> mutants developed kidney cysts, while mutants of several other NPHP genes show no obvious kidney phenotypes&quot; to Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Using a newly established floxed model of Nphp2, the authors show convincing data that Nphp2 loss in the kidney epithelium is critical to kidney cyst formation and fibrosis. In addition, the authors show compelling data that cilia loss in the setting of epithelial Nphp2 loss reduces kidney cyst severity. This cilia-dependent idea of PKD has been previously published in the setting of ADPKD, but remained unexplored for NPHP. No additional, or novel mechanistic insight is shown in the manuscript. The authors also suggest that Nphp2 loss in stromal cells is not important to cystic kidney disease or kidney fibrosis, but that data is underdeveloped. Lastly, the authors perform a preclinical trial using a broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor, in their model, which shows efficacy in slowing disease. This experiment seems disconnected from the rest of the paper.</p><p>Ksp-cre model characterization: (1) It would be important to compare the Ksp-cre results to a global knockout of Nphp2 (CAGGc-cre) in terms of PKD severity. The authors stress the possible importance of epithelial-stromal communication. To better define this a comparison of epithelial versus global knock-out is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, it is essential for an interpretable comparison but technically challenging to match knockout timing and efficiency in epithelial cells between a global knockout model and a Cdh16-Cre model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would be helpful to have a Kaplan-Meyer curve of the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a Kaplan-Meyer curve could provide useful information.

Further, these analyses are done only at P7, and it is unclear how it pertains to stages when cysts develop/are present. And, it is unclear why for all other figures examining proliferation, the authors performed PCNA staining and western blotting of essential proteins, but not for this one.</p></disp-quote><p>P7 is a precystic stage and we used it to detect defects that are not secondary to cyst formation. Increased proliferation at an earlier stage could potentially contribute to overt cyst at a later stage and increased proliferation was detected at P21, a cystic stage (Figure 6A, B). Regarding Western Blotting, we developed these assays for the analysis of double mutants and VPA treatment, after the completion of the characterization of P7 single mutants. Moreover, we feel the difference shown by immunostaining and quantification of PCNA and phosphohistone H3 positive cells was already convincing (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Foxd1-cre model characterization: (1) The characterization of this model is underdeveloped.
