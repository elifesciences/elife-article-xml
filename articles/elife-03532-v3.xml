uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>. Their translocation domain is a large β-barrel occluded by a plug domain, which is displaced to allow the translocation of pilus subunits across the membrane. Previous studies suggested that this gating mechanism is controlled by a β-hairpin and an α-helix. To investigate the role of these elements in allosteric signal communication, we developed a method combining evolutionary and molecular dynamics studies of the native translocation domain and mutants lacking the β-hairpin and/or the α-helix. Analysis of a hybrid residue interaction network suggests distinct regions (residue ‘communities’) within the translocation domain (especially around β12–β14) linking these elements, thereby modulating PapC gating. Antibiotic sensitivity and electrophysiology experiments on a set of alanine-substitution mutants confirmed functional roles for four of these communities. This study illuminates the gating mechanism of PapC ushers and its importance in maintaining outer-membrane permeability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03532.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03532.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03532.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a bacterium that commonly lives in the intestines of mammals, including humans, where it is usually harmless and can even be beneficial to its host.

One of these organelles, known as pili (or fimbriae), forms a class of virulence factors involved in host cell adhesion and recognition, invasion, cell mobility, and biofilm formation. P pili from uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are specifically required for the colonization of the human kidney epithelium, a critical event in the kidney infection process (pyelonephritis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roberts et al., 1994</xref>). P pili are assembled on the bacterial outer membrane (OM) via the chaperone/usher (CU) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thanassi et al., 1998</xref>), which is often used as a model system to elucidate the mechanism of pilus biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Waksman and Hultgren, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The biogenesis of pili via the CU pathway is a highly ordered process that comprises sequential steps. The chaperone protein (PapD) brings the pilins to the bacterial OM where they are assembled into a pilus at a transmembrane pore protein known as the usher (PapC). The usher (∼800 residues) is composed of five domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): a periplasmic N-terminal domain (NTD), an OM central translocation domain (TD) that comprises a translocation pore domain (TP), interrupted by a conserved Ig-like plug domain (PD), and two domains at the periplasmic C-terminal end (CTD1 and CTD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thanassi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capitani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geibel et al., 2013</xref>). The structure of the apo TD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) consists of a 24-stranded kidney-shaped β-barrel where the PD is inserted into the loop connecting two β-strands (β6–β7), occluding the luminal volume of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Remaut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). In the activated form of another archetypal member of the usher family, FimD, the PD is located outside the pore lumen in the periplasm, next to the NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geibel et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the PD, there are two secondary structure elements that uniquely characterize the large β-barrel structures of the usher TD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The first element is a <italic>β-hairpin</italic> that creates a large gap in the side of the β-barrel, a feature unprecedented in previously known OM β-barrel structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Remaut et al., 2008</xref>). This element (located between strands β5 and β6 of the barrel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) folds into the barrel lumen and constrains the PD laterally inside the barrel pore. Mutants lacking the β-hairpin show an increased pore permeability suggesting that the β-hairpin has a role in maintaining the PD in a closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volkan et al., 2013</xref>). The second element is an <italic>α-helix</italic> (located on the loop between β13 and β14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which caps the β-hairpin from the extracellular side. Mutants lacking the α-helix, or in which the interface between the helix and the PD is disrupted, present a remarkable increase in pore permeability, comparable with that of the mutant lacking the PD, suggesting a role for the helix in maintaining the PD in a closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mapingire et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volkan et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03532.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PapC usher organization and detail of its translocation domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram of the domain organization of PapC usher.

It has been observed in other OMP β-barrels that such secondary structure elements (e.g., an α-helix that protrudes inside the barrel or packs against the transmembrane strands) can use complex allosteric mechanisms to mediate their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Naveed et al., 2009</xref>). These are often combinations of large conformational changes (‘global motions’) dictated by the overall architecture (including movement of secondary structure elements) and smaller changes (‘local motions’, such as the motion of recognition loops and side-chain fluctuations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Bahar, 2012</xref>). Additionally, it has been shown that important residues in terms of evolution (highly-coevolved or conserved) could have a pivotal role in mediating such allosteric communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study, to understand the allosteric mechanism leading to the plug displacement in PapC and the involvement of the α-helix and β-hairpin, we used a hybrid computational approach and verified our results experimentally. By combining sequence conservation analysis, mutual information-based coevolution analysis, and all-atom molecular dynamics (AA-MD), we modelled the interaction network within the native PapC TD as well as within different mutants lacking the α-helix, β-hairpin, and both. This unique computational approach allowed us to identify residues that are likely to be involved in the transmission of the allosteric signal between the α-helix, β-hairpin elements and the plug. These residues were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, functional studies, and planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology. The results confirmed the involvement of 4 of the 5 distinct communities of residues in modulating the usher's channel activity and gating, suggesting that they all participate in the allosteric mechanism controlling plug displacement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate if the β-hairpin or α-helix (or both) of the TD (residues 146–637 in the full length PapC) have a role in the allosteric communication leading to the displacement of the PD (residues 264–324), we performed four independent MD simulations, corresponding to the PapC TD model (sim1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and three mutants embedded in a mixed lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>): (i) where the region corresponding to the hairpin between β5 and β6 (residues 233–240) is deleted (sim2); (ii) where the α-helix between β13 and β14 (residues 447–460) is removed; and where both the regions were removed (sim4).

The OM of Gram-negative bacteria has low permeability to detergents such as SDS and to antibiotics such as erythromycin and vancomycin, providing resistance to these molecules. In its resting state, the usher TP is gated closed by the PD, preserving integrity of the OM. Mutations that disrupt channel gating by the PD will result in the opening of the large TD channel, leading to increased sensitivity of the bacteria to antibiotics. Bacteria expressing five of the PapC substitution mutants (T331A, R237A, Y260A, F438A, and V327A) exhibited increased sensitivity to one or more of the tested molecules (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>).

However, the hemagglutination assay and antibiotic sensitivity assay are screening tools, and as such, they lack in sensitivity to pick up smaller changes in the ability to assemble pili or channel activity of the usher.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Electrophysiological analysis of selected mutants</title><p>In total, 10 mutated PapC TDs were found to be affected either in their ability to trigger hemagglutination or in their permeability to SDS or antibiotics (T331A, D249A in C1; R237A, R442A, S444A in C2; Y260A, K427A, T437A, F438A in C3; and V327A in C4). We attempted to purify those mutants in view of examining their channel activity using planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology (which is a more sensitive assay). Unfortunately, only seven of these 10 mutants yielded protein stable enough (as wild-type) in detergent solutions to carry out the planned experiments (T331A in C1; R237A, S444A in C2; K427A, T437A, F438A in C3; and V327A in C4). During the OM extraction procedure, D249A, R442A, and Y260A were not stable enough due to the loss of the membrane bilayer environment and inability to maintain their native conformation in detergents. Insertion of PapC purified proteins (see ‘Materials and methods’) was promoted in planar lipid bilayers by clamping the membrane potential to −90 mV. As soon as channel activity was observed, the potential was briefly returned to zero and the chamber stirring stopped to minimize further insertions. 10-min long recordings of channel activity at + and −90 mV, and at + and −50 mV were performed.</p><p>The typical electrophysiological signature of the wild-type PapC usher is characterized by prolonged dwell times at a low current level, representing the closed state of the usher, and brief transitions of various current amplitudes. These transitions represent short-lived openings of various conductance, ranging from 50 to 600 pS (‘transient-mixed’ behaviour, TM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Although it is not possible to know exactly how many individual pores were inserted into the bilayer, the observed fluctuations of various sizes are taken to represent various conformational states of a single pore. As documented previously, the openings of the ‘transient-mixed’ behaviour appear rather small and may be due to the jiggling of the plug within the TP and/or the thermally induced mobility of various domains of the protein, such as the NTD and CTDs or loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mapingire et al., 2009</xref>). Occasionally, and more so at higher membrane potential, very large and sustained openings (‘large-open’ behaviour, LO) are observed in wild-type PapC usher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These openings have a conductance of ∼3–4 nS, which is similar to the monomeric conductance of the mutant lacking the PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mapingire et al., 2009</xref>) and are interpreted as representing a full displacement of the PD from a single monomer. Prolonged opening of intermediate conductance (0.5–1 nS) can also be observed and may represent partial PD displacement.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03532.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Kinetic signatures of channel activity in wildtype and mutant PapC ushers and frequency of PD displacement.</title><p>Fifty-second segments of recordings obtained in planar lipid bilayers were selected to illustrate the behaviour of the different proteins.

The frequency of observing these large openings in wild-type PapC usher is ∼20% at ±50 mV, but increases to ∼60% at ±90 mV. The application of a larger transmembrane voltage is likely to disrupt the interactions between key residues involved in keeping the PD in place, leading to a more frequent spontaneous displacement of the latter.</p><p>3 of the 7 analysed mutants, V327A, T331A, and F438A, showed an increased propensity at displaying large openings, relative to the wild-type PapC usher, as illustrated for V327A and T331A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). This was particularly true at ±90 mV where the percent of sweeps with large openings reaches values of 75–90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The T331A mutant was consistently more prone to open than WT and any other mutants, which led to the occasional simultaneous opening of several monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Two of the seven mutants R237A and T437A still opened occasionally to the 3 nS level, but the frequency of sweeps with such events was slightly diminished relative to the wild-type PapC usher at ±90 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) suggesting that these mutants are likely to be insignificantly different from the wild-type PapC usher.</p><p>The K427A and S444A mutants showed a decreased frequency (or complete absence) of large openings. The K427A mutant almost never showed ‘large-open’ behaviour at ±50 and ±90 mV, indicating an extremely closed channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). The S444A mutant was even less prone to open, with 0% occurrence of PD displacement at ±50 mV in the 11 bilayers that we investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, increased activity with fast flickers and occasional more prolonged openings could be seen for both mutants if the membrane potential was switched to voltages in the ±100–150 mV range, indicating that the channels are present in the bilayer, but require higher voltages for activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PapC usher catalyses the translocation across the outer membrane of P pili, and its gating mechanism is important for bacterial homeostasis and for catalysis of pilus assembly. The TD of PapC is formed by the largest β-barrel pore known to be formed by a single chain. The PD occludes the pore in an inactive state and maintains the permeability of the channel. As previously documented, the native PapC channel is highly dynamic and is characterized by spontaneous short-lived openings of various conductance levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mapingire et al., 2009</xref>). Two distinct structural elements, the β-hairpin and the α-helix, play an important role in maintaining the PD in a closed conformation. In the absence of both elements the usher is defective for pilus biogenesis. Our analysis of the non-covalent interaction RIN in the native PapC TD shows that the interactions found between the TP and the PD are mostly weak, possibly to allow an easy release of the PD. This finding supports the idea that the highly dynamic behaviour of the native PapC channel is originated from the ‘jiggling’ of the PD within the TP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mapingire et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, we find that the interactions between the TP and the P-linkers, between the TP and the β-hairpin, and between the TP and the α-helix region are mainly stable, supporting their role in maintaining the PD in a closed conformation.</p><p>Analysis of the mutation-induced perturbation of the non-covalent interaction RIN of the native PapC TD in the absence of the β-hairpin, α-helix, or both, shows that the interactions between nodes that are not part of the deleted secondary structure elements are consistently weakened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This feature suggests that the two elements are not independent and they are part of a complex allosteric process regulating the PD gating mechanism. It has been proposed that only a few residues play essential roles during allosteric processes and that perturbing the interactions between these residues can facilitate the population shift of the conformational ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Sol et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, it has been shown that residues with a pivotal role in mediating such allosteric communications are also important in terms of evolution (both highly coevolved residues and conserved residues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferguson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). Remarkably, we show here that PapC is characterised by an uneven distribution of the evolutionary important residues, clustered in the P-linkers, the PD, and the barrel wall capped by the α-helix, in close proximity to the β-hairpin. Another interesting finding is the presence of the ‘β13 conserved patch’ that reaches the full height of the pore from the α-helix region to the loop located between β12 and β13 strands (β12–β13_loop), which has been recently identified as important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farabella, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volkan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To detect the allosteric network, we implement a new method that integrates dynamic and evolutionary information in a hybrid RIN and then apply network analysis. This approach allows us to explore a large part of the protein, resulting in the detection of only 14% of all residues in the TD as potential candidates. It has been shown that detecting ‘residue communities’ in protein structure networks leads to the identification of key residues that are often part of a signal transduction pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bode et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Sol et al., 2007</xref>). The interconnection within and between the communities is pivotal for the flow of allosteric signalling. Residues in the same community are densely interconnected and have multiple routes to communicate with one another. However, the interconnections between communities involve only a few edges, which form the bottleneck for the flow of the signal in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bode et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Sol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sethi et al., 2009</xref>). Here, all the identified communities (C1–C5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) comprise residues from multiple elements (e.g., the β-hairpin, P-linker1, P-linker2, and distinct part of the TP) of PapC TD, except C5 that is composed only by PD residues. Mutation of key residues linking elements within each of the communities C1–C4 shows an altered antibiotic sensitivity phenotype, confirming a role of these communities in the pore-gating mechanism. Additionally, communities C1–C3 are required for proper usher function (as estimated by the hemagglutination assay), suggesting dependency of the pore gating function and pilus assembly (based on some of the mutations). For example, mutations in β12–β13_loop:K427 in C3 and β13:S444 in C2, which lead to a drastic decrease in the frequency of plug displacement (stabilizing the closed state, based on channel activity analysis), also show defective pilus assembly (possibly due to their deficiency in relocating the plug in a functional conformation).</p><p>Additionally, our study identifies two residues with opposite effects on plug displacement in the same community: C3: β12–β13_loop:K427, which is located on β12–β13_loop, and β13:F438, which is located at the periplasmic end of the β13 conserved patch (linking β12–β13_loop with the α-helix region). This observation indicates that β12–β13_loop has a pivotal role in the regulation of plug displacement by acting as a ‘latch’, as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farabella, 2013</xref>) and was also shown by mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volkan et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, at the extracellular end of the β13 conserved patch there is another mutation (β13:S444) leading to a channel more reluctant to open, suggesting a regulatory role for the β13 conserved patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) in modulating the latch.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03532.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Residues involved in the allosteric signalling to control PapC gating.</title><p>A schematic model summarizing the location of the detected hot spots involved in the gating mechanism.

For example, the functionally important latch (β12–β13_loop) is shown to be in a different conformation in the open state (based on FimD:FimC:FimH structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phan et al., 2011</xref>]) as well as other residues in C3 and C4 communities. As a result, some residues that are identified by our method, such as V327, could in principle be selected also by visual inspection for further experimental investigation. V327 (located on P-linker2 in C4 at interface with P-linker1 and the barrel wall) is found to have a different interaction pattern in the open state of the usher and is also shown to promote plug displacement. However, more importantly, the method is able to predict residues in regions that would not attract our attention at all but may contain important information in respect to the allosteric pathway. (This aspect can become even more significant in the absence of an alternative conformation.) For example, we predict two such residues to be functionally important—T331 and S444. T331 is located on P-linker2 at the interface between P-linker2 and the barrel wall, which stays intact in the open conformation of the usher; S444 is located on β13 at the base of the α-helix, that is, on the barrel itself, and it lacks any direct contact with the plug domain. Surprisingly, and in support to our prediction, both residues are found to have an effect on plug displacement. Thus, the main strength of our method is that the knowledge of the structure of the protein (in one conformation only) and enough sequence information (to extract evolutionary information) are sufficient for the detection of functionally important residues that are pivotal for transferring the regulatory information within the protein.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we provide a first deep insight into the allosteric regulation of the gating mechanism of the usher family. Using PapC TD as model system, we developed an integrative approach combining computational modelling, sequence conservation analysis, mutual information-based coevolution analysis and information from AA-MD simulations, to study the potential involvement of particular secondary structure elements (the α-helix and β-hairpin) in the allosteric communication. The construction of a hybrid interaction network and the use of network analysis allowed us to identify communities of residues within the TD that potentially mediate this process. Antibiotic sensitivity and electrophysiology experiments on a set of alanine-substitution mutants confirmed that residues located in the P-linkers, the β-hairpin, and β13 conserved patch (part of four communities) alter channel gating and that residues located in P-linker2, β12–β13_loop, and β13 conserved patch (both periplasmic end and extracellular end) are sensitive to plug displacement. Therefore, we suggest that the β13 conserved patch acts as a regulator of β12–β13_loop (the latch), mediating channel opening. Furthermore, our study shows how the integration of different computational approaches based on evolution, structure, and dynamics of proteins, into a hybrid network can unveil communication pathways within proteins. Such an integrative approach can guide the experimental investigation by pinpointing key candidates involved in the transmission of the allosteric signal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Systems modelling</title><p>We built four model systems based on the X-ray structure of the TD (residues 1–492) of PapC at 3.2 Å resolution (PDB ID: 2vqi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Remaut et al., 2008</xref>]).

Planar bilayers were made from a preparation of L-α-phosphatidylcholine Type II-S from Sigma (also known as asolectin) according to the Montal and Mueller technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montal and Mueller, 1972</xref>) following a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mapingire et al., 2013</xref>). Protein aliquots were diluted 1:1 in buffer T (1 M KCl, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.2) containing either 1 or 2% <italic>N</italic>-Octyl-oligo-oxyethylene (octyl-POE, Axxora). Eight micrograms of protein from the diluted sample was added to the <italic>cis</italic> side of a planar lipid bilayer chamber containing ∼1.5 ml of buffer T. Gentle stirring was applied to promote spontaneous insertions of the protein into the bilayer. Channel activity was monitored by measuring current under voltage clamp conditions using an Axopatch 1D amplifier with a CV4B headstage or an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). The current was digitized (ITC-18; Instrutech) and stored on a PC computer using the Acquire software (Bruxton). 10-min long traces were sampled at 1.25 ms intervals and filtered at 500 Hz. Both chambers contained buffer T and Ag/AgCl electrodes with pellet. The <italic>trans</italic> side of the bilayer was set as ground. Insertions were typically performed at −90 mV. Data display and analysis were done with pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Dr David Houldershaw for computing support, and Drs Tsjerk Wassenaar and Paula Petrone for useful discussions.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled &quot;Allosteric Signalling in the Outer Membrane Translocation Domain of PapC Usher&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and Volker Dötsch (Reviewing editor), and two other reviewers (Nir Ben-Tal and Michael Wiener).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript describes mechanistic studies of the outer membrane translocation domain of PapC Usher, a protein required for assembly and secretion of P pili in uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is involved in kidney infection. This is an interesting paper that utilizes a hybrid computational approach to identify amino acid residues involved in signaling/allosteric regulation. The use of multiple computational methods to select/filter those residues most likely to be significant adds confidence to their selection, and enabled the verification experiments to be better focused.</p><p>A few points should, however, be addressed:</p><p>1) While the three steps of RIN, evolutionary analysis, and interaction analysis are presented and well-described, the relative contributions of each to the final Hot Spot sub-network are not provided. For example, if evolutionary analysis were not included, how would this have affected the identified Hot Spot sub-network? Please include some information, like a Venn diagram, to illustrate how each step selected/filtered the results. Or, what if order of application of the steps were varied?</p><p>2) For the electrophysiology assay the authors wanted to purify all 10 mutants that had shown an effect in either the hemagglutination or in the permeability assay. Only 7 were stable enough for further analysis. This is to some extent a contradiction to the earlier statement that no difference in stability of the mutants relative to wild type protein has been seen in the OM of the bacteria. Is this only a detergent effect or can it be ruled out that these mutants are also less stable in the OM and therefore the results are influenced by differences in folding/stability?</p><p>3) The goal of this project was to use a combination of in silico tools to identify residues that play key roles in the allosteric regulation of the pore formation. One particularly important aspect that was noted by all reviewers is that this combination of multiple analytical methods probably decreases &quot;false positives&quot;, i.e. residues that one or more methods selects as being functionally important, but another method (or two) filters out. Do you have identified residues that one or more methods select and that are removed by the remaining method(s)? A panel of three figures showing the residues that &quot;light up&quot; with each method would be useful.</p><p>In addition, are there residues located close to the allosteric residue communities in the structure that would have been selected by visual inspection of the structure as probably functionally important but that have not scored high in your combinatorial in silico approach? If there would be even experimental data showing that such &quot;negative control&quot; residues exist and can be predicted as functionally not important that would strongly support your method.</p><p>4) Along the same lines: 15 mutations were made but only 7 showed an effect in the hemagglutination assay and 10 if combined with the antibiotic resistance assay. Why do the other mutations not have the expected effect?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03532.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) While the three steps of RIN, evolutionary analysis, and interaction analysis are presented and well-described, the relative contributions of each to the final Hot Spot sub-network are not provided</italic>. <italic>For example, if evolutionary analysis were not included, how would this have affected the identified Hot Spot sub-network?

We now added some new details about our method to clarify some of these issues.</p><p>First, in the Results we expanded the paragraph entitled “Identifying Allosteric ‘Hot Spots’ From a Hybrid Residue Interaction Network” that refers to the filtering issues (sentences starting “This initial large sub- network is formed by 208 nodes (residues) connected by 456 NCI edges (in the native RIN)”).</p><p>Second, we would like to highlight that the order of the filters does not affect the identified Hot Spot sub-network, which rises from the intersection of the different sets of networks resulting from the application of the above filters. To clarify this point we added a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>), showing a Venn diagram of each step involved in the method.</p><p>Additionally, we now updated the section entitled “Allosteric ‘hot spots’ sub-network reconstruction” to clarify that our filters are used in combination (sentences starting “Using the hybrid network and starting from the α-helix region (residues 445-468) and β-hairpin residues (residues 230-240) we generated a sub-network of first neighbours residues based only on the NCI score higher than 0.3 in the native RIN”).</p><p>Note that originally we wrongly stated in the Methods that we used a NCI score greater than 0.3 for the selection of the weakened interactions in the section above. Now this point is corrected.</p><p>Finally, we changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to clarify the issue of the order by which the filters are applied (i.e. the two filters are indicated in the same level).</p><p><italic>2) For the electrophysiology assay the authors wanted to purify all 10 mutants that had shown an effect in either the hemagglutination or in the permeability assay. Only 7 were stable enough for further analysis</italic>. <italic>This is to some extent a contradiction to the earlier statement that no difference in stability of the mutants relative to wild type protein has been seen in the OM of the bacteria. Is this only a detergent effect or can it be ruled out that these mutants are also less stable in the OM and therefore the results are influenced by differences in folding/stability?</italic></p><p>We appreciate the concerns of the reviewers. The overall expression levels and folding of the 10 examined PapC mutants in the outer membrane are, indeed, similar to wild-type PapC usher. All PapC variants used in the electrophysiology assay for single channel recording were equally stable during the OM extraction procedure as wild-type. However, some PapC mutants behave well in their physiological environment within the membrane, but are unstable once extracted out of the outer membrane for purification. This is the case in 3 of the 10 purified mutants. Indeed, during the OM extraction procedure, D249A, R442A and Y260A mutants were not stable enough to maintain their native conformation in detergents, likely due to the loss of the membrane bilayer environment.</p><p>In response to the suggestions, we added a sentence to the section entitled “Electrophysiological analysis of selected mutants” in the Results:</p><p>“During the OM extraction procedure, D249A, R442A, and Y260A were not stable enough due to the loss of the membrane bilayer environment and inability to maintain their native conformation in detergents.”</p><p><italic>3) The goal of this project was to use a combination of in silico tools to identify residues that play key roles in the allosteric regulation of the pore formation. One particularly important aspect that was noted by all reviewers is that this combination of multiple analytical methods probably decreases &quot;false positives&quot;, i.e. residues that one or more methods selects as being functionally important, but another method (or two) filters out. Do you have identified residues that one or more methods select and that are removed by the remaining method(s)? A panel of three figures showing the residues that &quot;light up&quot; with each method would be useful</italic>.</p><p><italic>In addition, are there residues located close to the allosteric residue communities in the structure that would have been selected by visual inspection of the structure as probably functionally important but that have not scored high in your combinatorial in silico approach? If there would be even experimental data showing that such &quot;negative control&quot; residues exist and can be predicted as functionally not important that would strongly support your method.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this interesting point.</p><p>The residues that “light up” as a result of the evolutionary information are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Additionally, to highlight the residues that light up as a result of the dynamic information in each of the mutants and their combination with the native PapC we have now added new supplemental figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, showing each of the non-covalent RINs and their combination with the native PapC RIN, respectively.</p><p>As highlighted by the reviewers, the predictive power of our method rises from the combination of multiple analytical methods. These are based both on evolutionary data and on the information regarding the dynamics of the protein (without the need for prior knowledge on large confrontational changes it may undergo). As shown in the new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>) only 14% of all the residues in the TD were selected as a result of our integrative method, filtering out a large portion of the residues. Thus, the main strength of our method is the ability to explore a large part of the protein. As a result, the method is able to predict not only residues that could in principle be identified by visual inspection (especially if a structure of another conformation is available) but also residues in regions that would not attract our attention at all although they may contain important information in respect to the allosteric network. For example, V327, which was picked by our method and was shown experimentally to have a functional effect on plug displacement, could potentially have been selected for mutagenesis studies by visual inspection. This residue, which is located on P-linker2 (following a proline that is at the border of the mobile part of the linker) as part of the interface with P-linker1 and the barrel wall, has a different interaction pattern in the open state of the usher (based on FimD:FimC:FimH structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phan et al., Nature 2011</xref> Jun 2;474(7349):49-53). On the other hand, the method predicted, for example, two residues to be functionally important, T331 and S444, and it is extremely unlikely that they would have been selected as candidates for mutagenesis studies by visual inspection only (out of the 494 residues comprising the TD). T331 is located on P-linker2 at the interface between P -linker2 and the barrel wall, which stays intact in the open conformation of the usher) S444 β13 is located on base of the α-helix, i.e. on the barrel itself, and it lacks any direct contact with the plug domain. However, both residues were shown to have an effect on plug displacement.</p><p>We have added a dedicated paragraph in a new Discussion section (sentences starting “Interestingly, our community residues in some cases are found to have very different patterns of interactions in an alternative conformation”).</p><p><italic>4) Along the same lines: 15 mutations were made but only 7 showed an effect in the hemagglutination assay and 10 if combined with the antibiotic resistance assay</italic>. <italic>Why do the other mutations not have the expected effect?</italic></p><p>Our method helps to guide the experimental investigation pointing towards regions of interest in the structure (“communities”). Along the line of the answer to question #3, it is clear that the method is useful to pinpointing key candidates while exploring a large part of the investigated protein without prior knowledge of conformational changes. Additionally one should keep in mind that the hemagglutination assay and antibiotic sensitivity assay (used in this study) are screening tools, and as such, lack in sensitivity to pick up smaller changes in the ability to assemble pili or channel activity of the usher. For this reason we further investigated the key candidate mutants using a more sensitive assay such as single channel recording.</p><p>We have now added a sentence in the Results section entitled ‘Experimental Analysis of Residues In The Hot Spot Sub-Network’ to clarify this point:</p><p>“Y329A, R337A, S363A and S420A did not appear to perturb the allosteric signalling within PapC, showing the same antibiotic sensitivity phenotype and ability to assemble pili of the native PapC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). However, the hemagglutination assay and antibiotic sensitivity assay are screening tools, and as such, they lack in sensitivity to pick up smaller changes in the ability to assemble pili or channel activity of the usher.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
