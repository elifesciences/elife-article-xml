underlying choice between drug and nondrug rewards remains a challenge. This study adopts an original approach to probe these mechanisms by comparing response latencies during sampling versus choice trials. While lengthening of latencies during choice is predicted in a deliberative choice model (DCM), the race-like response competition mechanism postulated by the Sequential choice model (SCM) predicts a shortening of latencies during choice compared to sampling. Here, we tested these predictions by conducting a retrospective analysis of cocaine-versus-saccharin choice experiments conducted in our laboratory. We found that rats engage deliberative decision-making mechanisms after limited training, but adopt a SCM-like response selection mechanism after more extended training, while their behavior is presumably habitual. Thus, the DCM and SCM may not be general models of choice, as initially formulated, but could be dynamically engaged to control choice behavior across early and extended training.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>deliberative choice model</kwd><kwd>sequential choice model</kwd><kwd>cocaine</kwd><kwd>saccharin</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR- 2010-BLAN-1404-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>Serge H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM DPA20140629788</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>Serge H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Peter und Traudl Engelhorn Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vandaele</surname><given-names>Youna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a drug choice setting, rats’ preference is initially driven by deliberative processes but shifts to more automatic selection processes after extended training, in accordance with the sequential choice model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Investigating the decision-making mechanisms underlying choice between drug and nondrug rewards is essential to understand how their alterations can contribute to substance use disorders. Over the past decade, a growing research effort has been made to model this choice situation in animals, particularly in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lüscher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahmed, 2018b</xref>). Overall, when given a choice, most rats prefer the nondrug alternative (e.g., sweet water, food pellets or social interaction) over potent drugs of abuse, such as cocaine or heroin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lenoir et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lenoir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caprioli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caprioli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Venniro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vandaele et al., 2016</xref>). Only few individual rats prefer the drug. This pattern of individual preferences is observed even after extended drug use and regardless of the drug dose available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lenoir et al., 2007</xref>). We recently found that, after some amount of training in our procedure, preference may not necessarily involve a comparison and deliberation over options’ value, but could instead rely on more automatic processes such as habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vandaele et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vandaele et al., 2019a</xref>). However, investigating habitual control in a drug choice setting is particularly challenging, mainly because there is no effective method of drug reward devaluation in animals, particularly for drugs administered intravenously. An alternative approach, sufficiently versatile to probe the decision-making mechanisms underlying individual preferences in a drug choice setting, is thus needed.</p><p>Previous research aimed at testing the validity of different models of animal choice, including behavioral ecology-inspired models, have proposed that the decision-making mechanisms underlying choice should be, in theory, inferable from a detailed analysis of response latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kacelnik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monteiro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vasconcelos et al., 2010</xref>). One such model, the deliberative choice model (DCM), makes the assumption that deliberation requires time. Indeed, although deliberative behavior is highly flexible in adapting to new environmental contingencies, weighting the pros and cons of multiple choice outcomes to select the most valuable option requires higher cognitive demand and is therefore time-consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keramati et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wickelgren, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>). Specifically, if choice behavior involves a deliberation over the values of the different reward options, one would expect an increase in response latency during choice trials in comparison to sampling trials where the different options are presented separately and successively.</p><p>The sequential choice model (SCM) makes a prediction in direct opposition to the DCM. This model explains choice without postulating any explicit deliberation and/or valuation processes. Specifically, when facing different options, animals would consider each option sequentially, not simultaneously, and would decide whether to accept or reject it with no consideration of the other option available. It is hypothesized that such sequential decision process has evolved as an adaptation to the natural ‘reward ecology’ of most animals. Unlike in laboratory choice settings, successive encounters with different rewards are the rule in natural environments while simultaneous encounters are the exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charnov, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lea, 1982</xref>). Based on this assumption, the SCM proposes that there would be no genuine decision and that preference would be the result of a race-like competition between independent responses. Briefly, during choice, each option would automatically elicit a specific response with a certain latency: the shorter the latency, the more likely the corresponding response will win the race and thus, the more likely the animal will prefer that option. Importantly, due to this race-like selection process, the SCM uniquely predicts that the choice latencies should be shorter, not longer, than the sampling latencies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for additional information).</p><p>Thus, the DCM and SCM models make opposite testable predictions about the differences between choice and sampling latencies (i.e., longer or shorter) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, however, both models make one general common prediction regarding the relationship between sampling latencies and preference, though for different reasons. Both models predict that individuals that respond faster for one option relative to its alternative during sampling trials should also choose the former more frequently than the later during choice trials. In other terms, there should be a positive correlation between individual sampling latencies and individual preferences during choice. According to the SCM, the nature of this relationship should also be predictive since response latencies play a causal role in the establishment of preference in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vasconcelos et al., 2010</xref>). In the DCM, sampling latencies rather represent another measure of the options' relative values.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Unique predictions of the different decision-making models.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Models</th><th>Predictions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Deliberative choice model (DCM)</td><td>Sampling latencies &lt; choice latencies</td></tr><tr><td>Sequential choice model (SCM)</td><td>Sampling latencies &gt; choice latencies</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The goal of the present study is to test these predictions by conducting a systematic retrospective analysis of all cocaine versus saccharin choice experiments that have been conducted in rats in our laboratory over the past 12 years.

Choice sessions consisted of four sampling trials followed by eight choice trials and separated with 10 min inter-trial intervals. During sampling, each response option was presented twice, alternatively and sequentially. During choice trials, both response options were presented simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We assumed that without prior instrumental training, behavior would more likely involve deliberative processes. Indeed, rats’ behavior was initially less efficient in the W/O training set with a lower percentage of completed trials (higher number of omission) and longer choice latencies than rats having received prior instrumental training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; first session, % completed trials: Z = 3.63, p&lt;0.001; choice latency: Z = −4.57, p&lt;0.0001).

In all analyses, sampling and choice latencies for each response option were analyzed for each individual rat over the last three stable choice sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; gray area). In total, there were six sampling latencies per option and per rat and 24 choice latencies, with a variable number of responses for cocaine and saccharin, depending on the rat’s preference.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental conditions in experiments included in the W/and W/O training sets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the choice procedure comprising four sampling trials followed by eight choice trials, and separated by 10 min inter-trial intervals.

Alternatively, the SCM assumes that individuals make no comparison between options to make a choice (bottom panel). Instead, decision-making mechanisms are adapted to sequential encounters, in which individuals decide to accept or reject single opportunities. (<bold>B</bold>) The SCM proposes that individuals assign independently to each option a subjective value based on the option’s profitability relative to background opportunities. This value is expressed as a probability to accept each option instead of pursuing the search (i.e. the response latency). During a choice between two options A and B, the tendency to respond for both options is compared to a threshold. The response reaching the threshold first wins the race and is selected, while the alternative response is aborted (top panel). This results in a cross-censorship between distributions of response latencies (bottom panel); only the fastest response is selected and produces a latency observation. (<bold>C</bold>) When options are presented sequentially during sampling trials, there is no cross-censorship and the distributions of latencies are entirely expressed. (<bold>D</bold>) However, when options are presented simultaneously during choice trials, the cross-censorship described in (<bold>B</bold>) leads to a shortening of latencies during choice compared to sampling trials; the preferred option A is more often selected because response latencies for this option are overall shorter (top panel) but because of the overlap in distributions of latencies, the least preferred option B can occasionally be selected (bottom panel). Choices of option A are less censored by longer responses for option B (blue gradient, top panel); thus, the expected shift toward shorter latencies is weaker for the preferred option. In contrast, choices of the least preferred option B are largely censored by responses for option A (pink gradient, bottom panel). Thus, the expected shortening of choice latencies is stronger for the least preferred option.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64993-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Summary and conditions of experiments included in the analysis.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>N°Exp</th><th>Exp set</th><th>N</th><th>Prior training</th><th>Training session limit</th><th>Nb training sessions</th><th>Other conditions</th><th>Nb choice sessions (FR2)</th><th>Selected choice sessions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>W/O training</td><td>9</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>0</td><td>***</td><td>5</td><td>s13-s15</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>W/O training</td><td>11</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>0</td><td>***</td><td>5</td><td>s13-s15</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>W/O training</td><td>11</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>0</td><td>***</td><td>5</td><td>s13-s15</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"/><td>Total</td><td>31</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>W/training</td><td>18</td><td>FR1</td><td>30 rewards/3 hr</td><td>26</td><td>***</td><td>8</td><td>s32-s34</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>W/training</td><td>19</td><td>FR1</td><td>30 rewards/3 hr</td><td>26</td><td>***</td><td>8</td><td>s32-s34</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>W/training</td><td>11</td><td>FR1</td><td>30 rewards/3 hr</td><td>18</td><td>1 month home-cage saccharin access</td><td>10</td><td>s26-s28</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>W/training</td><td>22</td><td>FR1/FR2</td><td>30 rewards/3 hr</td><td>26</td><td>cannula intra-OFC</td><td>10</td><td>s34-s36</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>W/training</td><td>21</td><td>FR1</td><td>30 rewards/3 hr</td><td>23</td><td>cannula intra-OFC</td><td>9</td><td>s30-s32</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>W/training</td><td>12</td><td>FR1/FR2</td><td>30 rewards/3 hr</td><td>21</td><td>***</td><td>9</td><td>s28-s30</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>W/training</td><td>23</td><td>FR1/FR2</td><td>30 rewards/3 hr</td><td>32</td><td>***</td><td>5</td><td>s35-s37</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>W/training</td><td>9</td><td>FR1</td><td>30 rewards/3 hr</td><td>19</td><td>***</td><td>5</td><td>s22-s24</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>W/training</td><td>15</td><td>FR1/FR2</td><td>20 rewards/2 hr</td><td>21</td><td>***</td><td>5</td><td>s24-s26</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Total</td><td>150</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Both decision-making models predict that the relative latency of each response option when encountered sequentially (i.e., sampling phase) should predict which one will be selected when encountered simultaneously (i.e., choice phase). That is, the fastest the response for an option during sampling, the more likely this option will be selected during choice. We first tested this prediction by correlating preference with two estimates of the relative response latency for cocaine versus saccharin during sampling trials; the latency ratio (LR) and the proportion of winning latencies (WL). The LR was computed by dividing the mean saccharin sampling latency by the sum of saccharin and cocaine mean latencies. The WL was computed by estimating the probability that each of the six cocaine sampling latencies was shorter (i.e., a win) than each of the six saccharin sampling latencies when compared two by two. LR and WL scores close to one indicate faster cocaine sampling latencies. We found that both LR and WL were positively correlated with the percentage of cocaine choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; LR: R = 0.62, p&lt;0.001; WL: R = 0.42, p&lt;0.05). These results suggest that the faster the animals respond for cocaine relative to saccharin during sampling trial, the more they would prefer cocaine.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Lengthening of saccharin choice latencies compared to saccharin sampling latencies in the W/O training set.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation between the latency ratio and the percentage of cocaine choice.

In this subgroup, the distribution of choice latencies was shifted to the right compared to the distribution of sampling latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Accordingly, choice latencies were significantly longer than sampling latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; N = 29, Wilcoxon test: p&lt;0.0001; effect size: −0.99).

Interestingly, the SCM not only predicts that preference should be correlated with the relative sampling speed but also proposes that preference could be directly predicted from sampling latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vasconcelos et al., 2010</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we trained a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model on the mean cocaine and saccharin sampling latencies on 90% of the data set to classify the preference of individual rats as SP, indifferent (IND), or cocaine-preferring (CP) in the remaining 10%. To avoid any bias resulting from the unbalanced number of SP, IND, and CP rats, we performed the analysis on the same number of rats in each preference group (N = 19), by randomly sampling subjects in the SP and IND groups based on the number of CP rats. This analysis was performed on 50 random selections of SP and IND rats and the performance across all 50 repetitions was averaged to determine the model accuracy. It was possible to predict the preference profile (SP, CP, or IND) from the mean cocaine and saccharin sampling latencies with an accuracy of 53.1 ± 4.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A permutation test confirmed that the decoding accuracy significantly departed from chance (i.e. around 33.33%), assessed by shuffling the preference profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). This result further validates the first SCM prediction by showing that the preference profile can be predicted above chance, from the options’ sampling latencies.</p><p>The DCM and SCM make opposite predictions when comparing sampling and choice latencies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To test these predictions, we compared the individual distributions of sampling and choice latencies for each reward, separately. To avoid any selection bias resulting from saccharin preference in the majority of rats, choice and sampling latencies distributions were compared within-subjects in different preference groups, separately. Specifically, sampling and choice latencies were only compared for the option that was preferred (saccharin for SP rats, cocaine for CP rats) or chosen (saccharin or cocaine in IND rats) during choice trials.</p><p>In SP rats, the distribution of sampling and choice latencies on saccharin trials did not significantly differ, although there was a trend toward longer choice latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; N = 109; Wilcoxon test: p=0.077; effect size: −0.19). However, in CP rats, we observed a leftward shift in the distribution of latencies during cocaine choice trials compared to cocaine sampling trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Accordingly, cocaine choice latencies were significantly shorter than cocaine sampling latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; N = 19, Wilcoxon test: p&lt;0.01; effect size: 0.75). IND rats selected both cocaine and saccharin during choice trials allowing for similar ranges in the number of cocaine and saccharin choice latencies (i.e. between 8 and 16 latencies per reward). When comparing saccharin trials, we observed no difference between sampling and choice latencies, similar to saccharin trials in SP rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; N = 23; Wilcoxon test: p&gt;0.9; effect size: −0.0072). However, during cocaine trials, the distribution of choice latencies was shifted to the left compared to the distribution of sampling latencies. Likewise, choice latencies were significantly shorter than sampling latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; N = 23; Wilcoxon test: p&lt;0.0001; effect size: 0.96). These results partially validate the SCM prediction, since choice latencies were shorter than sampling latencies for the cocaine option but not for the saccharin option. Importantly, although rare, omissions were more frequent during sampling than choice trials, which could have biased the results reported here. However, similar results were found when omission trials were excluded (saccharin trials in SP rats: p=0.06; Cocaine trials in CP rats: p&lt;0.01; saccharin trials in IND rats: p&gt;0.9; cocaine trials in IND rats: p&lt;0.0001).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Shortening of cocaine choice latencies compared to cocaine sampling latencies.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Distributions of sampling and choice latencies during saccharin trials in SP rats (<bold>A</bold>), cocaine trials in CP rats (<bold>B</bold>), and saccharin (<bold>C</bold>) or cocaine (<bold>D</bold>) trials in IND rats.

We next asked whether analysis of choice and sampling latencies in these experiments would confirm the lack of deliberation suggested by rats’ preference insensitivity to devaluation of the nondrug reward. In the first experiment, rats were trained to choose between saccharin and cocaine, and saccharin was devaluated by sensory-specific satiety (test 1) or induction of a conditioned taste aversion (test 2). Lever pressing on both levers was not affected by either devaluation methods during the tests conducted in extinction, indicating that responding for saccharin was habitual. Analysis of saccharin latencies in SP and IND rats during the last three choice sessions immediately preceding devaluation tests indicates no significant difference between mean saccharin sampling and choice latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; N = 17, Test 1 Wilcoxon test: p&gt;0.2; effect size: −0.32; Test 2 Wilcoxon test: p&gt;0.2; effect size: −0.29). Although this result does not support the SCM, it confirms that under habitual control, the lack of deliberation can be inferred from comparably short choice and sampling latencies.</p><p>In the second experiment, water-restricted rats were offered a choice between water and cocaine. Water was then devalued by satiation. Although water preference was initially insensitive to water devaluation, rats eventually reversed their preference in favor of cocaine following repeated devaluation training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vandaele et al., 2019a</xref>). Sampling and choice latencies were compared during baseline privation sessions before and at the end of devaluation training in SP and IND rats. Interestingly, although water sampling and choice latencies did not significantly differ when choice behavior was under habitual control before devaluation training (N = 24; Wilcoxon test: p&gt;0.4; effect size: −0.17), choice latencies were significantly longer at the end of devaluation training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; N = 25; Wilcoxon test: p&lt;0.01; effect size: −0.67), presumably because rats had learned to reengage deliberative decision-making mechanisms to adjust their behavior to repeated changes in water value.

An increase in latencies during choice is predicted from the DCM whereas the SCM predicts a shortening of latencies during choice compared to sampling. Here we tested these different predictions in a systematic retrospective analysis of all the choice experiments conducted in the laboratory over the past 12 years. Our analysis shows a lengthening of choice latencies after limited training, suggesting the involvement of a deliberative process. However, when prior training is included before choice testing, we observed similar choice and sampling latencies on saccharin trials and a shortening of choice latencies on cocaine trials. These results are partially consistent with the SCM, but inconsistent with the DCM. Finally, additional analyses in two independent experiments assessing habitual control of choice behavior confirm that the engagement of deliberative or valuation processes can be inferred from the comparison of sampling and choice response latencies.</p><p>In agreement with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monteiro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vasconcelos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freidin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vasconcelos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vasconcelos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ojeda et al., 2018</xref>), results from our analysis validated in both experimental sets (with or without prior training) the general common prediction that the relative response latency during sampling trials should correlate with preference during choice trials. Indeed, the parameters of relative latency were both strongly correlated with the percentage of cocaine choices. Furthermore, in agreement with the SCM, which assumes that the relative sampling latency causally determines preference, sampling latencies could predict whether rats preferred cocaine, saccharin, or were indifferent. However, these findings are not sufficient to favor the SCM over the DCM, which also predicts a relationship between sampling latencies and preference. Indeed, according to the DCM, options are compared and selected based on their relative value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kacelnik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rangel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rangel and Hare, 2010</xref>) and numerous studies have reported that latencies are inversely related to options’ relative value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateson and Kacelnik, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Killeen and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lagorio and Hackenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shull et al., 1990</xref>). More generally, it was suggested that response latencies could be used as a sensitive metric for response strength and subjective value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateson and Kacelnik, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Killeen and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lagorio and Hackenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shull et al., 1990</xref>). The analysis and comparison of sampling and choice latencies are therefore needed to arbitrate between the DCM and SCM models.</p><p>Contrary to all prior studies testing predictions of the SCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kacelnik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monteiro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vasconcelos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freidin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vasconcelos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vasconcelos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ojeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Macías et al., 2021</xref>), analysis of experiments without instrumental training prior to choice testing reveals a lengthening of choice latencies compared to sampling latencies. These results are consistent with the DCM which assumes that processing of information during simultaneous encounters would increase the response latency compared to sequential encounters, due to the time cost of the evaluation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kacelnik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keramati et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rangel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rangel and Hare, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The discrepancy with prior findings could result from the relatively long training in instrumental tasks involving discrete trial designs, shown to promote rapid habitual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vandaele et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vandaele et al., 2019b</xref>), or from species differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kacelnik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monteiro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vasconcelos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freidin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vasconcelos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vasconcelos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Macías et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, in this analysis, the lengthening of latencies was observed in naïve rats trained for a very limited number of sessions while most studies investigating SCM predictions were conducted in European starlings or pigeons (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ojeda et al., 2018</xref>), after extensive instrumental training.</p><p>In the data set with prior instrumental training, the shortening of cocaine response latencies during choice is consistent with the SCM. Indeed, the race-like competition process implies that only the shortest latencies should be expressed during choice trials, the selection of one option excluding the opportunity to select the alternative option (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This cross-censorship between distributions of latencies results in a shortening of choice latencies. This prediction was validated for cocaine but not saccharin trials. The negative result for saccharin trials is however consistent with prior studies testing SCM predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monteiro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vasconcelos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vasconcelos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vasconcelos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ojeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Macías et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aw et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, none of these studies but one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ojeda et al., 2018</xref>) has reported a shortening of choice latencies for the preferred option. Demonstrating this decrease in latency is difficult because when animals strongly prefer one option, the distribution of latencies for that option is minimally censored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the high relative value of this option results in short latencies during sampling, limiting the room for further decrease. Analysis of prior studies conducted in our laboratory indicates that response latencies cannot go below 3 s, likely representing the reaction time.</p><p>The floor effect for saccharin response latencies cannot be excluded, but is also likely to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Macías et al., 2021</xref>). In the absence of floor effect, how to explain the similarity between saccharin sampling and choice latencies while there is a shortening of choice latencies on cocaine trial? A less parsimonious hypothesis would be that a shortening of latencies predicted from the SCM is masked by a lengthening of response latencies due to the involvement of deliberative processes. However, this hypothesis is not supported by findings from our devaluation experiments showing that preference for the nondrug reward rapidly becomes habitual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vandaele et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vandaele et al., 2019a</xref>). In the confirmatory analysis conducted on these experiments, we systematically found similar sampling and choice latencies when responding for the nondrug reward was under habitual control, as indicated by preference insensitivity to devaluation. Although inconsistent with the SCM, this result also invalidates the DCM and confirm that the absence of deliberative or valuation processes can be inferred from the comparison of sampling and choice response latencies. Interestingly, in the second experiment involving choice between water and cocaine, the increased sensitivity to water devaluation was associated with a lengthening of choice latencies compared to sampling latencies. This finding is consistent with the DCM and suggests that across devaluation training, rats are learning to re-engage deliberative processes during choice. Overall, these findings suggest that the DCM and SCM may not be general models of choice, as initially formulated, but could be dynamically engaged to control choice behavior across early and extended training, or following changes in outcomes value or instrumental contingencies.</p><p>Although cocaine was the preferred option in CP rats, we were able to observe a shortening of latencies at choice following extended training. Interestingly, this difference was mainly driven by the long sampling latencies since choice latencies were more homogenous between rewards and groups of rats. This finding is in agreement with the SCM, which assumes that while sampling latencies for each option are expressed without cross-censorship from the alternative option, choice latencies are censored by the selection of the alternative option. In CP and IND rats, cocaine sampling latencies are quite long, a finding consistent with prior studies from our lab that remains to be elucidated. However, during choice trials, selection of saccharin censors longer cocaine response latencies, thereby biasing the distribution of cocaine choice latencies in favor of the shortest latencies, more similar to saccharin latencies. Interestingly the gap between cocaine choice and sampling latencies was more pronounced in IND rats compared to CP rats. This result further supports the SCM, which predicts that trimming of the leftward side of the distribution of latencies would be more pronounced when the overlap between response distributions is stronger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kacelnik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since rats are indifferent, the drug and nondrug rewards are closer in value and selected with more comparable response latencies during sampling. The stronger cross-censorship between distributions of latencies during choice could have increased the shortening of cocaine choice latencies in this subgroup of rats. However, at indifference, the SCM predicts a shortening of choice latencies for both options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Macías et al., 2021</xref>). The similarity between saccharin sampling and choice latencies in IND rats is thus unexpected. Given the already low value of latencies during sampling (mean: 4.7 ± 0.49 s; median: 3.97 s), a floor effect cannot be excluded.</p><p>Like habit, the automatic selection process of option based on the response latency implied by the SCM is oblivious to the options’ value. The SCM assumes that during sequential encounters, each option is processed independently and choice results from a race between the mechanisms generating response latencies for each available option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kacelnik et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, although the SCM proposes a mechanism for the selection of responses based on their latency, this model makes no assumption on the valuation process generating distributions of latencies. It is tempting to speculate that the habitual system would process the action value (or ‘action policy’) while the SCM offers a mechanism by which habit translates in preference in a choice setting between two simultaneous options. This assumption is in agreement with a recent theory suggesting that decision-making does not necessarily require computation of the economic value by the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayden and Niv, 2020</xref>). Overall, our analysis suggests that after extended training, responses for the drug and the nondrug rewards are selected via a race-like competition mechanism, without deliberation over options’ value, not unlike the habitual preference demonstrated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vandaele et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vandaele et al., 2019a</xref>). Numerous studies show a shift in behavioral control from goal-directed to habitual decision-making processes across extended training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickinson and Weiskrantz, 1985</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that rats first engage a goal-directed deliberative strategy with computation and comparison of the options value but, after more extended training, adopt a SCM-like response selection process while their behavior becomes habitual. Interestingly, one would expect similar sampling and choice response latencies for a behavior performed automatically under habitual control and without representation of the options’ value. This is in fact what we systematically observed when comparing saccharin latencies in IND and SP rats, after some amount of prior instrumental training. Further research is needed to determine whether comparable sampling and choice latencies could be equated with habit in a choice setting.</p><p>A key question raised by our findings is whether the differences between sampling and choice latencies plausibly reflect operation of different decision-making mechanisms (race-like versus deliberative model) or different operations of the same decision-making mechanism. Likewise, it would be interesting to determine whether decision-making mechanisms or operations differ in the groups without and with prior training, when the behavior is presumably goal-directed and habitual, respectively. The interplay between goal-directed and habitual behavior is often described as dichotomous (i.e. based on separate decision-making mechanisms) but there is now a consensus on the need to consider it as a gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schreiner et al., 2020</xref>), which may involve a single decision-making mechanism with variations in the underlying operations. The diffusion decision model (DDM) or the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) are both derived from models of human choice reaction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ratcliff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Heathcote, 2008</xref>), and could be applied to our data sets to address this issue. A single decision-making model (LBA or DDM) could explain response latencies in both data sets (with and without prior training) with variations in how the model is operating between sampling and choice and/or between groups, for instance with a change in the starting point of the decision, in the rate of evidence accumulation, or in the threshold at which evidence is translated into choice behavior. Alternatively, behavior in groups with and without prior training could be better explained by different models, indicating that behavior is driven by distinct decision-making mechanisms. Future studies will aim at developing formal modeling of choice behavior to better delineate the decision-making mechanisms or parameters differing between sampling versus choice, limited versus extended training, or as a function of individual preference.</p><p>To conclude, this systematic analysis has begun to probe the decision-making processes underlying choice between sweet water and cocaine in rats. It shows that when simultaneously facing these two options, rats first engage a deliberative strategy but after more extended training, rats adopt an automated SCM-like response selection strategy, in the absence of deliberation. Clearly, more research is needed to dissect the precise decision-making mechanisms underlying choice between drug and nondrug rewards in our discrete-trial choice procedure. However, these results suggest that the comparison of sampling and choice latencies could be used to infer the involvement of deliberative processes during choice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>The data analyzed in this study have been obtained from previous experiments conducted in our laboratory over the past 12 years.

FR training allowed rats to learn the value of each reward and to associate its delivery with a different response option before choice testing. During FR training, rats had access to a single response option per session with the lever continuously available. On saccharin sessions, lever pressing on the saccharin lever was rewarded by a 20 s access to water sweetened with 0.2% of sodium saccharin delivered in the adjacent drinking cup. During the first 3 s of each 20 s access to sweet water, the drinking cup was filled automatically with sweet water; during the next 17 s, additional volumes of sweet water were obtained on demand by voluntary licking. On cocaine sessions, lever pressing on the alternative lever was rewarded by one intravenous dose of cocaine (0.25 mg delivered over 4 s). For both cocaine and saccharin sessions, reward delivery initiated a concomitant 20 s time-out period signaled by the illumination of the cue-light above the available lever. During the time-out period, responding had no scheduled consequences.

If rats responded twice within 5 min on the available lever, they were rewarded by the corresponding reward. Reward delivery was signaled by the immediate retraction of the lever and illumination of a cue-light above it. If rats failed to complete the response requirement within 5 min, the lever was retracted until the next trial 10 min later. The choice phase consisted of eight choice trials during which the two response options were presented simultaneously. Specifically, each choice trial began with the simultaneous presentation of both levers S and C and rats could select one of the two levers by responding twice consecutively on it to obtain the corresponding reward. Reward delivery was signaled by the simultaneous retraction of both levers and illumination of the cue-light above the selected lever. If rats failed to respond on either lever within 5 min, both levers were retracted and no cue-light and reward was delivered. Importantly, 10 min inter-trial intervals were set to minimize the direct pharmacological effects of cocaine on subsequent trials and prevent rats from choosing under the influence of the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lenoir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vandaele et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freese et al., 2018</xref>). A schematic diagram of the forced choice trials procedure can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lenoir et al., 2013b</xref>.</p><p>In the W/O training set, rats were first trained in the discrete-trials choice schedule with a FR1 for 10 sessions before testing with the final FR2 schedule for five sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Systematic analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Selection of experiments and data analysis</title><p>Only choice experiments that were conducted under similar conditions (e.g., initial FR training, conditions of reward delivery, inter-trial intervals, etc.) and that resulted in a stable preference within 5–10 choice sessions (i.e., no increasing or decreasing trend and significant correlation between preference scores over the last three sessions) were included in the present analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The last three sessions of the first experimental phase of choice testing were selected for the analysis to ensure stable preference with low within-subject variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Sampling and choice latencies for each response option were analyzed for each individual rat over the last three stable choice sessions. In total, there were six sampling latencies per option and per rat and 24 choice latencies, with a variable number of responses for cocaine and saccharin, depending on the rat’s preference. For convenience, performance during choice was expressed in percent of cocaine choices. Response latencies corresponded to the time to complete the FR2 requirement from trial onset (signaled by the lever insertion). When a rat failed to respond within 5 min after trial onset (omission), it was assigned a maximal response latency of 300 s. However, omissions occur rarely.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Test of the general common prediction</title><p>To estimate the relative speed at which the cocaine and saccharin options are selected during sampling trials, we computed for each individual rat the latency ratio (LR) and the proportion of winning latencies (WL). The LR was computed by dividing the mean saccharin sampling latency by the sum of saccharin and cocaine mean latencies. Thus, LR values close to zero indicate faster saccharin sampling latencies while LR values close to one indicate faster cocaine sampling latencies. The WL was computed by estimating the probability that each of the six cocaine sampling latencies was shorter (i.e., a win) than each of the six saccharin sampling latencies when compared two by two. The WL values ranged from 0 (all cocaine latencies are longer than the longest saccharin latency or cocaine never wins the race) to 100% (all cocaine latencies are shorter than the shortest saccharin latency or cocaine always wins the race). Correlation analyses were conducted between these two measures of relative latencies and the percentage of cocaine choices.</p><p>To determine whether and to what extent, cocaine and saccharin sampling latencies could predict rat’s preference profile, a LDA model (LinearDiscriminantAnalysis from sklearn library in Python) was trained on the mean cocaine and saccharin sampling latencies to classify the preference of individual rats as SP, IND, or CP. Rats were considered as SP, IND, or CP if their preference was below 33.3%, between 33.3% and 66.6% or above 66.6%, respectively. LDA models were trained on 90% of the data set and used to classify rats’ preference in the remaining 10% (stratified 10-fold cross-validation with 20 iterations; RepeatedStratifiedKFold from sklearn library in Python). To account for the unbalanced number of SP, IND, and CP rats, we performed the analysis on the same number of rats in each preference group by randomly sampling subjects in the SP and IND groups based on the number of CP rats (N = 19). This analysis was performed on 50 random selections of SP and IND rats and the performance across all 50 repetitions was averaged to determine the model accuracy. The same analysis was conducted with the preference group identities shuffled to determine the model accuracy expected from chance. To assess whether decoding accuracy significantly departed from chance, a permutation test was conducted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Comparison of choice and sampling latencies</title><p>To test predictions of the different decision-making models, we compared the distributions of sampling and choice latencies for each response option. Note that the number of choice latencies (i.e. max. 24) was larger than the number of sampling latencies (six per option) and that among choice trials, the number of saccharin responses was disproportionally higher than cocaine responses because of preference for saccharin in the majority of rats. To avoid any selection bias related to differences in preference, choice and sampling responses for saccharin were compared in SP (&lt;33.3% cocaine choice) and IND rats (33.3–66.6% cocaine choice) whereas choice and sampling responses for cocaine were compared in CP (&gt;66.6% cocaine choice) and IND rats. Note that the IND group comprises comparable numbers of cocaine and saccharin choice latencies allowing for analysis of both reward responses in this subgroup of rats.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Independent confirmatory analysis</title><p>To confirm whether the engagement of deliberative process could be inferred from an analysis of response latencies, choice and sampling latencies were compared in two independent experiments testing preference sensitivity to devaluation of the nondrug reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vandaele et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vandaele et al., 2019a</xref>). In the first experiment, 20 male Sprague Dawley rats were given a choice between cocaine and saccharin, as described above. We have previously shown that responding for saccharin was not affected by devaluation of saccharin with sensory-specific satiety (test 1) or conditioned taste aversion (test 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vandaele et al., 2020</xref>). Saccharin sampling and choice latencies across the last three sessions immediately preceding devaluation tests were analyzed. CP rats (&gt;66.6% cocaine choice) were excluded from this analysis.</p><p>In the second experiment, 28 male Wistar rats were water-restricted and allowed to choose between water and cocaine, as described above. Water was then devalued with 1 hr water access immediately before the choice session and during every inter-trial intervals of choice sessions (satiation sessions). We have shown that preference was initially insensitive to water devaluation but gradually reversed toward cocaine across repeated cycles of satiation and privation sessions (namely ‘devaluation training’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vandaele et al., 2019a</xref>). Water sampling and choice latencies were analyzed during the last three privation sessions before devaluation testing and during the last three privation sessions of the devaluation training. CP rats (&gt;66.6% cocaine choice) were excluded from this analysis.</p><p>A detailed description of the methods for these two experiments is available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vandaele et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vandaele et al., 2019a</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Linear regressions were tested with the Spearman's rank correlation test. Mean sampling and choice latencies were compared within subject using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. The effect sizes were estimated with the rank-biserial correlation. Following the LDA, a permutation test was conducted to determine whether the decoding accuracy significantly departed from chance. All statistical analyses were conducted on Python.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the French Research Council (CNRS), the Université de Bordeaux, the French National Agency (ANR- 2010-BLAN-1404-01), the Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche (MESR), the Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale (FRM DPA20140629788) and the Peter und Traudl Engelhorn foundation.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Animal experimentation: All experiments were carried out in accordance with institutional and international standards of care and use of laboratory animals [UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986; and associated guidelines; the European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/UE, 22 September 2010) and the French Directives concerning the use of laboratory animals (décret 2013-118, 1 February 2013)].

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Shelly Flagel as the Reviewing Editor and Michael Taffe as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gavan McNally (Reviewer #1); Stephanie Groman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our policy on revisions we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of revisions and/or additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors perform a retrospective analysis in attempt to delineate the role of goal-directed versus habitual mechanisms underlying choice between drug and non-drug rewards. Specifically, the authors utilized data generated in their laboratory to assess cocaine-versus-saccharin choice following limited and extended training paradigms. A sequential choice model was used to assess the prediction that increased latencies during choice reflects goal-directed control; whereas no change in latencies reflects habitual control. Based on this model, the authors report that rats engage in goal-directed control after limited training, and adopt more habitual responding after extended training. The authors conclude that the sequential choice model is specific to habitual choice.</p><p>We know already from decades of work that choice response times are almost always log-normally distributed (humans, non-human primates, rodents). The question here is whether differences in the mean and dispersion of these distributions can be used to derive insights into nature of the decision-making mechanism – a deliberative comparison versus a race model – and how this may differ for rats that prefer cocaine over saccharin and how this might be altered by more extended training. These questions are framed in terms of the differences between goal-directed and habitual behavior, which may be less compelling than considering the significance of the data in their own right.</p><p>While the Reviewers appreciate the approach and conceptual framework described in this manuscript, they are all in agreement that additional data and analyses are needed to better support the claims surrounding goal-directed versus habitual control of reward-seeking behavior. For example, an independent evaluation of whether the target behavior is in fact goal-directed or habitual seems necessary to support such claims. Additional concerns raised by the Reviewers and suggestions for improvement our included below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Much, if not all, of the absolute differences between latencies in sample and choice phases appear to be carried by the sample rather than the choice phase. Choice latencies for cocaine preferring rats, saccharin preferring rats, and the indifferent rats are all very similar. In contrast, the sampling latencies for cocaine preferring rats and the indifferent rats are longer. Why is this the case? The authors seem more concerned with the choice side of the experiment being different, not the sample phase. Is this predicted by the models being tested? Why would an SCM-like model would predict the difference being in the sample phase. Either way, the authors should be clearer about where the difference is expected to lie and why the sample phase is so obviously different in some conditions but the choice phase so similar.</p><p>2. The major issue with this manuscript is whether the differences between response latencies in the sample versus choice phases plausibly reflect operation of <italic>different</italic> decision making mechanisms (race model versus deliberative processing) or different operation of the <italic>same</italic> decision-making mechanism. The answer is difficult to derive from the data and modelling provided. The authors frame the differences in response time as being uniquely predicted or explained by different forms of choice. The models that the authors are using are closely linked to, and intellectually derived from, models of human choice reaction time. The most successful of these models are the diffusion model (DDM) (Ratcliff, R., Smith, P.L., Brown, S.D., and McKoon, G. (2016). Diffusion Decision Model: Current Issues and History. Trends in Cognitive Sciences 20, 260-281) and the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) (Brown, S.D., and Heathcote, A. (2008). The simplest complete model of choice response time: linear ballistic accumulation. Cognitive Psychology 57, 153-178.2008).</p><p>Even though the DDM and LBA adopt different architectures to each other (but the same architectures as those in Supp Figure 1A), they are intended to explain the same data. Of relevance, the same model (a DDM or an LBA) can explain differences in both the response distribution and the mean response time via changes in the starting point of evidence accumulation, rate of evidence accumulation, and/or the boundary or threshold at which evidence is translated into choice behavior. So, for either a difference accumulator model (DDM) or a race model (LBA), the difference between sampling and choice performance could reflect changes in how the model is operating between these two phases, including a change in the starting point of the decision [bias], a change in rate of accumulation [evidence], a change in threshold [caution] or collapsing boundary scenario, rather than reflecting operation of a completely different decision-making mechanism.</p><p>Another option could be to acknowledge this possibility and discuss it. e.g., does it really matter if it is a qualitatively different decision-making process or different operation of the same decision-making mechanism? The action-habit distinction doesn't live or die by reaction/response time data, this distinction is almost certainly far less absolute than often portrayed in the addiction literature, and it is generally intended as an account of what is learned rather than an account of how that learning is translated into behaviour (even if an S-R mechanism provides an account of both). Response time data likely reflect something different- about how what has been learned is translated into behaviour. The third, marginally more difficult but more interesting option, would be to explore these issues formally and to move beyond simple descriptive or LDA analyses of response time distributions. The LBA has a full analytical solution and there are reasonable approximations for the DDM. Formal modelling of choice response times (e.g., Bayesian parameter estimation for a race model or DDM) could indicate whether a single decision-making mechanism (LBA or DDM or something else) can explain response times under both sample and choice conditions or not. This is a standard approach in cognitive modelling. This would be compelling if it showed the dissociation the authors argue – i.e. one model cannot be fit to both sample and choice datasets for all animals. However, if one model can expain both, then formal modelling would show which decision making parameters change between the sample and choice conditions for cocaine v sacc v ind animals to putatively cause the differences in response times observed. Either way, more formal modelling would provide a platform towards identification of those specific features of the decision-making mechanisms that are being affected.</p><p>3. The use of response times between sampling and choice behavior as a proxy for assessing habitual vs. goal-directed behaviors is quite clever and the predictions are straightforward. However, the authors do not provide any data to validate this metric. For example, are there data in these animals using more traditional tests of habit (e.g., devaluation) that could be used to support their argument that behavior is habitual when sampling latencies are equivalent to choice latencies? Even using devaluation procedures there is variation across subjects, so perhaps the authors could correlate the difference score with responses during devaluation? These additional data would better support the utility of this task and analytic approach.</p><p>4. Most animals prefer saccharin and perform more saccharin-seeking responses; thus, the outcomes are not matched. Would cocaine RT become faster with more equivalent practice? This model should be applied perhaps in the first instance to responding for two natural rewards, where devaluation could confirm the nature of control and directly test the ideas from the model.</p><p>5. The stated aim of the study was to determine the decision-making processes underlying choice, but the data presented do not directly address this aim.

Much, if not all, of the absolute differences between latencies in sample and choice phases appear to be carried by the sample rather than the choice phase. Choice latencies for cocaine preferring rats, saccharin preferring rats, and the indifferent rats are all very similar. In contrast, the sampling latencies for cocaine preferring rats and the indifferent rats are longer. Why is this the case? The authors seem more concerned with the choice side of the experiment being different, not the sample phase. Is this predicted by the models being tested? Why would an SCM-like model would predict the difference being in the sample phase. Either way, the authors should be clearer about where the difference is expected to lie and why the sample phase is so obviously different in some conditions but the choice phase so similar.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting issue that we now better explain in the Discussion (p10, lines 24-32). Briefly, the fact that latency differences mainly appear during the sampling phase and not during the choice phase is a direct consequence of the response latency-based censorship among options hypothesized by the SCM. Indeed, while sampling latencies for each option are expressed without censorship by the alternative option, choice latencies are systematically censored by selection of the alternative option, thereby biasing their distribution in favor of the shortest choice latencies. This response latency-based censorship also inevitably results in a homogenization of choice latencies across preference groups.</p><p>Now, the differences in sampling latencies between the different groups of rats (i.e., saccharin-preferring rats, cocaine-preferring rats, and indifferent rats) were in fact due to the type of options sampled that were considered for analysis, as now better explained in the text (p7, lines 5-7). Regardless of the groups, sampling latencies for cocaine were longer than sampling latencies for saccharin. In Figure 3 (now Figure 4), this difference between options appears as a difference between groups because for the purpose of our analysis, we only compare the sampling and choice latencies of the option that is preferred (saccharin for saccharin-preferring rats, cocaine for cocaine-preferring rats) or chosen (saccharin or cocaine in indifferent rats) during choice trials. The reason why sampling latencies for cocaine are longer than sampling latencies for saccharin has not been elucidated yet. To paraphrase Newton, we “feign no hypotheses” here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The major issue with this manuscript is whether the differences between response latencies in the sample versus choice phases plausibly reflect operation of different decision making mechanisms (race model versus deliberative processing) or different operation of the same decision-making mechanism. The answer is difficult to derive from the data and modelling provided. The authors frame the differences in response time as being uniquely predicted or explained by different forms of choice. The models that the authors are using are closely linked to, and intellectually derived from, models of human choice reaction time. The most successful of these models are the diffusion model (DDM) (Ratcliff, R., Smith, P.L., Brown, S.D., and McKoon, G. (2016). Diffusion Decision Model: Current Issues and History. Trends in Cognitive Sciences 20, 260-281) and the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) (Brown, S.D., and Heathcote, A. (2008). The simplest complete model of choice response time: linear ballistic accumulation. Cognitive Psychology 57, 153-178.2008).</p><p>Even though the DDM and LBA adopt different architectures to each other (but the same architectures as those in Supp Figure 1A), they are intended to explain the same data. Of relevance, the same model (a DDM or an LBA) can explain differences in both the response distribution and the mean response time via changes in the starting point of evidence accumulation, rate of evidence accumulation, and/or the boundary or threshold at which evidence is translated into choice behavior.

We agree with the reviewer that our analysis falls short of addressing this question, but we feel that it is beyond the scope of our study. In fact, the sequential choice model is oblivious to the decision-making mechanisms underlying the selection of a particular option. However, as suggested by the reviewer, we now raise this question in the Discussion and discuss in some details how the diffusion and linear ballistic accumulator models could help to tackle it (p11 lines 12-30). We also acknowledge the limitations of the action-habit dichotomy and, thus, discuss the possibility of a gradient between action and habit that may involve a single decision-making mechanism with a change in underlying operations (p11, lines 12-30).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The third, marginally more difficult but more interesting option, would be to explore these issues formally and to move beyond simple descriptive or LDA analyses of response time distributions.

When preference was insensitive to devaluation of the nondrug reward, choice and sampling latencies were similar, whereas a lengthening of choice latencies compared to sampling latencies was observed when preference became sensitive to devaluation after repeated devaluation training. These results confirm our model and have now been included in the manuscript with an additional main figure (Figure 5) and a supplemental figure (Supplemental Figure 2).</p><p>Analysis of correlation between sensitivity to devaluation and the difference score between sampling and choice latencies did not provide consistent results in the different stages and experiments.

In fact, response latencies for cocaine remain longer than response latencies for saccharin even in rats that receive largely more operant practice with cocaine than with saccharin before choice testing (see Lenoir et al. 2007; see also, our response to comment 1 above). We agree, however, with the reviewer that our conclusions would benefit from an independent confirmation of our model in a choice situation between two nondrug rewards.

Thus, the stated aim of our study, consisting in determining the decision-making mechanisms (habit, goal-directed, SCM) underlying choice between a drug and a nondrug reward is addressed. We now report additional analysis of two independent experiments assessing preference sensitivity to devaluation that further supports our main conclusions (see response to comment 3). We also acknowledge the value of additional research in a choice situation involving two nondrug rewards (see our response to comment 4). However, our main goal here was to investigate decision-making mechanisms underlying choice between drug and nondrug rewards. Indeed, it remains difficult to determine whether preference for the drug is also under habitual control, mainly because there is no effective method of drug reward devaluation in animals, particularly for drugs administered intravenously. Thus, our study provides an alternative approach to drug devaluation to infer the goal-directed versus habitual nature of choice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
