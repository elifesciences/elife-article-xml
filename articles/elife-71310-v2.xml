associated with inflammation and fibrosis, <italic>albeit</italic> without complete understanding of underlying mechanism. Using two different genetic mouse knockouts of β-catenin, one with β-catenin loss is hepatocytes and BECs (KO1), and another with loss in only hepatocytes (KO2), we demonstrate disparate long-term repair after an initial injury by 2-week choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet. KO2 show gradual liver repopulation with BEC-derived β-catenin-positive hepatocytes and resolution of injury. KO1 showed persistent loss of β-catenin, NF-κB activation in BECs, progressive DR and fibrosis, reminiscent of CF histology. We identify interactions of β-catenin, NFκB, and CF transmembranous conductance regulator (CFTR) in BECs. Loss of CFTR or β-catenin led to NF-κB activation, DR, and inflammation. Thus, we report a novel β-catenin-NFκB-CFTR interactome in BECs, and its disruption may contribute to hepatic pathology of CF.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The liver has an incredible capacity to repair itself or ‘regenerate’ – that is, it has the ability to replace damaged tissue with new tissue. In order to do this, the organ relies on hepatocytes (the cells that form the liver) and bile duct cells (the cells that form the biliary ducts) dividing and transforming into each other to repair and replace damaged tissue, in case the insult is dire.</p><p>During long-lasting or chronic liver injury, bile duct cells undergo a process called ‘ductular reaction’, which causes the cells to multiply and produce proteins that stimulate inflammation, and can lead to liver scarring (fibrosis). Ductular reaction is a hallmark of severe liver disease, and different diseases exhibit ductular reactions with distinct features. For example, in cystic fibrosis, a unique type of ductular reaction occurs at late stages, accompanied by both inflammation and fibrosis. Despite the role that ductular reaction plays in liver disease, it is not well understood how it works at the molecular level.</p><p>Hu et al. set out to investigate how a protein called β-catenin – which can cause many types of cells to proliferate – is involved in ductular reaction. They used three types of mice for their experiments: wild-type mice, which were not genetically modified; and two strains of genetically modified mice. One of these mutant mice did not produce β-catenin in biliary duct cells, while the other lacked β-catenin both in biliary duct cells and in hepatocytes.</p><p>After a short liver injury – which Hu et al. caused by feeding the mice a specific diet – the wild-type mice were able to regenerate and repair the liver without exhibiting any ductular reaction. The mutant mice that lacked β-catenin in hepatocytes showed a temporary ductular reaction, and ultimately repaired their livers by turning bile duct cells into hepatocytes. On the other hand, the mutant mice lacking β-catenin in both hepatocytes and bile duct cells displayed sustained ductular reactions, inflammation and fibrosis, which looked like that seen in patients with liver disease associated to cystic fibrosis. Further probing showed that β-catenin interacts with a protein called CTFR, which is involved in cystic fibrosis. When bile duct cells lack either of these proteins, another protein called NF-B gets activated, which causes the ductular reaction, leading to inflammation and fibrosis.</p><p>The findings of Hu et al. shed light on the role of β-catenin in ductular reaction. Further, the results show a previously unknown interaction between β-catenin, CTFR and NF-B, which could lead to better treatments for cystic fibrosis in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ductular reaction</kwd><kwd>beta-catenin</kwd><kwd>NF-κB </kwd><kwd>cystic fibrosis</kwd><kwd>cholangiocytes</kwd><kwd>liver fibrosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01DK62277 1R01DK100287 1R01DK116993 R01CA204586 1R01CA251155-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>P Monga</surname><given-names>Satdarshan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01CA258449</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ko</surname><given-names>Sungjin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32EB0010216 1F31DK115017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Jacquelyn O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30DK120531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>P Monga</surname><given-names>Satdarshan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ductular reaction often observed in chronic liver pathologies such as in cystic fibrosis could be due to disruption of a novel complex of β-catenin-NF-κB and CFTR in cholangiocytes, which leads to persistent nuclear translocation of p65 and NF-κB activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The liver possesses unique regenerative potential. During chronic liver injury, however, liver fibrosis accompanies regeneration and can progress to cirrhosis, which can then progress to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) or hepatocellular cancer (HCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pellicoro et al., 2014</xref>). Currently, cirrhosis is the 11th leading cause of death globally, and the incidence of liver disease continues to rise as conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease continue to prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asrani et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, there has been great interest in studying mechanisms of injury, inflammation, and fibrosis during liver injury in order to effectively develop novel therapies. The role of hepatic epithelial cells (referred henceforth as ‘hepithelial’ cells), which include both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes or biliary epithelial cells (BECs), in regulating microenvironment is beginning to be appreciated. Loss of hepatocyte differentiation in chronic liver diseases and ESLD, either due to much needed hepithelial proliferation for repair, or as an adaptation to escape injury, seems to contribute to not only loss of key hepatic functions, but is also causally associated with increased immune response and hepatic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Argemi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishikawa, 2015</xref>). However, how hepithelial cells may modulate hepatic immune microenvironment is unclear.</p><p>As an important hepithelial cell type, BECs are known to undergo proliferation to replace dying BECs in cholangiopathies or cystic liver diseases, as well as can under phenotypic switch to generate de novo hepatocytes when hepatocytes are chronically injured and/or are unable to optimally proliferate, phenomena termed as ductular reaction (DR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sato et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson and Rudnick, 2019</xref>). Reactive ductules, however, can secrete pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines to induce inflammation, activate myofibroblasts, and induce fibrosis. The extent of DR correlates with fibrosis in many types of liver injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richardson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). The molecular underpinnings of reactive DR are incompletely understood although molecules like Yes-associated protein-1 (YAP1) have been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Planas-Paz, 2019</xref>).</p><p>β-Catenin, the major downstream effector of the Wnt signaling, is a well-known mediator of hepatocyte proliferation. Liver-specific (hepatocyte and BECs) β-catenin knockout (KO1) mice generated by breeding β-catenin-floxed and albumin-cre mice show delayed liver regeneration (LR) after partial hepatectomy or after toxicant-induced liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apte, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tan et al., 2006</xref>). When KO1 were administered choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet, it triggered greater steatosis, cell death, DR, inflammation, and fibrosis than wild-type (WT1), and upon switching to normal diet for 2 weeks for recovery, continued to show greater injury due to an impairment of hepatocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhurst, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russell, 2019</xref>). Similar greater injury, fibrosis, and DR were observed in CDE-fed hepatocyte-only β-catenin KO (KO2), generated by delivering adeno-associated virus serotype 8 carrying a plasmid encoding <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase under a hepatocyte-specific thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) promoter (AAV8-TBG-Cre) into the β-catenin-floxed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russell, 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, labeling BECs for fate-tracing showed the liver repair to occur through BEC-to-hepatocyte transdifferentiation upon recovery for 2 weeks and up to 6 months on normal diet, although long-term impact on injury resolution, inflammation, DR, and fibrosis was not studied in either model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russell, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we investigate hepatic injury and repair in KO2 and KO1 mice challenged for 2 weeks with CDE diet and allowed to recover on normal diet for 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Intriguingly, we observed highly divergent injury-repair responses in the two models. KO2 mice showed progressive repair through expansion of BEC-derived β-catenin-positive hepatocytes and resolution of inflammation, DR, and fibrosis. However, KO1 display progressive and peculiar DR composed of numerous small luminal structures lined by a single layer of BECs, even after being on normal diet for 6 months, which is associated with fibrosis and inflammation, and is reminiscent of cystic fibrosis (CF)-like morphology. We identify a unique interactome of β-catenin, p65 subunit of NF-κB and cystic fibrosis transmembranous conductance regulator (CFTR) in BECs and show perturbations in these interactions, leading to excessive NF-κB activation and inflammation in BECs in both KO1 and CF patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Long-term follow-up of mice lacking β-catenin in hepatocytes only (KO2) shows delayed but eventual resolution of fibrosis and DR after initial 2-week CDE diet</title><p>We previously showed CDE diet for 2 weeks led to enhanced injury, fibrosis, and DR in mice lacking β-catenin in hepatocytes only (KO2), generated by delivering AAV8-TBG-Cre into <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Rosa-stop<sup>flox/flox</sup>-EYFP</italic> mice, as compared to WT2 mice, generated by injecting AAV8-TBG-Cre into <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>+/+</sup>; Rosa-stop<sup>flox/flox</sup>-EYFP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russell, 2019</xref>).

To specifically investigate durability of repair especially after the increased injury observed in the KO2 mice at 2 weeks of CDE diet, we fed CDE diet to KO2 and WT2 mice for 2 weeks and switched to normal diet for 2 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). KO2 mice had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin (BR) levels than WT2 at 2 weeks of CDE diet, but returned to normal at 2 weeks onwards after switching to normal diet, similar to WT2, although BR levels tended to be higher in KO2 up to 3 months of recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To further verify presence of β-catenin-p65 complex in BECs in vivo, we examined β-catenin and p65 localization using confocal microscopy.

At the same time, DR can induce fibrosis by secreting pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic factors to contribute to the disease process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richardson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Bravo, 2019</xref>). What drives the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic phenotype of these reactive BECs and what reverts these cells back to normal is poorly understood.</p><p>Previously, we and others have described β-catenin-p65 complex in hepatocytes, breast and colon cancer cells, which could inhibit NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nejak-Bowen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng, 2002</xref>). Indeed, being a ‘sticky’ protein, β-catenin interacts with many proteins in a cell to modulate their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Russell and Monga, 2017</xref>). The exact biological significance of β-catenin-p65 interaction is not well understood and likely context dependent. We identify the existence of this complex in normal BECs. We show β-catenin-p65 complex to be present in the cytoplasm in the BECs to prevent nuclear translocation and activation of p65 and in turn keep NF-κB activity in check. While knockdown of β-catenin in BECs in vitro led to some baseline nuclear translocation, it allowed more profound nuclear translocation and activation of p65 in the presence of LPS, a well-known NF-κB activator. Conversely, β-catenin stabilization in BECs dampened NF-κB activation basally or in the presence of LPS. β-Catenin activation is observed in BECs within the DR during chronic liver injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okabe, 2016</xref>). However, unlike in hepatocytes, β-catenin activation in BECs does not play a role in their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okabe, 2016</xref>). Our current study shows that β-catenin stabilization in BECs may in fact be ‘mopping’ up p65 to dampen and eventually shutoff NF-κB activation, reverting BECs to their quiescence. NF-κB activation has been shown to be important in BEC proliferation and DR by regulating Jagged/Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2015a</xref>). And NF-κB in BECs has been suggested to play a role in inducing pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic milieu as well through regulating expression of many of its target genes including <italic>Ccl2</italic> and <italic>Cxcl5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O’Hara et al., 2013</xref>). In summary, absence of β-catenin in BECs as seen in KO1 prevents β-catenin-p65 complex formation, leading to sustained NF-κB activation after injury, whereas this complex reforms in KO2 especially due to known β-catenin increase in BECs after injury, thus preventing chronic NF-κB activation. Molecular underpinnings of β-catenin stabilization in BECs especially during cholestatic liver injuries remain under investigation, although portal fibroblasts, macrophages, hepatocytes, and BECs have all been shown to secrete ligands like Wnt7a, Wnt7b, Wnt10a, and Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilson, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Another intriguing observation was the distinct morphology of DR evident in the recovery phase from the CDE injury in β-catenin-deficient livers, which was reminiscent of the histology of the CF cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakiani et al., 2019</xref>). Surprisingly, very few BECs in AH showed nuclear p65, while PLD cases showed variable but increased nuclear p65 in cells lining the cysts. However, DR in CF cases exhibited strongest and consistent nuclear p65. This led us to investigate interactions between β-catenin-p65 and CFTR, whose gene is mutated in CF. CFTR protein is present in BECs only in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohn et al., 1993</xref>). We observed a pulldown of CFTR (B-band and C-band) with β-catenin in a BEC line. To mimic LOF, which is the common end result of <italic>CFTR</italic> mutations in CF patients, we silenced <italic>CFTR</italic> in SMCC line, which led to a profound p65 activation that was decreased upon β-catenin stabilization. This suggests an important tripartite regulatory interaction between these proteins. Interestingly, in human lung epithelial cells, a proteomic screen identified interaction of β-catenin with WT CFTR but not with ∆F508 CFTR, a major site of LOF mutation in the <italic>CFTR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pankow, 2015</xref>). Additionally, in mouse intestine, CFTR was shown to stabilize β-catenin and prevent its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). The same study showed that ∆F508 CFTR is unable to interact with β-catenin, leading to β-catenin degradation and eventually resulting in activation of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascade. Our results show an existence of a tripartite interaction between β-catenin, p65, and CFTR in cholangiocytes. LOF of CFTR or its reduced levels led to decrease in β-catenin protein in BECs both in vitro (SMCC) and in vivo (CF patient liver lysate), leading to nuclear translocation of p65, NF-κB activation, and increased expression of its pro-inflammatory chemokine targets. Absence of β-catenin in BECs however did not alter CFTR levels, suggesting CFTR to upstream effector of β-catenin while not being dependent on β-catenin for its own stability. We believe that the classical pathology of liver disease in CF including periductal inflammation, DR, periportal fibrosis, and focal biliary cirrhosis may be explained by our observations, in addition to previously described mechanisms such as Rous sarcoma oncogene cellular homolog (Src)-dependent Toll-like receptor-4 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiorotto, 2016</xref>). Since β-catenin activation in BECs inhibited NF-κB activation occurring due to CFTR silencing, this strategy may have therapeutic implications in controlling CF disease progression in the liver and elsewhere and future studies will directly address this novelty. NF-κB activation has been shown to be important in BEC proliferation and DR by regulating Jagged/Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2015a</xref>). The same study showed NF-κB activation to be regulated by cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61), whose knockdown reduced DR. Incidentally, <italic>CFTR</italic> was also significantly reduced in that study and might have been a mechanism of DR through disruption of CTFR-p65-β-catenin interactions. The mechanism of NF-κB activation and whether these tripartite interactions are playing any role in other pathologies such as PLD or subset of AH cases requires further investigation.</p><p>There is very little understanding of the process of resolution of DR along with its associated fibrosis, although these are strongly linked to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ko et al., 2019</xref>). Our study provides novel insight into not only the molecular underpinnings of a reactive cholangiocyte, but also sheds light on how BECs regulate the immune microenvironment. Levels of Timp1 correlate with fibrosis, and several groups have investigated the use of TIMP1 levels as a biomarker for fibrosis in hepatitis C patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leroy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boeker et al., 2002</xref>). Mice with overexpression of TIMP1 developed dramatically more fibrosis after CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoshiji, 2000</xref>), and TIMP1 transgenic mice showed impaired fibrosis resolution after cessation of CCl<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshiji, 2002</xref>). Our data is consistent since expression of <italic>Timp1</italic> was associated with fibrosis, and levels of <italic>Timp1</italic> normalized upon resolution of fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animals are housed in temperature and light-controlled facilities and are maintained in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Animal Welfare Act.

They make the interesting observation that the loss of β-Catenin in both binary epithelial cells and hepatocytes results in persistent inflammation and fibrosis with persistent activation of NFκB, wheres the loss in just hepatocytes results in healing. This pathology was reminiscent of liver damage seen in cystic fibrosis leading the group to identify an interaction with CFTR. These studies will encourage others to explore the relative contributions of biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes in liver injury and repair.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;β-Catenin-NFκB-CFTR interactions in cholangiocytes regulate inflammation and fibrosis during ductular reaction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Paul Noble as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Xin Chen (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The IHC images of β-Catenin in Figures 1C and 3C are very hard to interpret. A higher resolution images or inset images will be highly helpful.</p><p>2. Also, what happens to GS IHC in the two mouse Ctnnb1 KO model?</p><p>3. It would be helpful to quantify CD45(+) cells in Figures 5A and 5B.</p><p>4. For Figure7, does bCatenin and P65 interaction occur in cytoplasm or nuclear in BECs? Please clarify.</p><p>5. Sup. 1A showing that PanCK(+) cells are proliferating is very important. However, the staining is not entirely convincing (maybe due to the low resolution) that those PCNA(+) cells are also PanCK(+) (seem to be the adjacent cells are positive for PCNA). Perhaps better images or additional DR markers will be helpful.</p><p>6. In the introduction, the author mentioned that YAP has been implicated in DR. What happens to YAP in these Ctnnb1 KO liver samples? Some studies or discussion would be helpful.</p><p>7. Most of the experimental groups for KO mice analyzed only n=3 or 4, which caused a big variation and reduced statistical power. This point should be improved throughout the study.</p><p>8. Figure 2A,B examined fibrosis. Sirius red staining showed fibrosis is similar degrees in WT2 and KO2 mice 2 weeks after recovery and more fibrosis in KO2 3 months after recovery.

Also, the study suggests b-catenin and NF-κB activation may have significant roles in CF livers. First, the study compared the recovery patterns from CDE-induced chronic liver injury in mice deficient in b-catenin in hepithelial cells and in hepatocytes only. The study found b-catenin activity is crucial for the recovery of chronic liver inflammation, fibrosis, and DR. The authors found reduced activity of b-catenin is associated with prolonged NF-κB activation in BECs. The authors also found that CF patient livers had reduced b-catenin expression and NF-κB activity, and that b-catenin, NF-κB, and CFTR form the complex and regulate NF-κB activity in BECs. Overall, the study should be of interest to the researchers who investigate liver regeneration, its relation to BEC biology, and cystic fibrosis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1.

These mice were challenged for 2w with choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet and allowed to recover on normal diet for 2w, 3m and 6m. KO2 show gradual liver repopulation with biliary epithelial cell-derived β-catenin-positive hepatocytes, and resolution of injury. KO1 showed persistent loss of β-catenin, NF-κB activation in biliary epithelial cells, progressive ductular reaction and fibrosis. They identified interactions of β-catenin, NF-κB and CFTR in biliary epithelial cells. Loss of CFTR or β-catenin led to NF-κB activation, ductular reaction and inflammation.

For Figure7, does bCatenin and P65 interaction occur in cytoplasm or nuclear in BECs? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on colocalization studies using immunofluorescence (now supplementary figure 9F), most of the interaction of β-catenin and p65 occurs in the cytoplasm of the BECs in vivo. in vitro data in SMCCc shows that most β-catenin and p65 are located in cytoplasmic compartment (Figure 7C). Upon β-catenin knockdown, there is a modest increase in nuclear p65 levels and activity, which is more pronounced following LPS treatment. This data also supports that β-catenin-p65 binding occurs in cytoplasm at baseline which prevents nuclear translocation of p65 spontaneously or after treatment with LPS. We have better clarified this in both results and discussion</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Sup. 1A showing that PanCK(+) cells are proliferating is very important.

In the introduction, the author mentioned that YAP has been implicated in DR. What happens to YAP in these Ctnnb1 KO liver samples? Some studies or discussion would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>YAP1 is seen mostly in biliary epithelial cells in an adult liver and contributes to their survival and proliferation. Its deletion from cholangiocytes disrupts homeostasis leading to bile duct paucity and cholestatic injury. Since there is increased DR in KO1 at 3 and 6 months of recovery from CDE, YAP1 levels are expected to increase simply due to their expression in these cells. Indeed we see increased YAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) in DR in KO1. However, whether this increase in YAP1 in DR is contributing to the disease pathogenesis in our model requires additional studies such as generation of conditional KO of YAP1 along with β-catenin, which is out of scope of the current study.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71310-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Most of the experimental groups for KO mice analyzed only n=3 or 4, which caused a big variation and reduced statistical power. This point should be improved throughout the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our study uses n≥3 mice for control and KO groups and at various time points. This is chiefly due to allocation of the minimal numbers of mice to multiple time points for analysis that still allow us to perform statistics and allow some generalizable conclusions. During COVID-19 pandemic, there were additional restrictions placed on how many mice we were allowed to keep. Additionally, we believe that the variability seen in RT-PCR analysis is most likely due to diversity in cell composition of randomly selected liver pieces that could have varying degree of ductular reaction etc. We have been careful to not over-interpret results. We have been transparent about all significant and insignificant differences in various markers and mentioned trends versus significance, where applicable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 2A,B examined fibrosis. Sirius red staining showed fibrosis is similar degrees in WT2 and KO2 mice 2 weeks after recovery and more fibrosis in KO2 3 months after recovery. The pictures are inconsistent with the quantification shown in Figure 2B.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. While we were careful to include the representative images, we have now replaced these images with better quality 100x images. We do observe a clear difference in Sirius Red staining (Red color) in KO2 as compared to WT2 at the time-points indicated as was assessed by densitometry for Sirius red staining. All statistics were done using one way ANOVA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 2C examined the expression of fibrogenic genes, Col1a1 and TGFb2.

Eventually though, at 6 months, our key time point of concern, the fibrosis has subsided in KO2, and comparable to WT2. The possible reason for the variability in expression of genes within biological replicates is likely due to diversity in cell composition of randomly selected liver pieces for RT-PCR. One way ANOVA, which is more stringent than unpaired T test was used for significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 2D showed DR in WT2 and KO2 during the recovery.

There is decrease in hepatocyte proliferation in KO2 following CDE injury and recovery due to lack of β-catenin, but as cholangiocyte-derived hepatocytes appear, they show more profound proliferation and gradually repopulate the KO2 liver. We have quantified IHC for panCK for DR for both figure 2D and 4D and data is presented as supplemental figure S3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Figure 2F showed Timp1 expression for understanding matrix degradation.

Hence a comprehensive analysis of all MMPs might not be feasible. We assessed MMP9 and MMP13 on the available whole liver RNA and data is presented in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) .

The images in figure 4A for WT1 have now been replaced by more representative images. The reviewer is also correct and WT1 and WT2 showed comparable but low fibrosis after CDE injury. The KO1 also continue to show higher fibrosis than controls at all time points and do not show any decrease in fibrosis at 2 weeks of recovery. A better image has been included and text has been corrected. The Sirius red quantification in figure 4B is indeed correct. However, the collagen data, like mentioned previously, shows higher trends of expression which did not achieved significance as assessed by one way ANOVA. This is likely due to variability of DR observed in pieces of tissue used for RNA isolation and RT-PCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. In Figure 6, the authors assessed NF-κBp65 nuclear translocation mainly in CK19 positive cells. Also, in the text, the authors mentioned &quot;NF-κB, the master regulator of immune cell response.&quot; Is NF-κB activation in CK19 positive cells related to immune cell infiltration that the study showed in Figure 5. If so, how? There is a gap between immune cell infiltration and NF-κB activation in BECs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point. We show using in vivo data first that absence of β-catenin in BECs led to increased nuclear p65 which was associated with increase expression of chemokines (Figure 6D and FigS8). However, since whole livers were used, we wanted to verify if this was also occurring in isolated BECs. For this we used SM-CC cells and upon β-catenin knockdown, showed increased p65 reporter activity along with increased nuclear p65. There was simultaneous increase in expression of similar chemokines like <italic>CCl2</italic> and <italic>Cxcl5</italic> that are known drivers of inflammation. Simultaneously we see increased CD45 positive cells in KO1 in periportal region where p65 is observed in reactive cholangiocytes. KO2 have no inflammation and no nuclear p65 in cholangiocytes. Taken together, NF-κB in cholangiocytes through expression of chemokines, is likely the driver of inflammation. We apologize for not making this clear but have now added clarity to this end in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14.

If the study suggests the interaction of b-catenin and NF-κB with CFTR, KO1 could have altered CFTR expression and some phenotypes related to CFTR inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. What we are proposing is that loss of function mutations in CFTR leads to its inability to bind β-catenin in BECs which leads to its destabilization. The ensuing decrease in β-catenin protein allows for p65 to get activated more readily in the presence of cytokines to lead to NF-κB activation and downstream signaling. We do not believe that β-catenin loss impacts CFTR levels although we are unsure if that impacts CFTR function which needs to be investigated in the future. Since CFTR is expressed in BECs only, we used whole tissue lysate from WT1 and KO1 at baseline and at 6m recovery to test any changes in total CFTR levels. We did not find any changes in total levels of CFTR protein.

Insignificant changes between these two genotypes in serum levels of ALT were observed. Intriguingly, there were a subset of KO2 mice maintained on normal diet and without any previous CDE diet induced injury, that showed higher levels of total bilirubin. These changes were insignificant as assessed by one way ANOVA. It is important to mention that KO2 fed CDE diet for 2 weeks and followed on normal diet for various times, begin to show repopulation of these livers by BEC-derived β-catenin-positive hepatocytes such that KO2 are no longer KOs.
