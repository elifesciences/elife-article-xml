Currently approved BTK inhibitors, including Ibrutinib, a first-in-class covalent inhibitor of BTK, bind directly to the kinase active site. While effective at blocking the catalytic activity of BTK, consequences of drug binding on the global conformation of full-length BTK are unknown. Here, we uncover a range of conformational effects in full-length BTK induced by a panel of active site inhibitors, including large-scale shifts in the conformational equilibria of the regulatory domains. Additionally, we find that a remote Ibrutinib resistance mutation, T316A in the BTK SH2 domain, drives spurious BTK activity by destabilizing the compact autoinhibitory conformation of full-length BTK, shifting the conformational ensemble away from the autoinhibited form. Future development of BTK inhibitors will need to consider long-range allosteric consequences of inhibitor binding, including the emerging application of these BTK inhibitors in treating COVID-19.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Treatments for blood cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, rely heavily on chemotherapy, using drugs that target a vulnerable aspect of the cancer cells. B-cells, a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies, require a protein called Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, or BTK for short, to survive. The drug ibrutinib (Imbruvica) is used to treat B-cell cancers by blocking BTK. The BTK protein consists of several regions. One of them, known as the kinase domain, is responsible for its activity as an enzyme (which allows it to modify other proteins by adding a ‘tag’ known as a phosphate group). The other regions of BTK, known as regulatory modules, control this activity. In BTK’s inactive form, the regulatory modules attach to the kinase domain, blocking the regulatory modules from interacting with other proteins. When BTK is activated, it changes its conformation so the regulatory regions detach and become available for interactions with other proteins, at the same time exposing the active kinase domain.</p><p>Ibrutinib and other BTK drugs in development bind to the kinase domain to block its activity. However, it is not known how this binding affects the regulatory modules. Previous efforts to study how drugs bind to BTK have used a version of the protein that only had the kinase domain, instead of the full-length protein.</p><p>Now, Joseph et al. have studied full-length BTK and how it binds to five different drugs. The results reveal that ibrutinib and another drug called dasatinib both indirectly disrupt the normal position of the regulatory domains pushing BTK toward a conformation that resembles the activated state. By contrast, the three other compounds studied do not affect the inactive structure. Joseph et al. also examined a mutation in BTK that confers resistance against ibrutinib. This mutation increases the activity of BTK by disrupting the inactive structure, leading to B cells surviving better.</p><p>Understanding how drug resistance mechanisms can work will lead to better drug treatment strategies for cancer. BTK is also a target in other diseases such as allergies or asthma and even COVID-19. If interactions between partner proteins and the regulatory domain are important in these diseases, then they may be better treated with drugs that maintain the regulatory modules in their inactive state. This research will help to design drugs that are better able to control BTK activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bruton tyrosine kinase</kwd><kwd>kinase inhibitor</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>nuclear magnetic resonance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI43957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andreotti</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first-in-class kinase inhibitor, Ibrutinib, destabilizes its autoinhibited Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) target, and a remote resistance mutation causes global structural changes that activate BTK catalytic activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the TEC family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rawlings and Witte, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2005</xref>). BTK is expressed primarily in B cells and myeloid cells, where it functions downstream of receptors including the B-cell receptor, Fc receptors, and toll-like receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurosaki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">López-Herrera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hartkamp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellmeier et al., 2011</xref>). B-cell receptor engagement leads to BTK activation (via phosphorylation on Y551 in the activation loop), which results in the direct phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2) triggering calcium flux and subsequent regulation of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurosaki, 2011</xref>). In addition to the clear role of the BTK catalytic domain in activating PLCγ2, the N-terminal regulatory domains of BTK, which include the Pleckstrin homology and Tec homology (PHTH) domain, a proline-rich region (PRR), a SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), mediate autoinhibitory and activating interactions that control BTK function. Indeed, both kinase-dependent and independent activities of BTK have been shown to contribute to proper signaling downstream of immune receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halcomb et al., 2007</xref>). Previous work has established that the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains of BTK assemble into a compact autoinhibitory conformation on the ‘distal’ surface of the kinase domain, similar to the autoinhibited SRC kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

Upon receptor-mediated activation, the regulatory domains of BTK bind their activating ligands, which releases the catalytic domain from its intramolecular interactions, thereby permitting activation loop phosphorylation and a conformational shift of the catalytic machinery from the inactive to active state.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain organization of full-length Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and Ibrutinib binding site.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The BTK fragments used in this study are shown with key residues indicated above each domain.

Ibrutinib is an irreversible ATP-competitive inhibitor that binds covalently to BTK C481 within the kinase active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). This small molecule is the first BTK-specific inhibitor to be approved by the FDA and has become the frontline drug in efforts to control a variety of B-cell disorders.

Ibrutinib is currently approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) ,and chronic graft versus host disease and is in various stages of clinical trials for the treatment of other B-cell disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davids and Brown, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Molica et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Treon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aw and Brown, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). More selective, second-generation BTK inhibitors, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), have since received FDA approval bringing the total number of approved therapies that target BTK to three. Recent findings demonstrate a possible role for the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib in treating excessive inflammation in the context of severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roschewski et al., 2020</xref>). Off-label use of acalabrutinib for hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed normalization of inflammatory markers and decreased oxygen requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roschewski et al., 2020</xref>). Development of reversible BTK inhibitors has also progressed with a number of candidates in clinical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2016</xref>). To date, all BTK inhibitors currently being used or in clinal trials are active site inhibitors.</p><p>Despite the success of Ibrutinib in the clinic, drug resistance is a major ongoing challenge. Based on previous kinase-targeted therapies, it has become clear that acquisition of drug resistance occurs via a variety of mechanisms including loss of drug binding, activation of the kinase, or the activation of downstream substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lovly and Shaw, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sherbenou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yun et al., 2008</xref>). Of the Ibrutinib resistance mutations that have been identified in BTK, all except one (T316A) cluster to the BTK active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puła et al., 2019</xref>). The most prevalent mutation occurs at BTK C481, the residue in the kinase active site that covalently binds to Ibrutinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lampson and Brown, 2018</xref>). The BTK C481S mutation and other kinase active site Ibrutinib resistance mutations are thought to interfere with stable Ibrutinib binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Woyach et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the BTK T316A mutation occurs in the BTK SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and is the only Ibrutinib resistance mutation that has been identified to date outside of the BTK kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kadri et al., 2017</xref>). The mechanism by which the remote T316A mutation confers Ibrutinib resistance is currently unknown.</p><p>Although an abundance of data including pharmacology, associated toxicities, metabolic processing, clearance, potency, and efficacy are available for the full-length BTK protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Molica et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Owen et al., 2019</xref>), the major molecular-level insights provided by high-resolution BTK:drug complex crystal structures are limited to the kinase domain fragment of BTK with drug bound to the active site cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuglstatter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xing and Huang, 2014</xref>). Structural consequences of drug binding to the full-length BTK protein have remained unexplored. Importantly, work from other kinase systems have shown that drug binding to the kinase active site can block catalytic activity as expected but can also have unanticipated and important long-range allosteric effects that impact protein/ligand interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sonti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leonard et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To expand our mechanistic understanding of drug resistance and the effect of different inhibitors on the full-length BTK protein, we developed solution-based Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) tools to probe local and long-range conformational consequences of resistance mutation and drug occupancy in the BTK active site. A panel of five BTK inhibitors, Ibrutinib, GDC-0853 (Fenebrutinib), CGI1746, CC-292 (Spebrutinib, AVL-292), and Dasatinib, was assembled based on availability of crystallographic data and commercial availability of each drug. Additionally, drug choices were prioritized to represent a range of kinase structures (activation loop ‘in’ versus ‘out’, αC-helix ‘in’ versus ‘out’) and different inhibitor binding modes (covalent versus non-covalent). All inhibitors in this study, except Dasatinib, have been developed as BTK-specific inhibitors.</p><p>Our findings provide the first molecular insights into the conformational response of full-length BTK toward a spectrum of small-molecule active-site inhibitors. The inhibitors fall into two categories, differentiated by the presence or absence of an inhibitor-induced effect on the regulatory regions distant from the active site. We find that Ibrutinib and Dasatinib have profound effects on the entire BTK protein that extend beyond the active site. In contrast, GDC-0853, CGI1746, and CC-292 do not alter the conformational state of the regulatory domains. Additionally, we explore the mechanism of action of the T316A resistance mutation. This single remote amino acid mutation destabilizes the autoinhibited conformation of full-length BTK. We propose that an increase in the population of active enzyme contributes to the decreased Ibrutinib sensitivity observed in vivo. Taken together, these data provide a framework for developing new strategies to target BTK in the face of acquired drug resistance and reveal significant differences in the overall conformational preferences of full-length BTK bound to distinct small molecule inhibitors. We anticipate that further development of BTK inhibitors will rely on such information to fully understand, and ultimately control, the consequences of drug interactions within the full-length BTK protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ibrutinib binding to BTK kinase domain shifts the conformational equilibrium to the inactive conformation</title><p>A conserved structural switch in the αC-helix of protein kinases plays a crucial role in controlling catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). The conformational equilibrium between an inactive and active kinase domain involves a switch in the αC-helix between an ‘αC-out’ and ‘αC-in’ conformation, respectively, which in turn either breaks or creates a salt bridge between a conserved Lys/Glu pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Crystal structures of active and inactive BTK kinase domain show that the conformational shift in αC is accompanied by a change in the rotamer conformation of the BTK W395 sidechain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We have established use of the BTK W395 side chain indole NH resonance to monitor the conformational preference of the BTK kinase domain by solution NMR methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). The upfield W395 resonance was previously assigned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>) to the inactive, αC-out conformation and in the full-length apo BTK protein this resonance is in slow exchange with the downfield resonance corresponding to the active, αC-in kinase domain conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This W395 resonance signature is consistent with previously established resonance frequencies of tryptophan indoles that are hydrogen bonded to water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fenwick et al., 2018</xref>). The ~0.2 ppm upfield shift observed for the W395 indole NH proton likely reflects weaker hydrogen bonding in the more nonpolar environment of the W395 indole NH in the αC-out conformation compared to αC-in rather than a complete removal of the bound water, which is characterized by a &gt; 2 ppm upfield shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fenwick et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>W395 indole NH resonance reports on the conformation of BTK.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Close-up of the structural differences surrounding the αC helix, W395, and the Lys/Glu salt bridge for structures of the active Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) kinase domain conformation (PDB ID: 3K54) and the inactive BTK kinase domain conformation (PDB ID: 5P9J). W395 and the αC helix are labeled depicted in yellow while the Lys/Glu sides chains are shown in cyan (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

The W395 indole NH resonance in the apo BTK LKD is in the downfield position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, top spectrum) showing that the LKD fragment, in the absence of Ibrutinib, adopts the active or αC-in conformation in solution consistent with activity assay results reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joseph et al., 2007</xref>). Titration of Ibrutinib into BTK LKD shows an increase in the intensity of the W395 peak in the upfield position, and a corresponding decrease in the intensity of the W395 peak in the downfield position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This is consistent with a conformational change in solution from the αC-in to the αC-out state observed in the crystal structure of the kinase:Ibrutinib complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In fact, at a 1:1 molar ratio of protein to drug, the BTK LKD almost exclusively populates the inactive conformation consistent with a single binding site for Ibrutinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). That the upfield resonance corresponds to W395 in Ibrutinib-bound BTK LKD was confirmed by acquisition of the same spectrum of the BTK W395A mutant bound to Ibrutinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>), full-length apo BTK (as compared to the BTK LKD) gives rise to more than one W395 resonance indicating exchange between αC-in and αC-out kinase domain conformations likely reflecting the increased conformational heterogeneity in the full-length protein due to the presence of the regulatory domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,iii</xref>). Ibrutinib binding to full-length BTK shifts the conformational equilibrium to the αC-out conformation as observed for Ibrutinib-bound LKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <italic>iv</italic>). The greater W395 upfield shift induced by Ibrutinib compared to apo full-length BTK (red versus gray dashed line) may be due to local chemical shift changes in the presence of Ibrutinib and/or further stabilization of the αC-out conformer.</p><p>Ibrutinib binding to full-length BTK also results in appearance of a new peak corresponding to the indole NH resonance of a different tryptophan, W251 in the SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <italic>iv</italic>, peak denoted with asterisk). This resonance is broadened beyond detection in the apo full-length BTK spectrum due to intermediate exchange and so its appearance upon addition of Ibrutinib suggests that dynamics in the SH3 domain region have been altered. We have previously found that the W251 indole resonance is also visible in spectra of BTK Y223A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>), a mutation that disrupts the autoinhibited conformation of BTK shifting the SH3 domain toward an unengaged state more similar to the isolated SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the appearance of the W251 resonance in the spectrum of Ibrutinib-bound full-length BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <italic>iv</italic>) suggests that drug binding to the kinase active site shifts the conformational preference of the regulatory SH3 domain away from its autoinhibitory contacts on the distal side of the kinase domain. This observation prompted further exploration of the consequences of other BTK active site inhibitors on full-length BTK to determine whether this is a shared feature of active site inhibition of BTK.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BTK active site inhibitors have different effects on the kinase domain conformation</title><p>Crystal structures of the BTK kinase domain have been solved in complex with different active site inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bender et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marcotte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Paolo et al., 2011</xref>).

However, unlike the Ibrutinib, GDC-0853, and CGI1746 complexes, the activation loop in the CC-292 crystal structure is not resolved, suggesting that this segment of the protein remains dynamic when bound to CC-292. Comparison of the tryptophan resonances for apo BTK LKD to BTK LKD bound to CC-292 shows the W395 indole NH resonance remains in the downfield position indicating that binding of CC-292 to the active site does not shift the conformational preference of the kinase domain in solution toward the αC-out state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

Dasatinib binding causes a further downfield shift in the <sup>1</sup>H resonance frequency of W395 suggesting that either binding of this drug increases the population of the αC-in conformation compared to apo BTK LKD or may be reflective of local chemical shift changes due to drug binding to the active site. Acquisition of separate <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY HSQC spectra for Ibrutinib, GDC-0853, CGI1746, CC-292, and Dasatinib bound to the BTK linker-kinase (W395A) mutant confirms the W395 assignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the conformational states of the BTK LKD complexed to the different drugs are similar for full-length BTK, we analyzed the corresponding NMR spectra of full-length BTK bound to each of the drug molecules. Binding of Ibrutinib, GDC-0853, and CGI1746 all shift the conformational equilibrium of the kinase domain in the full-length protein to the αC-out conformation in a manner that is nearly identical to drug binding to the shorter LKD fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Although the magnitude and direction of the chemical shift changes are the same for the fragment and full-length BTK, the inhibitor-bound W395 indole NH resonances in these full-length BTK complexes are more complex with multiple overlapping peaks likely reflecting conformational heterogeneity around the αC-out state of the multi-domain, full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>).</p><p>Despite its covalent binding to the active site, CC-292 bound to full-length BTK highlights the dynamic nature of the bound complex that is partially evident in the BTK:CC-292 crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY HSQC spectrum of full-length BTK bound to CC-292 gives rise to a range of W395 indole NH resonances corresponding to both the αC-in and αC-out states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). It is likely that the crystal structure of BTK LKD bound to CC-292 captured the lowest energy, inactive conformation, whereas solution NMR methods reveal the extent of conformational sampling of the CC-292/BTK complex.</p><p>And last, Dasatinib binding to full-length BTK leads to extensive line-broadening throughout the spectrum. The W395 resonance is no longer detected but other resonances remain visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The observed line-broadening likely reflects increased dynamics of the conformational ensemble upon Dasatinib binding to the active site. While distinctly different from one another, the BTK:Dasatinib and BTK:CC-292 complexes both exhibit increased dynamic motions in the kinase domain compared to BTK bound to Ibrutinib, GDC-0853, or CGI1746. To complement the NMR data (which reveals the conformational status of just the kinase domain), we next sought further details about the effects of drug binding on the regulatory domains within the full-length protein by subjecting the BTK:drug complexes to hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dramatic differences in full-length BTK:drug complexes revealed by HDX-MS</title><p>We have previously established that HDX-MS can be used to assess the conformational status of each domain in full-length BTK as the conformational equilibrium shifts between the ‘closed’ autoinhibited and the ‘open’ active states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). In solution, full-length BTK exists predominantly in the ‘closed’ autoinhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). BTK activating mutations that destabilize the autoinhibitory conformation result in an increase in deuterium uptake, compared to wild-type BTK, in peptides derived from the SH3, SH2, and SH2-kinase linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). Building on this approach, full-length BTK was mixed separately with either a twofold molar excess of Ibrutinib or a 10-fold molar excess of GDC-0853, CGI1746, CC-292, or Dasatinib and each sample was subjected to HDX-MS analysis. We compared the effects of each inhibitor on full-length BTK using a set of peptic peptides common among all six forms (apo and five inhibitor-bound states, the identities of this subset of peptides are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) which report on the conformational status of the regulatory domains and the kinase domain.</p><p>Inhibitor binding to full-length BTK causes clear effects on conformation and dynamics as measured by HDX-MS, and there are stark differences between the different inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Comparison of deuterium uptake for Ibrutinib conjugated to full-length BTK with that of apo BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) shows that Ibrutinib labeling of C481 of BTK FL alters deuterium exchange in several different regions of the protein. As expected, the β2 and β3 strands in the kinase N-lobe as well as the β7, β8 strands and the N-terminus of the kinase activation segment (DFG motif) show reduced deuterium incorporation that is consistent with the location of Ibrutinib binding in the kinase active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Similar increases in deuterium uptake in BTK regulatory elements have been observed for mutations that shift the equilibrium away from the autoinhibited BTK conformation and increase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>).

Protection induced by GDC-0853 and CGI1746 in the regions surrounding the active site is similar to that observed for Ibrutinib albeit greater in magnitude. Specifically, upon binding of GDC-0853 and CGI1746 the activation loop (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,c</xref>, peptide iv) is more strongly protected than when bound to Ibrutinib while parts of the αF and αG helices are strongly protected with GDC-0853 and CGI1746 but not protected at all by Ibrutinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a,b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). It is also important to note that peptides that cover β1–3 in the N-lobe of the kinase domain (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, peptide iii) are both sensitive to the presence of the inhibitor (protection from exchange in the inhibitor-bound forms compared to the apo-form) and see an attenuation in the degree of that protection (difference between BTK:Ibrutinib and BTK:GDC-0853/CGI1746) as the regulatory domains are released from the autoinhibited conformation. While the HDX-MS changes within the kinase domain are consistent with the binding mode and contacts being made by the drug within the BTK active site in the BTK:drug co-crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), HDX-MS of full-length BTK reveals that there are clear conformational differences in the BTK regulatory domains between the drug-bound forms in solution.

Consistent with this, HDX-MS reveals only limited protection upon CC-292 binding localized primarily to the N-lobe surrounding the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, peptide iii, 6). The lack of protection from deuterium exchange in the activation loop of BTK upon binding to CC-292 is consistent with high flexibility and the absence of electron density for this region in the crystal structure of CC-292 bound to BTK LKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The smaller and more confined HDX differences between apo- and CC-292-bound full-length BTK are consistent with the similar conformational modulation evident in the W395 resonance for apo BTK and BTK:CC-292 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Finally, the BTK:CC-292 complex, like the GDC-0853 and CGI1746 complexes, is characterized by a lack of changes in the regulatory domains. As full-length BTK is predominantly in the autoinhibited conformation in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>), this result indicates that binding of GDC-0853, CGI1746, and CC-292 do not shift the equilibrium away from the inactive, autoinhibited conformation of full-length BTK.</p><p>HDX-MS of the BTK:Dasatinib complex shows that this complex exhibits the largest differences compared to apo full-length BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In contrast to the other BTK:drug complexes, Dasatinib binding causes dramatic increased deuterium uptake in a large part of the kinase domain C-lobe and activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, peptide iv, 6), a result suggesting that these regions of the protein become less structured and more solvent exposed upon binding to Dasatinib. Such changes are consistent with the extensive NMR line broadening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) and the absence of electron density for the activation loop in the crystal structure of Dasatinib bound to BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In addition, the SH3 and SH2 domains and the SH2-kinase linker region all exhibit increased deuteration upon Dasatinib binding to the BTK active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and the extent of deuterium uptake is greater than that observed for Ibrutinib binding suggesting Dasatinib shifts the population away from the autoinhibited form to a greater extent than Ibrutinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,e</xref>, peptide i and 6). Indeed, the W395 resonance suggests that the kinase domain in the Dasatinib:BTK complex populates the αC-in conformation rather than the αC-out conformation stabilized by Ibrutinib providing a possible explanation for how Dasatinib induces greater exposure in the regulatory domains. Taking the results for all the inhibitors together, NMR and HDX-MS data provide unique insights into the extent to which different BTK inhibitors affect the conformational preferences and dynamics of both the kinase domain itself and the regulatory domains within full-length BTK. Ibrutinib and Dasatinib promote changes in the conformational equilibria of full-length BTK, whereas the other inhibitors, GDC-0853, CGI1746, and CC-292, cause significantly more localized conformational adjustments limited to the kinase domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The Ibrutinib resistance mutation T316A activates BTK by disrupting the autoinhibitory conformation of full-length BTK</title><p>Refocusing on the clinically important BTK inhibitor, Ibrutinib, we turn next to evaluating the cause of Ibrutinib resistance upon mutation of BTK T316 to alanine.

The location of T316 suggests that mutation at this position might destabilize autoinhibitory contacts between the SH2 domain and the kinase domain C-lobe. T316 is adjacent to R307, a key residue in the autoinhibitory salt bridge interaction between the SH2 domain and D656 in the C-terminus of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>).

Comparing the extent of deuterium uptake for wild-type BTK versus the T316A mutant shows small increases in exchange in the non-catalytic regulatory SH3-SH2 region upon mutation of T316 to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c,d</xref>). Mapping the peptides that show increased deuterium uptake for the BTK T316A mutant onto the autoinhibited structure shows that the regions affected by the mutation in the SH2 domain localize to the SH3-SH2 domains and SH2-kinase linker that together create autoinhibitory contacts with the distal side of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). It should be noted that these small 0.5–1.0 Da changes cannot be specifically localized within the regions indicated and so the peptides shown encompass a region larger than the actual change in deuteration. As well, the changes observed for the T316A mutation are consistent with a more transiently populated ‘open’ conformation compared to the more drastic changes in deuterium uptake observed upon mutation of D656 in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). Loss of the D656 sidechain abolishes the autoinhibitory salt bridge with R307 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) and leads to activation of BTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to the changes in deuterium exchange observed for the BTK T316A mutant, the BTK C481S active site resistance mutant shows no change in exchange behavior compared to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).</p><p>NMR analysis confirms that the T316A mutation in the BTK SH2 domain shifts the conformational ensemble of BTK toward the active kinase (αC-in) population.

Peak intensities for the W395 resonance in the upfield and downfield positions indicate that 72% of full-length wild-type BTK adopts a conformation consistent with inactive kinase (αC-out) and mutation of T316 to alanine results in only 60% of the full-length kinase in an inactive conformation. Accordingly, the population of active BTK as measured by W395 peak intensity increases ~1.5-fold, from 28% for wild-type BTK to 40% for the BTK T316A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Consistent with the HDX-MS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), the partial shift in population to the αC-in state in the T316A mutant is small when compared to the the BTK D656K activating mutant, which shows an almost complete shift in the conformational ensemble to the active (αC-in) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). To directly test kinase activity, we compared autophosphorylation of BTK wild-type and T316A mutant under identical kinase assay conditions.

We examined Ibrutinib conjugation to the BTK T316A mutant by following the W395 resonance and the HDX-MS signatures. Both experimental methods require protein concentrations in the micromolar range and so it is noted that the experiments are carried out well above the nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> values previously reported for Ibrutinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Woyach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamasy et al., 2017</xref>). W395 reports a shift toward the inactive (αC-out) kinase domain conformation upon Ibrutinib binding to the BTK T316A mutant that mirrors the results of Ibrutinib binding to wild-type BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). Ibrutinib binding to the T316A mutant results in increased deuterium exchange in the region spanning the SH3, SH2 domains and SH2-kinase linker in a manner that is nearly identical to wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the Ibrutinib-induced remote conformational changes in the regulatory region of BTK appear to be a general consequence of Ibrutinib binding that occurs regardless of the T316A mutation in the BTK SH2 domain.</p><p>The covalent nature of Ibrutinib binding to the BTK active site prevents standard measurement of affinity constants. To assess whether the T316A mutation in the SH2 domain affects drug binding to the active site, we instead performed an HDX-MS titration series to compare Ibrutinib binding to wild-type and T316A BTK. No meaningful differences (&gt;0.5 Da) in deuterium uptake are observed between wild-type BTK and the BTK T316A mutant over a range of Ibrutinib concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that the BTK T316A mutation likely causes resistance to Ibrutinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>) by shifting the conformational ensemble of full-length BTK to favor the active state. At concentrations of Ibrutinib that exceed the IC<sub>50</sub>, there is no evidence that the T316A mutation in the SH2 domain limits binding of drug to the BTK active site.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The essential role that kinases play in cell signaling make them attractive pharmacological targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao and Bourne, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller et al., 2015</xref>). The vast majority of available kinase inhibitors target the kinase active site and our work shows that the occupancy of the kinase active site by different inhibitors can have profoundly distinct effects on the distant BTK regulatory domains, effects that are missed in crystal structures of drug-bound kinase domain alone. Here, we provide the first report of the impact of binding of the irreversible FDA-approved drug Ibrutinib on the conformation of full-length BTK. Approval of an increasing number of covalent inhibitors demonstrate the effectiveness of irreversible drugs compared to reversible inhibitors in the targeted therapies of kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao and Bourne, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer, 2015</xref>). A major advantage of irreversible inhibitors is that once covalently bound to the kinase, they permanently trap the protein, thereby sequestering its catalytic function until fresh protein is produced by translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barf and Kaptein, 2012</xref>). Consequently, covalent inhibitors are particularly effective in the treatment of kinases that have a long cellular half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer, 2015</xref>). Additionally, covalent inhibitors are selected for rapid clearance from the serum to prevent toxicity effects arising from off-target modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barf and Kaptein, 2012</xref>). Ibrutinib levels in the serum peak 1–2 hr post-ingestion and return to basal levels after 3–4 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Advani et al., 2013</xref>). The BTK C481S resistance mutation prevents the covalent attachment of Ibrutinib to the active site during the period when Ibrutinib is available in the serum but Ibrutinib still binds noncovalently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furman et al., 2014</xref>). This reversible drug binding coupled with rapid serum clearance implies that the BTK C481S mutant is not ‘trapped’ by Ibrutinib. Once serum Ibrutinib levels diminish, BTK signaling by the BTK C481S mutant occurs resulting in drug resistance.</p><p>The BTK T316A resistance mutant retains the ability to be covalently modified by Ibrutinib. Thus, when the BTK T316A mutant encounters Ibrutinib it is likely ‘trapped’ by the covalent drug in a manner similar to wild-type BTK. However, the BTK T316A mutation is itself activating; loss of the T316 sidechain destabilizes a key down-regulatory interaction within BTK and shifts the conformational equilibrium away from the autoinhibited state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8a</xref>). And so, newly synthesized BTK T316A could escape the narrow inhibition time window created by rapid Ibrutinib clearance. The unconjugated and active T316A mutant could then promote BTK signaling, unlike properly autoinhibited wild-type BTK. The idea that resistance mutations can counteract the autoinhibitory state has been elegantly demonstrated in recently published work on the ABL kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xie et al., 2020</xref>). It should be noted that we have not characterized binding of Ibrutinib to the phosphorylated form of BTK and so it is possible that phosphorylated BTK T316A could exhibit diminished affinity for Ibrutinib thereby also contributing to the observed resistance.</p><p>Our findings now show that mutation is not the only mechanism by which the BTK conformational ensemble shifts away from the ‘closed’ autoinhibited state. Binding of either Ibrutinib or Dasatinib triggers the same shift in the conformational equilibrium of the regulatory domains away from the autoinhibited conformation creating the opportunity for BTK regulatory domain interactions with exogenous ligands despite the inhibited kinase domain. This conformational shift could promote kinase-independent signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Middendorp et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Middendorp et al., 2005</xref>) and/or create a dominant negative. Varied effects of inhibitor binding on the non-catalytic functions of kinases have been observed previously and range from alterations in interactions with upstream or downstream regulatory kinases and phosphatases to changes in ligand affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sonti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leonard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Skora et al., 2013</xref>). For BTK specifically, recent evidence suggests that non-catalytic functions of Ibrutinib-bound BTK activate CLL-specific PLCγ variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wist et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, selection of BTK inhibitor type to treat specific disease states as well as design of the next generation of BTK inhibitors need to carefully consider the impact of the inhibitor on BTK regulatory domain conformation.</p><p>Of the five active site inhibitors studied here only CGI1746, CC-292, and GDC-0853 inhibit kinase activity without disrupting the autoinhibitory conformation of the full-length kinase. Ibrutinib and Dasatinib alter the conformational equilibrium of the multidomain kinase decreasing the population of the autoinhibited kinase even though the drugs block and inactivate the kinase domain. The effect of an active site inhibitor on the overall conformational preference of a multidomain kinase must originate in the kinase domain. Multiple mobile elements including the αC-helix, DFG motif, and the activation loop switch the kinase domain between its inactive and active conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fabbro et al., 2015</xref>). A number of studies are emerging that focus on the long-range conformational effects of active site inhibitor binding to the SRC module kinase families: SRC, ABL, and TEC. There is an overriding effort to define a unifying metric that can predict the outcome of inhibitor binding on the conformation of the regulatory domains and different studies have endeavored to link disassembly of the regulatory domains to different mobile elements within the kinase domain.</p><p>For the SRC family, the αC-in configuration has been correlated with release of the regulatory domains from the autoinhibited state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leonard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsutsui et al., 2016</xref>). Other studies suggest that the αC-helix conformation alone can be used to predict the regulatory domain conformation in the SRC, ABL, and TEC kinases; inhibitors that stabilize the αC-in conformation disrupt the regulatory domains from their autoinhibitory conformation, whereas αC-out stabilizing inhibitors do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang, 2020</xref>). However, ABL focused studies show that Dasatinib stabilizes αC-in but does not disrupt the regulatory domains from their compact, autoinhibitory state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sonti et al., 2018</xref>). For ABL, a strict correlation has been observed instead between activation loop conformation and regulatory domain assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sonti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Skora et al., 2013</xref>). Inhibitors that stabilize an activation loop ‘in’ conformation disrupt the ABL SH3 and SH2 domains from their autoinhibited conformation, whereas inhibitors that stabilize the activation loop ‘out’ conformation do not. Our results suggest simple αC-helix or activation loop ‘in’ versus ‘out’ metrics are not sufficient to explain BTK inhibitor effects. Just one example from the data presented here shows that both Ibrutinib and CGI1746 favor the activation loop ‘in’ configuration, but the regulatory domains are displaced upon Ibrutinib binding and remain in the autoinhibited conformation on binding CGI1746.</p><p>To understand why Ibrutinib and Dasatinib disrupt the autoinhibited conformation of full-length BTK while GDC-0853, CGI1746, and CC-292 do not, we turn back to the crystal structures of BTK LKD bound to each inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

The ‘hydrophobic stack’ consists of two residues on the distal surface of the kinase domain (Y461 and W421 in BTK) and a single hydrophobic residue from the linker spanning the SH2 and kinase domains (L390 in BTK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). Regulatory domain release from the distal side of the kinase domain leads to disruption of the hydrophobic stack and is accompanied by exchange of ADP for ATP in the active site, thus linking the conformational preference of the regulatory domains and the occupancy of the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">von Raußendorf et al., 2017</xref>). Given the impact of Ibrutinib and Dasatinib on the R-spine residue L460 and the fact that the hydrophobic stack residue Y461 is adjacent to L460, we can speculate that small molecules that fill (directly or indirectly) the back pocket of the active site, may allosterically trigger conformational adjustments in the hydrophobic stack region that result in displacement of the regulatory domains from their autoinhibited pose. This is a new metric for predicting global conformational effects of specific BTK inhibitors that does not depend on strict conformational requirements being met in the αC helix and/or activation loop.</p><p>Structural studies that combine data from X-ray crystallography, solution NMR and HDX-MS provide a detailed and more complete picture to identify key regulatory interactions at work in protein kinases. In addition, use of the full-length kinase reveals unexpected differences between BTK inhibitors that are missed in crystallographic analyses of fragments. For BTK, this work has demonstrated that the clinically important inhibitor Ibrutinib imposes conformational adjustments on the distant non-catalytic domains of BTK, which may be functionally relevant in vivo. BTK inhibitors that do not induce a conformational shift toward the ‘open’ form of BTK may improve the efficacy of disease treatment where the kinase-independent functions of BTK play an important role. Additionally, targeting downstream BTK substrates such as PLCγ2 or combination therapies of Ibrutinib together with reversible active site/allosteric inhibitors that have a prolonged serum half-life may reduce the type of resistance embodied by the T316A mutation. The sustained presence of reversible inhibitors in the serum may block the activity of newly synthesized BTK T316A and prevent escape from Ibrutinib. Recognizing the conformational impact that mutations and inhibitors such as Ibrutinib have on full-length BTK should inform future strategies to effectively target this kinase in the context of disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs and reagents</title><p>The bacterial expression constructs for murine BTK LKD, SH3-SH2-Linker-kinase domain (32LKD) and full-length (FL) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>).

Briefly, the culture was grown at 37°C to an O.D. 600 nm of 0.6 to 0.8. The temperature of the culture was lowered to 18°C and then induced with either 1.0 mM IPTG for BTK LKD construct or 0.1 mM IPTG for BTK full-length and 32LKD.

For the Ibrutinib titration experiment, labeling was performed for 10 min for BTK:Ibrutinib at molar ratios of 1:0.2, 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2. After the binding reactions, both the free kinase and kinase bound to Ibrutinib were placed on ice prior to deuterium labeling. Deuterium labeling proceeded for the times described using labeling buffer, and labeling was stopped with an equal volume of quench buffer at 0°C (details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). Full-length wild-type BTK was independently mixed with CGI-1746, CC-292, GDC-0853, or Dasatinib to final concentrations of BTK 20 µM, inhibitor 200 µM and these mixtures were incubated for 1 hr at 21°C. Unbound kinase (as control) or kinase bound to each of the small molecules was deuterated for the times described using labeling buffer, and labeling was stopped with an equal volume of quench buffer at 0°C (details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). Quenched samples were immediately analyzed using a Waters nanoACQUITY with HDX technology using online pepsin digestion with a Waters Enzymate immobilized pepsin column and UPLC separation of the resulting peptic peptides. Mass spectra were acquired using a Waters Synapt HDMS<sup>E</sup> mass spectrometer. Peptides generated from online pepsin digestion were identified with Waters Protein Lynx Global Server 3.0 using separate unlabeled protein that was prepared in the same manner as protein labeled with deuterium. Deuterium incorporation was quantified using Waters DynamX 3.0. Deuterium levels for each peptide were calculated by subtracting the average mass of the undeuterated control sample from that of the deuterium-labeled sample; the data were not corrected for back exchange and are therefore reported as relative.

Using NMR and HDX solution measurements, the study compares one covalent inhibitor (ibrutinib) and four non-covalent inhibitors (GDC0853, CGI1746, CC292, dasatinib). The study reports three findings: First, NMR shows variable effects on W395 indole NH, which based on NMR and X-ray comparisons of linker-kinase BTK, reports active and inactive conformations of helix aC. These solution conformations differ from those predicted based on X-ray structures of each inhibitor bound to the BTK kinase domain. Second, HDX measurements show variable effects of inhibitors on FL-BTK. The results reveal clear conformational differences between BTK:drug complexes in solution, and an unexpected effect of dasatinib on increased conformational mobility that propagates throughout the kinase domain. Third, the binding interactions of each inhibitor with active site elements are used to construct a structural model which explains why only ibrutinib and dasatinib disrupt the remote SH3-SH2 interactions. The model proposes that L460 and/or T474 relay conformational changes from the active site to the regulatory domains through connections between R spine residues. This is then tested by mutation of L460A, which elevates HDX throughout the SH3-SH2 region as well as within the kinase domain, supporting its likely role in maintaining the allosteric connection between the active site and SH3-SH2 (but see concerns about effects on kinase stability, noted below). The T474A mutation does not affect the SH3-SH2 and kinase domain, but increases HDX in the linker region and autoinhibitory PHTH domain. Both mutants interfere with kinase activity partially (T474A) or fully (L460A).</p><p>The strengths of this manuscript are its analysis of the solution behavior of full length BTK using a powerful combination of NMR and HDX. The results establish evidence for the remote regulation of the SH3-SH2 regulatory domain, variable impact of different inhibitors on this allosteric mechanism, and variable conformational selection by different inhibitors within the active site. The model for allostery involving L460 as a sensor linking the kinase active site to the regulatory domains is exciting, and at least for ibrutinib is supported by HDX evidence. A principal weakness of the study is the limited rigorous mechanistic understanding of the effects of inhibitors on BTK conformation.</p><p>In Joseph, Wales, et al. &quot;BTK regulatory domains escape Ibrutinib inhibition&quot;, the authors examine full length BTK using 1H-15N NMR and HDX-MS to investigate effects of an irreversible covalent inhibitor, ibrutinib, and a T316A drug resistance mutation whose mechanism is unknown. There are three main findings: First, NMR and HDX show that the inhibitor preserves the conformation of the kinase domain predicted from the X-ray structure, but disrupts remote autoinhibitory contacts between SH3-SH2 and the linker-kinase, leading to behavior resembling that of the partially active form. Second, the T316A resistance mutation enhances BTK kinase activity, while increasing HDX in the SH3-SH2 domains, consistent with disengagement to a partially activated state, and shifting a W395 NH resonance towards a productive active site conformation. Third, the effect of ibrutinib on remote conformational changes is nearly the same between WT-BTK and the T316A mutant. The study concludes that ibrutinib has long distance allosteric effects, displacing the SH3 and SH2 domains from their compact autoinhibited conformation and that T316A resistance mutation located outside of the kinase domain works by increasing the catalytic activity of BTK.</p><p>Strengths of the manuscript are its unique combination of NMR and HDX, and its excellent illustration of the power of this approach in probing regulatory conformational changes, in a way that has been elusive using X-ray crystallography. The description of NMR assignments are rigorous and the data interpretation, particularly with HDX are accurate and not overstated. There are few studies of full-length BTK, and together with the co-submitted article, the manuscript makes a clear case for allostery unique to the full-length form that can be regulated by a clinically important inhibitor and a poorly understood resistance mechanism. Weaknesses are that the manuscript is confusing to understand without extensive reading of previous articles in Structure 2017 and JMB 2016. It would benefit from revisions that clarify a number of ambiguities and confusing terminologies. In addition, the study needs a more convincing explanation for why the results necessarily explain drug resistance by T316A. HDX-MS experiments indicate that despite stabilizing an inactive conformation of the kinase domain, ibrutinib induces disassembly of the inhibitory interactions with the SH3 and SH2 domains. This is a surprising finding that could have important implications for the effects of the drug, which is an FDA-approved therapeutic. Studies with the T316 mutant show that it induces disassembly of the SH3/SH2 interactions and consequently enhances BTK catalytic activity, but the molecular explanation for this is unsatisfactory.</p><p>Comments to address when revising and merging the manuscripts:</p><p>A) Specific comments pertaining to Joseph, Amatya, et al. &quot;Differential Effects of BTK active site inhibitors.…&quot;</p><p>Major points to address:</p><p>1) There is concern that the L460 and T474 mutations are hard to interpret – they are non-conservative substitutions in key regions of the kinase domain that almost certainly destabilize it to some extent, and can therefore be expected to affect SH3/SH2 regulatory interactions. Indeed the authors see this for the L460A mutation. So it may be difficult to ascribe HDX changes with inhibitors to a role for these residues in allosteric communication. It is possible that similar results with many non-conservative substitutions in this region of the kinase domain. The authors should consider either removing these experiments, or justify their inclusion with additional text.</p><p>2) &quot;The BTK:CC292 complex shares structural similarity with the ibrutinib, GDC and CGI BTK complex crystal structures but the solution behavior of the CC292 complex is distinct. HDX reveals only limited protection upon CC292 binding localized primarily to the N-lobe surrounding the active site.&quot;</p><p>Detailed analyses of drug-enzyme interactions are needed to support this statement. Superficial examination of Figure 1A suggests that the BTK:CC292 cocrystal structure might have more space for water in the active site.</p><p>Related to this point, it would be helpful to note in the manuscript which of these structures were generated from co-crystallized proteins and which were generated by soaking.</p><p>3) T474A does not phenocopy effects of L460A on HDX (see also the comment above on the potential effects of mutations on stability). Therefore, it was hard to understand how the proposed mechanism explains why dasatinib necessarily phenocopies ibrutinib effects on HDX within the remote SH3-SH2 regions. The conclusions about T474A are not integrated very well with results in Figures 3 and 4 to explain the distinct effects of dasatinib. The authors propose that both ibrutinib and dasatinib perturb L460 in different ways, where ibrutinib interacts directly with L460 to push helix aC out, while dasatinib interacts with T474 to allow helix aC-in, which also perturbs the back pocket. The part of the mechanism involving dasatinib is largely based on the X-ray structure, which seems incongruent with the conclusion from Figure 3 that the Xray structures for CC292 and dasatinib are not representative of their solution conformations. Therefore, it seems possible that perturbation of T474 (the gatekeeper) signals to the remote SH3-SH2 by an alternative route. Perhaps prior findings in JMB 2016 showing that T474M activates the kinase would be useful to integrate into this Discussion. It might also be useful to show the outcomes of Figure 8 experiments using dasatinib instead of ibrutinib.</p><p>Overall these two large sections read somewhat incoherently, and it was difficult to parse out which aspects were supported by evidence and which were speculation. The sections need to be reconsidered or explained more carefully.</p><p>4) The authors should place their model in the context of “Conformational Selection” , which is a general mechanism that could explain all their results.</p><p>B) Specific comments pertaining to Joseph, Wales, et al. (BTK regulatory domains escape.…)</p><p>Major points to address:</p><p>1) It would help to clarify that the active mutants used in the prior work as well as T316A in this study only activate BTK by 2-3x. Therefore all mutants cause only a partially active state of BTK, that is intermediate between the autoinhibited and fully active kinase. This was hard to grasp from the manuscript, but explained in a short review of the 2017 Structure paper by Agnew and Jura. Thus the current manuscript is somewhat misleading in using &quot;active conformation&quot; terminology throughout. Is there work comparing HDX in full length BTK vs SH3 and SH2 domains alone? It is possible that the HDX increase would be much greater in fully activated BTK than in the 2-fold activated mutants. It would help to say this, and explain that the mutants increase HDX by only 1-2 Da because the detachment reflects only a partially activated intermediate conformation.</p><p>Related to this, can any form of FL-BTK yield full activation in vitro? For example, does stoichiometric phosphorylation at Y551 by Lyn and/or autophosphorylation at Y223, with or without PIP3 binding, result in a fully active kinase? If available, it would be useful to know how HDX of SH3-SH2 in the fully activated state compares to that of the mutants.</p><p>2) Given prior data, including the crystal structure of the BTK kinase domain with ibrutinib and crystal structure of a SH3/Sh2/kinase fragment of BTK in the autoinhibited state, it might be expected that ibrutinib would tend to stabilize the assembled, autoinhibited state of BTK because it stabilizes the inactive conformation of the kinase domain (which is in turn coupled to SH3/SH2 interactions). But the present HDX-MS data clearly suggests otherwise. Is it possible that the destabilization arises from binding of ibrutinib to a solvent exposed cysteine elsewhere in BTK – for example the one in the SH2 domain? The authors present beautiful mass spec data showing 1:1 labeling with ibrutinib, but was this labeling experiment carried out under the same conditions as ibrutinib binding for HDX-MS? Also the mass spec experiment shows not even a trace of unlabeled BTK or double labeled BTK – was some sort of mass selection or filtering applied in this experiment to select the singly-labeled species? Also, Materials and methods should be provided for this mass spec experiment.</p><p>3) It was unconvincing that T316A should promote resistance by activating FL-BTK.</p><p>First, the extent of activation by the mutation was only 2-fold. The assay measures autophosphorylation at Y551, which only occurs in vitro and might be irrelevant to cellular activation, therefore might fail to report potentially larger effects of the mutation on activity measured with a true substrate or autophosphorylation at pY223.</p><p>Related to point #3 above, what is the effect of the T316A mutation on the activity of a fully activated BTK (if it exists), and the degree of its inhibition by ibrutinib? Perhaps T316A increases activity to a greater extent when BTK is fully phosphorylated.</p><p>Second, as noted by the authors, the irreversible coupling of ibrutinib might mask any effects of the mutant on binding affinity. The latter might be detectable using BTK-C481A to measure ibrutinib binding, or by measuring rates of covalent coupling of ibrutinib to BTK at varying concentrations of a competing inhibitor.</p><p>Third, elevated activity of unbound BTK-T316A would not be expected to bypass the effects of drug, if drug truly binds the mutant in cells.</p><p>4) Enzymes exist in ensembles of multiple conformations in solution. This is presented well with the TROSY 1H15N spectra in Figure 2. Crystallography provides high resolution snapshots of only one likely conformation. It is erroneous for the authors to validate their ensemble measurements with crystal structures. The conclusions from the NMR titrations in Figure 2A are correlated with inactive state in Figure 1D. If anything, the authors' results caution against relying on simplistic single snapshot conformational analyses to explain allostery.</p><p>5) It will greatly help the reader if the authors discuss and reassess their results on the basis of “Conformational Selection”, “Induced Fit” or a combination of both models. It could be argued that the inhibitor favors one conformation and shifts the equilibrium. The authors throughout the manuscript imply Ibrutinib binding allosterically displaces the remote regulatory domain- and then there is a notion of regulatory domains escaping the inhibitor from the title.</p><p>Supporting the ensemble behavior and conformational selection, the authors conclude from the NMR and HDXMS studies that the T316A mutant shifts the ensemble to a more active kinase conformation consistent with a mutation-induced bias toward the active state.</p><p>6) An important control would be to compare HDXMS upon Ibrutinib binding with a non-specific covalent modification of BTK at C481 with biotin maleimide for instance. An alternate control would be analysis of the C481M mutant, which might mimic the covalent modification of C481. Have such experiments been done?</p><p>In this context, the noncovalent interaction of Ibrutinib with C481S is intriguing. Does it give the same equivalent inhibitory effect? Does it compete equivalently with ATP? Are the HDX-MS differences equivalent to wt C481?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;Differential impact of BTK active site inhibitors on the conformational state of full-length BTK&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Thus the current manuscript is somewhat misleading in using &quot;active conformation&quot; terminology throughout. Is there work comparing HDX in full length BTK vs SH3 and SH2 domains alone? It is possible that the HDX increase would be much greater in fully activated BTK than in the 2-fold activated mutants. It would help to say this, and explain that the mutants increase HDX by only 1-2 Da because the detachment reflects only a partially activated intermediate conformation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We have previously compared isolated SH3 and SH2 domains to full-length BTK by HDX-MS and indeed the magnitude of the increase in deuterium uptake is small in the full length T316A mutant when compared to either 1) the isolated domains, 2) the D656K activating mutation or perhaps more relevant, 3) binding of full-length BTK to PIP3, an activating ligand that binds the PH domain (all three cases were described in Joseph, Structure 2017). This suggests that the T316A mutation induces a small shift in the conformational ensemble of the regulatory domains of full-length BTK away from the autoinhibited conformation (as compared to the larger shift promoted by PIP3 binding). This is now carefully acknowledged in the text describing the effect of T316A.</p><p>The manuscript has now been modified throughout to clearly indicate the conformational state probed by the NMR experiment. The “active” versus “inactive” state terminology has been replaced in the NMR experiments to reflect the αC-in versus -out conformation of the kinase domain. A panel has been added to Figure 2 to more clearly show the αC helix and W395 conformations in structures of the active and inactive kinase. The HDX-MS changes are interpreted in the context of the autoinhibited structure since this is the only available multidomain structure for BTK. The data show the location of changes that are consistent with release of the regulatory domains from the kinase domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, can any form of FL-BTK yield full activation in vitro? For example, does stoichiometric phosphorylation at Y551 by Lyn and/or autophosphorylation at Y223, with or without PIP3 binding, result in a fully active kinase? If available, it would be useful to know how HDX of SH3-SH2 in the fully activated state compares to that of the mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>The PIP3 bound, Y551 phosphorylated full-length BTK protein is presumed to be the fully activated state, however we have not characterized this form due to challenges associated with producing sufficient uniformly Y551 phosphorylated sample. For this reason, all NMR and HDX-MS experiments have been carried out using unphosphorylated BTK to ensure sample homogeneity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given prior data, including the crystal structure of the BTK kinase domain with ibrutinib and crystal structure of a SH3/Sh2/kinase fragment of BTK in the autoinhibited state, it might be expected that ibrutinib would tend to stabilize the assembled, autoinhibited state of BTK because it stabilizes the inactive conformation of the kinase domain (which is in turn coupled to SH3/SH2 interactions). But the present HDX-MS data clearly suggests otherwise. Is it possible that the destabilization arises from binding of ibrutinib to a solvent exposed cysteine elsewhere in BTK – for example the one in the SH2 domain? The authors present beautiful mass spec data showing 1:1 labeling with ibrutinib, but was this labeling experiment carried out under the same conditions as ibrutinib binding for HDX-MS? Also the mass spec experiment shows not even a trace of unlabeled BTK or double labeled BTK – was some sort of mass selection or filtering applied in this experiment to select the singly-labeled species? Also, Materials and methods should be provided for this mass spec experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>In the HDX MS experiments, we were not able to identify any cysteine-containing peptides that were conjugated to Ibrutinib, including those peptides containing C481. However, peptic peptides that contain C481 were absent only in the Ibrutinib labeled BTK samples while all other C containing peptides retained signal in the mass spectrometer suggesting that Ibrutinib conjugated only to C481. We are therefore confident, when combined with intact MS analysis (Figure 2C), that there were no substantial sideconjugation reactions to other cysteines in the protein.</p><p>Thank you for pointing out our error in not describing the methods for the acquisition of the intact mass data. The complete methods for the intact mass analyses are now included in the Materials and methods section of the text. These added methods describe that intact mass analysis was performed under the same conditions as those for the HDX MS experiments, and during mass spectral acquisition there was no mass selection or filtering applied for either the Ibrutinib conjugated or free wild-type BTK. Mass spectra were also acquired after 4 hours of labeling BTK with Ibrutinib and still there was a single mass adduct (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It was unconvincing that T316A should promote resistance by activating FL-BTK.</p><p>First, the extent of activation by the mutation was only 2-fold. The assay measures autophosphorylation at Y551, which only occurs in vitro and might be irrelevant to cellular activation, therefore might fail to report potentially larger effects of the mutation on activity measured with a true substrate or autophosphorylation at pY223.</p><p>Related to point #3 above, what is the effect of the T316A mutation on the activity of a fully activated BTK (if it exists), and the degree of its inhibition by ibrutinib? Perhaps T316A increases activity to a greater extent when BTK is fully phosphorylated.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the kinase assay measuring phosphorylation on Y551 might occur only in vitro. However, this assay does report on the intrinsic activity of the kinase and shows a 2-fold increase in activity which is consistent with the population shift measured by NMR. The drug resistance mutation in the ABL SH2 domain, T231R, has been studied extensively and, while this substitution directly stabilizes the active ABL conformation, the fold activation observed using an in vitro kinase assay is also two-fold (Sherbenou et al., 2010). In this case drug resistance is also thought to arise from a conformational shift away from a form to which the drug binds. While the T316A mutation could have additional effects in the context of a fully phosphorylated form of BTK, the impact of the mutation on the unphosphorylated protein is likely playing a role in Ibrutinib resistance in vivo given the pharmacokinetics of this drug. Finally, we are aware of data (personal communication) supporting a resistance causing mutation in a SRC module kinase that does not affect drug binding to the active site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, as noted by the authors, the irreversible coupling of ibrutinib might mask any effects of the mutant on binding affinity. The latter might be detectable using BTK-C481A to measure ibrutinib binding, or by measuring rates of covalent coupling of ibrutinib to BTK at varying concentrations of a competing inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>We did consider these approaches to measure binding affinity. Using the C481A mutant to measure binding affinity of Ibrutinib would be an approximation and not reflect the true binding kinetics of a covalent inhibitor. The use of a competing inhibitor (eg. fluorescent tagged ADP) would require that it binds with the same affinity to both the wild-type and mutant proteins. However, previous work has shown that destabilization of the autoinhibited conformation changes the affinity for ADP. Given these complications, we tested binding using HDX-MS and acknowledge the deficiencies in the approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, elevated activity of unbound BTK-T316A would not be expected to bypass the effects of drug, if drug truly binds the mutant in cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The pharmacokinetics of an inhibitor is a key factor that must be taken into consideration in assessing mutational outcomes. Covalent inhibitors such as Ibrutinib, unlike reversible inhibitors, are rapidly cleared from the serum and Ibrutinib levels drop to basal levels within 4 hours. Newly synthesized BTK T316A could escape this narrow inhibition time window. The unconjugated T316A mutant therefore could promote BTK signaling due to its elevated activity, unlike wild-type BTK which is autoinhibited. In the merged manuscript we address this at the beginning of the Discussion section. In addition, we have acknowledged in this section that the T316A mutation could also adversely affect Ibrutinib binding to the active site thereby contributing to resistance especially in the context of activation loop phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Enzymes exist in ensembles of multiple conformations in solution. This is presented well with the TROSY 1H15N spectra in Figure 2. Crystallography provides high resolution snapshots of only one likely conformation. It is erroneous for the authors to validate their ensemble measurements with crystal structures. The conclusions from the NMR titrations in Figure 2A are correlated with inactive state in Figure 1D. If anything, the authors' results caution against relying on simplistic single snapshot conformational analyses to explain allostery.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our solution work are ensemble measurements and that crystal structures provide snapshots of a single conformation. Inhibitor and mutational effects are interpreted as shifts in this conformational equilibrium and the crystal structures are used as a guide to interpret these changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It will greatly help the reader if the authors discuss and reassess their results on the basis of “Conformational Selection”, “Induced Fit” or a combination of both models. It could be argued that the inhibitor favors one conformation and shifts the equilibrium. The authors throughout the manuscript imply Ibrutinib binding allosterically displaces the remote regulatory domain- and then there is a notion of regulatory domains escaping the inhibitor from the title.</p><p>Supporting the ensemble behavior and conformational selection, the authors conclude from the NMR and HDXMS studies that the T316A mutant shifts the ensemble to a more active kinase conformation consistent with a mutation-induced bias toward the active state.</p></disp-quote><p>It is noteworthy that the recent publication referenced above (Xie et al., 2020) is one of the few examples in the kinase field where multiple structures within an ensemble have been detected and structures solved so that conformational shifts induced by mutations could be correlated to structures that exist in the ensemble of the wild type protein – supporting conformational selection. The NMR approach used in these studies (CEST) requires long acquisition times that might prohibit application to full-length BTK.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) An important control would be to compare HDXMS upon Ibrutinib binding with a non-specific covalent modification of BTK at C481 with biotin maleimide for instance. An alternate control would be analysis of the C481M mutant, which might mimic the covalent modification of C481. Have such experiments been done?</p><p>In this context, the noncovalent interaction of Ibrutinib with C481S is intriguing. Does it give the same equivalent inhibitory effect? Does it compete equivalently with ATP? Are the HDX-MS differences equivalent to wt C481?</p></disp-quote><p>Ibrutinib and CC-292 (also in this study) are both covalent inhibitors that modify BTK C481. CC292 can therefore be considered as a control for Ibrutinib and in the general sense modification at C481 – the consequences of Ibrutinib and CC-292 on the overall conformational preferences and dynamics of full-length BTK are strikingly different.</p><p>C481S is an Ibrutinib resistance mutation. The C481S mutant exhibits an increase in IC<sub>50</sub> for Ibrutinib in vivo. ATP binding to the BTK C481S mutant has not been tested. Our NMR and HDX-MS analysis of the C481S mutant and wild-type protein show no significant differences between the apo proteins (Figure 7 and 8 in the manuscript) or when bound to Ibrutinib (data not shown). It is likely that loss of the covalent bond to Ibrutinib results in a faster off rate and subsequent clearance of Ibrutinib from the serum, in other words BTK C481S is not “trapped” by the drug.</p></body></sub-article></article>
