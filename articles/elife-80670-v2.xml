Because of the great evolutionary distance that separates vertebrates from cephalopods, it is evident that higher cognitive features have evolved separately in these clades despite the similarities that they share. Alongside their complex behavioral abilities, cephalopods have evolved specialized cells and tissues, such as the chromatophores for camouflage or suckers to grasp prey. Despite significant progress in genome and transcriptome sequencing, the molecular identities of cell types in cephalopods remain largely unknown. We here combine single-cell transcriptomics with in situ gene expression analysis to uncover cell type diversity in the European squid <italic>Loligo vulgaris</italic>. We describe cell types that are conserved with other phyla such as neurons, muscles, or connective tissues but also cephalopod-specific cells, such as chromatophores or sucker cells. Moreover, we investigate major components of the squid nervous system including progenitor and developing cells, differentiated cells of the brain and optic lobes, as well as sensory systems of the head. Our study provides a molecular assessment for conserved and novel cell types in cephalopods and a framework for mapping the nervous system of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cephalopod</kwd><kwd><italic>Loligo vulgaris</italic></kwd><kwd>single-cell RNAseq</kwd><kwd>cell type</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_188471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IZCOZ0_182957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell transcriptomics correlated with in situ gene expression analysis provide an overview of the diversity and molecular features of cell types in the squid <italic>Loligo vulgaris</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cephalopods are part of a long tradition in evolutionary neuroscience and are often highlighted as an ideal example of convergent evolution of nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Young, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Young, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 1995</xref>). Their large brains, relative to body size, and behavioral repertoires offer opportunities for comparative analysis of the evolution of learning and memory mechanisms. Cephalopods possess a sophisticated nervous system that resembles that of vertebrates in relative size and cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Young, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hochner et al., 2006</xref>). These complex behavioral abilities include various forms of learning, problem-solving, and body color and pattern changes used either as predatory or anti-predatory behaviors or for social communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fiorito et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Langridge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Staudinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Darmaillacq et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schnell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Richter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin and Chiao, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mather and Dickel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanlon and Messenger, 2018</xref>). The fossil record suggests that cephalopods were more prominent in marine ecosystems over 300 million years ago with a higher biodiversity than today. It is assumed that the rise of bony fishes and resulting competition for resources in that ecological niche played a major role in the extinction of many clades of cephalopods, including all the shelled cephalopods except few members of the subclass Nautiloidea. Today, the class Cephalopoda has over 800 current living species with extremely diversified lifestyles and body shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kröger et al., 2011</xref>). The vast majority of current cephalopod species belong to the soft-bodied subclass Coleoidea (cuttlefishes, octopuses, and squids), and a small handful belong to the subclass Nautiloidea (nautiluses). Coleoid cephalopods, which have internalized or lost their shell over evolutionary time, were able to swim more easily and could compete with other predators in open waters. The continuous competition with other animals to access resources has been proposed to have been the main trigger for the selection of cephalopods that could develop specialized strategies for accessing resources unavailable to competing species. In coleoid cephalopods, this evolutionary process resulted in larger brains, camera-type eyes, as well as abilities to voluntarily change their skin pattern and texture for camouflage and social communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Young, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanlon and Messenger, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amodio et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The European squid <italic>Loligo vulgaris</italic> is well known for its economic role in the food and fishing industry but is much less studied for its fascinating biology. This species is known for its striking ability for camouflage typically in open-water environments by the use of its specialized iridescent cells to reflect light in different manners depending on its surroundings. The neuroanatomy and nervous system morphology of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> have been described in detail in histological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Young, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wild et al., 2015</xref>). Detailed staging of the embryonic development of the related species <italic>Loligo pealii</italic> was established and can be used as a reference for <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arnold, 1965</xref>). While the gross anatomy of squids is well known from histology and morphological studies, we are currently lacking resolution at the molecular level to identify genes that specify the many cell types that make up the unique cephalopod body-plan and nervous system. Since the publication of the first complete genome sequence of <italic>Octopus bimaculoides</italic>, there has been increasing interest in cephalopod biology and neuroscience. In addition, the availability of genomic sequences of other cephalopods, such as <italic>Euprymna scolopes</italic> (Sepiida), <italic>Architeuthis dux</italic> (Oegopsida), and <italic>Nautilus pompilius</italic> (Nautilida), opens the possibility for molecular comparisons between these distant clades of cephalopods with drastically different morphologies and lifestyles. These comparisons constitute a major step for understanding the molecular basis of cephalopod evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albertin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belcaid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">da Fonseca et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Single-cell transcriptomics experiments in different cephalopods have shed light on the cell type diversity of the <italic>O. bimaculoides</italic> visual system, the brain of <italic>Octopus vulgaris,</italic> and the nervous system of the squid <italic>Euprymna berryi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gavriouchkina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songco-Casey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Styfhals et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To gain further insights into the cellular diversity and cell type-specific gene expression in squids, we performed single-cell transcriptomics on whole <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> heads (stages 28–30 based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arnold, 1965</xref>, pre-hatchling stage). Additionally, we used hybridization chain reaction in situ hybridization (HCR ISH) to visualize gene expression in situ and correlate single-cell transcriptomes with anatomical features. By combining these methods, we were able to identify and assess common cell types found in most bilaterians, such as different types of neurons, muscles, and connective tissues. Interestingly, even in these canonical tissues, we found certain clusters that highly express cephalopod-specific genes, as exemplified by some subtypes of connective tissues. Thus, while cells can be assigned a certain identity based on well-characterized marker genes, such as collagens, these cell types have likely further diverged in cephalopods. Neural tissues are prominent in the head and include the brain, optic ganglia, eyes, and other sensory organs. We identified and analyzed new markers of different cells in the nervous system, including widely expressed pan-neuronal genes, genes marking distinct stages of neural differentiation, markers for neural subsets, as well as sensory cell types. In addition, we also characterized cephalopod-specific cell types, such as the chromatophores or cells of the suckers. Our study provides new insights into the transcriptomic signatures of cell types in <italic>L. vulgaris</italic>. By analyzing the expression patterns of many cell type-specific genes, we assessed the conservation of features previously described in other animal clades but also previously unknown features and modalities of cell types that appear specific for cephalopods.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell transcriptome of the <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> head</title><p>To generate a reference transcriptome of <italic>L. vulgaris,</italic> embryos were collected at late embryonic stages for RNA extraction and subsequent cDNA synthesis. The transcriptome was sequenced, assembled de novo, and annotated (for details, see 'Materials and methods').</p><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed from the dissociated cells of the whole heads of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> pre-hatchlings. Cells were captured and sequenced in two different experiments and the resulting barcoded sequences were mapped to the reference transcriptome. The mapping rate of the sequences was of 29.3% and 29.8% for samples 1 and 2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This low mapping rate can be explained by <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> genes not being mapped to the transcriptome because the genes are missing from the transcriptome and by the presence of cells and ambient RNA from other species in the single-cell suspension. The assessment of the transcriptome assembly using benchmark universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) showed a score of 54.4% (49.8% single-copy, 4.6% duplicated, 1.9% fragmented), which indicates that a number of genes are likely missing from our transcriptome that in turn may impact downstream analysis. Cells that were identified and sequenced were clustered and analyzed. 20,000 cells were analyzed in our study. Cells were filtered to keep only the ones with a gene-per-cell count comprised between 200 and 2000 (median = 700 genes/cell). This filtering step resulted in a total of 19,974 cells. Cells were plotted to identify the presence of outliers for gene-per-cell count, UMI-per-cell count, or percentage of mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Clustering was performed with Seurat using 25 principal components with a resolution value of 2. This resulted in a total of 34 cell clusters numbered from 0 to 33. Clusters were assigned to presumed cell type identities based on the genes differentially expressed in each cluster (Cl). Clusters were manually annotated and fitted into cell type categories based on the expression of specific markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The presence of enriched <italic>laminin</italic> and <italic>fibroblast growth factor receptor</italic> further suggests that these cell clusters include precursors or differentiated cells of connective tissues. These markers that are typical of connective tissues are, however, co-expressed with several uncharacterized genes that have known orthologs in other cephalopod species. These previously unidentified markers could provide new avenues for the study of cephalopod connective tissues and provide a molecular complement to the existing morphological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Thompson and Kier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kier and Stella, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Cells of the epidermis are characterized based on the expression of an <italic>egf-like</italic> epidermal growth factor (Cl08, Cl09).

However, because the presence of this gene is not sufficient to affirm a specific cell type, we named these cells foxD<sup>+</sup> cells. A large proportion of these cells co-express the transcription factor <italic>ets4</italic>. In Cl30, <italic>foxD1</italic> was co-expressed with a <italic>GATA zinc-finger protein (gata-2</italic>) and a few blood-related markers (<italic>ferritin, hemocyte, apolipophorin</italic>).</p><p>Cl20 and Cl22 are characterized by the expression of different types of <italic>reflectin</italic> genes, a family of proteins used in cephalopods to control light reflection by modulating the iridescence of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crookes et al., 2004</xref>).

Genes of the <italic>achaete-scute</italic> complex have been broadly studied for their implication in the specification of the neuronal lineage, particularly in the fruit fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Campuzano and Modolell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Skeath and Doe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arefin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Soares et al., 2022</xref>). Both clusters also express histone-related genes and markers of proliferation, suggesting that they may be replicating undifferentiated cells. The presence of a <italic>soxB1</italic> in these cells indicates that they may be proliferating neuronal progenitors, based on previous evidence of expression of soxB1 genes during neurogenesis in cephalopods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miyagi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Focareta and Cole, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The lens is a specialized part of the eye for which we identified a cluster (Cl33) based on the expression of <italic>s-crystallin,</italic> an important structural component of the tissue of the lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tomarev and Piatigorsky, 1996</xref>).</p><p>To next move beyond the in silico assessment of cell cluster identity and describe where distinct cell types are localized, we analyze the expression of an array of marker genes specifically enriched in cell clusters of particular interest using HCR ISH.

The anatomical characterization of brain structures is usually relying on the identification of neuropils, which are regions that have large numbers of axons and synapses but few cell bodies. Since the methods used here to describe gene expression are detecting RNA molecules that are mostly located in the cell bodies, usually surrounding nuclei, we briefly describe here the anatomy of the <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> nervous system in a nonexhaustive manner to facilitate the understanding of the results. The largest structure in the <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> nervous system are the optic lobes. The cortex of the optic lobes is composed of an outer and inner plexiform layers and outer/inner granular layers. The rest of the optic lobe is referred to as the medulla. The suboesophageal mass and supraoesophagal mass make up the central part of the brain and contain several different lobes. Discussed in this article from anterior to posterior are the inferior buccal lobe, superior buccal lobe, frontal lobe, anterior basal lobe, precommissural lobe, vertical lobe, medial basal lobe, and dorsal basal lobe. The smaller peduncle lobe and olfactory lobe are posterior to the optic lobes. Note that the nervous system of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> has several posterior lobes (posterior to the basal lobes) that are not shown on the confocal micrographs of this study as they have been sometimes lost during sample preparation after amputation of the head. A rough schematic of the arrangement of the different lobes (not at scale) can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>To search for neuronal subtypes in the nervous system, we looked specifically at the cell clusters that express neuronal makers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then assessed the expression patterns of neuronal markers using HCR ISH to gain better insights into the molecular identities of neuronal populations. Probes were generated for the genes <italic>elav-like 1, elav-like 2, amyloid beta-binding-like,</italic> and <italic>tetraspanin-8,</italic> which were all found to be expressed broadly across all neuronal clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). HCR ISH experiments for these probes confirmed their expression throughout the nervous system of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic>, but different genes showed specificities in their expression domains and expression levels. Some regions of the nervous system show co-expression of <italic>elav-like 1</italic> and <italic>elav-like 2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Both genes are highly expressed in the optic lobes and in the neurons of the supraesophageal and suboesophageal mass. However, differences in the expression patterns of <italic>elav-like 1</italic> and <italic>elav-like 2</italic> can be observed: <italic>elav-like 1</italic> is strongly expressed in the medial part of the supraesophageal mass, including neurons of the dorsal basal lobe, vertical lobe, and subvertical lobe, as well as in the optic lobes in the medial portion of the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). <italic>Elav-like 2</italic>, on the other hand, is expressed broadly in the lateral edges of the supraesophageal mass near the optic lobes and in the optic lobes. Interestingly, photoreceptors of the retina do not express <italic>elav-like 1</italic> but only <italic>elav-like 2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The different expression domains are reflected by the scRNAseq data that shows, for instance, that <italic>elav-like 2</italic> expression level is higher than that of <italic>elav-like 1</italic> in Cl05<italic>,</italic> whereas the opposite can be observed in Cl07 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Differences in the expression of these two ELAV homologs suggest that these genes could either serve different functions specific to the neuronal subpopulations in which they are expressed or that the different expression patterns reflect distinct developmental or differentiation states. The data shows that <italic>elav-like 2-</italic>expressing cells are present in the central and peripheral nervous system as well as in the lateral lips, which are shown to be connected to stem cells and neuronal differentiation later in the article (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Molecular mapping of the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic> nervous system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UMAP with clustered identified as neuronal or neuron-related highlighted.

However, at higher magnification, it becomes evident that expression levels differ between cells.

Low expression of <italic>amyloid beta-binding-like</italic> can also be observed in the olfactory organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3F</xref>). Additionally, the scRNAseq data shows that the expression of <italic>amyloid beta-binding-like protein</italic> is lower in the reflectin<sup>+</sup> clusters (Cl20, Cl22, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The transcriptional repressor <italic>scratch-2</italic> was found to be highly expressed in two neuronal clusters (Cl05, Cl15) as well as in a reflectin<sup>+</sup> cluster (Cl22).

The analysis of the expression of <italic>scratch-2</italic> in the scRNAseq dataset highlights that the cells highly expressing this gene are distinct from neurons expressing <italic>elav-like 1</italic>, <italic>tetraspanin-8,</italic> and <italic>amyloid beta-binding-like</italic> but show more transcriptional similarities with <italic>elav-like 2</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p><italic>Fmrf</italic> was shown to be expressed in some cells within the nervous system in agreement with previous anatomical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wollesen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wollesen et al., 2012</xref>). It is expressed in a region located between the dorsal basal lobe and the anterior basal lobe, surrounding the precommissural lobes, the peduncle lobe, the olfactory lobes, on the posterior part of the buccal mass and in the olfactory organ. Some cells expressing <italic>fmrf</italic> are also scattered throughout the optic lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The homeobox transcription factor <italic>LIM homeobox</italic> is expressed in the vertical lobe and subvertical lobe in a domain located between the dorsal basal lobes and the frontal lobes.

We identified a <italic>serotonin transporter</italic> gene that is expressed in the nervous system and more particularly in the medulla of the optic lobes. Low expression of this gene can be observed throughout the nervous system and indicates that the expression of the gene in the nervous system is not specific to an anatomical structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This transporter was, however, very highly expressed in the cornea of eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6D–F</xref>).</p><p>Two receptors for glutamate (<italic>glutr3</italic>) and GABA (<italic>gaba-r</italic>) were also tested with HCR ISH. The results show that a very large proportion of neurons express <italic>glutr3</italic> but <italic>gaba-r</italic> expression is mostly restricted to the medial part of the brain and a few cells of the optic lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Expression of <italic>glutr3,</italic> on the other hand, is observed all over the animals in neuronal tissues but also in epithelial and muscular tissues. This extremely broad expression pattern for <italic>glutr3</italic> indicates that this gene is likely to have other functions unrelated to neuronal communication. The genes involved in neurotransmission normally used to differentiate neuronal populations were expressed only in few cells in the single-cell dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). This could be caused by issues with the quality of the cells or a lack of mapping to the reference transcriptome.

Two clusters (Cl02, Cl14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) do not express specific transcription factors that can be associated with developmental processes but show enrichment of genes involved in cellular proliferation and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In Cl10 and Cl17, the transcription factor <italic>e2f3</italic> is expressed together with other indicators of cellular proliferation, cellular growth, and nucleic acid synthesis such as histone proteins (<italic>H3</italic>), ribosomal proteins (<italic>40s ribosomal protein S13, 40s ribosomal protein s19</italic>), <italic>pcna,</italic> and DNA replication licensing factors (<italic>mcm3, mcm4, mcm5</italic>). The role of <italic>e2f3</italic> to promote cellular proliferation has been shown to be conserved between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. and mammalians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dynlacht et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Attwooll et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DeGregori and Johnson, 2006</xref>). Because these clusters highly express proliferation markers but lack any distinctive features of differentiated cell types, we propose that they may be stem cells. To visualize the expression pattern of this gene, we performed HCR ISH experiments for <italic>e2f3</italic>. The results show that this gene is specifically expressed in the anatomical structure called the lateral lips, which have been described in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deryckere et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests the presence and proliferation of stem cells or progenitors in the lateral lips of squids, consistently with the proposed neurogenic regions of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>.</p><p>In Cl17, Cl21, and Cl26, the transcription factor <italic>achaete-scute</italic> (<italic>asc</italic>), which has a well-studied role in the regulation of nervous system development in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> is expressed together with similar proliferation markers as indicated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cabrera et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Romani et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Skeath and Carroll, 1992</xref>). This is particularly interesting to assess the possible conservation of this gene’s function in nervous system development. The expression pattern revealed by HCR ISH showed a strong similarity with the expression of <italic>e2f3</italic> in the lateral lips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that neuronal progenitors and stem cells are co-located in the lateral lip where they proliferate. Frequent co-expression with <italic>soxB1</italic> in these clusters further supports their neuronal fate because of the conserved involvement of <italic>soxB1</italic> genes in neuronal development in very distantly related species such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals as well as in cephalopods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Arsic et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miyagi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alqadah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Focareta and Cole, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We next analyzed the expression of <italic>soxB1</italic>, which revealed enriched expression in the lateral lips, similarly to <italic>e2f3</italic> and <italic>asc</italic>. Interestingly, the pattern of expression of <italic>soxB1</italic> is broader than <italic>asc</italic> and is also present in most lobes of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together, the overlapping expression patterns of <italic>e2f3, asc</italic>, and <italic>soxB1</italic> in domains associated with cephalopod neurogenesis strongly suggest that stem cells and neuronal progenitors are present the lateral lips of <italic>L. vulgaris,</italic> suggesting that these cells are likely migrating to the nervous system at later differentiation stages. In agreement with a pro-neural function, these cells do not yet express markers of terminally differentiated neurons. It was previously shown that <italic>soxB1</italic> is expressed throughout late embryogenesis in the developing eye of <italic>D. pealeii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Napoli et al., 2022</xref>). We indeed found comparable expression of <italic>soxB1</italic> in the developing eye in <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> pre-hatchling and further detected expression in the developing olfactory organ, suggesting a broader role of <italic>soxB1</italic> in sensory organ development or function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Cl16, Cl19, and Cl30 are characterized by the expression of the forkhead box transcription factor <italic>foxD1</italic>. FoxD genes have been documented to be expressed in the nervous systems of <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevi</italic>, <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and to play a role in the development of neuronal cell types although not exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herrera et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Polevoy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Newman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Janssen et al., 2022</xref>). HCR ISH assessment of the expression of <italic>foxD1</italic> showed that these cells are strongly expressed in the cortex of the optic lobes and in the medial basal and anterior basal lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The expression of <italic>foxD1</italic> is very strong in the cortex of the optic lobes and in the medial and anterior basal lobes but is also sparsely located in the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The expression pattern of <italic>foxD1</italic> indicated that these cell types are present in the nervous system and could therefore be types of neurons or neuronal progenitors. Cl30 also expressed a GATA zinc finger transcription factor (<italic>gata-2</italic>) together with some markers typically associated with blood cells (<italic>hemocyte protein, immunoglobulin, soma-ferritin, apolipophorin</italic>). The expression pattern of <italic>gata-2</italic> is very similar to <italic>foxD1</italic> and is also strongly expressed in the cortex of the optic lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). <italic>Gata-2</italic> expression can also be found at the surface of the arms and in the suckers. The HCR ISH experiments with these different genes showed that the expression of <italic>e2f3</italic> and <italic>asc</italic> is limited to the proliferating cells located in the lateral lips, whereas the expression of <italic>foxD1</italic> and <italic>gata-2</italic> is not found in the lateral lips but inside nervous tissue. The expression pattern of <italic>soxB1</italic> revealed that it is present both in the lateral lips and the nervous tissue of the optic lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>To assess the possible developmental lineages that could link these different clusters together, we performed trajectory analysis on a subset of cells. We selected all the cells from the stem cell clusters (Cl02, Cl10, Cl14, Cl17), the neuronal clusters including photoreceptors and presumed sensory cells (Cl05, Cl07, Cl11, Cl13, Cl27, Cl32), the foxD<sup>+</sup> clusters (Cl16, Cl19, Cl30), and the asc<sup>+</sup> clusters (Cl21, Cl26). These cells were used for subclustering and subsequent trajectory analysis using Monocle3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qiu et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qiu et al., 2017a</xref>). As monocle operates with its own clustering algorithm, we fist verified that the markers tested previously were still clustered together and then proceed to calculate trajectories. We selected the <italic>e2f3</italic> expressing cluster as a starting point for the trajectories and the results indicated that following the proliferative stage where cells express <italic>e2F3</italic> and <italic>asc,</italic> cell trajectories go through a stage where <italic>foxD1</italic> and <italic>gata-2</italic> are strongly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). After this stage, we see increased expression of the markers of differentiated neurons <italic>amyloid beta-binding-like</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The expression of <italic>soxB1</italic> along the trajectory axis appears to be present in the early stages as well as in the differentiated neurons, consistently with the expression patterns previously observed by HCR ISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). The expression level of <italic>soxB1</italic> is, however, very low in the <italic>foxD1</italic>-expressing stage. Additional markers could be plotted along the trajectory axis: the proliferation markers <italic>pcna</italic> and <italic>histone H3</italic> and the transcription factor <italic>elf-2</italic> show similar expression as <italic>e2f3</italic> and <italic>asc</italic> in the early stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The hypothetical intermediate stage characterized by the expression of <italic>foxD1</italic> and <italic>gata-2</italic> could also be correlated with the expression of the transcription factors <italic>ets4</italic> and <italic>hes-4</italic> as well as <italic>chemotrypsin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). <italic>Elav-like 1</italic>, <italic>elav-like 2,</italic> and <italic>synaptogyrin-1</italic> are highly expressed in the differentiated, and although they are present across all clusters, the average expression increases along the differentiation axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To support the results shown by the monocle 3 trajectory inference, we performed a similar analysis with slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Street et al., 2018</xref>). The same cells as for the monocle analysis were selected and re-clustered. The results obtained with slingshot were very similar to those obtained with monocle and showed a trajectory that supports foxD1+ cells as a possible intermediate stage between the proliferative stage where <italic>e2f3</italic> and <italic>asc</italic> are expressed and the differentiated neurons expressing <italic>amyloid beta-binding-like</italic> and higher levels of <italic>elav-like 1</italic> and <italic>elav-like 2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). The calculation of trajectories using these two separate methods provides insights into the developmental relationship between these different identified cell types and provides new hypotheses for the study of neurogenesis of cephalopods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sensory cells</title><p>Vision is a crucial sense for various behaviors of the squids as it is needed for navigating efficiently in open waters in the wild. The eyes of squids are very large and the optic lobes, where visual information is processed and integrated, take up a significant part of the overall volume of the brain. The phototransduction cascade that allows light stimuli to be transformed into an electrical signal in the neurons is well conserved among cephalopods, and we were able to clearly identify photoreceptors in the scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davies et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Monk et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arendt, 2003</xref>). Many important components of the phototransduction cascade are highly expressed in Cl32 such as <italic>trp-like</italic>, <italic>retinochrome</italic>, <italic>arrestin</italic>, <italic>phospholipase C,</italic> and <italic>rhodopsin</italic>. To verify the expression of members of the phototransduction cascade in the photoreceptors, HCR ISH probes for <italic>trp-like</italic> and <italic>rhodopsin</italic> were selected and tested. Both genes showed striking specificity and are expressed in the photoreceptors of the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The olfactory organs of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> are located on the ventral surface of the head (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The genes involved in the function of these sensory organs remain unknown and thus no cell type-specific markers were readily available to identify chemosensory cells of the olfactory organ. However, through screening of some cluster markers of interest, we could observe that the olfactory organ strongly expresses FMRF-related neuropeptides (<italic>fmrf</italic>). Interestingly, the pattern of expression of <italic>fmrf</italic> in the olfactory organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) strongly resembles that of <italic>reflectin-8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>)<italic>,</italic> a gene typically involved in the function of iridophores, which are a specialized subclass of chromatophores. FMRFamide has been previously shown to be involved in the control of chromatophores in squids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loi and Tublitz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sweedler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mobley et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, we observed expression of <italic>elav-like 1</italic> in neurons of the epidermal lines, stripes of cells located on the dorsal epidermis of cephalopods that have been proposed to have a function similar to the lateral lines of fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Budelmann and Bleckmann, 1988</xref>).

Additionally, the cephalopod-specific chromatophores, which are colored or iridescent, have been shown to be modulated by the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dubas et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wardill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gonzalez-Bellido et al., 2014</xref>). Cl08 and Cl09 could be identified as epidermal cells from the scRNAseq data because of the consistent expression of epidermal growth factor EGF-like. In Cl08 and Cl09, <italic>egf-like</italic> was co-expressed with an aminopeptidase (<italic>xaa-pro aminopeptidase</italic>) and <italic>feeding circuit activating peptide-like,</italic> a neuropeptide that was shown to be involved in the feeding circuit in the nervous system of <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sweedler et al., 2002</xref>). Cl08 expressed the markers <italic>tyrosinase</italic> and <italic>tryptophan 2–3 dioxygenase</italic>, two enzymes involved in melanin synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Takeuchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crawford et al., 2020</xref>). HCR ISH experiments confirmed that <italic>egf-like</italic> is expressed in several cells across the epidermis of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Cl31 was characterized as epithelial due to the very specific expression of <italic>epithelial splicing regulatory protein</italic> (<italic>esrp</italic>). HCR ISH for this gene revealed that it is expressed specifically on the surface of the arms, on the epithelium covering the surface of the eyes and in cells of the epidermis, similarly to <italic>egf-like. Esrp</italic> is also expressed at a lower level across the surface of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cl03, Cl04, and Cl12 showed specific enrichment for <italic>papilin</italic>. Studies on the role of <italic>papilin</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> revealed that it is a secreted extracellular protein that acts as a metalloproteinase and is important for embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kramerova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kramerova et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> as well as other cephalopods, the presence of this protein is documented but its function is unknown. These clustered also showed elevated expression of <italic>gluthatione S-transferase,</italic> indicating a possible role of these cells in metabolizing reactive oxygen species. The location of <italic>papilin</italic>-expressing cells was assessed with HCR ISH, and we observed that this gene is expressed in a very particular set of cells of the skin that form characteristic rings around larger epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Although <italic>papilin</italic> is expressed everywhere on the epidermis of the head of <italic>L. vulgaris,</italic> it is absent from the surface of the olfactory organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the layering of the olfactory organ is composed of different cell types than the rest of the epidermis. Cl28 is characterized by the expression of a zinc metalloproteinase <italic>nas 14-like</italic> of unknown function. Due to the co-expression <italic>of collagen-related</italic> genes, <italic>myosins</italic>. and <italic>actins</italic>, these cells were assigned to connective tissue. HCR ISH experiments showed expression of <italic>nas 14-like</italic> throughout the body in large cells with extended processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The branched morphology of these cells is similar to fibroblasts. <italic>Nas-14</italic> is expressed predominantly in the ventral epidermis but is also observed in the dorsal epidermis, the arms, and tentacles and is heavily expressed on the surface of the funnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We analyzed the expression of <italic>reflectin-8,</italic> one of the several <italic>reflectins</italic> expressed in Cl20 and Cl22. However, in addition to having been shown to be also expressed in the olfactory organ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), HCR ISH for this <italic>reflectin</italic> showed broad expression at the surface of the epidermis but also inside the optic lobes and around the anterior basal lobes, superior buccal lobes, and peduncle lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The expression pattern of <italic>reflectin-8</italic> in the nervous system suggests that the involvement of this protein may go beyond its ability to modulate light reflection and could play a role inside the nervous system itself for the modulation of chromatophores and iridophores as is suggested in previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Demski, 1992</xref>). This is also supported by the co-expression of reflectins and the neuronal markers <italic>scratch-2</italic>, <italic>elav-like 1, elav-like 2</italic>, and <italic>rhodopsin-1</italic> in Cl20 and the expression of <italic>LIM homeobox</italic> in Cl22. A <italic>mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor</italic> (<italic>madnf</italic>) is expressed in Cl23<italic>,</italic> Cl27, and Cl31, which were characterized as connective tissue, mechanosensory cells, and epidermis, respectively. HCR ISH experiments for this gene surprisingly show an expression pattern very similar to <italic>reflectin-8</italic>. The results showed that this gene is expressed throughout the nervous system, including in the optic lobes in the medial portion of medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). While <italic>madnf-</italic>expressing cells of Cl27 co-express neuronal markers, the cells of Cl23 and Cl31 do not. Given the observed expression pattern of this gene, it is possible that these cells are a non-neuronal cell type of the nervous system and could be a type of glial cells. Suckers contain a specific cell type that makes up the hard structure of the sucker ring teeth, which are used for holding on to their prey. The sucker ring teeth consist of the protein suckerin, for which we found gene expression in Cl29, which is associated with epidermal tissues. The cells of the suckers expressed many uncharacterized genes, indicating that these cell types are highly specialized in cephalopods. Moreover, we noted co-expression of <italic>myeloperoxidase-like,</italic> a gene involved in antimicrobial activity. It has been shown that <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> suckers express peptides that display structural similarities with antimicrobial α-peptides (AMPs) and exhibited a significant role in antimicrobial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maselli et al., 2020</xref>). It is likely that octopuses and other cephalopods exploit secreted AMPs as part of an innate defense mechanism, similarly to other aquatic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thøgersen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Derby, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Falanga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gogineni and Hamann, 2018</xref>).

The combination of these two techniques allowed us to provide insights into the different cell types that make up the <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> head, into the process of nervous system development and the identity of neuronal subtypes. The data produced for this article enabled the identification of 34 cell clusters that we used as a correlate for cell type diversity. Although the data can provide a broad overview of cell diversity, we note that few cell types that would be expected in the head of cephalopods such as components of the vascular and digestive systems could not be confidently identified in this study. The apparent lack of resolution in the clusters and their low number is likely to be in large part caused by the lack of completeness of the reference transcriptome, which resulted in a lower mapping rate of the single-cell reads. It has been shown in other cephalopods that having a high-quality genome largely contributes to improving cluster resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gavriouchkina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songco-Casey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Styfhals et al., 2022</xref>). Because of the lack of a reference genome for <italic>L. vulgaris,</italic> a non-redundant transcriptome was used as a mapping reference in this study, which has shown to be sufficient for identifying cell types and describing the expression some of their characteristic marker genes but is however not sufficient to affirm full coverage of cell type diversity of this organism. The use of a transcriptome instead of a genome as a reference has been previously shown to enable molecular description of cell types but can lack in resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Duruz et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, it is likely that the transcriptome assembly could be improved by obtaining more RNA from <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> by including different embryonic stages and adult stages. We are convinced that re-running this analysis with a better reference would reinforce our analysis and provide better cell type resolution. In our analysis of the nervous system, we were able to recognize broad neuronal markers that are expressed throughout the nervous system while showing different levels of expression in predicted neuronal cell types. These newly identified neuronal markers will provide a new perspective to study the characteristics of the nervous systems of cephalopods. Particularly, the genes <italic>tetraspanin-8</italic> and <italic>amyloid beta-binding-like</italic> show strikingly elevated expression pan-neuronally. Besides the identified sensory cells, the homogeneity of the neuronal clusters was rather surprising. Different neuronal subpopulations were expected to be identified by the expression of genes neurotransmitter synthesis pathway to distinguish neurons by their chemical modalities. Such fine distinctions between neuronal populations could be found in the nervous systems of <italic>E. berryi</italic> and <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gavriouchkina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songco-Casey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Styfhals et al., 2022</xref>). It is likely that this lack of resolution is due to missing genes in our reference transcriptome, which would classically contribute to distinguishing neuronal populations. The analysis of the expression of two highly expressed members of the ELAV family elav-like 1 and elav-like 2 revealed that although they can be found in most lobes of the nervous system, their expression levels differ in different clusters. Previous studies of ELAV proteins in <italic>S. officinalis</italic> revealed that the gene Sof-Elav1 was expressed in all the lobes of the nervous system but also during early embryogenesis while the other gene Sof-Elav2 was not specific to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buresi et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>O. bimaculoides,</italic> a single neuronal ELAV protein was identified and was observed to be also expressed during neurogenesis and could be used as a neuronal marker to study nervous system development during embryogenesis, similarly to <italic>Sepia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shigeno et al., 2015</xref>). It is interesting to note that contrarily to what was described in cuttlefish and octopus we show two cell type-specific elav genes, which are both expressed in neurons. This challenges the hypothesis of a duplication of the elav gene during lophotrochozoan evolution proposed after the observation of two elav genes in <italic>Capitella</italic> sp<italic>.,</italic> one of which is expressed in neurons while the other is expressed mainly in the mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer and Seaver, 2009</xref>). The identification of two neuronal elav genes in <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> raises the question of whether they are orthologous to the genes studies in <italic>Sepia</italic> and <italic>Octopus</italic> but their function is different. Alternatively, these two neuronal elav genes could the result of another duplication of the neuronal elav. Such questions would need to be further investigated by more thoroughly studying the sequence homology of these genes and reconstruct their phylogeny. We identified key transcription factors involved in stem cells and development. The expression of these genes likely reflects different states of neuronal differentiation and suggests a migration of neuronal progenitors towards the nervous system. We could show that proliferating cells that express of the transcription factor <italic>e2f3</italic> are located in the lateral lips near the nervous system. We interestingly observed the expression of <italic>asc</italic> in the same region, together with several proliferation markers. Extensive study of neurogenesis in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> has shown that the proneural complex <italic>asc</italic> can determine the neuronal fate of quiescent multipotent ectodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Campuzano and Modolell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Skeath and Doe, 1996</xref>). In vertebrates, on the other hand, <italic>asc</italic> is expressed in cells that have already undergone neuronal specification but are self-renewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Soares et al., 2022</xref>). Studies of neurogenesis in the annelid <italic>Capitella teleta</italic> have shown that, similarly to vetrebrates, proneural genes such as <italic>asc</italic> are expressed in self-renewing neuronal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sur et al., 2020</xref>). Our data suggests that <italic>asc</italic> is also expressed in proliferating cells, similiarly to vertrebrates and <italic>C. teleta</italic> but unlike <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This is consistent with documented co-expression of <italic>asc</italic> and the mitotic marker phosphor-histone H3 in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deryckere et al., 2021</xref>). The observation of <italic>soxB1</italic> expression together with <italic>asc</italic> strengthened their characterization as neuronal progenitors due to the documented role of this gene in neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miyagi et al., 2009</xref>). However, strong soxB1 expression in differentiated neurons has been shown in the gastropod <italic>Patella vulgate</italic> and in the cephalopods <italic>S. officinalis</italic> and <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Le Gouar et al., 2004</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Focareta and Cole, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deryckere et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>L. vulgaris,</italic> we observe similar results where <italic>soxB1</italic> is expressed in the lateral lips together with <italic>asc</italic> but is also expressed in differentiated neurons. This was consistently shown by the HCR ISH experiments as well as the single-cell analysis. Therefore, the hypothesis proposed for the action of <italic>soxB1</italic> in the early stages as well as the later stages of neuronal differentiation in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> is consistent with our data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deryckere et al., 2021</xref>). The unexpected expression of <italic>foxD1</italic> in the nervous system of <italic>L. vulgaris,</italic> together with existing evidence of the role of this gene in neuronal development, motivated the grouping of the foxD1<sup>+</sup> clusters with other clusters characterized as neuronal progenitors for further analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herrera et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Polevoy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Newman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Janssen et al., 2022</xref>). Our trajectory inference analysis using monocle3 and slingshot showed that <italic>foxD1</italic> is expressed in cells that could represent an intermediate neuronal differentiation stage following the expression of <italic>asc</italic> but before the expression of <italic>amyloid beta-binding-like</italic> and the second peak of <italic>soxB1</italic> expression. Such a role has been proposed in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> in the cells expressing <italic>neuroD</italic> that are expressed in a gradient between the lateral lip and the central nervous system, which may indicate a pattern of migration of differentiating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deryckere et al., 2021</xref>). We could, however, not correlate these results with our hypothesis of an intermediate <italic>foxD1</italic>-expressing stage because <italic>neuroD</italic> expression could not be detected in specific clusters in our single-cell dataset. Although the trajectories we calculated point towards a role of FoxD1 in neuronal differentiation, the relatively poor cluster resolution and the lack of cells along the trajectory axes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> suggest that this hypothesis would require further investigation that should include a more complete set of genes that have been involved with cephalopod neurogenesis. In our analysis of sensory cells, we provide valuable information regarding the different sensory systems of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> and could identify photoreceptors and additionally describe newly identified markers of the olfactory organ and mechanosensory cells. The sensory cells of cephalopods have been extensively studied and are known to be very complex and can have multiple sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van Giesen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buresch et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>O. bimaculoides</italic> and <italic>S. officinalis,</italic> several chemosensory receptors could be identified and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van Giesen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andouche et al., 2021</xref>). In our analysis of the <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> head, we were however not able to identify putative chemosensory genes, likely due to the absence of characteristic receptors in our transcriptome. The chemosensory function of cells analyzed here was only inferred because of their expression in the olfactory organ. A full analysis of chemosensory genes in <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> would be required to be able to truly describe the diversity of their sensory cell types. Finally, we further characterize the highly specialized epidermis of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> and cephalopod-specific cell types such as suckers or iridophores. The expression of a few genes facilitated the characterization of some of these cell types as exemplified by the expression of <italic>egf-like</italic> in epidermal cells, <italic>suckerin-6</italic> in suckers, and <italic>reflectin-8</italic> in iridophores. However, many cluster-specific genes could not be assigned to a specific function. The abundance of papilin-expressing cells on the surface of the epidermis is striking and had not been previously documented. The gene <italic>madnf</italic> is known to play a role in the maturation and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Palgi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Richman et al., 2018</xref>). We found discrepancies between the observation of <italic>madnf</italic> in non-neuronal clusters and in a small cluster of mechanosensory cells and the expression patterns shown by HCR ISH, where expression is found in different areas of the brain, optic lobes, and olfactory organs. Similarly, the expression of <italic>reflectin-8</italic> is not limited to the chromatophores but is also in the nervous system. The expression of these non-neuronal makers inside the nervous system results highlights the importance of considering non-neuronal cell types, even when aiming to answer neurobiological questions. Many cell types remain unidentified, and further characterization of these cells and the function of the genes that they differentially express could advance our understanding of cephalopod biology. The combination of high-resolution imaging rendered possible by HCR in conjunction with the data provided by single-cell transcriptomics enabled us to extend our understanding of the cell types of cephalopods. The experimental approach is efficient to identify and explore conserved sets of genes conferring cell type identity in these animals while comparing cell type markers across different clades. On the other hand, the accurate anatomical description gained with HCR ISH allowed us to find previously undescribed cell type-specific genes by identifying the anatomical features in which they are expressed, enabling the exploration not only of conserved cell types but also novel ones. By applying single-cell RNA sequencing in a member of this fascinating clade of mollusks and by correlating this data with high-resolution mRNA imaging techniques, we can further understand the main molecular features that drive cell type identity in <italic>L. vulgaris</italic>. The analysis of the expression of selected genes of interest can provide insight into their function, which can be a starting point for future investigations of cephalopod cell types. Further studies of the nervous system of squids and the different cell types that compose them could help fill important gaps in our understanding of the evolution of the nervous system and could provide insights into how brains complexified independently in very distant clades of animals. By comparing the molecular features of neuronal cell types of cephalopods with other species, we could better understand the evolutionary history of the unique brains of cephalopods and identify what confers them such unique capabilities. This is a significant step in the study of convergent evolution of brains and provides a valuable resource for future research on cephalopods.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>L. vulgaris</italic> embryo collection and maintenance</title><p><italic>L. vulgaris</italic> eggs were collected during a sampling project of the European Marine Biological Resource Center (EMBRC) France at the Bay of Morlaix.

The RNA was also tested by spectrophotometry using a Denovix DS-11 FX Spectrophotometer/Fluorometer to assess the purity of the RNA. Once all quality control tests confirmed high-quality RNA, the 'Procedure &amp; Checklist – Iso-Seq Express Template Preparation for Sequel and Sequel II Systems' was followed (PN 101-763-800 version 02 [October 2019]). Two libraries were created from the same total RNA input (300 ng): one targeting 2 kb transcripts and one targeting &gt;3 kb transcripts. Both libraries were SMRT sequenced using a Sequel binding plate 3.0, sequel sequencing plate 3.0 with a 20 hr movie time on a PacBio Sequel system on their own SMRT cell 1M v3 LR. The 2 kb library was loaded at 3 pM and generated 33.90 Gb and 409,187 ≥ Q20 Circular consensus reads (CCS). While the &gt;3 kb library was loaded at 3 pM and produced 27.04 Gb and 248,304 ≥ Q20 CCS. All steps post RNA extraction were performed at the Next Generation Sequencing Platform, University of Bern. High-quality isoforms were generated from PacBio reads using the Iso-Seq analysis pipeline of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) Link (version 9), which generates circular consensus sequencing reads and then clusters and polishes the isoforms.

Afterward, the Coding GENome reconstruction Tool (cogent v 6.0.0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huo et al., 2020</xref>) was used to further reduce redundancy and reconstruct the coding genome. In order to annotate the coding genome, the redundancy removed sequences were blasted against the nr database of NCBI using blastx version 2.9.0 (NCBI Resource Coordinators 2016). We aligned our reference non-redundant transcriptome to the benchmark universal single-copy orthologs database for Mollusca (BUSCOs) and obtained a score of 54.4% (49.8% single-copy, 4.6% duplicated, 1.9% fragmented).

Slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Street et al., 2018</xref>, version 2.2.1) was used as an alternative to calculate trajectories. The 'slingshot' function was run with the embedded clustered Seurat object. Cl9 of the subclustered data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>) was selected as the starting cluster. The resulting trajectories were plotted onto the original clusters obtained with Seurat.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Hybridization chain reaction</title><p>Probes for HCR ISH were ordered and designed by Molecular Instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2016</xref>). Whole pre-hatchlings <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> animals (stages 28–30, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arnold, 1965</xref>) were dissected out of their eggs and were then anesthetized in a mix of 1.7% MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% ethanol, and artificial seawater. After 20 min in the anesthetic solution, the animals were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 48 hr at room temperature. Samples were then washed three times with phosphate buffer (PBS) and were dehydrated and stored in 100% ethanol at –20°C. Prior to HCR ISH experiments, samples were rehydrated in PBS in three 5 min steps. Our HCR ISH protocol used was adapted from the provided 'generic sample in solution' protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2016</xref>) with the following modifications: a light proteinase K treatment was performed before pre-hybridization for 5 min at a concentration of 1 ul/ml in PBS at room temperature and subsequently washed three times with PBS. All volumes were reduced to 200 ul per well. Incubation times for hybridization and amplification were increased to 16–20 hr to increase signal (inappropriate for RNA quantification). DAPI was added together with one of the 5× SSCT washes. Double HCR ISH experiments were performed by combining B1-Alexa-488 hairpins with B2-Alexa-647 hairpins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>Images were taken on Leica Stellaris 8 falcon or a Leica TCS Sp5 laser scanning confocal microscopes. All mosaic images were taken by automatically stitching 3 × 3 or 3 × 4 confocal image stacks with a 10% overlap. Laser power and gain were adjusted depending on the experiment to ensure optimal visualization. Images were treated with ImageJ where the contrast was adjusted. All images are optimized for qualitative assessment and are therefore not appropriately acquired or treated for quantitative analysis or comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Table of top 100 marker genes of all clusters.</title><p>Top differentially expressed marker genes of all clusters.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80670-supp1-v2.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Table of top 10 marker genes of neuronal clusters.</title><p>Top differentially expressed marker genes of clusters with neuronal identity.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80670-supp2-v2.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Table of top 100 marker genes of progenitors in Seurat.</title><p>The 100 most differentially expressed markers obtained with Seurat in progenitor subclusters.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80670-supp3-v2.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Table of top 100 marker genes of progenitors in Monocle.</title><p>The 100 most differentially expressed markers obtained with Monocle in progenitor subclusters.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80670-supp4-v2.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80670-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data have been deposited in GEO under accession code GSE200108.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Duruz</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaldun</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Soudy</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tschanz-Lischer</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicholson</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruggmann</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Molecular characterization of cell types in the squid Loligo vulgaris</data-title><source>NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE200108">GSE200108</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to acknowledge the staff of the station Biologique de Roscoff, France, for organizing the collection and shipment of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> embryos.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Molecular characterization of cell types in the squid <italic>Loligo vulgaris</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sonia Sen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Samuel Reiter (Reviewer #2); Astrid Deryckere (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While appreciating the relevance of this there were a set of common concerns raised by the reviewers that need to be addressed. These are:</p><p>1. The reference transcriptome: A high-quality reference transcriptome will be critical for any downstream analysis. Could the authors please provide data for how they validated their reference transcriptome? For example, the authors could report the BUSCO score for assessing the completeness of their assembly, a cumulative density plot of AED scores for annotation quality, and any other metric they choose. Could the authors also report what percent of their single cell reads mapped to the reference?</p><p>2. The scRNAseq data: Could the authors please provide data that would allow readers to assess the quality of their single-cell data? At a minimum, could they please provide violin plots depicting the range of UMIs, genes, and mitochondrial genes per cell?</p><p>3. Cluster-specific markers: Could the authors please provide dot plots for the top differentially expressed genes for all clusters? In addition to this, the authors have described a set of genes that they did not identify as cell-specific markers (for example, neurotransmission-related ones). Could they please show dot plots for these as well?</p><p>4. Trajectory Analysis: Could the authors please explain how they have chosen the cells used in this analysis, the clustering resolution they have used (please provide a dimplot), and which starting point they have selected? In addition to this, could they please analyze the differentially expressed genes along the trajectory to make their claim stronger? Since this data challenges the current state of the field, it would be useful to demonstrate the robustness of their results by verifying it by:</p><p>4a. Using different trajectory analysis methods (Monocle or FateID).</p><p>4b. Analysing more marker genes (in addition to foxD1) along the differentiation axis.</p><p>5. The writing: Could the authors please pay attention to some aspects of the text to help the reader place their work in the broader context of the field? Specifically:</p><p>a. There are missing references (see detailed reviews below), including three other recently posted cephalopod scRNAseq preprints. Could the authors please incorporate these references?</p><p>b. On occasion, the chronology of the text and figures don't match. There are also some figures that are currently not mentioned in the text. Could the authors please fix this?</p><p>c. Many of the methods are not sufficiently well explained. Could the authors please pay attention to this, particularly for bioinformatics? Could the authors motivate this better?</p><p>d. The Results section contains many points that would belong better in the Discussion section.</p><p>e. Conversely, the discussion as it currently stands, is a summary of the results. Could the authors please revisit their discussion to place their work and findings in the context of the growing field of cephalopod neurobiology?</p><p><italic>Review #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I was concerned about the quality of the scRNAseq data for a few reasons:</p><p>- The number of genes per cells (200-2000) seems low to me.</p><p>- The clusters don't really resolve.</p><p>- Many genes that one would have expected to pick up, for example, neurotransmitter-related genes for the neuronal cluster, were not picked up.</p><p>So, could the authors please provide the violin plots depicting the range of UMIs, genes, and mitochondrial genes per cell?</p><p>2. It was not clear to me how the authors picked the marker genes. Could they provide the top 20 DEGs for each of the clusters?</p><p>3. The signal in each of the images could be enhanced. To orient the reader, it would also be useful to have an inset of each of the expression patterns in the whole head. Some of these are really nicely represented in the supplementary information.</p><p>4. The authors should refer to the three recent preprints that have used scRNAseq in other cephalopods and, in the discussion, place their work in this context.</p><p>5. In general, could the authors elaborate their method sections? Many fairly important aspects are too briefly described – for example, the reference transcriptome and its validation and the selection of marker genes, among others.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The core of this study is the analysis of scRNAseq data. Here the authors assembled a transcriptome de novo. I wonder about the quality of this assembly, as it will affect all downstream analysis. The other 3 studies (Styfhals et al. bioRxiv 2022.01.24.477459; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.24.477459; Songco-Casey et al. bioRxiv 2022.06.11.495763; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.11.495763; Gavriouchkina et al., bioRxiv 2022.05.26.490366; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.26.490366) all refer to the necessity of a high-quality reference genome for a high-quality transcriptome. If this is not the case here, it would be useful to quantify this.</p><p>I found the analysis of stem cells and progenitors quite interesting. The authors profile specific markers for cell types, map these cell types onto interesting anatomical regions, and analyze developmental trajectories defined transcriptomically.</p><p>In other parts of the paper, I was surprised that many cell types could not be defined based on certain marker genes/small combinations of genes. Figure 2b, for example, shows that clusters have a great deal of overlapping expression among 'marker' genes. This would deviate quite a bit from the other scRNAseq studies I am familiar with. I could see a few possible explanations: (1) This is a product of low-quality transcriptome assembly/single-cell data (2) This is a product of the immature developmental stage of the animal, and (3) This reflects a cephalopod-specific transcriptomic signature.</p><p>I doubt possibility 3, as the other 3 cephalopod scRNAseq papers describe cell types well differentiated (eg. By neurotransmitter expression, Figure 2 in Songco-Casey et al. 2022, Figure 3 in Gavriouchkina et al. 2022). The fact that specific neurotransmitters are often not well localized to specific cell types here calls for an explanation. Similarly, the lack of differentiation of neural types even when analyzed separately from other cell types (Figure 2c). Many phototransduction genes are expressed in Cluster 32, and these genes are expressed, specifically in the retina. They could potentially be used as a sanity test for the scRNAseq: Are these genes only found in cluster 32?</p><p>The lack of specific marker genes makes some of the FISH experiments in this manuscript less informative than others. Many plots show anatomical localization of a gene broadly expressed in many cell types, meaning we cannot conclude how transcriptomically identified clusters map spatially. In other cases, FISH is used to mark individual cell types. In some cases, it is not clear which situation we are looking at. It would be useful to have a quantification of how specifically the marker genes used in FISH experiments mark individual clusters.</p><p>The authors observe a similar anatomical expression of fmrf and reflectin-8 in the olfactory organ. Because these have been linked to chromatophore and iridiophore control, they argue that this suggests that chromatophores and iridiophores are modulated through the olfactory organs. I find this plausible but the logic questionable. FMRF has many functions unrelated to chromatophore modulation, so just observing its presence seems insufficient to make statements about the neural control of chromatophores. Reflectin-8 is shown later in the manuscript to be broadly expressed in the epidermis and brain (Figure 5c).</p><p>I was not clear why the expression of elav-like 1 in the epidermal lines 'informs on their potential mechanosensory function'. With elav-like 1 expressed very broadly across cell types and anatomical locations.</p><p>The expression of the cilia-associated protein, rab3 and synaptogyrin-1, and other cilia/flagella markers in cluster 27 suggested that this corresponds to a mechanosensory population. To test whether this is neural, the authors take the subset of cells in the dataset expressing amyloid β- binding-like (a neural marker) and see whether a subset of these also expresses the collection of sensory markers. This seems round about to me. Why not look directly at whether the cells in cluster 27 express amyloid β- binding-like? If the probability of co-expression is high, then concluding that these cells are neurons seems warranted. If the probability is lower, then the conclusion does not seem warranted. The author's existing analysis does not address the possibility that non-neurons (those not expressing amyloid β- binding-like) express the collection of sensory markers.</p><p>Line 63: 'Coleoid cephalopods, which have internalized or lost their shell over evolutionary time 64 were able to swim more easily and could exploit other niches.'</p><p>Not clear what 'other' refers to. The niches of ammonoids? Not clear whether it was the loss of shell that led to niche exploitation or the other way.</p><p>Line 93 &quot;… as a first step to understanding cephalopod evolution&quot;. I'm not clear why a molecular comparison would be a first step to understanding cephalopod evolution. What then is the non-molecular evolutionary story given earlier in the introduction?</p><p>Figure 2 Are the Umap plots in 2c re-estimated on the subset of data in A? If so, I don't see a description of this in the methods section, and I am surprised at the lack of cell type differentiation among neurons.</p><p>Figure 4D is described as 'feature plots'. Is this UMAP? How are the plots on the right-hand side generated?</p><p>The developmental trajectory analysis using slingshot could be better explained in text/methods/figure legend and not easily interpretable from Figure 3e if one is not familiar with the technique</p><p>'Additionally, the cephalopod-specific chromatophores, which are colored or iridescent, have been suggested to be modulated by the nervous system'. Maybe I am misunderstanding the sentence, but as I read it this is an understatement of what we know. Over 50 years of work have profiled the neural control of chromatophores in detail.</p><p>Some of the supplementary figures are quite dark. Why not increase the brightness of the images? Others like Figure 4 supplement 1 are beautiful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>First of all, I would like to congratulate the authors on the extensive expression analysis study performed in this manuscript. However, I believe that this dataset offers so many more opportunities to better understand cell types in cephalopods, and in general, the data could be analysed and interpreted in more detail.</p><p>Since the field of scRNAseq is moving incredibly fast, the authors should be careful with claims of being first (e.g. Abstract line 34). Preprints of scRNAseq data in the nervous system of other cephalopods have been recently published (Styfhals 2022, Gavriouchkina 2022, Songco-Casey 2022).</p><p>The manuscript is missing key citations to support the results and to provide a comparative view of gene expression in other cephalopods. For example, the expression patterns of Elav, SoxB1, Asc have been reported during the development of octopus, squid, and cuttlefish, and could enhance the interpretation of the results observed in Loligo.</p><p>In general, the reader needs to be proficient in the brain areas of cephalopods in order to follow the results. Therefore, the manuscript would benefit from a short introduction of the main brain lobes in cephalopods to be accessible to a wider audience, either in the introduction or in the results in Figure 1C.</p><p>Please make sure to refer to the figures and figure panels chronologically. Multiple figure panels are not referred to throughout the text (e.g. the first figure described is Figure 1B and there is no notion to Figure 1A, similar to Figure 2, …).</p><p>The authors distinguish 33 cell clusters when using 25 pca's and a resolution of 2. The UMAP, however, shows most cells in one single, central blob. This is striking knowing how different connective tissue is from neurons. Did the authors try other methods for clustering and dimensionality reduction, or change the parameters in the current algorithm to try to resolve the data better? It would also be helpful to specify the filtering parameters for filtering out low-quality cells in the methods section.</p><p>In the first section of the results, the authors list a handful of enriched genes used to differentiate the major cell type categories. However, little explanation is given to why these genes were chosen and a comprehensive overview supporting the claims is missing. It would help the reader if they would add a plot (e.g. a DotPlot) to support these data. In addition, a UMAP plot with cells colored according to cell cycle could clearly show where the progenitor cells are located on the UMAP.</p><p>To avoid going back and forth between cell type categories in the first results paragraph, it would be helpful to describe Cl 27 (lines 202 onwards) and Cl 32 (lines 207 onwards) with the other nervous system cells, and Cl 29 (lines 213 onwards) with the epidermis section.</p><p>In order to interpret HCR expression patterns, the authors should add axis labels to the figures. In addition, I understand that the figure panels are small to add annotation of the brain regions, but since we are looking at different levels through the brain, either a schematic with the figure or annotation would really help.</p><p>The authors should explain the analysis performed to obtain the UMAP(?) plots in Figure 2C. Which cells were selected? Were they re-clustered? What do the clusters look like?</p><p>Did the authors perform image manipulation e.g. Figure 2C and 2D for the DAPI channel? Why is DAPI absent from the neurons in the tetraspanin-8 HCR, or the serotonin transporter staining?</p><p>In Figure 3B, it would be helpful to add some genes involved in proliferation, as exemplified in the text.</p><p>The authors claim that neural stem cells undergo neuronal differentiation and then migrate to the nervous system. However, evidence is missing as the authors do not show where progenitor cells stop dividing and start to differentiate.</p><p>The use of the marker foxD1 for differentiation neurons is not well supported. Additional marker analysis is required before this can be claimed.</p><p>The authors need to explain which clusters were used for trajectory analysis using Slingshot and how the data were reclustered. Were non-neuronal stem cells included? This might skew the analysis. Importantly, the method was not described in the methods section. It is critical for the readers to know which endpoints were selected in the slingshot algorithm. Off note, the slingshot is very dependent on clustering resolution and will try to connect all clusters. Have the authors tried a different pseudotime analysis method such as Monocle or FateID? Additionally, can the authors elaborate on which transcription factors are steering this differentiation? In the current state, the analysis is preliminary and contradicts present data on the origin and trajectory of neurons in the cephalopod brain (see comment below; Koenig et al. 2016, Deryckere et al. 2021).</p><p>With the current interpretation of the data, the authors claim that foxd1 cells are an intermediate developmental state of neurons. This would be very striking since the cortex of the optic lobe has been described as being the inner retina. Additionally, it is contradicting the expression of amyloid β-binding like in the optic lobe cortex, which the authors say is only expressed in differentiated neurons. Is amyloid β-binding-like expressed in clusters 15, 19, and 20? How about other markers for differentiated neurons? What would all those intermediate cells do there? Do the authors think they migrate into the medulla or even the central brain? This is contradicting existing literature on the origin of neurons in the cephalopod brain (Koenig 2016, Deryckere 2021) and requires in-depth discussion.</p><p>The authors prepared beautiful summary diagrams in Figures 3 and 4. However, they should be referred to in the main text.</p><p>After performing extensive HCR expression studies, can the authors go back to their scRNAseq data and better annotate the different clusters?</p><p>In order to better understand neuronal diversity and neural cell types (as the authors claim), the dataset has to be analyzed in more depth. 33 clusters/cell types seem low given the number of cells that were sequenced and the different tissues that were sampled. Can the authors identify the different brain regions when subclustering the neurons? Can they identify and annotate different neural cell types?</p><p>The authors present several striking findings. However, at the moment, the Discussion section explains the results obtained in the paper, but does not place the acquired data within the current state-of-the-art. Parts of the results should be moved to the discussion and the discussion should be elaborated on.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Line 76: &quot;by the use its specialized iridescent cells&quot; misses an of</p><p>Line 97: it would be helpful for the readers to add the &quot;pre-hatchling stage&quot; to stage 28, as was done in the Results section for the audience to have a better idea of what stage was studied.</p><p>Throughout the text (starting line 219) please write &quot;HCR ISH&quot; instead of just &quot;HCR&quot;.

What identity are the authors referring to? Genes involved in proliferation etc do not give identity to stem cells and Cl02 and Cl14 are also actively cycling. Do the authors suggest only Cl10 and Cl17 are stem cells? Can the authors show more evidence?</p><p>Lines 350-359: I would suggest moving this part to the discussion and incorporating the following comments:</p><p>Lines 347-352: The expression of Asc is not as well conserved as the authors suggest. Indeed, it has some proneuronal role, but the level of differentiation in the cell it is expressed is very different across the animal tree. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> as in other non-insect arthropods, Asc is expressed in quiescent ectodermal cells to drive them into the neural lineage (formation of a neural progenitor cell) (e.g. Cabrera et al., 1987; Skeath and Carroll, 1992). In contrast, in vertebrates and also in spiralia such as capitella teleta, Ascl1 is expressed in neural progenitor cells to drive them into differentiation (e.g. Bertrand 2002; Sur 2020). Ascl1 expression has been studied in octopus and seems to have a similar function as in capitella, not <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Deryckere 2021). This scRNAseq dataset has the power to test this hypothesis and figure out whether, in cephalopods, as is expressed in proliferating and not quiescent cells.</p><p>Lines 354-355: this conclusion does not reflect the data shown. The authors are showing proliferating stem cells, not the location of differentiation. In octopus, differentiation seems to happen in the transition zones (NeuroD cells, Deryckere 2021). It would be interesting to locate those cells in your dataset.</p><p>Lines 356-359: Again here, one needs to be careful to extrapolate the functionality of a gene in one species to other species. In invertebrates, SoxB1 is also expressed in differentiated neurons (e.g. Le Gouar et al., 2004; Semmler et al., 2010). Additionally, expression of SoxB1 has been described in Sepia (Focareta and Cole, 2016) and octopus (Deryckere 2021), indicating expression in neurons (with some interesting discrepancies). Furthermore, be careful with the use of the word &quot;neuroblast&quot; because it refers to different types of cells in different animals.</p><p>Line 361: &quot;Interestingly&quot; it seems a general theme for cephalopods, and maybe invertebrates in general (see comment above).</p><p>Line 367: Data are missing to show where the neural progenitor cells differentiate.</p><p>Line 370-374: in line with this, SoxB1 expression is also found in sensory epithelia of sepia and octopus (e.g. suckers and statocyst; Baratte, S. and Bonnaud 2009; Deryckere 2021).</p><p>Line 376-378: add a reference and elaborate. Regulators of development is a very general process. In addition &quot;for this reason, these cells were presumed to be differentiating cells&quot;: this is an overstatement and needs additional gene expression patterns to support this presumption.</p><p>Line 382-385: optic lobe cortex = inner and outer granular layers, please adjust and rephrase. From Figure 3C upper panel, it seems that Foxg1 is also expressed in the medulla. Or is this all cortex? Annotation would be helpful here.</p><p>Line 386: this is an overstatement. Most neurons in the brain express elav1 and the function of foxD1 is very broad. Additional markers (like for example NeuroD) are required to support this claim.</p><p>Lines 394-400: Figure 3D is not mentioned in the text and seems substantial. The authors might also want to revise it with the comments above and in public review.</p><p>Lines 408-411: please add references to support these statements.</p><p>Lines 419-421: Why did the authors choose to map the expression of Pax9? Koenig et al. studied the eye in Doryteuthis and mapped the expression of several genes important for eye development. A reference to this work would be appropriate here. Pax9 is not an eye gene in vertebrates and invertebrates (in contrast to Pax2/6). In which clusters is it expressed (again here, a dotplot of the genes under study would be helpful)? The level of the image in Figure 4A for Pax9 is also different than the others, why is this? In which cells of the eye is Pax9 expressed?</p><p>Line 448: Figure 5B should be Figure 4B I think.</p><p>Line 457: can the authors verify that they selected cells with expression level &gt;3? From the legend in Figure 4D, the expression level of 3 seems present in a lot of cells (it looks more like the selected level was 5). In addition, the authors should explain how they obtained the graphs on the right. It looks like they underwent an extra transformation? Or are they just distorted?</p><p>Line 459, and together with the comment above: It would be helpful to be able to check the cluster numbers. For example, are cilia-associated protein cells from Cl27?

Please revise.</p><p>Line 545 and onwards: please not only discuss the results obtained but place the discussion in the state-of-the-art literature. Several statements have already been proposed in other papers which deserve to be referenced (e.g. lines 559, 568). Multiple genes mapped with HCR in this manuscript have been described in other cephalopods and assigned a preliminary function (e.g. Buresi 2013, 2014; Shigeno 2015; Koenig 2016; Focareta 2016; Deryckere 2021 and others).

These are:</p><p>1. The reference transcriptome: A high-quality reference transcriptome will be critical for any downstream analysis. Could the authors please provide data for how they validated their reference transcriptome? For example, the authors could report the BUSCO score for assessing the completeness of their assembly, a cumulative density plot of AED scores for annotation quality, and any other metric they choose. Could the authors also report what percent of their single cell reads mapped to the reference?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have now included metrics about the reference transcriptome that was used for this study. We discuss the implications of using a transcriptome instead of a genome for the downstream analysis and emphasize this point as the main limitation of our analysis. We now include the suggested parameters and report the BUSCO score (s 876-882) and the mapping rate of the reads to the reference in figure 1 —figure supplement 1 and discuss that the low mapping rate is directly linked to the coverage of the reference transcriptome. We agree that a high-quality genome would be better for single cell RNAseq analysis, however transcriptomes provide an alternative if a genome is not available. We are indeed planning in the future to sequencing the <italic>Loligo vulgaris</italic> genome, given the genome size of many cephalopods this remains still likely a major effort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The scRNAseq data: Could the authors please provide data that would allow readers to assess the quality of their single-cell data? At a minimum, could they please provide violin plots depicting the range of UMIs, genes, and mitochondrial genes per cell?</p></disp-quote><p>We now added a figure supplement (figure 1 —figure supplement 1) that shows violin plots for the gene-per-cell counts, number of UMIs and percentage of mitochondrial genes to better assess the quality and variability of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Cluster-specific markers: Could the authors please provide dot plots for the top differentially expressed genes for all clusters? In addition to this, the authors have described a set of genes that they did not identify as cell-specific markers (for example, neurotransmission-related ones). Could they please show dot plots for these as well?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a supplementary figure with large dot plot that shows the top ten differentially expressed genes in each of the 34 clusters to help the reader identify the genes discussed in this study as well as potential other markers that are not discussed (figure 1 —figure supplement 2). We also provide dot plots for the neuronal markers that were not cluster-specific but for which we performed HCR ISH experiments. These plots are part of a new supplement (figure 2 —figure supplement 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Trajectory Analysis: Could the authors please explain how they have chosen the cells used in this analysis, the clustering resolution they have used (please provide a dimplot), and which starting point they have selected? In addition to this, could they please analyze the differentially expressed genes along the trajectory to make their claim stronger? Since this data challenges the current state of the field, it would be useful to demonstrate the robustness of their results by verifying it by:</p><p>4a. Using different trajectory analysis methods (Monocle or FateID).</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an important point. We agree with the reviewers that the explanation for the trajectories was not precise enough. We now provide more detailed information about how the trajectories were calculated and which parameters were used in a new section of the material and methods section titles &quot;trajectory inference&quot; (lines 961-981). We replicated the results obtained with slingshot by running the analysis using monocle3. We decided to include the monocle-based trajectories in the main figure (Figure 3) and the results obtained are described in the manuscript (lines 461-489).</p><p>We also identified additional genes that can be followed along the trajectory axes (Figure 3 —figure supplement 4). The analysis using slingshot is now part of the supplementary data and we could also follow the expression of several genes along the trajectory on a dot plot (Figure 3 —figure supplement 5, lines 490-501).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The writing: Could the authors please pay attention to some aspects of the text to help the reader place their work in the broader context of the field? Specifically:</p><p>a. There are missing references (see detailed reviews below), including three other recently posted cephalopod scRNAseq preprints. Could the authors please incorporate these references?</p><p>b. On occasion, the chronology of the text and figures don't match. There are also some figures that are currently not mentioned in the text. Could the authors please fix this?</p><p>c. Many of the methods are not sufficiently well explained. Could the authors please pay attention to this, particularly for bioinformatics? Could the authors motivate this better?</p><p>d. The Results section contains many points that would belong better in the Discussion section.</p><p>e. Conversely, the discussion as it currently stands, is a summary of the results. Could the authors please revisit their discussion to place their work and findings in the context of the growing field of cephalopod neurobiology?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestions for improving the writing. We added the missing references for the three recent cephalopod single-cell studies. We also added additional references to better support the rationale and the interpretation of the data. We checked the chronology of the figures and made sure that all figures and supplements are cited in the text. We developed the methods section to include more detail about the downstream analysis of the data and the bioinformatics. As stated above, we now also give more detailed information about the calculation of trajectories for figure 3 (Materials and methods, trajectory inference). We also included the information that was previously missing about the sub-clustering parameters used for figures 2 and 3 in the Materials and methods on lines 944-957. We developed the discussion to better place our findings within the existing literature and to further address possible issues with the analysis. Because the results are very descriptive by nature, we decided to keep some of the discussion-like elements in the Results section to provide the reader with a minimum of context before reaching the discussion. However, all the points mentioned in the results are then discussed more in depth in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Review #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. I was concerned about the quality of the scRNAseq data for a few reasons:</p><p>- The number of genes per cells (200-2000) seems low to me.</p><p>- The clusters don't really resolve.</p><p>- Many genes that one would have expected to pick up, for example, neurotransmitter-related genes for the neuronal cluster, were not picked up.</p><p>So, could the authors please provide the violin plots depicting the range of UMIs, genes, and mitochondrial genes per cell?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. As discussed in point 1 of the joint reviews, we now provide the metrics for the quality of the RNAseq experiments as well as the reference transcriptome and the details concerning mapping rate of the single-cell reads (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1, lines 132-153). The quality of the metrics of the single cell RNAseq experiments are of high standards. Based on combined metrics of transcriptome and single-cell RNseq, we propose that the lack of some relevant marker genes and neuron-specific markers is caused by coverage of the reference transcriptome. This is likely due to low expression level and transcript abundance of some critical markers, indeed property that differs between transcritpomes and genomes. We now also discuss that the use of a transcriptome versus genome impacts the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It was not clear to me how the authors picked the marker genes. Could they provide the top 20 DEGs for each of the clusters?</p></disp-quote><p>Markers were chosen typically from the top differential expressed genes. We now provide a list of the top hundred DEGs for each cluster in supplementary table 1. Additionally, the expression of the top 10 differentially expressed genes for each cluster can now be seen on a dot plot included as figure 1 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The signal in each of the images could be enhanced. To orient the reader, it would also be useful to have an inset of each of the expression patterns in the whole head. Some of these are really nicely represented in the supplementary information.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. The contrast was enhanced on all the confocal micrographs. To help the reader understand the pictures shown on the main figures, we provide an inset showing the location of the micrograph in the animal as well as anatomical annotations, similarly to the figure supplements. We additionally include a description of the anatomy of the <italic>Loligo</italic> nervous system in the Results section on lines 253-266 with a supporting figure (figure 2 —figure supplement 1) to help orient the reader. When available, the overviews of the tiled confocal micrograph showing the whole head are available in the figure supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should refer to the three recent preprints that have used scRNAseq in other cephalopods and, in the discussion, place their work in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cited these three papers and have placed out analysis in the context of these studies (Lines 98, 656 and 679).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In general, could the authors elaborate their method sections? Many fairly important aspects are too briefly described – for example, the reference transcriptome and its validation and the selection of marker genes, among others.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed agree with this point. We have further and extended developed the results and Materials and methods section to include more details about the transcriptome quality assessment as well as the mapping rate of the reads to the transcriptome (Results: lines 132-153). We added a more detailed description of the clustering and sub-clustering process done in Seurat and we wrote a new section to describe the way the trajectories from figure 3 were obtained (Materials and methods: lines 961-981).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The core of this study is the analysis of scRNAseq data. Here the authors assembled a transcriptome de novo. I wonder about the quality of this assembly, as it will affect all downstream analysis. The other 3 studies (Styfhals et al. bioRxiv 2022.01.24.477459; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.24.477459; Songco-Casey et al. bioRxiv 2022.06.11.495763; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.11.495763; Gavriouchkina et al., bioRxiv 2022.05.26.490366; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.26.490366) all refer to the necessity of a high-quality reference genome for a high-quality transcriptome. If this is not the case here, it would be useful to quantify this.</p><p>I found the analysis of stem cells and progenitors quite interesting. The authors profile specific markers for cell types, map these cell types onto interesting anatomical regions, and analyze developmental trajectories defined transcriptomically.</p><p>In other parts of the paper, I was surprised that many cell types could not be defined based on certain marker genes/small combinations of genes. Figure 2b, for example, shows that clusters have a great deal of overlapping expression among 'marker' genes. This would deviate quite a bit from the other scRNAseq studies I am familiar with. I could see a few possible explanations: (1) This is a product of low-quality transcriptome assembly/single-cell data (2) This is a product of the immature developmental stage of the animal, and (3) This reflects a cephalopod-specific transcriptomic signature.</p><p>I doubt possibility 3, as the other 3 cephalopod scRNAseq papers describe cell types well differentiated (eg. By neurotransmitter expression, Figure 2 in Songco-Casey et al. 2022, Figure 3 in Gavriouchkina et al. 2022). The fact that specific neurotransmitters are often not well localized to specific cell types here calls for an explanation. Similarly, the lack of differentiation of neural types even when analyzed separately from other cell types (Figure 2c). Many phototransduction genes are expressed in Cluster 32, and these genes are expressed, specifically in the retina. They could potentially be used as a sanity test for the scRNAseq: Are these genes only found in cluster 32?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these valuable comments. In light of the documented impact of reference quality on the downstream analysis, we now provide additional information regarding the quality of the single-cell reads and the reference transcriptome (Results: lines 132-153, figure 1 —figure supplement 1). As mentioned above (joint reviewer comments) we indeed fully agree that a reference genome would be beneficial for the downstream analysis of sc-RNAseq data. We aim to take this on the task of generating a <italic>Loligo vulgaris</italic> genome in the future. With the transcriptome as reference, we cannot exclude that some cell types do not resolve because of the developmental stage of the animal. The analysis of the completeness of the transcriptome as measured by its BUSCO score, it seems a likely explanation for the lack of cluster resolution. This is probably most relevant for the absence of some genes such as makers of neurotransmitter synthesis pathway or patterning transcription factors. However, we feel that the current analysis provides a substantial advance, particularly in an otherwise molecularly underexplored taxon. With the reference markers we can identify and characterizes most clusters. Most importantly we feel that the histological correlation and mapping of cell types in situ is powerful. When looking at the example of phototransduction genes, they are very specifically expressed in cluster 32 but they can also be found in other cell types at much lower expression levels. The cell-type specificity observed with HCR ISH in the retina may not be the full picture. As in most other species one might expect these genes to be also present in other cells and other tissues, as exemplified in recent years in model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> or mouse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lack of specific marker genes makes some of the FISH experiments in this manuscript less informative than others. Many plots show anatomical localization of a gene broadly expressed in many cell types, meaning we cannot conclude how transcriptomically identified clusters map spatially. In other cases, FISH is used to mark individual cell types. In some cases, it is not clear which situation we are looking at. It would be useful to have a quantification of how specifically the marker genes used in FISH experiments mark individual clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We now provide additional information regarding the cell type specificity of markers of interest in the supplementary table 1 and in figure 1 —figure supplement 2. Generally, the choice of marker genes was more based on the availability of information and literature regarding their function or cell type specificity rather than a purely mathematical selection. This explains why some of the genes picked in our analysis are not always the markers with the lowest p-value but are the ones that have been previously associated with cell types of interest, development and, in certain cases, that are candidates for marking novel cell types as exemplified by the sections about <italic>papilin</italic> and <italic>madnf</italic> expression. It is indeed an intriguing idea to start probing for instance cephalopod or <italic>Loligo</italic> specific genes in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors observe a similar anatomical expression of fmrf and reflectin-8 in the olfactory organ. Because these have been linked to chromatophore and iridiophore control, they argue that this suggests that chromatophores and iridiophores are modulated through the olfactory organs. I find this plausible but the logic questionable. FMRF has many functions unrelated to chromatophore modulation, so just observing its presence seems insufficient to make statements about the neural control of chromatophores. Reflectin-8 is shown later in the manuscript to be broadly expressed in the epidermis and brain (Figure 5c).</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed important and we fully agree with your point. We apologize for this overstatement. We have now reformulated this sentence. It now reads: &quot; FMRFamide has been previously shown to be involved in the control of chromatophores in squids (Loi and Tublitz 2000; Sweedler et al. 2000; Satpute-Krishnan et al. 2006; Mobley et al. 2008)&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was not clear why the expression of elav-like 1 in the epidermal lines 'informs on their potential mechanosensory function'. With elav-like 1 expressed very broadly across cell types and anatomical locations.</p></disp-quote><p>Several genes that we analyzed are highly expressed in some clusters but are also expressed at lower levels in other tissues. As discussed above with the example of phototransduction genes, HCR experiments tend to only reveal cell-types in which the gene is highly expressed. For this reason, we interpreted the high signal from the epidermal lines as an indication of the presence of neurons in this structure. The mechanosensory modality of these neurons is based on studies done in other cephalopods. We reformulated the sentence to make this clearer.</p><p>It now reads: &quot; The expression of <italic>elav-like 1</italic> in this structure in <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> is consistent with their proposed mechanosensory function other cephalopods.&quot;</p><p>The differential expression of the two elav genes is quite interesting and might reflect different functions as recent results in <italic>Drosophila</italic> of the three Elav-family members (Elav, Fne and Rbp9) suggest (Lee et al., 2021,Plos Genetics).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The expression of the cilia-associated protein, rab3 and synaptogyrin-1, and other cilia/flagella markers in cluster 27 suggested that this corresponds to a mechanosensory population. To test whether this is neural, the authors take the subset of cells in the dataset expressing amyloid β- binding-like (a neural marker) and see whether a subset of these also expresses the collection of sensory markers. This seems round about to me. Why not look directly at whether the cells in cluster 27 express amyloid β- binding-like? If the probability of co-expression is high, then concluding that these cells are neurons seems warranted. If the probability is lower, then the conclusion does not seem warranted. The author's existing analysis does not address the possibility that non-neurons (those not expressing amyloid β- binding-like) express the collection of sensory markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. We indeed realized that this is a circular argument in this case as cells were originally identified as neurons on the basis of the expression of markers such as amyloid-β binding. The intent was to visually represent the co-expression of these newly identified sensory markers with neuronal markers. We changed figure 4 to plot the expression of the sensory genes in the set of neuronal genes used in figure 2. We reformulated the sentence to highlight that this is not a proof of their neuronal identify but rather a demonstration that the hypothesis regarding sensory cell types is consistent with the hypotheses made in the previous sections. It now reads: &quot; The results highlight the co-expression of neuronal markers and sensory markers, therefore supporting their sensory identity (figure 4D).&quot; (lines 550-553).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 63: 'Coleoid cephalopods, which have internalized or lost their shell over evolutionary time 64 were able to swim more easily and could exploit other niches.'</p><p>Not clear what 'other' refers to. The niches of ammonoids? Not clear whether it was the loss of shell that led to niche exploitation or the other way.</p></disp-quote><p>We now specify that coleoid cephalopods were able to access resources in open waters, which was not the case for shelled cephalopods. It is not possible to confidently state that one event caused the other in this case. However, the exploitation of different niches, which was only possible because of the increased mobility of coleoid cephalopods, favored the differences in nervous system anatomy that can be observed today between Nautilus and coleoid cephalopods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 93 &quot;… as a first step to understanding cephalopod evolution&quot;.

An introduction to the brain areas that are mentioned in the manuscript is now available at the paragraph &quot;molecular mapping of the <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> nervous system&quot; (lines 253 – 266). To better understand the spatial arrangements of the lobes, we also provide a rough schematic of the anatomy in a new figure supplement (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please make sure to refer to the figures and figure panels chronologically.

We have now checked the chronology of the figures, so that they appear in the right order in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors distinguish 33 cell clusters when using 25 pca's and a resolution of 2. The UMAP, however, shows most cells in one single, central blob. This is striking knowing how different connective tissue is from neurons. Did the authors try other methods for clustering and dimensionality reduction, or change the parameters in the current algorithm to try to resolve the data better? It would also be helpful to specify the filtering parameters for filtering out low-quality cells in the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed noticed that the resolution of the clusters using different tissues (such as in the head) is quite different from resolving similar cells in the brain, which we have mainly focused on in the past. We have initially tested several values for PCs and resolution and felt 25 PCs and resolution 2 gave the best result. This issue of having clusters too close to each other could not be resolved using different clustering parameters (PCA selection method, number of PCs, cluster resolution). Representing the data with TSNE instead of UMAP also showed similar issues. We propose in the discussion that such lack of resolution, although it is sufficient to analyze cell types, is due to missing genes in the reference transcriptome (Results: lines 367-372, discussion: lines 652-666, 680-682). It is actually an intriguing point we frequently discuss which way might be more adequate: splitting or grouping clusters; this may be partly a semantic issue or a matter of taste and mostly decide on a middle path.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the first section of the results, the authors list a handful of enriched genes used to differentiate the major cell type categories. However, little explanation is given to why these genes were chosen and a comprehensive overview supporting the claims is missing. It would help the reader if they would add a plot (e.g. a DotPlot) to support these data. In addition, a UMAP plot with cells colored according to cell cycle could clearly show where the progenitor cells are located on the UMAP.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a good point. As mentioned above, the genes were chosen among a list of differentially expressed genes in the clusters. The choice among the top markers is made based on previous knowledge on the association of the gene to a specific cell type. For example, genes of unknown function that have never been studied in other species were not selected in our analysis because they could not inform us on the identity of cell types, even though they may be statistically relevant. The choice of markers was generally subjective based on our own interests and pre-existing knowledge as the systematic analysis of all the top markers would have been practically impossible in our case. To provide the reader with a better idea of the relevance of the genes chosen in this study, we now provide a dot plot showing the top markers across all cluster (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2) in addition to the full list of differentially expressed genes (supplementary table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To avoid going back and forth between cell type categories in the first results paragraph, it would be helpful to describe Cl 27 (lines 202 onwards) and Cl 32 (lines 207 onwards) with the other nervous system cells, and Cl 29 (lines 213 onwards) with the epidermis section.</p></disp-quote><p>We now grouped the description of Cl27 and Cl32 with the description of neuronal markers in this section and the description of Cl29 directly following the description of the epidermis markers (results: lines 198-205).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In order to interpret HCR expression patterns, the authors should add axis labels to the figures.

Why is DAPI absent from the neurons in the tetraspanin-8 HCR, or the serotonin transporter staining?</p></disp-quote><p>The images were not manipulated but this is the result of an experimental issue. All the HCR ISH experiments were performed on whole mount samples and sometimes we encountered problems with the penetration of DAPI inside the denser tissues. This is visible on several pictures where the outside of the animals is strongly labeled with DAPI but the signal fades as we go deeper in the tissue. We realize that this may confuse the reader and added a word of caution regarding this problem in the results and the concerned figure legend (lines 306-309, lines 1075-1077).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3B, it would be helpful to add some genes involved in proliferation, as exemplified in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We added new plots showing the expression of additional markers in the scRNAseq along the proposed differentiation axis.

These plots are available in Figure 3 -supplements 4 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that neural stem cells undergo neuronal differentiation and then migrate to the nervous system. However, evidence is missing as the authors do not show where progenitor cells stop dividing and start to differentiate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that currently there is no data supporting this hypothesis. Although we show that cells in different stages are present in different locations, the timeline of differentiation and migration cannot be inferred from our data but we propose that such a stage exists and is yet to be characterized. We reformulated these statements to be more representative of the evidence. It reads as follows: &quot; Together, the overlapping expression patterns of <italic>e2f3, asc</italic> and <italic>soxB1</italic> in domains associated with cephalopod neurogenesis strongly suggest that stem cells and neuronal progenitors are present the lateral lips of <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> suggesting that these cells are likely migrating to the nervous system at later differentiation stages &quot; (results: lines 423-427 ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of the marker foxD1 for differentiation neurons is not well supported. Additional marker analysis is required before this can be claimed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an important point, we apologize for not being clearer on this. In fact the, choice to include foxD1 in the analysis of neuronal differentiation was made after the HCR ISH experiments that showed its expression in the nervous system. In correlation with literature that link foxD1 genes with neuronal differentiation, we decided to check if we could computationally link the foxD<sup>+</sup> clusters with neuronal clusters. We are aware that foxD1 genes are not a typical feature of differentiating neurons as it is also broadly expressed in other tissues in the development of other species (Herrera et al. 2004; Polevoy et al. 2017; Newman et al. 2018; Janssen et al. 2022). In the section about trajectory inference, we added additional markers of these cells (Figure 3 —figure supplements 4 and 5). We generally reformulated interpretations regarding foxD1 to avoid overstatements. While we are confident about this observation of where foxD1 is expressed in situ and in silico, we indeed agree that with the current data we may not define it as neuronal differentiation and have widely re-written this section and that it will in the future need to be thoroughly tested (discussion: lines 733-753).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to explain which clusters were used for trajectory analysis using Slingshot and how the data were reclustered. Were non-neuronal stem cells included? This might skew the analysis. Importantly, the method was not described in the methods section. It is critical for the readers to know which endpoints were selected in the slingshot algorithm. Off note, the slingshot is very dependent on clustering resolution and will try to connect all clusters. Have the authors tried a different pseudotime analysis method such as Monocle or FateID? Additionally, can the authors elaborate on which transcription factors are steering this differentiation? In the current state, the analysis is preliminary and contradicts present data on the origin and trajectory of neurons in the cephalopod brain (see comment below; Koenig et al. 2016, Deryckere et al. 2021).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the lack of information regarding the trajectories and the need to replicate these results. We now include more detail about how the trajectories were calculated and which parameters were selected in the materials and methods in a new paragraph called &quot;trajectory inference&quot;. We also include details about how the cells were chosen and re-clustered for figure 2 and 3 (Materials and methods: lines 944950). We now include in the main figure the analysis of the trajectories using monocle in addition to the previous analysis with slingshot that has been move to the supplements (figure 3 —figure supplement 5). The other cluster specific transcription factors that could be identified were also plotted onto the trajectory analysis on figure 3 —figure supplement 4 and 5. However, many genes that have been linked to neuronal differentiation (for example neuroD in Deryckere et al. 2021) could not be found in our data and are therefore not available to support our hypotheses. More generally, we agree that these results are preliminary and require further experimental validation (see discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With the current interpretation of the data, the authors claim that foxd1 cells are an intermediate developmental state of neurons. This would be very striking since the cortex of the optic lobe has been described as being the inner retina. Additionally, it is contradicting the expression of amyloid β-binding like in the optic lobe cortex, which the authors say is only expressed in differentiated neurons. Is amyloid β-binding-like expressed in clusters 15, 19, and 20? How about other markers for differentiated neurons? What would all those intermediate cells do there? Do the authors think they migrate into the medulla or even the central brain? This is contradicting existing literature on the origin of neurons in the cephalopod brain (Koenig 2016, Deryckere 2021) and requires in-depth discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed agree on this point and as stated above we have included a more moderate interpretation. Our analysis of foxD1 originally showed two different things:</p><p>1. This gene is very specific to certain cell clusters and is highly expressed in these cells compared to other clusters (Figure 3A). These cells cannot be directly assigned a cell-type identity as they lack known cell-types markers, including markers of differentiated neurons.</p><p>2. This gene is highly expressed in different regions of the nervous system, including optic lobe cortex (Figure 3, figure 3 —figure supplement 2). Importantly, we do not think that the expression of this gene in these regions necessarily means that they are differentiated neurons.</p><p>Because these two observations do not clearly indicate a link between foxD1 and neurons, we decided to computationally assess whether there might be a developmental relationship between the cell types found in the nervous system and the progenitor-like cells present in the lateral lips. Contrary to our expectation, the trajectory analysis put foxD1 cells in between putative progenitors (expressing e2f3, asc and soxB1) and differentiated neurons (expressing elav-like 1, elav-like 2, tetraspanin-8, amyloid-β-binding) (We do find some cells expressing low levels of amyloid β-binding-like in FoxD expressing cells (clusters 16, 19, and 30)). Essentially, it means that there are more transcriptional similarities between foxD1 and neurons (respectively between foxD1 cells and asc<sup>+</sup> cells) than there are between asc<sup>+</sup> cells and neurons. Whether that means that foxD1 expression marks a specific stage neuronal differentiation is not clear and will needs to be further investigated. We moderated our conclusions regarding the analysis of foxD<sup>+</sup> in the text and provide more discussion of the subject (lines 733-753). We agree that a theoretical intermediate cell stage could in any case not be defined by the expression of a single gene and that thorough analysis of more transcription factors would be necessary to support these claims. The absence of many neurogenesis-associated transcription factors from our data renders this analysis more difficult and a higher resolution dataset may be able to conciliate our findings with previous literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors prepared beautiful summary diagrams in Figures 3 and 4.

Can the authors identify the different brain regions when subclustering the neurons? Can they identify and annotate different neural cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and we indeed hoped to find genes identifying neural subtypes or defining certain brain regions. We indeed identified some genes with regionalized expression, such as scratch and LIM, which to some degree can be associated to certain clusters (scratch 5, 15, 20; Lim high in 22). However, we did not uncover wide diversity of neuron subtypes. This may be partly due to the fact that we took entire heads for our analysis (as compared to only brain) and partly to the coverage of the transcriptome.</p><p>The HCR ISH studies provided a lot of additional information about the genes originally described in the scRNAseq data and the cell types that they represent. The interpretation of the results combining these two methods provides avenues for future studies but is usually not sufficient to confirm the identity of a previously undescribed cell type. The clustering parameters used initially resulting in a total of 34 clusters could have been changed to obtain more clusters but the markers genes of these new clusters could not have informed us on the possible identity of these cell types. The example of the lack of resolution for the nervous system well exemplifies this limitation in our study: several genes were shown to be expressed in specific lobes of the nervous system but this did not correlate with specific clusters in the scRNAseq data. We envision in the future to extend our investigations by including more developmental stages (and behavioral context) and to possibly assembling a <italic>Loligo</italic> genome to map the same reads to may resolve this issue (Results: lines 369-372, discussion: lines 652-666, 680-682).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors present several striking findings.

In contrast, in vertebrates and also in spiralia such as capitella teleta, Ascl1 is expressed in neural progenitor cells to drive them into differentiation (e.g. Bertrand 2002; Sur 2020). Ascl1 expression has been studied in octopus and seems to have a similar function as in capitella, not <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Deryckere 2021).

Additionally, expression of SoxB1 has been described in Sepia (Focareta and Cole, 2016) and octopus (Deryckere 2021), indicating expression in neurons (with some interesting discrepancies).

Studies of neurogenesis in the annelid <italic>Capitella teleta</italic> has shown that, similarly to vetrebrates, proneural genes such as <italic>asc</italic> are expressed in self-renewing neuronal progenitors (Sur et al. 2020). Our data suggests that <italic>asc</italic> is also expressed in proliferating cells, similiarly to vertrebrates and <italic>Capitella teleta</italic> but unlike <italic>Drosophila</italic>.”</p><p>We also discuss the role of soxB1 and compare it to what has been observed in other cephalopods but also refer to the documented expression of this gene in differentiated neurons (lines 721-733):</p><p>“The observation of <italic>soxB1</italic> expression together with <italic>asc</italic> strengthened their characterization as neuronal progenitors due to the documented role of this gene in neuronal differentiation (Miyagi et al. 2009). However, strong soxB1 expression in differentiated neurons has been shown in the gastropod <italic>Patella vulgate</italic> and in the cephalopods <italic>Sepia officinalis</italic> and <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> (Le Gouar et al. 2004; Focareta and Cole 2016; Deryckere et al. 2021). In <italic>L. vulgaris</italic> we observe similar results where <italic>soxB1</italic> is expressed in the lateral lips together with <italic>asc</italic> but is also expressed in differentiated neurons. This was consistently shown by the HCR ISH experiments as well as the single-cell analysis. Therefore, the hypothesis proposed for the action of <italic>soxB1</italic> in the early stages as well as the later stages of neuronal differentiation in <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> is consistent with our data (Deryckere et al. 2021).”</p><p>We also discuss the possible limitation of our analysis as some genes that have been shown to be involved in <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> neurogenesis could not be found in our data (lines 742-753):</p><p>“Such a role has been proposed in Octopus vulgaris in the cells expressing <italic>neuroD</italic> that are expressed in a gradient between the lateral lip and the central nervous system, which may indicate a pattern of migration of differentiating neurons (Deryckere et al. 2021). We could however not correlate these results with our hypothesis of an intermediate <italic>foxD1</italic>-expressing stage because <italic>neuroD</italic> expression could not be detected in specific clusters in our single-cell dataset. Although the trajectories we calculated point towards a role of FoxD1 in neuronal differentiation, the relatively poor cluster resolution and the lack of cells along the trajectory axes shown in figure 3 suggest that this hypothesis would require further investigation that should include a more complete set of genes that have been involved with cephalopod neurogenesis.”</p><p>A short interpretation of the data is left in the results to facilitate comprehension of the data but is then discussed more in depth in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 376-378: add a reference and elaborate.

Although there is evidence of foxD1 being involved in the development of the nervous system, the hypothesis of these cells being a possible stage of neuronal differentiation is only prompted by the expression pattern observed by HCR ISH followed by the trajectory analysis described later in the manuscript.

After careful re-analysis we decided to exclude this gene from the analysis as it is not a cluster-specific marker in the scRNAseq data and the expression pattern revealed by HCR ISH showed expression in what appeared to be non-neuronal tissue around the eye.
