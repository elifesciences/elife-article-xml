Purified MAVS CARD from culture cells self-assembles into filaments. Previously, we reported a low-resolution cryoEM structure of MAVS CARD filament, which exhibits a C3 symmetry with a rotation of −53.6° and an axial rise of 16.8 Å for every unit in the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, a cryoEM reconstruction of MAVS CARD filaments at 3.6 Å resolution was reported with a C1 helical symmetry of a rotation of −101.1° and an axial rise of 5.1 Å per subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). The differences in these two models were carefully analyzed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Egelman, 2014</xref>), which suggested that the helical ambiguity in helical reconstruction was not fully resolved in our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). We recently collected a new dataset at higher resolutions. Using a newly developed method for analysis of helical filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Clemens et al., 2015</xref>), we obtained a 4.2 Å resolution reconstruction of MAVS CARD filaments purified from mammalian cells under native conditions.

Fourier transforms of motion-corrected raw images showed Thon rings up to ∼3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). After CTF fitting, the selected raw images were phase-flipped, and individual filaments were selected interactively using EMAN2 Helixboxer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>). Selected filaments were segmented using individual boxes that had 90% overlap between neighboring ones. Segmented filament images were high-pass filtered at 120 Å to suppress the low-resolution variations in optical density across individual images as well as the contribution of low-resolution noise to particle alignment. The filament datasets were processed using a customized version of Relion 1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Scheres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Clemens et al., 2015</xref>). This ‘helical’ Relion implemented the Iterative Helical Real Space Reconstruction (IHRSR) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Egelman, 2010</xref>) within the framework of Relion 1.2.

Reference models of C1 and C3 symmetries were calculated from our SPIDER-based analysis using sorted fractions of filament particles from the four datasets in our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). They were filtered to 60 Å and then refined against the new dataset in helical Relion. We found that the new dataset converged better to the C1 symmetry. To reduce model bias, we also calculated a reconstruction by imposing the C1 symmetry for the first five runs of refinement to a C3 model obtained from our original analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). The initial C1 symmetry parameters of a twist angle (ΔΦ) = −101.25° and an axial rise (Δz) = 4.75 Å (from our old datasets and adjusted to 4.95 Å due to the change of the imaging system) were derived from the corresponding selection rule defined by indexing the power spectrum. After the fifth run, the refinement was continued to optimize the helical parameters and converged to (ΔΦ = −101.21° and Δz = 5.06 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), close to the C1 symmetry reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Wu et al. (2014)</xref>. The final map has an overall resolution of 4.18 Å, estimated from the gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) calculated between two maps that were refined independently against the top and bottom halves of the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’ section). To examine the resolution with an independent method, we generated a B-factor weighted map based on the PDB model from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Wu et al. (2014)</xref> (PDB ID: 3J6J), and used it to calculate FSC against the experimental map. A 0.5 threshold found an estimated resolution of 4.25 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), close to the one estimated by using two halves of experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

While the six α-helices of the crystal structure of MAVS CARD monomer (PDB: 2VGQ, residues 3–93) fitted into the EM map well, multiple bulky side chains and those residues in the loop between H4 and H5 needed adjustment. The atomic model reported previously (PDB: 3J6J, residues 1–97, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Wu et al., 2014</xref>) fit into the density well except for some unoccupied densities next to the N- and C-termini of the docked CARD model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>).

The positively charged residues R37 and R41 in H3, R64 and R65 in the loop between H4 and H5 from one CARD molecule (grey in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) are in close proximity to the negatively charged residues D23 in the loop between H1b and H2 and E26 in H2 of another CARD molecule (cyan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Compared with the wild-type MAVS, which potently induced IFNβ in a dose-dependent manner, D23A showed significantly decreased activity and mutations of other charged residues (E26, R37, R41, R64 and R65) at the interface to alanine or residues with reversed charge almost completely abolished MAVS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the crystal structure of MAVS CARD, the aromatic chain of W56 adopts two alternative conformations, with a major conformer (60% occupancy) exposed to solvent and stacked against the ring structure of residue F16 in immediate vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Potter et al., 2008</xref>). In the cryoEM map, the density of one conformer is resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2D, 3D</xref>) and there appears density corresponding to the side chain of R43 from an adjacent CARD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting a possible cation–pi interaction between these two residues, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Alanine substitution of R43 almost completely abolished MAVS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Besides W56, the ring structures of residues F16 and Y30 also appear to be important for filament assembly. Single alanine substitution of F16, W56 or Y30 almost completely abolished MAVS activity, while substitutions with different ring-containing residues to these positions, such as F16H, W56F, W56Y, Y30F and Y30H, were able to largely retain MAVS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Another residue involved in stabilizing the interface is R52, whose replacement by alanine significantly decreased its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Interface III mediates the interactions between adjacent monomers along the helical trajectory. Close to the central pore of the helical filament, residue L48 from each MAVS CARD monomer contributes to the formation of a hydrophobic core with G50 and A44 in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, top view and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Substitution of L48 with charged residues (D or K), but not alanine, completely abolished MAVS activity in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). It is interesting to note that L48 is not conserved, and is R or Q in MAVS from multiple other species. The filaments might need to rearrange in order to accommodate such substitutions. The small side chain or hydrophobicity of A44 may be important for the packing at this hydrophobic interface because its mutation to T impaired MAVS CARD filament formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Charged residues R37, R41, D40 and D53 are located at the outer rim of the filament forming electrostatic interactions together with charged residues at type I interface. Single alanine substitution of these residues almost completely abolished MAVS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the loss-of-function mutation data are consistent with both the C1 map reported here and the C3 map obtained previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). However, although key residues involved in the interactions are almost identical in the two models, the detailed interactions at the interfaces are different according to the two maps, indicating that mutagenesis analyses alone cannot distinguish one model from the other.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>MAVS CARD filaments from our new dataset converged to almost the same C1 symmetry as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Wu et al. (2014)</xref>, not the C3 symmetry as we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). The heterogeneity of the samples and the limited resolution of images were likely among the factors that led to the exclusion of the C1 model in the original analysis. We wish to correct this mistake and apologize for any confusion it might have caused. We stand by all other data in the paper, including in vitro mapping of the oligomerization interface, cell-based mutational analyses, super-resolution SIM imaging of MAVS aggregates in virus-infected cells, and the crystal structures. These experiments for the first time identified most of the key residues involved in MAVS polymerization, leading to an extensive mapping of the molecular surfaces for forming the MAVS filament.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Flag-MAVS CARD (1–100) expressed in HEK293T cells was purified in a buffer containing 50 mM NaCl.

The microscope was equipped with a Cs corrector (Cs = 0.01 mm) and operated at 300 kV. EPU (FEI) was run to control automatic data collection across multiple preselected holes in the holey grids. Images were taken using a defocus range of −2.5 to −4.0 microns at a nominal magnification of 59,000×, which corresponds to a calibrated pixel size of 1.05 Å at the specimen level. Images were taken with a total dose of 35 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> distributed over 16 frames. The movie data were processed using the program dosefgpu_driftcorr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Frames 3–12 of every movie were summed together as the corrected image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The carbon-support of our filaments made the motion between consecutive frames very small (mostly less than 2 pixels) and we therefore did not do motion correction for individual filaments (polishing) in Relion. We started with 27,916 filaments. After 2D classification, 15,600 filaments were selected. During the 3D classification into two different classes, there was a negligible fraction of the filaments conforming to a different volume with poor alignment statistics. We therefore kept all 15,600 filaments for final map calculation, which correspond to ∼80,000 images of individual CARD units.</p><p>In order to calculate a gold-standard FSC from truly independent datasets, we divided the 15,600 filaments into the top and bottom two halves. These two datasets had negligible overlap. Two separate C1 models were generated using the SPIDER-based method from a small sorted fraction (∼13%) of filaments out of our old datasets as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), and imposed with diagonally varied symmetry parameters (5.22 Å, −102.2°) and (4.82 Å, −100.2°), respectively. These two models were used as initial models and separately refined against the two half datasets in helical Relion. The two refinements converged to almost the same symmetry parameters, (5.05 Å, −101.25°) and (5.08 Å, −101.20°), respectively. The two volumes were post-processed in EMAN2 and aligned in CHIMERA. The map calculated from the top half of the dataset was rotated −2.4° and shifted by −1.05 pixels before being compared with the one from the bottom half to calculate a gold-standard FSC using e2proc3d.py in EMAN2. The calculations in the final refinement steps were done in the <italic>largemem</italic> nodes of the STAMPEDE supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computer Center (TACC) in Austin, Texas. Molecular modeling was done in CHIMERA and Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Funding</title><p><table-wrap id="tblu1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Funder</th><th>Grant reference</th><th>Author</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>National Institutes of Health</td><td>R01GM088745</td><td>Hui Xu, Brian Borkowski, Qiu-Xing Jiang</td></tr><tr><td>National Institutes of Health</td><td>R01GM093271</td><td>Hui Xu, Brian Borkowski, Qiu-Xing Jiang</td></tr><tr><td>National Institutes of Health</td><td>R01GM088197</td><td>Xiaojing He, Xuewu Zhang</td></tr><tr><td>National Institutes of Health</td><td>1S10RR027972</td><td>Qiu-Xing Jiang</td></tr><tr><td>American Heart Association</td><td>12IRG9400019</td><td>Qiu-Xing Jiang</td></tr><tr><td>Welch</td><td>I-1684, I-1389, and I-1702</td><td>Hui Zheng, Qiu-Xing Jiang, Hui Xu, Zhijian J Chen, Xuewu Zhang</td></tr><tr><td>Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas</td><td>RP120474</td><td>Hui Xu, Qiu-Xing Jiang</td></tr><tr><td>National Institutes of Health</td><td>R01AI093967</td><td>Zhijian J Chen</td></tr><tr><td>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</td><td/><td>Zhiheng Yu, Michael Jason de la Cruz, Zhijian J Chen</td></tr><tr><td>National Institutes of Health</td><td>C06RR30414</td><td>Hui Xu, Hui Zheng, Lily J Huang, Brian Borkowski, Qiu-Xing Jiang</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr Edward H Egelman for pointing out the ambiguity in helical reconstructions.
