Cholesterol is a lipid enriched at the plasma membrane with pivotal roles in the control of membrane fluidity and maintenance of membrane microarchitecture, directly impacting on GPCR stability, dynamics, and function. Cholesterol extraction from pancreatic beta cells has previously been shown to disrupt the internalisation, clustering, and cAMP responses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B1 GPCR with key roles in the control of blood glucose levels via the potentiation of insulin secretion in beta cells and weight reduction via the modulation of brain appetite control centres. Here, we unveil the detrimental effect of a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R-dependent glucoregulation in vivo, and the improvement in GLP-1R function that a reduction in cholesterol synthesis using simvastatin exerts in pancreatic islets. We next identify and map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active <italic>vs</italic> inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations, followed by a screen of key residues selected from these sites and detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions, plasma membrane behaviours, clustering, trafficking and signalling in INS-1 832/3 rat pancreatic beta cells and primary mouse islets, unveiling an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor. This study (1) highlights the role of cholesterol in regulating GLP-1R responses in vivo; (2) provides a detailed map of GLP-1R - cholesterol binding sites in model membranes; (3) validates their functional relevance in beta cells; and (4) highlights their potential as locations for the rational design of novel allosteric modulators with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MD simulations</kwd><kwd>incretins</kwd><kwd>islets</kwd><kwd>GLP-1R</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>type 2

Activation of GLP-1R also promotes beta cell survival, inhibits gastric emptying, regulates food intake, and reduces appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Graaf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drucker and Holst, 2023</xref>), making it a key pharmacological target for various metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">El Eid et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). Circulation of active GLP-1 (7–36) hormone is short-lived due to its rapid cleavage into inactive GLP-1 (9–36) by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boer and Holst, 2020</xref>; DPP-4-resistant peptide analogues of GLP-1 have, therefore, been developed and successfully used clinically for the treatment of T2D and obesity, including exendin-4, liraglutide, and semaglutide, amongst others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Graaf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boer and Holst, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drucker and Holst, 2023</xref>). Despite their success, access to incretin peptide analogues is challenging for most individuals that require these therapies due to their high cost and complex manufacturing process leading to supply shortages, as well as the requirement for refrigeration and administration by injection, together with notable side effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, prompting further research into the development of a new wave of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Camilleri and Acosta, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lu et al., 2023</xref>), including those targeting the receptor as allosteric or ago-allosteric modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smelcerovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cong et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The GLP-1R is part of the glucagon family of receptors, including the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drucker and Holst, 2023</xref>), the glucagon receptor (GCGR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Müller et al., 2017</xref>), and the glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP-2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drucker and Yusta, 2014</xref>), which are class B1/secretin-like GPCRs with a typical structure of seven transmembrane domains (7-TMD), a C-terminal tail, and a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) important for peptide agonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bortolato et al., 2014</xref>). GPCRs transmit extracellular signals via coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and interactions with β-arrestins, leading to activation of various intracellular signalling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccouch et al., 2022</xref>); the GLP-1R in particular signals preferentially via Gα<sub>s</sub> coupling and adenylate cyclase activation, leading to cAMP accumulation and downstream signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marzook et al., 2021</xref>). Their 7-TMD structure involves intimate interactions with plasma membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccouch et al., 2022</xref>), known to be non-homogeneously distributed but rather organised in regions known as lipid nanodomains or lipid rafts, enriched in lipid species including sphingolipids and cholesterol, as well as in integral membrane proteins serving as scaffolds for signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sezgin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernardino de la Serna et al., 2016</xref>), and for GPCR trafficking and sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccouch et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kumar and Chattopadhyay, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sunshine and Iruela-Arispe, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The plasma membrane-enriched lipid cholesterol has been identified as an allosteric modulator for certain GPCRs, due to its direct binding to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McGraw et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanson et al., 2008</xref> and modulation of GPCR activation, trafficking, and signalling patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sejdiu and Tieleman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shrivastava et al., 2022</xref>). A previous study from our laboratory established that the GLP-1R function in pancreatic beta cells is also modulated by cholesterol. Specifically, we showed that GLP-1R activation leads to receptor segregation into flotillin-positive lipid nanodomains and that disruption of the plasma membrane architecture by cholesterol extraction with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) significantly reduces exendin-4-mediated receptor clustering, internalisation, and cAMP accumulation in beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buenaventura et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we focus on identifying the effect of more nuanced changes in cholesterol content on exendin-4-mediated GLP-1R function in primary islets and in vivo, followed by mapping of cholesterol binding sites for both apo-state and active receptor structures using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations tailored to identify lipid-receptor interactions, and functional validation of a prominent site for its effects on cholesterol binding, plasma membrane behaviours and exendin-4-mediated GLP-1R function in beta cells and primary islets. Our investigation identifies new potentially druggable locations in the receptor, expanding the existing repertoire of functionally relevant sites for the rational design of novel GLP-1R allosteric modulators based on the modulation of receptor-cholesterol interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Changes in cholesterol content modulate exendin-4-induced GLP-1R behaviours in primary islets and in vivo</title><p>To determine the effect of increased cholesterol levels on GLP-1R function, we fed mice a standard chow diet supplemented or not with cholesterol for 5 wk.

We have first shown that exogenous cholesterol increases via prolonged dietary changes in mice lead to a decrease in the capacity of the GLP-1R for in vivo glucoregulation, without affecting glucose levels under vehicle conditions. Further investigations showed that GLP-1R-mediated cAMP responses were reduced in islets extracted from these mice, suggesting that a high cholesterol diet specifically impacts on beta cell GLP-1R activity. Similarly, acute cholesterol increases in mouse islets exposed to cholesterol-loaded MβCD decreased the GLP-1R capacity to potentiate insulin secretion, validating our observed in vivo effects. In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asalla et al., 2016</xref>), acute (1 hr) beta cell exposure to high cholesterol leads to increased insulin secretion under 11 mM glucose conditions, but the GLP-1R is unable to further potentiate secretion to the same extent than with unmodified cholesterol levels.</p><p>While we have observed a direct detrimental effect of a cholesterol-enriched diet on islet GLP-1R cAMP outputs, we cannot rule out that the reduced receptor capacity to lower blood glucose levels following cholesterol loading might encompass further negative effects of high cholesterol on GLP-1R downstream signalling. Persistently elevated mouse islet cholesterol levels have been shown to cause a decrease in the expression of cholesterol synthesis genes (<italic>Hmgcr</italic>) and increased expression of steroidogenic acute and regulatory protein (StAR), while also decreasing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akter et al., 2022</xref>). StAR is a steroid biogenesis factor involved in cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Manna et al., 2016</xref>) expressed at low levels in beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hogan et al., 2019b</xref>), with increased StAR expression linked to reduced beta cell mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hogan et al., 2019a</xref>). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregory Austin et al., 2024</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2015</xref>), have shown that the GLP-1R plays an important role in the control of beta cell mitochondrial function, a key process for optimal insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ježek et al., 2022</xref>), with our recent interactome results unveiling direct interactions between GLP-1R and cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism factors located at ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregory Austin et al., 2024</xref>). It is, therefore, possible that high cholesterol might impact on the capacity of the GLP-1R to regulate mitochondrial and beta cell function via altered expression and interaction with cholesterol regulatory enzymes, hindering the insulin secretion potentiation effect of the receptor.</p><p>Conversely, in this study, we also found that a reduction in mouse islet cholesterol levels with simvastatin, which disrupts ER cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMGCR enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Röhrl and Stangl, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friesen and Rodwell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Plosker and Simvastatin, 1995</xref>), increased exendin-4-mediated cAMP and insulin secretion responses. While this partial reduction in cholesterol levels appears beneficial for beta cell GLP-1R function, we previously observed that a much more drastic cholesterol extraction using MβCD leads to the opposite effect, inhibiting agonist-induced GLP-1R cAMP responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buenaventura et al., 2019</xref>), a result that we hypothesise is linked to the profound disruption of plasma membrane architecture caused by MβCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mahammad and Parmryd, 2008</xref>). The use of statins at higher concentrations than in the present study has been previously associated with varying effects on insulin secretion: simvastatin was shown to reduce, while pravastatin increased insulin secretion in response to glucose, with GLP-1 or exendin-4 exposure restoring secretory responses from statin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yaluri et al., 2015</xref>). Statin use has been associated with increased risk of T2D by poorly understood mechanisms involving both reduced insulin sensitivity and impaired beta cell insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laakso and Fernandes Silva, 2023</xref>), the latter ameliorated by GLP-1R agonist exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buldak et al., 2022</xref>). Considering our results as well as previous literature, we speculate that patients with increased cholesterol levels might also exhibit reduced beta cell responses to incretin therapies unless dyslipidaemia is subsequently ameliorated following weight loss. In addition, patients taking cholesterol modifying drugs like statins are particularly good candidates for incretin use as they might present with improved incretin responses that would also help prevent a potentially increased risk of developing T2D in this patient subset. Further research to determine responses to GLP-1R agonists in individuals with different cholesterol levels before and after treatment with cholesterol lowering agents will be required to elucidate this matter.</p><p>The GLP-1R, as an integral membrane protein and 7-TMD GPCR, tightly interacts with its lipid-rich plasma membrane microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corradi et al., 2018</xref>) and is also known to segregate to cholesterol-rich, flotillin-positive lipid nanodomains upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buenaventura et al., 2019</xref>). It is, therefore, plausible that direct interaction of cholesterol molecules with specific binding pockets in the GLP-1R might at least be partially responsible for cholesterol modulation of GLP-1R function. To test this possibility, we performed cgMD simulations of GLP-1R in active <italic>vs</italic> inactive conformations in a model mammalian plasma membrane using the latest Martini 3 forcefield and cholesterol parameters, identifying specific receptor sites with high cholesterol occupancies and residence times. The fact that the highest cholesterol occupancy residues identified correspond to either ring-containing (Phe) or branched (Val, Leu, Ile) amino acids suggests that these residue types might play important roles in cholesterol stabilisation at GLP-1R binding pockets. Importantly, the GLP-1R-cholesterol binding sites identified here do not overlap with previously predicted cholesterol consensus motifs (CCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>) or Cholesterol Recognition Amino Acid Consensus (CRAC) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jafurulla et al., 2011</xref>) identified for other GPCRs, confirming the theory that GPCRs lack predictable primary sequence consensus motifs for cholesterol binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Taghon et al., 2021</xref>). The GLP-1R-cholesterol binding sites also presented notable differences between active and inactive receptor conformations, suggesting that cholesterol binding is regulated by agonist binding and receptor activation. GLP-1R in its inactive apo-state is constantly moving but prefers to adopt a closed ECD conformation in absence of peptide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Active, peptide-bound receptors, on the other hand, adopt a more open conformation resulting from the peptide agonist interacting with the ECD, leading to prominent changes at TMD regions which stabilise G protein binding and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). The conformational shift between the receptor in active and inactive states is, therefore, predicted to affect GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions, thereby leading to distinct active <italic>vs</italic> inactive cholesterol binding sites. Interestingly, one of the most prominent GLP-1R-cholesterol binding sites identified here lies within the functionally important TM5-TM6 region required for G protein signal transduction, indicating the potential impact of cholesterol binding on GLP-1R activation and downstream signalling.</p><p>To investigate the importance of direct cholesterol interactions in modulating beta cell GLP-1R function, we have screened 12 residues selected from the cholesterol binding sites identified in our cgMD simulations, covering a wide range of occupancy, residence time, ability to tolerate the planned mutation, and varied locations within binding sites in active <italic>vs</italic> inactive receptor states. Interestingly, the residues that had significant effects on GLP-1R internalisation while mutated to alanine were all non-polar branched amino acids, with some of these also predicted to cause changes in the cavity in which they reside. Specifically, changing the Val229 residue to alanine, selected in this study for further investigation, was predicted to trigger a change in the cavity and a buried exposure switch at the inactive receptor, thereby potentially modifying the interactions between itself and other pocket residues with cholesterol.</p><p>Further detailed investigations of GLP-1R V229A behaviours in beta cells revealed an overall reduction in cholesterol binding under vehicle conditions, which correlated with reduced lateral diffusion, average displacement, and speed of movement across the plasma membrane of the V229A receptor under these conditions. Detailed examination of the receptor oligomerisation state using N&amp;B also demonstrated a greater population of higher order oligomers under vehicle conditions for the V229A <italic>vs</italic> WT GLP-1R. RICS lateral diffusion takes into consideration the movement of molecules in regions of interest within cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rossow et al., 2010</xref>; the reduced lateral diffusion of GLP-1R V229A could, therefore, be due to the mutant receptor existing as a subpopulation of pre-clustered, higher order oligomeric assemblies in absence of agonist stimulation, predicted to cause a decrease in the movement of receptors within these clusters. Interestingly, we detected a similar pattern of reduced lateral diffusion of the WT GLP-1R under vehicle conditions following cholesterol lowering with simvastatin, while increased cholesterol led to a reduction in the capacity of exendin-4 to slow down the GLP-1R, suggesting that plasma membrane cholesterol levels, and therefore receptor-cholesterol interactions, are key for the regulation of this behaviour, which in turn determines the capacity of receptors to segregate to lipid nanodomains, modulating downstream signalling responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, GLP-1R V229A presented with a higher tendency to segregate to flotillin-positive lipid nanodomains, or lipid rafts, in the apo-state, so that the increased clustering of GLP-1R V229A could potentially be triggered by increased mutant receptor partitioning to these nanodomains. This observation also highlights the complexity that modifying a residue within a cholesterol binding site might have on the overall pattern of receptor interactions with cholesterol and other plasma membrane lipids, as increased segregation to these cholesterol-rich lipid rafts occurs despite the overall reduction in total cholesterol binding under vehicle conditions observed for the V229A mutant receptor.</p><p>GLP-1R V229A receptor pre-clustering under vehicle conditions did not trigger any measurable changes in the lateral diffusion of plasma membrane lipid-ordered nanodomains measured as a whole using the lipid dye Laurdan, which allows for the detection of different plasma membrane organisation states as either liquid ordered or disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gunther et al., 2021</xref>). Laurdan is a non-species-specific lipid probe that cannot discriminate between different lipid nanodomains at the plasma membrane, hence potentially explaining the lack of effect on their overall lateral diffusion by expression of the mutant <italic>vs</italic> WT GLP-1R. We nevertheless observed, by RICCS analysis, a tendency for reduced co-diffusion of these highly packed lipid nanodomains with GLP-1R V229A under vehicle conditions, an effect that is only present in stimulated conditions for the WT receptor, with no further change after agonist stimulation observed for the V229A mutant, again suggesting a different pattern of interaction of V229A <italic>vs</italic> WT GLP-1R with these plasma membrane lipid nanodomains.</p><p>Underscoring the importance that direct cholesterol engagement has in the modulation of GLP-1R function, the changes in cholesterol binding and plasma membrane behaviours introduced by the V229A substitution led to significant effects on GLP-1R trafficking and signalling in beta cells: V229A caused a decrease in GLP-1R recruitment to CCPs and receptor internalisation, accompanied by an increase in Gα<sub>s</sub> (measured with mini-G<sub>s</sub>) and β-arrestin 2 engagement, as well as increased plasma membrane recycling following exendin-4 stimulation. Overall, the V229A receptor presented with biased signalling favouring Gα<sub>s</sub> coupling over β-arrestin 2 recruitment and receptor localisation and activation at the plasma membrane. GLP-1R biased signalling also occurs in WT receptors following activation with modified peptide agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jones, 2022</xref>). For example, biased GLP-1R signalling is observed following stimulation with exendin-phe1, which carries a phenylalanine substitution at position 1 of exendin-4, causing a similar reduction in receptor internalisation and increased plasma membrane recycling to GLP-1R V229A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, however, exendin-phe1 triggers essentially no β-arrestin 2 recruitment to the receptor, as well as prolonged GLP-1R-induced cAMP and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2018</xref>), together with reduced GLP-1R clustering and lipid raft recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buenaventura et al., 2019</xref>), while GLP-1R V229A presents with increased oligomerisation at vehicle conditions and acute effects on beta cell function (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Some of these effects are, as previously highlighted, analogous to those observed by reducing beta cell/islet cholesterol with simvastatin: in addition to a reduction in GLP-1R plasma membrane lateral diffusion under vehicle conditions, both manipulations led to acute increases in GLP-1R-induced cAMP and islet insulin secretion responses. While the V229A mutation did not confer an advantage to ameliorate insulin secretion responses to exendin-4 in islets loaded with excess cholesterol ex vivo, it remains to be studied if this or another modification in GLP-1R cholesterol binding sites can improve in vivo responses to incretin therapies under diet-induced metabolic stress conditions. Regardless, when taken together, the results of this study indicate that modulation of direct GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions is a valid strategy to fine-tune beta cell incretin receptor responses, providing a new avenue for further investigation of novel ways to improve GLP-1R signalling outputs.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) V229A in inactive and active states compared with GLP-1R wild-type (WT).</title><p>(↑ increased, ↓ decreased, ≈ unchanged).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Assay</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="2">GLP-1R V229A <italic>vs</italic> GLP-1R WT</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Vehicle (inactive)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Exendin-4 (active)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Surface expression</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≈ (↓)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cholesterol binding</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≈</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasma membrane diffusion</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↓↓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≈</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasma membrane displacement</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≈</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasma membrane speed</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≈</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Oligomerisation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↑</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≈</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lipid raft recruitment</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↑</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↑</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CCP recruitment</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≈</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↓</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Internalisation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↓</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recycling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↑</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Degradation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≈</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mini-G<sub>s</sub> recruitment</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↑↑</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">β-arrestin 2 recruitment</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↑</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mini-G<sub>q</sub> recruitment</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≈</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Activation at plasma membrane</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↑↑</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Activation at endosomes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↑</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">cAMP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↑</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Insulin secretion</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">↓ cells / ≈ islets</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≈ cells / ↑ islets</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of effects of cholesterol binding mutant glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) V229A on GLP-1R function.</title><p>Thick arrows indicate increased and thin arrows decreased pathway engagement.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101011-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The phenomenon of cholesterol modification of GPCR outputs by direct receptor binding has been previously demonstrated for other GPCR classes, especially class A GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moreau et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jakubík and El-Fakahany, 2021</xref>). For example, cholesterol binding sites were identified in the adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor; mutation of residues within the predicted receptor-cholesterol binding sites caused changes in basal receptor activity, ligand binding, G protein coupling, and cAMP responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McGraw et al., 2022</xref>). Receptor-cholesterol interactions were also affected by either agonist or antagonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moreau et al., 2023</xref>). Similarly, determining the effect that different agonists and/or antagonists might have on GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions might also provide further valuable insights into their specific mechanisms of action. Additionally, it would be highly pertinent to study the effects of modifying GLP-1R cholesterol binding sites in other cell types that express the receptor beyond pancreatic beta cells/islets, specifically in neurons where the receptor plays important roles in the control of satiation and nausea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trapp and Brierley, 2022</xref>), which might be modulated by modified receptor-cholesterol interactions.</p><p>Our results serve as a first for a class B1 GPCR, highlighting the importance of GPCR-lipid interactions on receptor function and dynamics for this receptor class. It further confirms cholesterol binding pockets as high value sites for GLP-1R allosteric modulation, with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R trafficking, signalling, and functional outputs. Further investigations to fully elucidate the effect of the V229A substitution on GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions might include detailed atomistic MD simulations of WT <italic>vs</italic> V229A receptors, as well as resolving cryo-EM structures of mutant and WT receptors in nanodiscs containing relevant lipid compositions to preserve receptor-lipid interactions in their native environment. Large cgMD simulations including increased numbers of WT or mutant receptors in a membrane environment with varying cholesterol levels could also be performed to determine the effect of cholesterol on GLP-1R oligomerisation. Finally, further high-throughput investigations to evaluate all other key residues involved in GLP-1R-cholesterol binding will generate high value data for the future development of novel GLP-1R allosteric modulators with improved signalling properties for the treatment of T2D and obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p>In vivo studies were carried out under the approval of the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Project Licence PP7151519 (PPL Holder: Dr A.

Cells were washed with PBS and imaged in RMPI 1640 medium without phenol red using the confocal settings of a Leica Stellaris 8 STED FALCON in an 86 X objective and a 10% power 405 nm excitation laser and emission ranges of 420–460 nm (blue emission, IB) and 470–510 nm (red emission, IR) for Laurdan, plus a 5% power 647 nm excitation laser for SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 647. The general polarisation (GP) formula (GP = IB-IR/IB +IR) was used to retrieve the relative lateral packing order of lipids at the plasma membrane: values of GP vary from 1 to −1, with higher values reflecting lower fluidity (or higher lateral lipid order), whereas lower values indicate increased fluidity. Two hundred consecutive frames were captured for 2.45 min at a pixel size of 80 nm and a format size of 256 × 256 pixels. Cells were imaged under vehicle conditions and after stimulation with 100 nM exendin-4.

While we concur with the reviewer that the effect in this case is triggered by increased basal insulin secretion at 11 mM glucose, exendin-4 appears to no longer compensate for this increase by proportionally amplifying insulin responses in cholesterol-loaded islets, leading to a significantly decreased exendin-4induced insulin secretion fold increase under these circumstances, as shown in Figure 1F. We interpret these results as a defect in the GLP-1R capacity to amplify insulin secretion beyond the basal level to the same extent as in vehicle conditions. An alternative explanation is that there is a maximum level of insulin secretion in our cells, and 11 mM glucose + exendin-4 stimulation gets close to that value. With the increasing effect of cholesterol-loaded MβCD on basal secretion at 11 mM glucose, exendin-4 stimulation would then appear to work less well.</p><p>We have performed a simple experiment to investigate this possibility: insulin secretion following stimulation with a secretagogue cocktail (20 mM glucose, 30 mM KCl, 10 µM FSK and 100 µM IBMX) in islets +/- MβCD/cholesterol loading to determine if maximal stimulation had been reached or not in our original experiment. This experiment, now included in Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 1C, demonstrates that insulin secretion can increase up to ~4% (from ~2%) in our islets, supporting our initial conclusion. We have also included absolute insulin concentrations as well as percentages of secretion for all the experiments included in the study in the new Supplementary File 3 to improve the completeness of the report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To me the most important experiment of them all is the simvastatin experiment, but the results rest on very few numbers and there is a large variation.

While this falls outside the scope of the present paper, we encourage other researchers with access to clinical data on GLP-1R agonist responses in individuals taking cholesterol lowering agents to share their results with the scientific community.

Table 1 and Figure 9 are very beneficial to summarize the findings. The lower interaction with cholesterol and lower membrane diffusion in V229A GLP-1R resembles the reduced diffusion of wt GLP-1R with simv-induced cholesterol reductions, although by presumably decreasing the cholesterol available to interact with wt GLP-1R. This could be interesting to see if lowering cholesterol alters other behaviors of wt GLP-1R that look similar to V229A GLP-1R. I further wonder if the authors expect that increased cholesterol content of islets (with loading of MβCD saturated with cholesterol or high-cholesterol diets) would elevate baseline GLP-1R membrane diffusion, and if a more broad relationship can be drawn between GLP-1R membrane movement and downstream signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>Membrane diffusion experiments are difficult to perform in intact islets as our method requires cell monolayers for RICS analysis. We however agree that it is of interest to investigate if cholesterol loading affects GLP-1R diffusion. To this end, we have performed further RICS analysis in INS-1 832/3 SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R cells pretreated with vehicle or MβCD loaded with 20 mM cholesterol (new Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 1D and 1E). Interestingly, results show significantly increased plasma membrane diffusion of exendin-4-stimulated receptors, with no change in basal diffusion, following MβCD/cholesterol loading. This behaviour differs from that of the V229A mutant receptor which shows reduced diffusion under basal conditions, a pattern that mimics that of the WT receptor under low cholesterol conditions (by pre-treatment with LPDS/simvastatin).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I think there are no obvious weaknesses in this manuscript and overall, I believe the authors achieved their aims and have demonstrated the importance of cholesterol interactions on GLP-1R functioning in beta-cells.

This assay therefore measures GLP-1R activation specifically at each of these two subcellular locations. We have included a schematic of this assay in the new Figure 7 - Figure Supplement 1 to clarify the aim of these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Certainly many follow-up experiments are possible from these initial findings and of primary interest is how this mutation affects insulin homeostasis in vivo under different physiological conditions.
