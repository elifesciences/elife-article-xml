cortical pyramidal neurons. The differential electrophysiological properties and distributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels lead to distinct contributions to AP initiation and propagation. While Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 at the distal AIS promotes AP initiation and forward propagation, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 at the proximal AIS promotes the backpropagation of APs to the soma. Here, we show the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway modulates Na<sup>+</sup> channels at the AIS to increase neuronal gain and the speed of backpropagation. Since SUMO does not affect Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, these effects were attributed to SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2. Moreover, SUMO effects were absent in a mouse engineered to express Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38Gln channels that lack the site for SUMO linkage. Thus, SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 exclusively controls I<sub>NaP</sub> generation and AP backpropagation, thereby playing a prominent role in synaptic integration and plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SUMO</kwd><kwd>pyramidal neuron</kwd><kwd>axon initial segment</kwd><kwd>persistent sodium current</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd><kwd>backpropagation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1384/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleidervish</surname><given-names>Ilya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL10549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Steven AN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In cortical pyramidal neurons, subtype-specific SUMOylation of Na+ channels regulates input-output relationships, synaptic boosting, and action potential propagation from the axonal trigger zone back into the dendrites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In cortical pyramidal cells, as in many central nervous system (CNS) neurons, action potentials (APs) initiate in the axon initial segment (AIS), the proximal part of the axon where the neuronal membrane is not covered with a myelin sheath. The AIS is characterized by a specialized assembly of scaffolding proteins and voltage-gated channels with distinctive biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bean, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rasband, 2010</xref>). Classically, APs propagate forward from the AIS into the axonal arbor, triggering neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals. APs can also propagate backward into the dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells, where they are proposed to play a role in synaptic plasticity by regulating synaptic strength and the coordination of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stuart and Sakmann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markram et al., 1997</xref>). Both initiation and propagation of APs are critically dependent on the distribution and properties of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Na<sub>V</sub>) channels in specific neuronal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stuart et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baranauskas et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, identifying signaling pathways that regulate the biophysical properties of neuronal Na<sub>V</sub> channels is key to understanding spike generation, propagation, and integration in cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantrell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantrell and Catterall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kole and Stuart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Central neurons express, to varying degrees, three primary Na<sub>V</sub> channels Î±-subunit isoforms. Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 are found in mature neurons, while Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are also found in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldin et al., 2000</xref>). Each Na<sub>V</sub> isoform has a distinct spatiotemporal distribution and is subject to the activity of specific signaling pathways that regulate the biophysical properties and trafficking behavior of the channel. For example, in mature pyramidal neurons, the AP trigger zone, which is located in the distal AIS, contains almost exclusively Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lorincz and Nusser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lorincz and Nusser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian et al., 2014</xref>). These channels are also present in the nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldwell et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, the proximal portion of the AIS, soma, and dendrites is believed to contain mostly Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grubb et al., 2011</xref>). While this difference in the distribution has long made it tempting to posit that the initiation and forward propagation of APs are predominantly dependent on Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels and the backpropagation of APs is dependent on the activity of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels, studies of the biophysical attributes of the two channels have not previously verified this hypothesis.</p><p>While heterologous studies show that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels activate at more negative voltages than other neuronal Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms and have a higher propensity to generate non-inactivating currents, differences in the gating behavior of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels appear to be subtle within their native neuronal milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou and Goldin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rush et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, using knockout mice, we found that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels were not required to determine the initiation site for APs within the AIS, for backpropagation into the dendrites, or for the lower activation threshold voltage for APs that is commonly observed in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although the biophysical differences between native Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 are subtle, each channel isoform is differentially regulated by neuromodulators. Thus, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels are less sensitive to inhibition by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). This finding explains divergent regulation of Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtypes following the activation of D1/D5 dopamine or 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> serotonergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maurice et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2017</xref>). We have shown that ion channels are also subject to post-translational regulation by covalent linkage of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plant et al., 2020</xref>). Three SUMO isoforms (SUMO1â3) are operative in central neurons and can modulate the gating of specific channels following their conjugation to the Îµ-amino group of specific lysine residues on the intracellular termini or cytoplasmic loops of the channel subunits. Further, we found the enzymes required to activate, mature, and conjugate SUMO reside in the plasma membrane of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, tissue culture cells, and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>). Although SUMOylation is a covalent post-translational modification, it is a dynamic process subject to rapid reversal by the action of the SENP family of sentrin-specific cysteine proteases. Thus far, we have observed that SUMOylation increases excitability either by decreasing potassium flux through K<sub>V</sub> and K2P channels or by increasing the activity of Na<sub>V</sub> channels and that the opposite functional effects are mediated by the activity of SENPs. Further, we have observed that SUMOylation status varies among channel types at baseline and in response to environmental stimuli such as hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plant et al., 2020</xref>), and particularly germane to this study, that SUMO has differential effects on the principal Na<sub>V</sub> channel isoforms expressed in central neurons. Specifically, we found that SUMOylation modulates the voltage-dependent gating of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels via linking to lysine 38, but SUMO does not interact with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we tested the hypothesis that SUMOylation regulates the excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons. By combining whole-cell recordings with high-speed fluorescence imaging to simultaneously monitor Na<sup>+</sup> flux in different subcellular compartments of L5 cortical neurons, we found that SUMO1 increases excitability via a synergistic effect on subthreshold K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> conductances. Thus, SUMOylation suppresses the open probability of K<sup>+</sup> channels while concurrently increasing Na<sup>+</sup> influx via a leftward shift in the steady-state activation of subthreshold persistent Na<sup>+</sup> currents. These effects are absent in a CRISPR-generated mouse that constitutively expresses Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38Gln channels, a channel variant that cannot be SUMOylated. Confirming the long-held notion for their roles in the AIS based on distribution, and consistent with our previous report that SUMO regulates Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 but not Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels, we demonstrate that SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 regulates the velocity of backpropagation in cortical pyramidal neurons independent of the speed at which AP propagate forward from the AIS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SUMO1 increases the excitability of layer 5 cortical neurons</title><p>Previously, we showed that the effects of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation of neuronal ion channels underlying <italic>I<sub>DR</sub></italic>, <italic>I<sub>Kso</sub>,</italic> and <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> could be assessed by including purified SUMO1 or SENP1 polypeptides, respectively, in the recording pipette solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>). To characterize the effects of the SUMO pathway on the excitability of layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons, we made whole-cell, current-clamp recordings from these cells using pipettes filled with a solution containing SUMO1 or SENP1 polypeptides at 1000 and 250 pmol/l, respectively. We have previously shown that polypeptides at these concentrations produce maximal effects on K<sub>V</sub>, K<sub>2P</sub>, and Na<sub>V</sub> channels in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule neurons, human ventricular cardiomyocytes derived from iPS cells, and on channels expressed in heterologous cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plant et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Passive neuronal properties and repetitive firing characteristics were assessed by examining the voltage responses to a series of prolonged hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses delivered via the somatic pipette. Because cortical cells are geometrically complex, we compared data obtained 2 min and 35 min after breakthrough into whole-cell configuration to account for slow intracellular dialysis of the polypeptide into the neurons. As SUMO1 diffused into the cell, the frequency of spike firing in response to a given depolarizing suprathreshold current pulse increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Thus, the mean instantaneous firing frequency in response to a 0.3 nA current injection increased from 17.5 Â± 3.6 Hz immediately after the break-in to 29.0 Â± 5.4 Hz (n = 8, p=0.036, paired <italic>t</italic>-test) after 35 min of SUMO1 dialysis. In contrast, dialysis with the SENP1-containing solution caused a gradual decrease in the frequency of repetitive firing over time. The mean instantaneous firing frequency in response to a 0.3 nA current pulse decreased from 20.5 Â± 3.4 Hz immediately after the break-in to 7.3 Â± 3.5 Hz (n = 8, p=0.002, paired <italic>t</italic>-test) after 35 min of SENP1 dialysis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SUMOylation and deSUMOylation have opposing effects on the excitability of layer 5 pyramidal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Current-clamp, whole-cell recordings from L5 neurons 2 min after the break-in to whole-cell mode (black) and 35 min later demonstrate time-dependent effects of SUMO1 (blue) or SENP1 (green) dialysis on firing frequency.

Thus, the apparent input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>), calculated as a ratio of the steady-state amplitude of the voltage deflection to current amplitude, gradually increased when SUMO1 was included in the pipette, from 96.1 Â± 12.7 MÎ© at a time of break-in to the cell to 122.5 Â± 13.7 MÎ© (n = 8, p&lt;0.002) at 35 min of recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In contrast, dialysis of the neurons with SENP1 caused R<sub>in</sub> to decrease as a function of recording time from 130.0 Â± 24.9 MÎ© to 80.4 Â± 14.6 MÎ© (n = 6, p&lt;0.01). In parallel, the membrane time constant (Ï<sub>m</sub>) obtained by fitting a monoexponential function to the voltage transient following the end of the hyperpolarizing current pulse was increased by SUMO1 application from 16.8 Â± 1.9 ms at the time of break-in to 22.8 Â± 2.7 ms (n = 8, p&lt;0.01) and shortened by SENP1 application from 17.7 Â± 0.7 ms to 11.2 Â± 1.3 ms (n = 8, p&lt;0.001). Recording of similar duration with control intracellular solution had no significant effect on R<sub>in</sub> (113.7 Â± 9.3 vs. 112.8 Â± 8.9 MÎ©, n = 11, p=0.77) and Ï<sub>m</sub> (24.3 Â± 2.2 vs. 21.2 Â± 1.9 ms, n = 11, p=0.09). These findings indicate that in L5 cortical neurons the SUMO pathway regulates potassium channels that determine the passive membrane properties. Furthermore, the relatively high effectiveness of SENP1 suggests that in L5 neurons, as in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>), a significant fraction of these channels are SUMOylated under control conditions.</p><p>The effect of SUMO1 and SENP1 on repetitive firing may reflect the action of the polypeptides on passive neuronal characteristics or their influence on the ion currents underlying spike generation. Theoretical analysis revealed that while the former mechanism should elicit a parallel shift of the frequencyâcurrent (F-I) curve to the right or left along the current axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chance et al., 2002</xref>), the latter should alter the neuronal gain, that is, the steepness of the slope of the F-I characteristic.

To find out whether the leftward shift in voltage dependence of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 activation could increase the backpropagation velocity, we studied the dynamics of AP propagation in a simplified compartmental model in which we distributed the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels in accordance with immunohistochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). In good agreement with our experimental results, a 6 mV leftward shift in half-activation voltage of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 caused an about twofold increase in AP backpropagation velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>), whereas the forward propagation remained almost unaffected. Thus, our data indicates that in cortical pyramidal neurons SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels could provide a âswitchâ allowing differential regulation of the AP invasion into the dendritic tree and synaptic plasticity, whereas the ongoing neuronal activity that relies on SUMO-resistant, Nav1.6-mediated, spike forward propagation, would not be affected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have previously shown that SUMOylation has opposite but synergistic effects on Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channel gating that conspire to increase neuronal excitability. Our present findings in cortical brain slices reveal that SUMO1, on the one hand, increases the inward persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, and on the other hand, decreases the outward potassium current at the subthreshold range of voltages. Together, the SUMOylation of these channels enhances the gain of neuronal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chance et al., 2002</xref>) to depolarizing current injection by increasing the steepness of the post-spike voltage trajectory towards the next spike threshold. In contrast, we found that deSUMOylation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels by SENP1 decreases neuronal gain, indicating that native neuronal channels are partially SUMOylated under baseline conditions. These findings are congruent with reports describing SUMO-regulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Welch et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We have recently reported that, in Na<sub>v</sub>1.6-deficient L5 pyramidal neurons, the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels expressed in the AIS still show a clear hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation compared with somatic channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katz et al., 2018</xref>). One of the goals of this study was to find out whether SUMOylation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>) could be, at least partially, responsible for the axo-somatic difference in Na<sup>+</sup> channel gating. Because whole-cell recording of transient Na<sup>+</sup> current is not achievable in huge, geometrically complex L5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spruston et al., 1993</xref>), we used a combination of electrical and Na<sup>+</sup> imaging recording to compare the voltage dependence of somatic and axonal I<sub>NaP</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleidervish et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shvartsman et al., 2021</xref>).

It is, therefore, unlikely that this variability is caused by a difference in SUMOylation, but it rather reflects the inhomogeneity of morphological and functional properties within the L5 neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chagnac-Amitai et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We postulate that the effects of SUMO1 differ in different parts of the neuron due to the heterogeneous subcellular distribution of Na<sup>+</sup> channel subtypes and their differential susceptibility to SUMOylation. In pyramidal neurons, the SUMO1-sensitive sodium channels, Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, are in the area associated with backpropagation, that is, in the soma, dendrites, and proximal parts of the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lorincz and Nusser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grubb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The SUMO1-insensitive Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 channels, however, are located mainly in the distal part of the AIS and in the nodes of Ranvier, that is, in the compartments associated with spike forward propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldwell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lorincz and Nusser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The differential effects of SUMO1 on propagation speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), in addition to the differential effect of SUMO1 on the activation curve of the I<sub>NaP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), are part of complex, compartment-specific neuromodulatory processes regulating neuronal excitability.</p><p>Our evidence that, in cortical pyramidal neurons, SUMO1 facilitates spike backpropagation but not forward propagation suggests that SUMOylation is less involved in regulating timing and synchrony in the cortical neuronal circuits. However, SUMO1, in its physiological context, may play an essential role in regulating the spike-time-dependent plasticity of dendritic spines. The backpropagating APs invading the dendrites remove Mg<sup>2+</sup> from NMDA receptor channels and trigger long-lasting changes in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">SjÃ¶strÃ¶m et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>). The activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors decreases the success rate of AP backpropagation and enhances the segregation of axonal and dendritic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Unlike phosphorylation, SUMOylation of the target proteins is reported to depend on SUMO concentration (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flotho and Melchior, 2013</xref>). SUMO acts as a limiting factor for conjugation because of the abundance of enzymes responsible for SUMO attachment in the cytosol. Similarly, the concentration of SUMO-specific proteases that cleave the isopeptide bonds is a limiting factor for deSUMOylation. Thus, intracellular administration of the exogenous SUMO1 and SENP1 is capable of either saturating or emptying the SUMO-conjugation sites on the ion channels, respectively, reflecting the local concentrations of the polypeptides. However, because of the complex morphological structure of L5 pyramidal neurons, diffusion of SUMO1 and SENP1 from the somatic whole-cell pipette into the cytosol is expected to be extremely slow, with half diffusion times of several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fleidervish et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, a limitation of this study is that the concentration of these polypeptides is expected to be significantly lower throughout the neurons than the pipette concentration, making it difficult to predict whether SUMOylation of the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels has reached a steady state even after our 30 min protocols.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that SUMOylation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels significantly increases the speed of AP backpropagation. The subsequent events and consequences due to the acceleration may need to be further investigated, for example, the change of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient to synaptic contacts on dendrites, the alteration of local dendritic membrane excitability, and the potential effects on other neuromodulator receptors. SUMOylation might alter the time delay between the pre- and postsynaptic APs, thereby influencing the resulting change in synaptic efficiency. Together with the synergistic effect on the excitability in cortical pyramidal neurons, our findings suggest that Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and the SUMO pathway might be a new mechanism for regulating AP and neuronal function in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Human SUMO1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R&amp;D Systems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UL-740</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Human SENP1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R&amp;D Systems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">E-700</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse: C57BL/6N-<italic>Scn2a</italic><sup>K38QMut/+</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biocytogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EGE-ZY-016</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NEURON 8.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Yale University</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_005393</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Lead contact and materials availability</title><p>Further Information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to the lead contacts.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Theodore R Cummins (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that these results are solid and interesting. However, reviewers also raised several concerns about the interpretation of the data and some other aspects related to data analysis and discussion that should be addressed by the authors. Essential revisions should include:</p><p>1) Discuss the effect of SUMOylation on the frequency of firing.</p><p>2) Review statistical analysis and/or data in all Figures, following the suggestions by reviewer #2.</p><p>3) Discuss potential differences in neuronal types used in the study, and explain differences in neuronal parameters after treatments identified in some experiments (e.g. Figure 1-Sup. 1).</p><p>4) Provide an extended comparison of Nav1.2-Lys38Gln with wild type neuronal properties in similar experimental conditions.</p><p>5) Discuss the limitations of the slice recordings and alternative interpretations of the obtained results using ramp-elicited currents, e.g. what/if other sodium current properties, not examined in this study, could contribute to the observed results. Additionally, discuss how this interpretation relates to the changes observed in the previous studies (e.g., Plant et al., 2016).</p><p>6) Revise the text according to all recommendations raised by the reviewers and listed in the individual reviews below.</p><p>Because the individual reviews include several important points they are included here for your reference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It seemed odd that the effects of SUMO1 and SENP1 on the f-I curve in wild-type mice were relegated to a Supplemental figure while the lack of effect on the f-I slope in the engineered mouse was in a main figure â it seemed that the opposite (or showing both in a main figure) would be more logical.</p><p>322 &quot;We observe that the effects of SUMO1 differs in different parts of&quot;â¦should be &quot;differ&quot; to match &quot;effects&quot;.</p><p>338 &quot;Our evidence that SUMO1 affects the backpropagation, but not forward propagation indicates that activation of SUMOylation pathways does not affect the ongoing processing by the cortical neuronal circuits.&quot;</p><p>It seems that the dramatic changes in the f-I relation do constitute a significant change in processing.</p><p>232 and 579 &quot;leftward shift of activation kinetics&quot; might be more precisely &quot;leftward shift of voltage-dependence&quot;, since it is the voltage-dependence rather than kinetics that is shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Regarding the point 1 from &quot;public review&quot;, I would like to mention two examples for better understanding:</p><p>â Lines 156-158: &quot;mean instantaneous firing frequency in response to a 0.3 nA current injection increased from 14.7{plus minus}3.9 Hz immediately after the break-in to 25.7{plus minus}5.4 Hz (n=6, p=0.029) after 35 mins of SUMO1 dialysis.&quot;</p><p>Values are mean +/- S.E.

It would be good to clarify what is being used and tighten up the language so that it is accurate.</p><p>Is there a change in resting membrane potential with the recombinant proteins? Is input resistance estimated from the resting membrane potential? These details may be important and should be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81463.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Discuss the effect of SUMOylation on the frequency of firing.</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion on the effect of SUMOylation on the frequency of firing has been extended, and the relevant paper by Chance, Abbott and Reyes (2002) has been cited (see Discussion, p. 14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Review statistical analysis and/or data in all Figures, following the suggestions by reviewer #2.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.
