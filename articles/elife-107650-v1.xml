purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration – transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia–neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prions</kwd><kwd>prion diseases</kwd><kwd>reactive microglia</kwd><kwd>P2Y6</kwd><kwd>neuronal surveillance</kwd><kwd>microglial mobility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS045585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baskakov</surname><given-names>Ilia V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS129502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baskakov</surname><given-names>Ilia V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In chronic neurodegeneration associated with prion disease, reactive microglia adopt a highly mobile, neuron-by-neuron surveillance strategy, replacing homeostatic process-based monitoring with dynamic somatic migration and prolonged neuronal engagement.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Under homeostatic conditions, microglia continuously monitor neuronal health through specialized structures known as somatic purinergic junctions – sites where microglial processes make direct contact with neuronal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cserép et al., 2020</xref>). A key molecular component of these junctions is the P2Y12 receptor, which plays a critical role in mediating microglia–neuron communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cserép et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cserép et al., 2022</xref>). Homeostatic, ramified microglia exhibit highly dynamic behavior, extending and retracting their processes in a phenomenon termed <italic>microglial motility</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cserép et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nebeling et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rotterman and Alvarez, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Damani et al., 2011</xref>). These transient process-to-soma contacts constitute the primary mode of neuronal surveillance in the healthy brain.</p><p>Under chronic neurodegenerative conditions, microglia acquire a sustained reactive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Makarava et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butovsky and Weiner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krasemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keren-Shaul et al., 2017</xref>). Reactive microglia differ markedly in morphology from their homeostatic counterparts, displaying an amoeboid shape with reduced process complexity. Both microglial ramification and P2Y12 receptor expression are significantly diminished as microglia transition to the reactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butovsky and Weiner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krasemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zrzavy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenkhuis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holtman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maeda et al., 2021</xref>). Paradoxically, this occurs at a time when the demand for neuronal surveillance intensifies due to increased neuronal stress and dysfunction. How microglia maintain effective surveillance of neurons under conditions of chronic neuroinflammation remains poorly understood.</p><p>Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are fatal and infectious neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prusiner, 1998</xref>). The hallmark pathological event in these diseases is the accumulation and spread of the misfolded, β-sheet-rich isoform of the prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) throughout the central nervous system. This process involves the templated conversion of the host’s normal cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into the disease-associated PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Legname et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Makarava et al., 2018</xref>). Chronic neuroinflammation is a prominent neuropathological feature of prion diseases, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Makarava et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butovsky and Weiner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krasemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keren-Shaul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Makarava et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Makarava et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, unlike animal models of other neurodegenerative diseases, prion-infected animals including mice develop authentic ultimately lethal neurodegenerative disease that recapitulates key features of the human prion disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watts and Prusiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeffrey et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we demonstrated that in prion-infected mice, reactive microglia engage in a distinct form of microglia–neuron interaction characterized by partial envelopment of neuronal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Makarava et al., 2024</xref>). These extensive body-to-body contacts differ from typical process-based surveillance. The enveloped neurons appear structurally intact, lack classical apoptotic markers, but exhibit functional impairments. This phenomenon is consistently observed across multiple brain regions exhibiting neuroinflammation in both prion-infected mice and human cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Makarava et al., 2024</xref>). Strikingly, genetic ablation of P2Y12 increases the frequency of neuronal envelopment and accelerates disease progression in prion-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarava et al., 2025</xref>). In non-infected mice, P2Y12 deletion also increases the prevalence of microglia–neuron body-to-body interactions at the expense of process-to-body contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarava et al., 2025</xref>). These findings suggest that neuronal envelopment represents an alternative, P2Y12-independent mode of microglial surveillance, employed by reactive microglia under pathological conditions.</p><p>To date, quantification of neuronal envelopment has relied on fixed brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Makarava et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarava et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinha et al., 2021</xref>), leaving key questions about the temporal dynamics of these interactions unresolved. Although the frequency of envelopment increases with disease progression, it remains unclear whether individual interactions are sustained over time or whether reactive microglia sequentially engage multiple neurons through transient contacts.</p><p>The current study employed ex vivo time-lapse imaging of acute organotypic brain slices prepared from prion-infected mice to investigate the surveillance behavior of reactive microglia under chronic neurodegenerative conditions. Unlike homeostatic microglia, reactive myeloid cells lose territorial confinement. In contrast to homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility but high process motility enabling simultaneous monitoring of multiple neurons, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. Reactive microglia move dynamically through tissue, engaging in sequential body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. This shift in behavior represents a fundamental reorganization of microglial surveillance strategies in the diseased brain. Surprisingly, acutely isolated reactive microglia retained high-mobility in vitro in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that this dynamic behavior is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. The current studies reveal that in the reactive state, microglia adopt fundamentally different surveillance strategies to respond to the altered demands of the chronically inflamed and degenerating brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reactive microglia envelop neurons</title><p>To investigate microglial dynamics, we performed ex vivo time-lapse imaging using acute organotypic brain slices prepared from Cx3cr1/EGFP mice (fractalkine receptor knockout/EGFP knock-in). These mice express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the endogenous <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> promoter, restricting expression to myeloid cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency does not influence disease pathogenesis, survival, or microglial activation in mice infected with the 22L or RML prion strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Striebel et al., 2016</xref>). In agreement with these findings, we observed that <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency and EGFP knock-in in Cx3cr1/EGFP mice did not alter the incubation time to disease following infection with mouse-adapted SSLOW or 22L prion strains, compared to wild-type (WT; C57BL/6J) controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation levels were comparable between SSLOW-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>For subsequent experiments, we selected the SSLOW strain due to its strong induction of neuroinflammation and the shortest incubation time among mouse-adapted prion strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makarava et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Makarava et al., 2021</xref>). In prior studies, neuronal envelopment by microglia was consistently observed across all brain regions exhibiting prion-induced neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Makarava et al., 2024</xref>).

Imaging was conducted at three stages of disease progression: late sub-clinical (111–113 days post-inoculation, dpi), early clinical (125–128 dpi), and advanced (162–169 dpi). In mice inoculated with SSLOW via ip route, clinical onset typically occurs around 122 dpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Makarava et al., 2024</xref>). Western blotting confirmed the presence of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the brains of mice examined at all three stages, with progressive accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> correlating with disease advancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Age-matched non-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP mice (160–164 days old) served as healthy controls.</p><p>To be consistent with previously established terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smolders et al., 2019</xref>), the term ‘motility’ will be used to refer to the movement of microglia processes, whereas the movement of cell bodies to new positions will be referred to by the term ‘mobility’. Initial time-lapse recordings of acute brain slices from non-infected adult Cx3cr1/EGFP mice, acquired at a rate of one frame every 5 min, demonstrated that microglial morphology remained ramified – indicative of a homeostatic state – for at least 6 hr of continuous imaging (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). During this period, microglia largely remained within defined territories, displaying limited somatic mobility but sustained dynamic process activity, confirming cellular viability (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). However, noticeable photobleaching occurred after approximately 3 hr of imaging, with accelerated photobleaching observed at higher imaging frequencies. Accordingly, all subsequent time-lapse videos were captured at a frame rate of one frame every 5 min.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that transcriptomic changes in slice cultures are most pronounced 1 day post-preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delbridge et al., 2020</xref>), though morphological, functional, and gene expression alterations can begin as early as 4 hr post-slicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrucci et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast to the stable process motility observed in homeostatic microglia, EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in slices from SSLOW-infected animals exhibited both high process activity and active somatic translocation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). To define the optimal imaging window for capturing dynamic behavior, we tracked individual cell movements across six consecutive 1-hr intervals following slice preparation. Microglial activity progressively declined after 3–4 hr in both SSLOW-infected and control slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), prompting us to restrict all subsequent imaging experiments to a 3-hr window.</p><p>At all examined disease stages, EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in prion-infected brains displayed significantly increased mobility compared to controls, as reflected by elevated mean speed and total soma displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>).

These surveillance mechanisms in the homeostatic state are primarily tuned to detect acute injuries, as microglia respond to changes in neuronal activity and environmental signals such as ATP, ADP, and UDP released by damaged neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rotterman and Alvarez, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Damani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koizumi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fekete et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohsawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eyo et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to acute or focal injuries, neuronal dysfunction in chronic conditions evolves gradually and spreads across broader regions. It is commonly assumed that reactive microglia continue to rely on the same cues and surveillance strategies as in the homeostatic state. However, during the transition to a reactive phenotype in the context of chronic neurodegeneration, both the complexity and number of microglial processes involved in surveillance decrease, even as the demand for neuronal monitoring intensifies. Additionally, expression of P2Y12, a key receptor for sensing ATP and ADP at purinergic junctions, is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butovsky and Weiner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krasemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zrzavy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenkhuis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holtman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maeda et al., 2021</xref>). This raises a critical question: How do reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies to meet the increasing demands of chronic neurodegeneration?</p><p>Our findings suggest that, in the reactive state, microglia adopt a distinct approach to neuronal monitoring. In the homeostatic brain, individual microglial cells occupy well-defined territories, extending their processes to simultaneously contact multiple neurons. By contrast, in the reactive state, myeloid cells lose this territorial organization, becoming highly mobile and migrating through the extracellular matrix. They pause intermittently to form direct body-to-body contacts, typically with one neuron at a time. This movement begins with process extension, followed by somal translocation along the path of the extended process.</p><p>On average, each myeloid cell surveyed one neuron per hour. However, the duration of contact varied considerably – from a few minutes to several hours – as did the extent of neuronal envelopment. Partial envelopment of neuronal somas was the most common form of interaction, though full envelopment was also observed. Notably, full envelopment was often reversible, transitioning back to partial envelopment or complete retraction. These ongoing morphological changes – including the appearance, disappearance, and reappearance of intercellular contacts – underscore the highly dynamic nature of communication between reactive myeloid cells and neuronal somas. Although individual contacts were fluid, they could be maintained for several hours. It is tempting to speculate that the duration and degree of envelopment may reflect both the extent of neuronal damage and the complexity of the underlying decision-making processes governing neuronal fate.</p><p>Reactive myeloid cells frequently interacted with two or three neuronal somas simultaneously, exhibiting oscillatory or ‘wobbling’ movements between them. This behavior suggests a capacity for multitarget surveillance. Moreover, within a 3-hr window, multiple myeloid cells could be observed sequentially interacting with the same neuron, indicating again a breakdown of territorial organization.</p><p>To navigate the extracellular matrix, an amoeboid morphology offers clear advantages over a ramified one. In the reactive state, microglia upregulate matrix-degrading enzymes that facilitate migration by clearing paths through the adhesive matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lively and Schlichter, 2013</xref>). The mobility pattern of reactive myeloid cells observed in our study resembles that of embryonic mouse microglia, which alternate between phases of process extension and subsequent somal translocation along the axis of the extended processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smolders et al., 2017</xref>). This mechanical similarity suggests that reactive microglia may engage migratory mechanisms akin to those used during developmental stages to support their surveillance functions. However, unlike their embryonic counterparts, reactive myeloid cells appear to actively scan their environment to select among multiple potential neuronal targets, indicating a more decision-oriented migratory behavior.</p><p>In our study, the average speed of the highly mobile microglial population ranged from 13.2 μm/hr at the sub-clinical stage to 19.1 μm/hr at the advanced disease stage. These velocities are lower than those reported for hippocampal microglia at postnatal day 2 (~36 μm/hr) and cortical microglia at embryonic day 17.5 (~25 μm/hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eyo et al., 2016</xref>). It is important to note that our measurements likely underestimate actual migration speeds due to the low frequency of frame acquisition in time-lapse experiments and potential movements occurring between frames that were not captured.</p><p>In this work, we classified cells into two categories – high and low mobility – based on their behavior during the 3-hr observation period. It remains unclear whether these categories represent distinct phenotypic subpopulations. Given the limited time window, the observed mobility differences may reflect transient stages within the dynamic surveying behavior, rather than stable phenotypic traits. At the advanced disease stage, the proportion of highly mobile cells declined, potentially due to prolonged interactions between myeloid cells and neurons. This observation raises compelling questions for future investigation, including whether distinct phenotypes emerge among reactive myeloid cells as a consequence of neuronal interactions, and what the functional implications of such differences might be.</p><p>The activation and migration of homeostatic microglia in response to acute neuronal injury are known to be mediated by calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Umpierre et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Umpierre et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du et al., 2022</xref>). In the present study, sustained calcium bursts were observed in association with the migratory activity of high-mobility myeloid cells, suggesting that calcium signaling is crucial for migration in the reactive state too. However, unlike the brief calcium transients typically observed in homeostatic microglia, which last up to a minute, reactive myeloid cells exhibited elevated calcium levels for extended durations of at least 3 hr.</p><p>In microglia, calcium signaling is regulated in part by the metabotropic P2Y6 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Umpierre et al., 2024</xref>). Activation of P2Y6 by its endogenous ligand UDP has been implicated in various microglial functions, including migration, phagocytosis of damaged neurons, and clearance of apoptotic bodies and Aβ plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neher et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Umpierre et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puigdellívol et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Milde et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koizumi et al., 2007</xref>). In the present study, we found that the P2Y6 antagonist MRS-2578 partially suppressed the migration of reactive myeloid cells but did not prevent their association with neurons. These findings suggest that while P2Y6 signaling facilitates the mobility of myeloid cells, it does not mediate their physical interaction with neurons. This points to a specific role for P2Y6 in the surveillance behavior of reactive myeloid cells under conditions of chronic neurodegeneration. Multiple purinergic receptors, including P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y12, P2RY13, P2X4, and P2X7, have been implicated in microglial chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and directed movement in response to acute injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smolders et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franco-Bocanegra et al., 2019</xref>). In prion-infected mice, we observed modest upregulation of <italic>P2ry6</italic>, <italic>P2ry13</italic>, and <italic>P2rx7</italic>, with no detectable change in <italic>P2rx4</italic> expression, whereas prior studies have reported downregulation of P2Y12 receptor when normalized per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarava et al., 2025</xref>). Nevertheless, the observation that MRS-2578 only partially inhibited cell movement supports the idea that multiple, potentially redundant pathways govern microglial mobility.</p><p>A particularly intriguing finding of this study is that reactive myeloid cells maintained elevated mobility upon acute isolation in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli or neuronal activity. This indicates that heightened mobility is an intrinsic property of the reactive phenotype, in stark contrast to homeostatic microglia, which typically require external cues to initiate soma migration. These results imply that signaling mechanisms beyond purinergic pathways contribute to the enhanced mobility of reactive myeloid cells. It is possible that this behavior is sustained through autocrine or paracrine signaling involving proinflammatory factors secreted by reactive microglia themselves. Supporting this notion, recent work has demonstrated that IFNγ promotes microglial migration in the adult mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boghozian et al., 2023</xref>), and genes associated with IFNγ signaling are upregulated in microglia from prion-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nazmi et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies will be needed to determine whether such autonomous signaling mechanisms underlie the highly mobile phenotype.</p><p>Quantitatively, the mean speed and total distance traveled by reactive myeloid cells in vitro were two- to threefold greater than those observed in acute brain slices. This is not unexpected, given that in situ, cells must navigate the extracellular matrix and often pause to establish direct contacts with neurons. Notably, co-culturing reactive microglia with N2a neuronal cells increased their mobility even further. In the presence of N2a cells, reactive microglia exhibited more directed and less stochastic movement patterns. These observations suggest that, in a reactive state, myeloid cells retain a heightened responsiveness to environmental cues that do not elicit similar behavioral changes in homeostatic microglia.</p><p>Several limitations of this study warrant discussion. In Cx3cr1/EGFP mice, all myeloid cells, including monocytes and macrophages, express EGFP, raising questions about the specific identity of the myeloid cells that establish extensive contacts with neurons. Our current and previous work demonstrated that myeloid cells enveloping neurons are positive for TMEM119 and P2Y12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarava et al., 2025</xref>), markers generally associated with resident microglia. Additionally, prior studies have shown that microglial expansion in prion diseases primarily results from the proliferation of resident microglia, with minimal contribution from peripheral myeloid cell recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gómez-Nicola et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gómez-Nicola et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, infiltration of peripheral myeloid cells and their potential role in neuronal surveillance cannot be completely ruled out.</p><p>It is unclear whether reactive myeloid cells in other neurodegenerative diseases employ similar strategies for neuronal surveillance. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms and docking pathways mediating the formation of close body-to-body contacts between reactive myeloid cells and neurons are not yet understood. In earlier work, we found that knockout of CD11b, a component of complement receptor 3 involved in the phagocytosis of newborn neurons during neurodevelopment, does not affect the prevalence of neuronal envelopment or the progression of prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Makarava et al., 2024</xref>). Conversely, knockout of the P2Y12 receptor, which mediates purinergic junctions between microglial processes and neuronal soma, led to an increased prevalence of neuronal envelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarava et al., 2025</xref>). These findings suggest that P2Y12 is not required for body-to-body contact formation; rather, its absence facilitates neuronal envelopment by microglia.</p><p>The role of the high-mobility phenotype of reactive microglia in neuronal health and disease progression is poorly understood too. In a previous study, the onset of neuronal envelopment followed a decline in cellular levels of Grin1, a subunit of the NMDA receptor essential for synaptic plasticity. Reactive microglia were observed to envelop Grin1-deficient neurons, suggesting that myeloid cells respond to neuronal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Makarava et al., 2024</xref>). Notably, P2Y12 knockout increased the prevalence of neuronal envelopment and accelerated disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarava et al., 2025</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that while microglial envelopment may represent an adaptive response to heightened neuronal surveillance demands, excessive envelopment, as seen in the absence of P2Y12, appears to be maladaptive.</p><p>Cx3cr1 is a chemokine receptor expressed by microglia that binds its neuronal ligand Cx3cl1, which exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazan et al., 1997</xref>). The Cx3cr1–Cx3cl1 axis plays a role in homeostatic functions such as immune surveillance, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raoul et al., 2008</xref>). While CX3CR1 is known to regulate microglial process dynamics and migration, whether Cx3cr1 signaling reduces or accelerates microglial motility remains a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wagner et al., 2024</xref>). In the present study, we observed robust neuronal envelopment by reactive microglia in Cx3cr1/EGFP mice, which lack functional Cx3cr1, indicating that microglia-neuronal docking does not require Cx3cr1-Cx3cl1 signaling. Furthermore, microglia isolated from prion-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP and C57BL/6J mice exhibited comparably high-mobility in vitro, suggesting that Cx3cr1 contributes minimally to the regulation of surveillance behavior reactive microglia.</p><p>To summarize, the transformation of myeloid cells into a reactive phenotype involves a fundamental reorganization of microglial surveillance strategies. In the homeostatic state, microglia monitor a limited territory surrounding their location and require chemical cues to initiate migration toward sites of injury. In contrast, reactive myeloid cells exhibit high intrinsic mobility and actively search for neurons. These cells adopt a distinct surveillance pattern characterized by migration from one neuron to another, pausing to form extensive, body-to-body contacts – typically with a single neuron at a time. Prion-infected animals develop a lethal form of authentic prion disease. The observation of neuronal envelopment by reactive myeloid cells in both individuals with sporadic CJD and prion-infected mice underscores that this aspect of human disease pathology is faithfully recapitulated in prion-infected mice. To our knowledge, this study represents the first report of microglial surveillance behavior in the context of a bona fide neurodegenerative disease rather than a disease model.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>B6.129P2(Cg)-<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup></italic>/J mice (Strain 005582, The Jackson Laboratory) were purchased from the Jackson laboratory and bred in house.

B6.129P2(Cg)-<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup></italic>/J and WT mice were inoculated with 200 μl 1% BH intraperitoneally under 3% isoflurane anesthesia. Alternatively, mice were inoculated with 20 μl 1% BH intracranially (Figure S1a). In accordance with IACUC regulations, the inoculation status of animals was clearly indicated on each cage to ensure compliance with approved protocols. To minimize subjectivity, all procedures involving animal handling, including inoculation and clinical scoring, were performed by dedicated personnel who were not involved in the experimental design. This separation of duties helped reduce the potential for conscious or unconscious bias. Animals were scored weekly using four categories, each of which was graded using score ‘0–3’, with ‘3’ being the most severe impairment. The scoring categories were: clasping hind legs, posture (kyphosis, rigid tail, rearing difficulties), mobility (difficulties in ambulation and navigating the cage edge), and gait (keeping balance while walking, wobbly gait, disorientation, lethargy). The animals were deemed symptomatic when they displayed a consistent increase in the combined score starting from ‘4’.

The key here is the use of time-lapse imaging that captures the dynamics of microglial surveillance, including morphology, migration, and intracellular neuron/microglial contacts. The authors use a myeloid GFP-labeled transgenic mouse to track microglia in SSLOW-infected brain slices, quantifying differences in motility and microglial-neuronal interactions via live fluorescence imaging. Interesting findings include the elaborate patterns of motility among microglia, the distinct types and durations of intracellular contacts, the potential role of calcium signaling in facilitating hypermobility, and the fact that this motion-promoting status is intrinsic to the microglia, persisting even after the cells have been isolated from infected brains. Although largely a descriptive paper, it offers mechanistic insights, including the role of calcium in supporting microglial movement, with bursts of signaling identified even within the time lapse format, and inhibition studies implicating the purinergic receptor and calcium transient regulator P2Y6 in migratory capacity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The focus on microglia activation and activity in the context of prion disease is interesting</p><p>(2) Two different prions produce largely the same response</p><p>(3) Use of time-lapse provides insight into the dynamics of microglia, distinguishing between types of contact - mobility vs motility - and providing insight on the duration/transience and reversibility of extensive somatic contacts that include brief and focused connections in addition to soma envelopment.</p><p>(4) Imaging window selection (3 hours) guided by prior publications documenting preserved morphology, activity, and gene expression regulation up to 4 hours.</p><p>(5) The distinction between high- and low-mobility microglia is interesting, especially given that hypermobility seems to be an innate property of the cells.</p><p>(6) The live-imaging approach is validated by fixed tissue confocal imaging.</p><p>(7) The variance in duration of neuron/microglia contacts is interesting, although there is no insight into what might dictate which status of interaction predominates</p><p>(8) The reversibility of the enveloping action, which is not apparently a commitment to engulfment, is interesting, as is the fact that only neurons are selected for this activity.</p><p>(9) The calcium studies use the fluorescent dye calbryte-590, which picks up neuronal and microglial bursts -prolonged bursts are detected in enveloped neurons and in the hyper-mobile microglia - the microglial lead is followed up using MRS-2578 P2Y6 inhibitor that blunts the mobility of the microglia</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed my concerns in full - I think this is a very nice addition to the literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107650.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Subhramanian</surname><given-names>Sunitha</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bocharova</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Makarava</surname><given-names>Natallia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Safadi</surname><given-names>Tarek</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Baskakov</surname><given-names>Ilia V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review)</bold></p><p>The Cx3cr1/EGFP line labels all myeloid cells, which makes it difficult to conclude that all observed behaviors are attributable to microglia rather than infiltrating macrophages. The authors refer to this and include it as a limitation. Nonetheless, complementary confirmation by additional microglia markers would strengthen their claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment regarding the cellular identity of the enveloping myeloid cells. As suggested, we performed triple co-immunostaining of SSLOW-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP mice using markers for neurons (NeuN), myeloid cells (IBA1), and resident microglia (TMEM119 or P2Y12). Because formic acid treatment used to deactivate prions abolishes the EGFP signal, we relied on IBA1 staining to identify the myeloid population. Our results confirmed that IBA1⁺ cells exhibiting the envelopment behavior are also TMEM119⁺ and P2Y12⁺, consistent with a resident microglial phenotype. These new data are presented in Figures S3 and S4 and described in the final section of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the authors elegantly describe dynamic surveillance and envelopment hypothesis, it is unclear what the role of this phenotype is for disease progression, i.e., functional consequences. For example, are the neurons that undergo sustained envelopment more likely to degenerate?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important question regarding the functional implications of neuronal envelopment. At present, technical limitations prevent us from continuously tracking the fate of individual enveloped neurons in prion-infected mice. Nevertheless, our recent study demonstrated that P2Y12 knockout increases the prevalence of neuronal envelopment and accelerates disease progression (Makarava et al., 2025, J. Neuroinflammation). These findings suggest that while microglial envelopment may represent an adaptive response to increased neuronal surveillance demands, excessive envelopment, as observed in the absence of P2Y12, appears to be maladaptive. A new paragraph has been added to the Discussion to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, although the increase in mobility is a relevant finding, it would be interesting for the authors to further comment on what the molecular trigger(s) is/are that might promote this increase. These adaptations, which are at least long-lasting, confer apparent mobility in the absence of external stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. The molecular mechanisms underlying the increased mobility of microglia in prion-infected brains remain to be identified, and we plan to pursue this question in future studies. One possibility we briefly discuss in the revised manuscript is that proinflammatory signaling, mediated by secreted cytokines or interleukins, may drive this phenotype. Supporting this hypothesis, recent work has shown that IFNγ enhances microglial migration in the adult mouse cortex (doi:10.1073/pnas.2302892120). This work has been cited in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors performed, as far as I could understand, the experiments in cortical brain regions. There is no clear rationale for this in the manuscript, nor is it clear whether the mobility is specific to a particular brain region. This is particularly important, as microglia reactivity varies greatly depending on the brain region.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this insightful comment highlighting the importance of regional determinants of microglial reactivity, which indeed aligns with our ongoing research interests. In our previous studies, neuronal envelopment by microglia was observed consistently across all prion-affected brain regions exhibiting neuroinflammation. Assuming that envelopment requires microglial mobility, it is reasonable to speculate that microglia are mobile in all brain regions affected by prions and displaying neuroinflammatory responses. In the current study, we focused exclusively on the cortex because this region was used for quantifying the prevalence of neuronal envelopment as a function of disease progression in our prior work (DOI: 10.1172/JCI181169), which guided the present study design. Our ongoing investigations indicate that the prevalence of envelopment is region-dependent and correlates with microglial reactivity/the degree of neuroinflammation. In prion diseases, the degree of microglial reactivity is dictated by the tropism of specific prion strains to distinct brain regions. Notably, our prior studies have shown that strain-specific sialylation patterns of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycans play a key role in determining both regional strain tropism and the extent of neuroinflammatory activation (DOI: 10.3390/ijms21030828, DOI: 10.1172/JCI138677). In response to this comment, we have added a brief rationale for using the cortex in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be relevant information to have an analysis of the percentage of cells in normal, sub-clinical, early clinical, and advanced stages that became mobile. Without this information, the speed/distance alone can have different interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. The percentage of mobile cells across normal, sub-clinical, early clinical, and advanced disease stages is presented in Figure 3b and described in the final paragraph of the section “Enveloping behavior of reactive myeloid cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review)</bold></p><p>The number of individual cells tracked has been provided, but not the number of individual mice.

The primary aim of this study is to characterize behavioral patterns of single reactive myeloid cells. Analyzing data at the cell level allows us to capture the full distribution of cell behaviors and to preserve biologically meaningful heterogeneity within and across animals. By contrast, averaging values per animal would largely mask this variability. In the heat map in Figure 2d, data are averaged per animal, specifically to illustrate inter-animal variability within each group and to visualize changes across disease progression<bold>.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The potential for heterogeneity among animals has not been addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we now include a new Supplemental Figure (Figure S4) presenting the data using Superplots, in which individual cells are shown as dots, animal-level average as circles, and group means calculated based on animals as black horizontal lines. These plots demonstrate that cell mobility measures are highly consistent across animals within each group, indicating limited inter-animal heterogeneity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Validation of prion accumulation at each clinical stage of the disease is not provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide validation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation across disease stages by Western blot, along with quantitative analysis, in a new Supplemental Figure (Figure S2).

Based on the videos, there is a lot of movement and shape-shifting.</p></disp-quote><p>The following description has been added to Methods to clarify morphology analysis: For microglial morphology analysis, we quantified morphological parameters (radius, area, perimeter, and shape index) for individual EGFP⁺ cells in each time frame of the time-lapse recordings using the TrackMate 7.13.2 plugin in FIJI. Parameter values for each cell were then averaged across the entire three-hour imaging period to obtain a single mean value per cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While it is recognized that there are limits to what can be measured simultaneously with live imaging, the authors appear to have fixed tissues from each time point too - it would be very interesting to know if the extent or prion accumulation influences the microglial surveillance - i.e., do the enveloped ones have greater pathology.</p></disp-quote><p>This is very interesting question which is difficult to answer due to technical challenges in monitoring the pathology or faith of individual neuronal cells as a function of their envelopment in live prion-infected animals. Our previous work revealed that both accumulation of total PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in a brain and accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> specifically in lysosomal compartments of microglia due to phagocytosis precedes the onset of neuronal envelopment (DOI: 10.1172/JCI181169). Moreover, the onset of neuronal envelopment occurred after a noticeable decline in neuronal levels of Grin1, a subunit of the NMDA receptor essential for synaptic plasticity. Reactive microglia were observed to envelop Grin1-deficient neurons, suggesting that microglia respond to neuronal dysfunction. However, considering that envelopment is very dynamic and - in most cases - reversible, correlating the degree of envelopment with dysfunction of individual neurons is technically challenging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I recommend performing additional immunostaining using microglial markers to address specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>These new data showing immunostaining for markers of resident microglia TMEM119 and P2Y12 are presented in Figures S6 and S7 and described in the final section of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors can at least further discuss the functional consequences of their findings in further detail.</p></disp-quote><p>A new paragraph has been added to the Discussion to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Quantify the % of cells that become mobile in the different conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>The percentage of mobile cells across normal, sub-clinical, early clinical, and advanced disease stages is presented in Figure 3b and described in the final paragraph of the section “Enveloping behavior of reactive myeloid cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Improve method details on the brain regions used and further expand the statistical section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the Statistical Analysis section to indicate whether statistical comparisons and mean values were calculated at the single-cell level or the animal level for each analysis.

Only the cortical region was examined in this study; this information is stated in the Methods and is now also noted in the figure legends for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) More details on members of the PY2 receptor family expressed in microglia would be helpful. The study highlights a previously published prion-induced decline in the expression of P2Y12, a microglial marker that is required for intracellular neuron-microglial contacts, and P2Y6, involved in calcium transients, which is required for hypermotility. How are members of this family of receptors regulated at the gene and/or protein level in microglial and given their responsiveness to nucleotide ligands, are other members implicated in the properties being quantified here?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. To address this point, we examined the expression of multiple P2Y receptors and ATP-gated P2X channels known to contribute to microglial surveillance, activation, motility, and phagocytosis, alongside the activation markers Tlr2, Cd68, and Trem2. Bulk brain transcript analyses indicated that all examined genes were upregulated in SSLOW-infected mice relative to controls (new Figure S5a). However, because microglial proliferation substantially increases microglial numbers during prion disease progression, bulk tissue measurements do not necessarily reflect per-cell expression levels. Therefore, we normalized gene expression values to the microglia-specific marker Tmem119, whose per-cell expression remains stable across disease stages (Makarava et al., 2025, J. Neuroinflammation). After normalization, Tlr2, Cd68, and Trem2 were increased approximately 10-, 6-, and 4-fold, respectively. In contrast, P2 receptor genes showed more modest changes: P2ry6 increased ~3-fold, P2ry13 ~2-fold, and P2rx7 ~1.3-fold, while P2rx4 remained unchanged (Figure S5a). Within the scope of the present study, we focused on P2Y6 due to (i) its role in regulating calcium transients, (ii) the magnitude of its upregulation relative to other P2 receptors, and (iii) its highly microglia-specific expression in the CNS. We note that currently available commercial P2Y6 antibodies lack sufficient specificity, making reliable assessment of protein-level expression challenging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Is P2Y6 expressed in any other cell type that might account for the blunted mobility of the microglia? The authors mention P2Y12 also identifies the GFP cells; however, it would be beneficial to highlight the specificity of the target in the ex vivo treatment of the infected slices.</p></disp-quote><p>In the brain, both P2Y12 and P2Y6 are considered highly specific to resident microglia under physiological and neuroinflammatory conditions. P2Y12 is, in fact, widely used as a canonical marker of homeostatic and resident microglia. While P2Y6 is also expressed in peripheral myeloid cells such as macrophages, our phenotypic characterization indicates that the cells exhibiting neuronal envelopment are TMEM119⁺ and P2Y12⁺, consistent with a resident microglial identity. These data, including new analyses added to the revised manuscript, support that the cells responding to P2Y6 signaling in our ex vivo slice experiments are resident microglia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The fluorescent mouse lacks Cx3cr1 - have the authors investigated why there were no apparent consequences, at least in the context of prion infection? Are there functional redundancies that might be harnessed? Does this impact the generalizability of the findings here?</p></disp-quote><p>The role of Cx3cr1 in prion disease has been directly examined in two independent studies (doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.000442; doi: 10.1186/1471-2202-15-44). One study reported no effect of Cx3cr1 deficiency on disease incubation time, whereas the other observed only a minor difference. Importantly, both studies found no detectable alterations in microglial activation patterns, cytokine expression, or PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition in Cx3cr1-deficient mice compared to wild-type controls. Our own data (Figure S1) are consistent with these findings: disease course and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition were comparable between Cx3cr1/EGFP and wild-type mice. Moreover, we observed reactive microglial envelopment of neurons in both genotypes. Microglia isolated from SSLOW-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP mice also displayed similarly elevated mobility in vitro, in agreement with our previous observations of high mobility of microglia isolated from SSLOW-infected wild-type mice (Makarava et al., 2025, J. Neuroinflammation). Taken together, these results indicate that Cx3cr1 is not a key determinant of reactive microglial mobility or envelopment behavior in prion disease. Thus, the use of the Cx3cr1/EGFP reporter line does not compromise the generalizability of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The distinction between high mobility and low mobility microglia is interesting - is there any evidence to suggest that the slow-moving microglia are actually a separate class - do enveloping microglia exhibit both mobility states - can the authors comment on plasticity here?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this insightful comment, which closely aligns with our ongoing interests. At present, we do not have evidence to support that high- versus low-mobility microglia represent distinct molecular phenotypes. Given that our time-lapse imaging spans only a three-hour window, it remains unclear whether these mobility states reflect stable cell-intrinsic properties or transient phases within a dynamic surveillance process. Notably, we observed that individual cells can transition between more stationary, neuron-associated states and highly mobile states within the same imaging session. In future work, we intend to investigate whether prolonged interactions with neuronal somas or other microenvironmental cues may drive diversification of reactive myeloid cell phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In the discussion, the authors speculate about &quot;collective coordinated decision making&quot; - that seems a stretch unless greater context is provided. The fact that several microglia can be found in contact with an individual neuron and that each microglia can connect with multiple neurons simultaneously is certainly interesting; however, evidence for hive behavior is entirely lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our previous wording overstated the interpretation. The statement regarding collective decision-making has been removed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
