are influenced by their morphometric and morphological features, whose precise measurements require high-quality volume electron microscopy (EM). However, systematic surveys of nanoscale characteristics for identified neurons are scarce. Here, we characterize the morphology of <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) across the majority of genetically identified sensory hairs. By analyzing serial block-face electron microscopy images of cryofixed antennal tissues, we compile an extensive morphometric data set based on 122 reconstructed 3D models for 33 of the 40 identified antennal ORN types. Additionally, we observe multiple novel features—including extracellular vacuoles within sensillum lumen, intricate dendritic branching, mitochondria enrichment in select ORNs, novel sensillum types, and empty sensilla containing no neurons—which raise new questions pertinent to cell biology and sensory neurobiology. Our systematic survey is critical for future investigations into how the size and shape of sensory neurons influence their responses, sensitivity, and circuit function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfactory receptor neuron</kwd><kwd>olfactory sensillum</kwd><kwd>morphometrics</kwd><kwd>serial block-face electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>antenna</kwd><kwd>3D nanoscale model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC016466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chih-Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC015519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chih-Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DC108912</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chih-Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24NS120055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24GM137200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM082949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF2014862-UTA20-000890</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A morphological characterization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory receptor neurons—conducted systematically at nanoscale resolution—yields an extensive morphometric dataset, identifies novel features of olfactory sensilla, and raises intriguing questions for how the size and shape of sensory neurons influence their function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most insect species, including agricultural pests and disease vectors, rely on olfaction to guide critical behaviors including foraging, feeding, mating, egg-laying, and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Odor detection begins with the olfactory organs, the antenna and maxillary palp, which are covered with sensory hairs, or sensilla, that encapsulate the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, olfactory sensilla fall into four morphological classes—basiconic, coeloconic, intermediate, and trichoid—which are distinguished by their length, size, shape, and cuticular pore arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>). Notably, ORNs housed in different sensillum classes have distinct dendritic branching patterns and odor tuning properties. The outer dendritic segments of basiconic and intermediate ORNs display multiple branches, whereas the outer dendrites of coeloconic and trichoid neurons are typically unbranched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>). While basiconic ORNs respond to a wide range of odorants, trichoid neurons respond predominantly to pheromones, and most coeloconic neurons are selectively tuned to amines and carboxylic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yao et al., 2005</xref>). The link between sensillum class, dendritic branching pattern, and odor tuning property suggests that the morphological features of sensilla and ORNs likely influence olfactory function. However, testing this possibility requires a systematic survey of these morphological features at nanoscales for neurons whose receptors have been identified and whose odor response profiles have been characterized.</p><p>The majority of antennal sensilla house multiple ORNs. Each neuron is assigned a designation indicating the host sensillum and its relative extracellular spike amplitude among grouped neurons. Typically two and up to four ORNs are compartmentalized in a sensillum in stereotyped combinations—whereby a neuron expressing a particular receptor is always paired with a neighboring neuron that expresses another specific receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>). For example, the Or59b receptor is expressed in the ab2A neuron, which is located in the <underline>a</underline>ntennal <underline>b</underline>asiconic sensillum of type <underline>2</underline>, while the ‘A’ indicates that its spike amplitude is greater than that of the neighboring ab2B neuron, which invariably expresses the Or85a receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, deleting or substituting the tuning receptor for an ORN does not alter its characteristic spike amplitude (Dobritsa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that spike amplitude is a feature independent of receptor identity. The genetically predetermined pairing of neurons implies functional significance for this arrangement.</p><p>Indeed, ORNs housed in the same sensillum can inhibit each other by means of direct electrical interaction, termed ephaptic coupling, which can also modulate fruitfly behavior in response to odor mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Su et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Strikingly, in most sensillum types, lateral inhibition is asymmetric between compartmentalized ORNs: the large-spike neuron is not only capable of exerting greater ephaptic influence but is also less susceptible to ephaptic inhibition by its small-spike neighbors. Mechanistically, this functional disparity arises from the size difference between grouped neurons. The large-spike ORN has a larger soma than its small-spike neighbor(s); this feature is translated into a smaller input resistance for the ‘A’ neuron, thus accounting for its dominance in ephaptic interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). These findings indicate a causal relationship between an ORN’s morphometric features and its circuit function. Taken together, these observations highlight the necessity and value of a systematic morphometric survey of genetically identified ORNs.</p><p>Pioneering transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted (i.e., cryofixed) antennal tissues have provided a high-quality morphological atlas of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>). However, for morphometric analysis, the utility of this atlas is limited because the 3D structure and molecular identity of ORNs are undefined. Taking advantage of the CryoChem method, which we have previously developed to permit high-quality ultrastructural preservation of cryofixed and genetically labeled samples for volume EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsang et al., 2018</xref>), we have acquired serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) images of antennal tissues in which select ORNs expressed a membrane-tethered EM marker (APEX2-mCD8GFP or APEX2-ORCO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In a previous study, we focused our analysis on the soma of labeled ORNs and their co-compartmentalized neuronal partners in five sensillum types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, in addition to the APEX2-labeled hairs, each SBEM data set contains many other sensilla, whose identity can be determined by cross-referencing the sensillum morphology and the number of its compartmentalized ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grabe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Potter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>). For example, among the three large basiconic sensillum types, ab1 can be identified without genetic labeling because the sensillum houses four neurons, whereas ab2 and ab3 both house two ORNs. Moreover, within a known sensillum, the ‘A’ or ‘B’ ORN can be distinguished according to the soma size. That is, the spike amplitude ratio between grouped neurons reflects their soma size differential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the cellular identities of ORNs can be determined for many unlabeled neurons in our SBEM data sets (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref> for details).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Morphometric information on identified olfactory sensilla of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</title><p>Values are means ± s.e.m.

By segmenting SBEM images, we reconstruct 3D structures for neurons housed in 13 of the 19 genetically defined antennal sensillum types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Potter, 2015</xref>), covering all four morphological classes: the basiconic (ab1–5), coeloconic (ac1–4), intermediate (ai2 and ai3), and trichoid sensilla (at1 and at4) from a total of 158 reconstructed 3D sensillum models. Furthermore, based on 122 reconstructed 3D ORN models, we perform morphometric analysis for 33 of the 40 identified antennal ORN types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Task and Lin, 2021</xref>), as well as for 4 novel neuronal types. Our high-resolution survey uncovers multiple novel features, including extracellular vacuoles in the sensillum lumen, mitochondria-enriched inner dendritic enlargement, empty sensilla which house no ORNs, and two hitherto uncharacterized basiconic sensillum types. We also show that the outer dendritic branching pattern is much more intricate than previously appreciated.

Among the whole sensilla which were sampled in their entirety, we identified 37 basiconic, 30 coeloconic, 40 intermediate, and 51 trichoid sensilla based on their distinctive morphological features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>). Briefly, the cuticle of basiconic, intermediate, and trichoid sensilla is decorated with numerous pores which serve as passages for odorants. The pores of basiconic sensilla are arranged in characteristic arrays, whereas those of trichoid and intermediate sensilla appear to scatter irregularly on the cuticular surface. The trichoid and intermediate sensilla are further recognized by their cylindrical, thickened bases, termed the ‘basal drum’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, the cuticle of the coeloconic sensilla does not contain any pores but instead consists of multiple cuticular fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), between which numerous spoke channels allow odorants access to ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Different sensillum classes and their distribution across SBEM data sets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SBEM data sets analyzed in this study, named according to the genetically labeled ORNs (lower left corner, the receptor, and ORN identity are indicated).

Within a morphological class, sensillum identity was determined by the number of enclosed neurons and by genetic labeling when this information was available. Of note, the distribution of individual sensillum types on the antenna follows a characteristic topographical pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Bruyne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grabe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, for an unlabeled sensillum, its proximity to the labeled sensillum type may further aid its identification (see Large basiconic sensillum section below). For basiconic sensilla, we identified all three large basiconic sensilla (ab1, ab2, and ab3), one thin basiconic (ab4), and one small basiconic sensillum (ab5). Unexpectedly, we also found two novel types of basiconic sensilla: one large basiconic housing three neurons, which we termed abx(3), and the other, a small basiconic housing only one neuron, which we termed abx(1). For the other three morphological sensillum classes, all of the reported subtypes were identified, including four coeloconic, two intermediate, and three trichoid sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We further measured the length, surface area, cuticular, and lumen volumes of these identified sensilla (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The coeloconic sensilla are the shortest (5–8 μm), followed by the ab5 small basiconic (8–10 μm). The intermediate, thin, and large basiconic sensilla are of similar length (10–14 μm), while the trichoid sensilla are the longest (19–24 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Situated entirely beneath the antennal surface, the inner dendritic segment is ensheathed by the thecogen cell, which is itself enveloped by the trichogen processes and then further surrounded by the tormogen cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The inner dendrite exhibits a wider diameter (0.75–1.5 μm) than the outer dendrite (~0.3 μm), which extends into the sensillum lumen with a slight taper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or with a markedly flattened distal segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Although the T1 outer dendrite is believed to be typically unbranched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>), we observed that among the four segmented T1 ORNs, one exhibits three branches and another six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

They vary considerably in size (0.2–2.0 μm in diameter) and do not appear to have a regular shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In some cases, the vacuole occupied nearly an entire segment of the lumen, reducing the ORN dendrite to the margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Although their functional significance remains to be determined, the extracellular vacuoles are likely derived from the tormogen auxiliary cell. In one T1 sensillum, we found that its tormogen cell extended a bulbous protrusion into the lumen, resembling the process of membrane budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Immediately adjacent to the bulbous protrusion was a small vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The close proximity between these two structures suggests that the free vacuoles within the lumen may have originated from the tormogen cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>T2 and T3 sensilla</title><p>In addition to T1, we identified the other two trichoid sensillum types—T2 and T3—containing two and three neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All trichoid sensilla are similar in length (19–24 μm), but T1 is distinctively narrower than T2 or T3 with smaller sensillum surface area and volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, T2 and T3 cannot be distinguished externally from their morphological or morphometric features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). On the basis of recent molecular and functional studies, T3 likely corresponds to the at4 sensillum, which houses three pheromone-sensing neurons: the Or47b (at4A), Or65a (at4B), and Or88a ORNs (at4C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</xref>). However, the molecular identity for T2 neurons remains hitherto unknown.

In comparison, the at4C/Or88a soma is smaller, averaging 35 μm<sup>3</sup> in T2 and 44 μm<sup>3</sup> in T3. Although the Or65a ORN was previously designated as at4B without clear evidence for its intermediate spike amplitude, its soma is in fact the smallest among the three at4 ORNs, averaging only 26 μm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). As with soma size, the average inner and outer dendritic volumes are both greatest for at4A/Or47b neurons, followed by at4C/Or88a, and then at4B/Or65a ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). However, compared to soma size, a greater variability was observed for dendritic volumes. For example, in one T3 sensillum, the at4B/Or65a outer dendrite was larger than that of the neighboring at4C/Or88a neuron; in other instances, the at4C/Or88a dendritic volume was greater than that of at4A/Or47b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Similar to the T1 neurons, the inner dendritic segments of T2 or T3 ORNs are insulated from one another by thecogen processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A-3 and 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B-3 and 4</xref>). The outer dendrites of some T2 and T3 ORNs also exhibit a small number of branches: among 12 pairs of segmented neurons, three Or47b ORNs display two or three dendritic branches, and five Or88a neurons have two to four branches. In comparison, only one of the eight segmented Or65a ORNs exhibit branched outer dendrites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table2sdata1">Table 2—source data 1</xref> for details). Also similar to T1 neurons, the outer dendritic morphology of T2 and T3 neurons are typically cylindrical with a gradual taper toward the tip, while some neurons have portions of their outer dendritic segments flattened like a rippled ribbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Notably, we observed ring-shaped outer dendritic profiles in the cross-section images of some unbranched Or47b ORNs; 3D reconstruction reveals that these profiles correspond to dendritic regions with a hollow center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). In one neuron, the hollowed region was short, observed in the mid-section of the outer dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In another neuron, the hollowed section was considerably longer, exceeding 1/3 of the outer dendritic length, and was found in the distal segment of the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Their variable position and length suggest that this dendritic structure is dynamic, possibly reflecting the process of dendritic branching. Finally, as with T1 sensilla, we observed extracellular vacuoles in the proximal regions of the sensillum lumen in 27% of the analyzed T2 sensilla and in 29% of T3 sensilla (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref> for details).</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-69896-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>3D models of T2 and T3 olfactory receptor neurons.</title><p>Color codes are as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p></caption></media></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Coeloconic sensilla</title><p>Conical in shape, the coeloconic sensilla are the shortest antennal sensilla, ranging from 4.8 to 7.6 μm long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

While the Or35a receptor is common to the B neurons in both types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yao et al., 2005</xref>), the ac3IA neuron expresses the Ir75b receptor, whereas ac3IIA expresses Ir75c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we focused our analysis on the ac3II neurons identified from the Ir75c-labeled data set. The ac3II sensilla share similar external morphometric features as other coeloconic sensilla.

Compared to the ac3 sensillum, ac1’s cuticular fingers have a sharper edge, giving rise to its star-shaped cross-section profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The somatic volume of ac1A is nearly twice as large (~23 μm<sup>3</sup>) as ac1B (~12 μm<sup>3</sup>), which is in turn larger than ac1C (~10 μm<sup>3</sup>) and ac1D (~8 μm<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Auxiliary cells support olfactory function by insulating ORN soma and inner dendrites, maintaining transepithelial potential, expressing ion transporters, and secreting odorant-binding proteins and odorant degrading enzymes into the sensillum lymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaissling, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Larter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Menuz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shanbhag et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). We note that the ultrastructure of these cells has been described in detail through high-quality TEM images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, our objective was to illustrate their positions in 3D space in relation to other auxiliary cells, their associated ORNs, and the sensillum apparatus. Most olfactory sensilla contain three auxiliary cells, except for the coeloconic class which has four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>). In the following sections, we featured the auxiliary cells for ab4 and ac3 to represent these two possible cellular arrangements.</p><sec id="s2-14-1"><title>Auxiliary trio</title><p>The three auxiliary cell types are the thecogen, trichogen, and tormogen cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>). Among them, the thecogen is situated most deeply beneath the antennal surface, and forms a sleeve enveloping parts of the ORN soma, inner dendrite, and proximal portion of the outer dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). The plasma membrane of thecogen cell is typically smooth but can form microvilli or microlamellae in regions where the auxiliary cell ensheathes the inner dendrites (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B-4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A-1</xref>). The nucleus of the auxiliary cell is at a similar level as the ORN soma such that thecogen cells are often found adjacent to the cell body of neurons (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A-9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A-5 and B-5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The three auxiliary cells for a basiconic sensillum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D model and SBEM images of a representative ab4 sensillum, highlighting its three auxiliary cells.

The apical surface of the trichogen cell forms extensive, elaborate microvilli and microlamellae that border the sensillum-lymph cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B and D</xref>). Also characteristic of the thecogen cell are its abundant mitochondria and numerous tubular membrane invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B and D</xref>). The nucleus of the trichogen cell is located slightly distal to that of the thecogen cell at the level of proximal inner dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>).</p><p>Moving toward the antennal surface, a small portion of the apical thecogen cell is further enveloped by the tormogen cell, which occupies the most distal and peripheral position of the auxiliary trio. Similar to the trichogen cell, the apical surface of the tormogen cell forms microvilli and microlamellae bordering the sensillum lymph cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B and E</xref>). However, the tormogen processes are less numerous and elaborate. In turn, these processes surround the subcuticular segment of outer dendrites and terminate more distally near the sensillum base or occasionally into the sensillum lumen (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Moreover, in lieu of tubular invaginations, the tormogen cell displays an abundance of large, interconnected vesicles which open into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). The tormogen nucleus is situated at the level of dendritic ciliary constriction. The basal region of the tormogen cell is distinctive in that it extends a long, stalk-like protrusion that terminates below the level of ORN soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-14-2"><title>Auxiliary quartet</title><p>Focusing on ac3, we segmented its four auxiliary cells, which have been reported to include one thecogen, one trichogen, and two tormogen cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>). Similar to the cellular arrangement described above, the coeloconic thecogen is the innermost cell located at the bottom of the quartet, ensheathing parts of ORN soma, inner dendrite, and the proximal portion of outer dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). The apical thecogen region is likewise enveloped by trichogen processes, whose elaborate microvilli and microlamellae surround the proximal outer dendrites. Compared to the basiconic trichogen cell, the invaginations of coeloconic trichogen appear less tubular but are rather vesicle-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). In addition, the coeloconic trichogen nucleus is located more distally, at or above the level of ciliary constriction. Interestingly, we identified two trichogen cells instead of one based on their similar morphological features, including elaborate microlamellae, the position of their apical surface, and the lack of tormogen’s stalk-like protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B,D</xref>). This observation indicates that the coeloconic auxiliary quartet is in fact composed of one thecogen, one tormogen, and two trichogen cells. Finally, the coeloconic tormogen cell bears a strong resemblance to its basiconic counterpart. Both surround the subcuticular portion of outer dendrites with their apical processes, terminate their processes near the sensillum base, and extend a long, stalk-like basal protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). In future research, it will be interesting to determine whether the two coeloconic trichogen cells are functionally distinct, and how the morphological characteristics of individual auxiliary cells subserve function.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>The four auxiliary cells for a coeloconic sensillum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D model and SBEM images of a representative ac3 sensillum, highlighting its four auxiliary cells.

In addition to providing nanoscale measurements of 33 identified ORN types and their corresponding sensillum apparatus, our analysis reveals several novel features of olfactory sensilla, including extracellular vacuoles, empty sensilla, and two previously uncharacterized basiconic sensillum types. Additionally, we find that not all at4 sensilla house three neurons; a subset contains only two ORNs. For most ORN types, neurons expressing the same receptor can display marked variability in their dendritic branching and morphology, suggesting that these features are not entirely genetically predetermined but are instead dynamically regulated. Moreover, contrary to the previously proposed paintbrush model, the basiconic outer dendrites exhibit a highly intricate branching pattern: diverging points are numerous, and branches can bifurcate or converge with others. Within basiconic sensilla, the large-spike ORNs selectively exhibit enlarged inner dendrites which are enriched with mitochondria. Furthermore, a remarkable morphological disparity is observed between compartmentalized ab2 neurons; the large-spike ‘A’ neuron sprouts more than 300 dendritic branches occupying nearly the entire sensillum lumen, whereas the neighboring ‘B’ neuron has only one unbranched outer dendrite.</p><p>These observations raise many interesting questions. For example, what is the functional significance of the extracellular vacuoles commonly found in the basiconic lumen? Does the mitochondria-enriched inner dendritic enlargement influence olfactory response properties? What molecules regulate the diverse outer dendritic morphology? Does the surface area disparity between neighboring neurons (e.g., ab2A vs. ab2B) or between neuronal types (e.g., ab2A vs. ac3A) contribute to differences in olfactory sensitivity? What are the molecular identities for neurons housed in the two novel basiconic sensilla? Do the empty sensilla represent snapshots of neuronal turnover and adult neurogenesis? Why are the coeloconic neurons supported by not one but two trichogen cells? In addition to raising new questions, the rich morphological and morphometric information provided here lays the foundation for future biophysical studies and computational modeling to determine the impact of neuronal size and shape on sensory responses, as well as on ephaptic coupling between compartmentalized neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>SBEM data sets</title><p>The SBEM data sets were generated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), except for the Or7a-labeled data set. Briefly, 6–8-day-old females were cold anesthetized and their antennae removed. Following isolation of the third antennal segment, the sample was subjected to high-pressure freezing, freeze-substitution, rehydration, DAB labeling, en bloc heavy metal staining, dehydration, and resin infiltration. The flies expressed membrane-tethered APEX2 (<italic>10xUAS-myc-APEX2-Orco</italic> or <italic>10xUAS-mCD8GFP-APEX2</italic>) in select ORNs under the control of specific <italic>OrX-</italic> or <italic>Ir-X GAL4</italic> drivers as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).

The ‘drawing tools’ function was used to trace and outline the structure of interest through serial sections of SBEM images.

Further information on ‘imodmesh’ and meshing parameters can be found in the IMOD User’s Guide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/man/imodmesh.html">https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/man/imodmesh.html</ext-link>). The cell body, inner dendrite, and individual outer dendritic branches were segmented as independent objects to allow for further morphometric analysis of these different cellular regions. In cases where the same structure occupied separate areas on a single SBEM section (e.g., looping or bending of a dendrite), the different parts of the same structure were segmented as different objects to allow their respective centroids to be extracted separately, thus ensuring accurate length measurement (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Morphometric analysis</title><p>The sensillum cuticle, ORN soma, inner, and outer dendritic segments were analyzed as separate objects.

The ‘imodinfo’ function was used to extract morphometric data from surface models. We applied the ‘-c’ option in the line command to determine volume and surface area for each region.

The AutoSkeleton module was used to skeletonize the binary image volume. These skeletons, in swc format, were imported into neuTube software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neutracing.com/">https://www.neutracing.com/</ext-link>) to allow branches to be manually spread out onto a 2D plane.

This process was repeated for secondary, tertiary, and higher-order branches until overlap between branches was minimized.</p><p>The positions of ciliary constrictions and sensillum bases on the skeletons were determined by superimposing the spread-out skeletons on the original 3D model contours in swc format. First, the original contour skeleton was obtained by (1) extracting the coordinates of the points in the contours with the IMOD command ‘model2point’; (2) converting the file to the csv format; (3) importing the csv file into R, and (4) connecting the points of each contour. Subsequently, the spread-out skeleton was imported into R and superimposed with the contour skeleton using the R package NeuroAnatomy Toolbox (Gregory S X E Jefferis and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jefferis and Manton, 2017</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://natverse.org/nat/">https://natverse.org/nat/</ext-link>). The combined skeleton and contours were exported in the swc format to be processed in neuTube where the ciliary constrictions and sensillum bases were manually annotated.

the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The editors and reviewers were impressed by the breath and depth of the work, which will serve as the basis for future studies on the function, development and evolution of sensory sensilla of the fruit fly's antennae. We were very pleased that your data set was deposited into a public repository (Cell Image Library), which is key to elevate your findings to the status of a reference in the field, enabling others to build on your work in the best scientific tradition.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Systematic morphological and morphometric analysis of identified olfactory receptor neurons in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jürgen Rybak (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please clarify and detail how the identification of each sensilla was done. Please also be careful to avoid circular arguments regarding the identification of a sensillum and the use of that very set of characteristics for identification also for the comparative analysis across sensilla.</p><p>2) Please clarify how the data will be publicized and distributed. This data set is exceptional and enables further either follow up studies or orthogonal studies on a variety of aspects of sensilla morphology and its relationship to function.</p><p>3) Please attempt to address the detailed comments listed by the reviewers, as these capture a number of small issues whose resolution will only strengthen and clarify your beautiful findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Generally, given the descriptive nature of the manuscript, it would be good to include when possible graphs showing correlations between the identified morphological features and published functional data. I think this could add to the interpretation of their findings and give further insights.</p><p>I find the discussion could be improved by adding ideas on the possible functional implications of some of their key findings. For example, for the role of mitochondria and membranous protrusions.</p><p>Do the authors think that the basal vacuoles in trichoid sensilla are the same type as those distal in large basiconic sensilla? A discussion on these in the Discussion section would be welcomed.</p><p>The description of the auxiliary cells is a bit dry and for those with little knowledge on the presumed or demonstrated function of auxiliary cells difficult to interpret. I would recommend adding a bit of background on auxiliary cells and discuss the possible implications of their findings in the discussion.</p><p>Finally, as mentioned above, I would like to insist that given the focus of the manuscript, it is key that the authors provide a better description for the ways in which sensilla were identified, and discuss any drawbacks of their approach. This would include the suggested schematics in Figure 1 showing from which region in the antenna the datasets were collected. Furthermore, I think it is important to include in the figure legends and/or methods information on the dataset of origin for each of the sensilla used for their analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General comments to text and figures</p><p>– The extensive dataset potentially allows to study in more detail the ultrastructure and other cellular features of the ORNs, and its support cells. Therefore, it would be very valuable to make available the full SBEM datasets for the neuroscience community in an open repository, e.g.(https://github.com/). Suggestions on implementation software (e.g. https://github.com/catmaid/CATMAID) would be very helpful.</p><p>– Provide a more comprehensive table with respect to your identified sensilla/ORN types.</p><p>– How large is the variability of location of (identified sensilla) on the antenna?</p><p>– Throughout the text, please give always the number, (n=), consistently for the number of ORN/sensilla to avoid cross-reading. For the non-specialized reader parts of your results are had to follow.</p><p>– Is ciliary constriction a generic feature in all sensilla?</p><p>– The thecogen cell, which is itself enveloped by the trichogen processes and then further surrounded by the tormogen cell. Please, provide a proper introduction, and discussion on these cell types. Does your study provide more insight into their function see, also, Larter, N. K., et al.,(2016). &quot;Organization and function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> odorant binding proteins.&quot; <italic>eLife</italic> 5: e20242.</p><p>– The inner dendrite of a atypical neuron ac1 contained 24 mitochondria. Is this a single observation found in one neuron? You described mito-enriched inner dendrites in other ORN types: are there structural correlations to other parts of the dendrite or might is simply a plasticity based change?</p><p>Please, give a summary statement of the outcome of your statistical analysis: how much variability, how much generic, features do you find for the different ORN classes. Is soma size correlated with the dendritic branching in the outer dendrite?</p><p>– Abstract</p><p>– state the number of sensilla studied here</p><p>Introduction</p><p>– introduce the cell types thecogen, tormogen trichogen, use citations, what are the possible roles of these supporting cells?</p><p>– 1st para dendritic branching pattern? are these known from one of the authors cited above?</p><p>– there is evidence that centrifugal cells might modulates ORN response properties. Did you find morphological correlates of electrical or chemical synapses in your dataset? For example, the antenna is innervated by a large centrifugal aminergic neuron in other insect species (Schroter et al., 2007). Wang, J. W. (2012). Presynaptic modulation of early olfactory processing 10.1002/dneu.20936 Jung, J. W., Kim, (2013). Neuromodulation of Olfactory …..the American Cockroach, Periplaneta americana.</p><p>– page 4: 33 ORN types out of how many types of sensilla?</p><p>– page 4, 541 sensilla how many for each sensilla type out of 541 sensilla? Are these sampled from one female <italic>Drosophila</italic> antenna, or did you use several specimen. In Keesey (2019) the total number of sensilla are reported as to app. 400?</p><p>– page 4/5- characteristic topographical distribution: please refer in the text to Figure 1a and specify, in detail of how you determined the relative position of the sensillum of interest. see also my comments for Figure 1.</p><p>– sensillum identity? Criteria for the identification of non-genetically labeled and identified sensilla should be explained in more detail.</p><p>page 6 but some terminate before reaching the endpoint (Figure 2A), what is the diameter of the dendrite? do you mean branch, branch versus dendrite!!</p><p>page 6: provide larger image of the vacuoles., what lumen is inner or outer dendrite.</p><p>page 7: the info on T2 is insufficient ….</p><p>page 9: dendrite is unbranched?</p><p>Method</p><p>– Explain technical terms, and the technical workflow, so that the non-specialized reader can follow.</p><p>– More details on SBEM methodology, how is the quality of DAB labelling – is the DAB staining cytoplasmic, or membrane-bound – what resolution you used for sectioning?</p><p>– How did you perform the visualization of pores across the sensillum surface, from the EM images, or did you perform a SEM scan beforehand.</p><p>– Is imod an open software – specify the version of Amira.</p><p>– Isosurface is not suited for volume measure, how was the surface model generated and smoothed?</p><p>– Morphometry: how did you created the surface models, explain imodinfo..</p><p>Centroid values are a skeleton tool?</p><p>– Ball-and stick model?</p><p>Results</p><p>In general: for the text on different sensilla types in each sub-chapter, I suggest to always mention the corresponding ORN receptor name (and vice versa), for the convenience and less cross reading. Even though the data are summarized in Table 1 the non-specialized reader is not used to the terminology.</p><p>For example page 12, ab4 sensillum, the two ab4 neuron, ab4A and B should be named, and indicated, as Or7a and Or56a, respectively. Same for the legends.</p><p>– Is there always an positive correlation of soma size with dendritic arborization of the respective ORN?</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Please, discuss and cite the relevant literature related your novel findings in more detail. how the size and shape of sensory neurons influence their responses, sensitivity and circuit function of ORNs?</p><p>– New receptors found, e.g. ABx. Give suggestions of how can these be identified (in situ hybridization?)</p><p>– Some OSNs express more than one receptor. see the work by the Potter lab: Task (2020) Widespread Polymodal Chemosensory Receptor Expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Olfactory Neurons 2020.11.07.355651 for discussion discussed in this context.</p><p>The ORN in ab4b expresses two receptors: Or56a that respond specifically to goesomin and Or33a that no one could identify its ligand yet.</p><p>– How often did you find extracellular vacuoles within the sensilla lumen, in how many sensilla types they occur?</p><p>– Intricate dendritic branching in the outer dendrite ab4A neuron: Figure 8C, and text</p><p>In the 2D projection dendritic arbors seems to be fused, that contradicts neuron dichotomy morphology. Is this a simple crossover, or a dendritic tiling shown, here? as described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva Grueber (2002).:Tiling of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> epidermis Development, 129(12), see Figure 2B, here. Does the dendritic morphology correlates with arrangement or number of pores in the respective sensillum.</p><p>– Empty sensilla containing no neurons, are they described before?</p><p>Could this phenomen due to a cell turnover, or apoptosis? using P-MARCM Fernández-Hernández (2020). Reported a 3% turnover of ORNs.</p><p>Concluding remarks</p><p>Discuss in more detail your question with the literature what is known. Are empty cells reported before? How your data relate to other studies on the antenna.e.g. Keesey (2019) Inverse location https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09087-z, for the distribution of sensilla on the antenna.</p><p>Figures</p><p>– Figure 1A: the distribution on Apex labelled flies (false color?). Did you sample from the anterior / posterior side of the antenna? Please give an orientation, and a relative position of the sampled sensilla, e.g. location of arista, sacculus, and funiculus border (for an nice example, see e.g. Grabe (2016) Figure 1B).</p><p>– 1B: the columns are show the number of identified sensilla, I suggest, to Indicate in Figure 1 A with stars the labelled versus non-labeled sensilla,</p><p>– In Figure 1 you gave an overview of datasets used in the study.

Apart from the Or22a dataset, an ab2 sensillum was identified in the Or7a dataset on the basis of its proximity to the labeled ab4 sensilla, because ab3 is not found in the same topographical region as ab4 (de Bruyne et al., 2001).”</p><p>We have also indicated how each sensillum type was identified in the revised Source Data for Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please clarify how the data will be publicized and distributed.

I think this could add to the interpretation of their findings and give further insights.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We wish to clarify that the odor response profile of an ORN is predominantly determined by the receptor expressed in the neuron (Hallem et al., Cell, 2004), which is independent of whether the neuron is a large- or small-spike ORN. By extension, the odor response profile is independent of the neuron’s morphometric features. It is therefore of limited usefulness to search for any correlation between ORNs’ morphological features and odor response properties.</p><p>However, we have incorporated the reviewer’s suggestion by revising the text to include key ligands for certain ORNs that respond to ethologically salient odors. In addition, we have added the following sentence in the revised Table 2 legend: “The odor response profiles for many of the characterized ORNs can be found in the DoOR database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neuro.uni-konstanz.de/DoOR/default.html">http://neuro.uni-konstanz.de/DoOR/default.html</ext-link>)” such that readers who are curious about the functional data can easily find the information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I find the discussion could be improved by adding ideas on the possible functional implications of some of their key findings. For example, for the role of mitochondria and membranous protrusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. As the reviewer pointed out, our study is descriptive in nature, aiming to provide an extensive morphological and morphometric dataset for identified <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORNs. We hope our findings will stimulate future investigations into the developmental mechanism and functional significance of the rich diversity in ORN size and shape. As such, we prefer to highlight the multitude of intriguing questions, instead of speculating on the answers in our concluding remarks.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that we could provide more information on mitochondria function in olfactory signaling. In the revised Results, we have now included “We note that in vertebrate ORNs, mitochondria play a direct role in regulating cytosolic ca<sup>2+</sup> response profile and thereby ensure a broad dynamic range for the neurons’ spike responses (Fluegge et al., 2012). Although it is unclear whether mitochondria play a similar role in insect olfactory signaling, a recent study shows that odor-induced ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORNs are shaped by mitochondria (Lucke, Kaltofen, Hansson, and Wicher, 2020). Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate the functional significance of this striking mitochondrial disparity between grouped ORNs in future research” under the “Large Basiconic Sensilla” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the authors think that the basal vacuoles in trichoid sensilla are the same type as those distal in large basiconic sensilla? A discussion on these in the Discussion section would be welcomed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the careful reading of our manuscript. In this study, we define vacuoles as extracellular membranous structures found in the sensillum lumen. In this context, we do not distinguish vacuoles found in different sensillum types. We have, however, incorporated the reviewer’s comment by adding this sentence:</p><p>“Future research may be directed to determine whether the location of vacuoles influences their function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The description of the auxiliary cells is a bit dry and for those with little knowledge on the presumed or demonstrated function of auxiliary cells difficult to interpret. I would recommend adding a bit of background on auxiliary cells and discuss the possible implications of their findings in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the excellent suggestion. We have now provided background information on olfactory auxiliary cells in the revised Results, which reads “Auxiliary cells support olfactory function by insulating ORN soma and inner dendrites, maintaining transepithelial potential, expressing ion transporters, and secreting odorant binding proteins and odorant degrading enzymes into the sensillum lymph (Kaissling, 1986; Larter, Sun, and Carlson, 2016; Leal, 2013; Menuz, Larter, Park, and Carlson, 2014; Shanbhag et al., 2001, 2000; Sun, Xiao, Carlson, and Carlson, 2018)”.</p><p>We have also included the sentence “In future research, it will be interesting to determine whether the two coeloconic trichogen cells are functionally distinct, and how the morphological characteristics of individual auxiliary cells subserve function” at the end of the Olfactory Auxiliary Cells section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, as mentioned above, I would like to insist that given the focus of the manuscript, it is key that the authors provide a better description for the ways in which sensilla were identified, and discuss any drawbacks of their approach. This would include the suggested schematics in Figure 1 showing from which region in the antenna the datasets were collected. Furthermore, I think it is important to include in the figure legends and/or methods information on the dataset of origin for each of the sensilla used for their analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestions.

We have indicated that:</p><p>“Indeed, ORNs housed in the same sensillum can inhibit each other by means of direct electrical interaction, termed ephaptic coupling, which can also modulate fruitfly behavior in response to odor mixtures (Su, Menuz, Reisert, and Carlson, 2012; Zhang et al., 2019). Strikingly, in most sensillum types, lateral inhibition is asymmetric between compartmentalized ORNs: the large-spike neuron is not only capable of exerting greater ephaptic influence but is also less susceptible to ephaptic inhibition by its small-spike neighbors. Mechanistically, this functional disparity arises from the size difference between grouped neurons. The large-spike ORN has a larger soma than its small-spike neighbor(s); this feature is translated into a smaller input resistance for the “A” neuron, thus accounting for its dominance in ephaptic interaction (Zhang et al., 2019).”</p><p>Other than influencing the strength of ORN ephaptic coupling, how these morphological and morphometric features contribute to sensory function remains an open question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– New receptors found, e.g. ABx.

To explicitly demonstrate this point, we have now provided the information in the revised Introduction “Interestingly, deleting or substituting the tuning receptor for an ORN does not alter its characteristic spike amplitude (Dobritsa, van der Goes van Naters, Warr, Steinbrecht, and Carlson, 2003; Hallem et al., 2004), suggesting that this feature is independent of the receptor identity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ORN in ab4b expresses two receptors: Or56a that respond specifically to goesomin and Or33a that no one could identify its ligand yet.</p></disp-quote><p>For clarity, we prefer to use only the tuning receptors to indicate ORN identity without mentioning other co-expressed receptors of unknown function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How often did you find extracellular vacuoles within the sensilla lumen, in how many sensilla types they occur?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this question.

No, what was described in Figure 8C was not tilting or crossover, as highlighted in Video 7.</p><p>Our analysis does not extend to the pore arrangement or numbers.

We have already referenced the paper in our original submission, and speculated that empty sensilla may represent a snapshot of ORN turnover. The sentence can be found at the end of the paragraph:</p><p>“While the biological significance of empty sensilla remains to be determined, it is possible that they represent a small fraction of antennal olfactory hairs whose neurons have undergone apoptosis in the process of neuronal turnover (Fernández-Hernández, Hu, and Bonaguidi, 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concluding remarks</p><p>Discuss in more detail your question with the literature what is known.

Each SBEM volume sampled a specific portion of the antenna covering the majority of APEX2-labeled sensilla, making it difficult to precisely determine its relative antenna location. Therefore, we do not feel comfortable drawing direct comparison to other studies regarding the distribution of sensilla on the antenna.</p><p>We did not reference Keesey (2019) because our study concerns only one sensory modality in only one <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. However, we did reference other studies describing the sensillum distribution in an antenna “(de Bruyne, Foster, and Carlson, 2001; Grabe et al., 2016; Shanbhag et al., 1999)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures</p><p>– Figure 1A: the distribution on Apex labelled flies (false color?).

Also: are your samples randomly chosen across the antenna.Is there a distinct pattern of how are sensilla types are distributed across the antenna for certain sensilla types?</p></disp-quote><p>We have indicated the number of sensilla identified in each dataset in Figure 1B. To further address the reviewer’s comment, we have provided the requested information in a new Source Data file for Figure 1.</p><p>We wish to clarify that each dataset sampled a specific portion of the antenna. The imaged region was determined by the labeled sensilla, and is therefore not randomly selected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2 the extracellular vacuole (in teal) is shown in dark blue in 2B (3)? I suggest to use another color for the vacuoles for better understanding of the 3D structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the excellent suggestion. To better distinguish vacuoles from other structures in our figures, we have changed the vacuole color from teal to aubergine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Table 2 (main text): I suggest to provide more details for the identified ORN, to compare with previous datasets, or data repositories (such as DoOR) and to allow for more cross-references found in the literature: – OR co-receptor, – corresponding glomerulus in the antennal lobe, – functional response according to DoOR</p><p>In the DoOR database (http://neuro.uni-konstanz.de/DoOR/default.html ), for example, the ab4 sensillum hosing Or7A receptor (ab4A neuron), and the Or56a co-expressed with Or33Aa. The latter is not listed in your table.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have included ORN glomerulus projection as an additional identifier. The revised legend now includes: “ORN identity is indicated by the sensillum type, relative spike amplitude (A, B, C or D), odor-tuning receptor, and glomerular projection.”</p><p>For clarity, and in consideration of the large information load, we focus on our own morphometric data in Table 2. For the same reasons, we also focus on the tuning receptors as a key ORN identifier without mentioning other co-expressed receptors of unknown function.</p><p>Furthermore, we wish to clarify that the odor response profile of an ORN is predominantly determined by the tuning receptor expressed in the neuron (Hallem et al., Cell, 2004), which is independent of whether the neuron is a large- or small-spike ORN. By extension, the odor response profile is independent of the neuron’s morphometric features. It is therefore of limited usefulness to search for any correlation between ORNs’ morphological features and odor response properties.</p><p>However, we have incorporated the reviewer’s suggestion by revising the text to include key ligands for ORNs that respond to ethologically salient odors. We have also included the following sentence in the revised Table 2 legend “The odor response profiles for many of the characterized ORNs can be found in the DoOR database (http://neuro.uni-konstanz.de/DoOR/default.html)” such that readers who are curious about the functional data can easily find the information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary</p><p>Su_28-04-2021-RA-eLife-69896_Source_Data_File excel Table</p><p>In general: provide an explanation and an list of all abbreviation used in these excel files.
