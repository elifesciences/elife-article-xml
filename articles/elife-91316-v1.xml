injury. Despite the assumption that the injury response is similar among neuronal subtypes, functional recovery may differ. Understanding the distinct intrinsic regenerative properties between neurons may help to improve the quality of regeneration, prioritizing the growth of axon subpopulations to their targets. Here, we present a comparative analysis of regeneration across four key peripheral neuron populations: motoneurons, proprioceptors, cutaneous mechanoreceptors, and nociceptors. Using Cre/Ai9 mice that allow fluorescent labeling of neuronal subtypes, we found that nociceptors showed the greater regeneration after a sciatic crush, followed by motoneurons, mechanoreceptors, and, finally, proprioceptors. By breeding these Cre mice with Ribotag mice, we isolated specific translatomes and defined the regenerative response of these neuronal subtypes after axotomy. Only 20% of the regulated genes were common, revealing a diverse response to injury among neurons, which was also supported by the differential influence of neurotrophins among neuron subtypes. Among differentially regulated genes, we proposed MED12 as a specific regulator of the regeneration of proprioceptors. Altogether, we demonstrate that the intrinsic regenerative capacity differs between peripheral neuron subtypes, opening the door to selectively modulate these responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nerve injury</kwd><kwd>axon regeneration</kwd><kwd>sensory neuron</kwd><kwd>motorneuron</kwd><kwd>RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>specific regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2017-84464-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Udina</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FPU17/03657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bolívar</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010198</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital, Gobierno de España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2021-127626OB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Udina</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In reporter mice, subtypes of peripheral neurons show different regenerative capabilities after nerve injury and activate common pathways but also specific ones, indicating a different intrinsic growth response among them.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peripheral nerve injuries result in the loss of motor, sensory, and autonomic function of denervated targets. Although peripheral neurons can regenerate after injury, most nerve lesions result in an incomplete functional recovery. Strategies to promote regeneration often do not take into account the heterogeneity of peripheral neurons. Motor and sensory neurons are very different in terms of function, molecular identity, and their response to injury. Moreover, peripheral sensory neurons have a wide range of functions and target organs, and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses have distinguished up to 11 subtypes in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>). Whereas the majority of DRG sensory neurons are cutaneous afferents, some innervate muscle (mainly proprioceptors) or other organs. Since neuron subtypes differentially respond to environmental cues and might activate distinct intrinsic regenerative programs, there is a need to investigate the regenerative response of specific neuron subtypes after a nerve injury.</p><p>Attempts to study variations in axon regeneration among subtypes of peripheral neurons have yielded some contradictory results. The finding that sensory neurons regenerate faster than motoneurons has robust evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dolenc and Janko, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Madorsky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suzuki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Negredo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brushart et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, unmyelinated fibers have been described to recover their function earlier than myelinated fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Navarro et al., 1994</xref>). In contrast, alternative work suggests that myelinated fibers regenerate at the same speed as unmyelinated fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lozeron et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moldovan et al., 2006</xref>) or even that motoneurons regenerate better than sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">da Silva et al., 1985</xref>). Given that sensory neurons comprise both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, it is important to clarify the distinctions involving regeneration of different neuron subtypes.</p><p>After axotomy, peripheral neurons activate several signaling mechanisms such as the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sheu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Obata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agthong et al., 2006</xref>), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kimpinski and Mearow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murashov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edström and Ekström, 2003</xref>), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kenney and Kocsis, 1998</xref>), or the cAMP/protein kinase A/cAMP responsive element binding protein pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chierzi et al., 2005</xref>). All these signaling pathways activate regeneration-associated genes, including <italic>Gap43</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van der Zee et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kawasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mason et al., 2022</xref>). This process enables neurons to switch to a pro-regenerative state in which axon regrowth is permitted. However, as neuron subtypes are thought to regenerate at different rates, the transcriptional regeneration mechanism activated by these neurons might be expected to differ. In fact, some regeneration-associated pathways have been shown to have specific relevance in neuron subtypes. For instance, medium-to-large DRG neurons show an increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase compared to small DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Obata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Obata et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway may have a different role in motor and sensory regeneration given evidence that its inhibition enhances motor but not sensory axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>). Understanding the intrinsic regenerative differences between neuron subtypes may allow fine-tuning of the specific regeneration of neuron subtypes, prioritizing the growth or guidance of specific subpopulations toward their target organs. Overall, neuron regeneration involves several levels of complexity driven by a large ensemble of molecules that may be challenging to differentiate among subtypes.</p><p>To address these challenges, we used two lines of genetically engineered mice that allowed interrogation of regenerative properties among peripheral neuron subtypes. First, we described the regeneration of specific neurons after injury using TdTomato Cre reporter mice (Ai9). Breeding these to mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of specific promoters allowed us to study axonal regeneration in motoneurons (choline acetyltransferase, <italic>Chat</italic>), proprioceptors (parvalbumin, <italic>Pvalb</italic>), cutaneous mechanoreceptors (neuropeptide Y receptor Y2, <italic>Npy2r</italic>), and nociceptors (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, <italic>Trpv1</italic>). We found significant differences in axonal regeneration of these neurons that suggested distinct intrinsic regenerative mechanisms. Second, we explored the neuron-specific gene expression of these neurons after a sciatic nerve injury in vivo. Cre-driver animals were crossed to Ribotag mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanz et al., 2009</xref>), which express a modified ribosomal protein L22 (Rpl22) in a Cre-dependent manner. Through immunoprecipitation assays, ribosomes and the associated mRNA from specific cell populations can be isolated and sequenced. Using this approach, we were able to describe the gene expression patterns of motoneurons, proprioceptors, mechanoreceptors, and nociceptors after a nerve injury. Amidst this approach and data, we explored the role of one of the differentially expressed transcripts, mediator complex subunit 12 (<italic>Med12</italic>), a unique and unexplored protein, as a specific regulator of the regeneration of proprioceptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Axon regeneration in motor and sensory neurons has different rates and patterns</title><p>A comparative study of regeneration in peripheral neuron subtypes is complex and requires specific markers to label neuron populations. We took advantage of genetic labeling to comparatively study four key peripheral populations. In our previous report, we characterized and validated ChAT-Cre/Ai9, PV-Cre/Ai9, and Npy2r-Cre/Ai9 mice for the study of motoneurons, proprioceptors, and cutaneous mechanoreceptors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolívar and Udina, 2022</xref>). Here, we added TRPV1-Cre/Ai9 mice for the study of nociceptors, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Patil et al., 2018</xref>). We corroborated that the labeled neurons in the DRG were mostly peptidergic (42.8 ± 1.2% co-labeling with CGRP) and non-peptidergic (30.1 ± 1.4% IB4-reactive) small-diameter neurons. Additionally, fluorescent axons were found in the skin as free endings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The regeneration in these populations was established by crushing the sciatic nerve and counting the number of axons that had regenerated 7 and 9 days after the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In control nerves, we found that nociceptors and mechanoreceptors were the populations with the most abundant axons, followed by proprioceptors and motoneurons. As the number of axons differ between populations in control conditions, we evaluated both the total number of regenerated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the relative regeneration compared to each control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Seven days after the injury, the number of regenerated axons of the different subpopulation did not reach control values when assessed at a distance of 17 mm from injury site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, motoneurons and nociceptors achieved axon regrowth similar to controls at 12 mm from the injury site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, p&gt;0.05 vs their control). In contrast, by 9 days after crush, we found that all axon populations had regenerated to numbers comparable to uninjured controls at 12 mm, and only motoneuron and nociceptor axons reached control values at 17 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, p&gt;0.05 vs their control). Therefore, motoneurons and nociceptors were the populations that recovered their number of axons earlier. Despite this similarity, the pattern of regeneration differed between these populations. Motoneurons regrew significantly more axons at 12 mm 9 days after the injury than in control conditions (p=0.038), probably due to the collateral branching at the regenerative front, whereas nociceptors displayed an increase in axon number reaching a plateau at control levels. Since none of the populations reached control values at 17 mm and 7 days postinjury (dpi), we considered it the most discriminating evaluation point. At this time and distance, the relative number of regenerated motor axons was significantly lower than that of nociceptors (p=0.012), indicating that nociceptors were the population with a greater axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although non-significant, mechanoreceptors showed a tendency to regenerate proportionately more than proprioceptors, at both times and distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This pattern was maintained in DRG explants in vitro, where nociceptors extended significantly longer neurites than other sensory neurons and proprioceptors were the population with shorter neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Altogether, these results indicated that nociceptors had the greater regeneration, followed by motoneurons and, finally, cutaneous mechanoreceptors and proprioceptors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Regeneration rate of peripheral neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the transgenic mice and experimental design used in this study.

The caveat in these analyses is that many genes can be involved in multiple biological pathways and these databases might not entirely reflect the complete functional diversity of proteins. However, they provide a first approach for the interpretation of complex biological data. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed significantly enriched terms associated with regeneration in all neuronal populations following injury, including cell projection organization, axon guidance, and Ras protein signal transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that all neurons activate common pathways such as focal adhesion, MAPK, and cAMP signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Muscle neurons (motoneurons and proprioceptors) significantly regulated the ErbB and VEGF signaling pathways, which are potentially relevant for regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Importantly, GO analysis revealed a specific enrichment of the semaphorin-plexin pathway in these two neuron subtypes, a crucial pathway in neuron guidance during development and regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Therefore, we aimed to corroborate the differential effect of NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 (which bind TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, respectively) in our three sensory neuron populations. First, we examined neurite extension in the DRG by labeling neurites with a pan-neuronal marker, PGP9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that 10 ng/mL NGF produced the larger increase in neurite length, being the mean longest neurite of 927.5±85.0 µm (p&lt;0.0001 vs control 441.7±32.0 µm). We also observed a significant increase in neurite length with 10 ng/mL BDNF (771.1±54.8 µm, p&lt;0.0001) and 10 ng/mL NT-3 (64.0±48.6 µm, p=0.044).</p><p>Next, we evaluated if these neurotrophic factors had a differential effect in distinct neuronal subtypes.

For cutaneous mechanoreceptors, we did not find a significant increase in neurite outgrowth with any of the neurotrophic factors used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, NGF showed a tendency to increase the longest neurite in this population (p=0.052). Contrarily, both NGF and BDNF significantly increased the neurite length of nociceptors (973.5±63.8 µm, p&lt;0.0001 for NGF; 780.1±54.4 µm, p=0.002 for BDNF, both vs control 479.2±45.2 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The values of neurite length were normalized to their control groups for each neuron population and expressed as a fold-change to allow the direct comparison between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, we found that cutaneous mechanoreceptors and nociceptors had a similar pattern, which was clearly different from proprioceptors. The most specific growth factor for cutaneous neurons was NGF, which increased neurite length 1.69-fold in mechanoreceptors and 2.03-fold in nociceptors. In both cases, this increase was significantly higher than in proprioceptors, which showed a 0.45-fold change (p=0.007 vs mechanoreceptors; p&lt;0.0001 vs nociceptors). In contrast, the most specific factor for muscle sensory neurons was NT-3. Proprioceptors showed a 2.32-fold increase in neurite length in opposition to mechanoreceptors (0.8-fold change, p=0.002) and nociceptors (1.13-fold change, p&lt;0.0001).

Here, we show that, after axotomy, there is a specific response to injury that strongly varies between neuron types. We found differences in the regeneration ability of neuron subtypes after nerve injury, which were associated with an activation of distinct gene expression patterns. Previous studies have analyzed the transcriptome of peripheral neurons or the whole DRG after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lemaitre et al., 2020</xref>), but our results highlight the importance of the study of regeneration in specific neuron subtypes to improve specific regeneration after nerve injury.</p><p>In our crush study, we found that nociceptors were the peripheral population with greater axon growth. Unmyelinated fibers have been described to recover their function earlier than myelinated fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Navarro et al., 1994</xref>). As our population of nociceptors includes mostly unmyelinated fibers, a faster regeneration rate of these fibers could explain the advantage of these neurons over other populations. Similarly, the regeneration rate of sensory neurons has been reported to be faster than that of motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dolenc and Janko, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Madorsky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suzuki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Negredo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brushart et al., 2020</xref>). Most of these studies, however, use functional assessments to determine the speed of regeneration, which can be influenced by the reinnervation capacity of the different fibers. Motoneurons also showed heightened growth since their axons reached control values at the same time as nociceptors. This is in accordance with previous reports stating that myelinated sensory fibers can regenerate at the same speed as unmyelinated fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lozeron et al., 2004</xref>). However, this population had a regeneration pattern distinct from the other neurons. At 12 mm, we found a significantly higher number of axons than in the control group which could be explained by the presence of regenerative collaterals. In fact, we have previously described that motoneurons extend more regenerative collaterals than proprioceptors, confirmed by the current work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolívar and Udina, 2022</xref>). Cutaneous mechanoreceptors reached values of axon regrowth comparable to controls later than nociceptors and motoneurons. This finding differs from a previous work identifying that this population regenerates better than motoneurons after a femoral transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolívar and Udina, 2022</xref>). However, the approach and the territory used to assess regeneration differed, previously using retrotracers to evaluate numbers of regenerating femoral neurons, compared to direct counts of sciatic regenerating axons here. Since our cutaneous mechanoreceptors include myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, a more variable regeneration rate can be expected in these animals. We speculate that unmyelinated Npy2r<sup>+</sup> fibers may regenerate faster than motoneurons, but this might be masked by the motor regenerative collaterals and the heterogeneity in Npy2r<sup>+</sup> neurons. Finally, proprioceptors showed more limited regeneration. After the crush injury, this population exhibited a relatively lower proportion of axons compared to the other populations, both in terms of time and distance, which is in agreement with our previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolívar and Udina, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Altogether these results indicate that sensory regeneration is inversely proportional to the fiber size: large, myelinated neurons regenerate less robustly than smaller and less myelinated neurons. Previous authors described this phenomenon by using cuff electrodes after a crush in the tibial nerve of cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krarup et al., 1989</xref>) or with retrograde tracers after transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Negredo et al., 2004</xref>). As for motoneurons, our results suggest that, despite their large fiber size, their regeneration exceeds large-size DRG neurons but not small-size sensory neurons.</p><p>Axotomy initiates a massive response in neurons which involves several signaling pathways and the upregulation of RAGs. In our RNA-sequencing analysis, we saw a common upregulation of 515 transcripts and a downregulation of 300 transcripts across all studied populations. Among these, we found <italic>Gap43, Tubb2a, Sprr1a, Jun, Stat3, Sox11, Atf3, Hspb1, Gfra1</italic>, and <italic>Gal</italic>. All these genes are associated with regeneration after injury and growth cone dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tedeschi, 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, most induced transcripts differed between neuronal populations: 75–80% of DEGs were specifically regulated in a single neuron type or in groups of neurons. These are potential factors explaining the differences in regenerative capacity between neurons subtypes. Based on these results, we studied two strategies to selectively modulate neurite growth in vitro: addition of neurotrophic factors and analysis of the impact of knockdown of a specific DEG, namely <italic>Med12</italic>.</p><p>Peripheral neurons express distinct Trk receptors according to their subtype. Broadly, peptidergic neurons express the NGF receptor TrkA, myelinated Aβ fibers have the BDNF receptor TrkB, and proprioceptors express NT-3 receptor TrkC. These neurotrophins have been described to be involved in the survival and/or neurite extension of peripheral neuron subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DiStefano et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Terenghi, 1999</xref>). For this reason, we aimed to corroborate that different neurotrophic factors would elicit a distinct response in our sensory neuron subpopulations. When neurotrophic factors were analyzed overall, evaluating the growth of all neurites, we found that NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 promoted sensory outgrowth. This is in agreement with previous reports showing an increased axon elongation in explants of rat DRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allodi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Santos et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Santos et al., 2016b</xref>). In contrast, when we evaluated the neurite growth in each population separately, we saw that these factors had unique impacts. The neurite extension of proprioceptors was only promoted by NT-3. Contrarily, neither mechanoreceptors nor nociceptors showed an improved neurite extension when cultured in presence of this factor. NT-3 has been described as a ‘muscle factor’ because of its trophic effect on proprioceptors and motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ernfors et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braun et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Genç et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we confirmed that an overall trophic effect of NT-3 in sensory neurons is largely accounted for by neurite growth from proprioceptors. Nociceptors demonstrated a great increase in neurite length with the presence of NGF and, to a lesser extent, of BDNF. Mechanoreceptors showed a similar response pattern, although it was non-significant. Therefore, NGF could be considered a ‘cutaneous factor’, as it modulates specifically neurite extension of cutaneous neurons but not muscle neurons. In fact, NGF has been shown to act specifically on a subpopulation of small primary sensory neurons and on sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levi-Montalcini, 1987</xref>), and later studies confirmed that this factor increased sensory neurites, but not motor neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allodi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Santos et al., 2016b</xref>). Thus, neurotrophic factors can be used to modulate differentially muscle and cutaneous sensory neurons.</p><p>Among the most DEGs, we found that Med12 was strongly upregulated in proprioceptors but downregulated in nociceptors and mechanoreceptors. Since the regeneration of proprioceptors is limited, we thought that axotomy might trigger the expression of regeneration inhibitory factors in this population that slows this process. MED12 is a subunit of Mediator, a multiprotein complex that regulates transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ding et al., 2008</xref>). Besides its known involvement in genomic signaling, cytoplasmic MED12 was described to inhibit TGF-β receptor 2 through a physical interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). The TGF-β pathway is a positive regulator of regeneration since it contributes to the activation of the intrinsic growth capacity of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Walshe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ye et al., 2022</xref>). Knowing MED12’s involvement in the TGF-β pathway, we hypothesized that the upregulation of this protein could hinder axon regeneration in proprioceptors through inhibition of TGF-β receptor 2. When silencing Med12, we found a significant increase in the length of neurites that was specific to proprioceptors, with no discernible impact on other sensory populations. Since nociceptors and mechanoreceptors showed a strong downregulation of <italic>Med12</italic>, we believe that silencing this gene has little effect on these cells. Altogether, our data demonstrates that MED12 is a novel regulator of neuron-specific regeneration and can be a promising factor to improve proprioceptive regeneration after nerve injury. The mechanism by which MED12 regulates this process is, however, unknown. We did not observe a change in expression of some typical TGF-β mediators. This does not exclude this pathway as the mechanism of action of MED12 since the low percentage of proprioceptive cells could be masking the effects. Future investigations should focus on elucidating the specific mechanisms by which MED12 modulates regeneration and neurite outgrowth. As a unique strategy to enhance proprioceptive neuron plasticity, in vivo analysis of the functional impact of its knockdown will be of significant interest.</p><p>Besides <italic>Med12</italic>, we found a large sample of genes significantly regulated after an injury, and many of them could explain the differential response seen in the regeneration of peripheral neuron subtypes. From these, we focused on the differences between muscle and cutaneous neurons since these could help us improve specific regeneration toward their target organs.</p><p>Muscle neurons strongly upregulated <italic>Bcam</italic> and <italic>Myadm</italic>, among other genes. <italic>Bcam</italic> encodes a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that binds to laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Udani et al., 1998</xref>). Although this protein has been mainly studied in erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wautier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartolucci et al., 2010</xref>), laminin is the main substrate in the peripheral nerve and its differential expression might influence regeneration. MYADM has been described to be associated with lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Capkovic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aranda et al., 2013</xref>), which are membrane domains involved in growth factor signal transduction, axon guidance, and cellular adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsui-Pierchala et al., 2002</xref>). In HeLa and PC3 cell cultures, MYADM is crucial for targeting RAC1 to these membrane rafts, facilitating cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aranda et al., 2013</xref>). Since RAC1 is one of the most important Rho GTPases favoring axon elongation, MYADM could be an interesting target for future regeneration studies. In contrast, one the genes more upregulated in cutaneous neurons compared to muscle neurons was <italic>Gpc2</italic>, which encodes for a cell surface proteoglycan. In N2a cells, the interaction of GPC2 with midkine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sorrelle et al., 2017</xref>) was shown to promote cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kurosawa et al., 2001</xref>). This suggests that GPC2 could be a target to enhance cutaneous specificity in mechanoreceptors and nociceptors.</p><p>Given the plethora of DEGs identified in a single neuron subtype, several could account for their distinct regeneration patterns. Among the top motoneuron-specific upregulated genes we found <italic>Ngfr</italic> (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), which was also found upregulated in previous motoneuron-specific RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shadrach et al., 2021</xref>). The functions of p75<sup>NTR</sup> are complex and diverse since its activation by neurotrophins can have opposite effects, including both survival and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roux and Barker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chao, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gutierrez and Davies, 2011</xref>). NRP2 is a cell surface receptor for class 3 semaphorins, with high affinity to SEMA3C and SEMA3F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 1997</xref>). This receptor participates in axon guidance during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gil and Del Río, 2019</xref>), but its role in peripheral nerve injuries is largely unknown. In our study, we found a significant upregulation of <italic>Nrp2</italic> (and <italic>Nrp1</italic>) only in proprioceptors, the neuron population linked to less robust regenerative growth. Semaphorins are expressed in the nerve after an injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ara et al., 2004</xref>), and their repulsive effect through NRP2 could partially account for impaired growth in proprioceptive axons. In contrast, <italic>Ndel1</italic> was upregulated in all the studied neuron populations, except for proprioceptors. NDEL1 is a cytoskeleton integrator that participates in the formation of the vimentin-dynein complex during neurite extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shim et al., 2008</xref>). In vivo silencing of <italic>Ndel1</italic> after nerve injury resulted in reduced regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Toth et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the lack of upregulation of <italic>Ndel1</italic> in proprioceptors is in agreement with the limited regeneration observed in this population after a nerve injury.</p><p>Finally, the regenerative transcriptome from mechanoreceptors and nociceptors can also be useful to study candidates regulating allodynia and hyperalgesia after a nerve injury. We found a significant upregulation of <italic>Atf2</italic> in mechanoreceptors. Upregulation of this factor in small and medium DRG neurons was previously reported after injury, and its knockdown reduced tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia after spinal nerve ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salinas-Abarca et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, we found a strong upregulation of <italic>Il6ra</italic> (interleukin-6 receptor alpha or gp80) in nociceptors. In neuropathic pain models, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is involved in hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cunha et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murphy et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arruda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Melemedjian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Quarta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, some studies support that IL-6 is involved in the pro-regenerative response of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirota et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murphy et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murphy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cafferty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zorina et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the high expression of <italic>Il6ra</italic> in nociceptors could be one of the contributing mechanisms to the greater regeneration of these neurons after nerve injury.</p><p>Altogether, we identified several DEGs not previously associated with the regenerative response. We also reported differences between neuron populations in genes that are known to be associated with a regenerative phenotype. Yet, it is worth noting that regenerative responses are dynamic, and we only analyzed the transcriptome 7 days after injury. Since we observed that regeneration rate varies between neurons, differences in gene expression could be influenced by the stage of regeneration. Analyzing different times after injury could help understanding some of the differences in the regenerative response of neuron populations. For instance, discriminating those set of genes that are specifically activated by a population after injury from the differential activation of the same set of genes at different regeneration stages. Furthermore, we studied four neuron populations, some of which encompass more than one neuron subtype and not all of them are found in the same microenvironment. Motoneuron’s somas are found in the spinal cord, further away from the lesion, and are influenced by a completely different environment than sensory neurons. Therefore, the direct comparison of motor and sensory neurons is limited and challenging. However, here we used a well-established model of injury that resembles the physiological conditions. Despite these caveats, we think that our findings are a key step to decipher the intrinsic growth capacity of different types of peripheral neurons.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We characterized the regeneration of four key peripheral neuron subtypes from a histological and a genetic perspective. Our study aimed to identify specific mechanisms that could potentially be used in the future for modulating preferential regeneration of these neuron subtypes. Through our analysis, we were able to observe significant differences in the regeneration rate and gene expression after nerve injury that could be attributed to their distinct regenerative profiles. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving the regeneration of different neuron subtypes and could serve as a basis for future studies focused on developing targeted approaches to promote specific types of regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona Animal Experimentation Ethical Committee and followed the European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/EU and the Spanish National law (RD 53/2013).

Validity of the samples was assessed with 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent). 100 ng of total RNA from each sample was used for preparing the libraries with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit (New England Biolabs, #E7760), using the rRNA depletion module. Libraries were validated with TapeStation and all samples were pooled and sequenced using the NextSeq 500 System (Illumina) in runs of 2×75 cycles, yielding at least 30 million reads per sample. The raw data are available on the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (accession PRJNA1101080).</p><p>FASTQ files were tested for quality using FastQC (v0.11.9). The reads were aligned to the coding DNA reference database (Ensembl Mouse database, Genome assembly: GRCm39, release 102) using Salmon (v1.8.0). The nature of the pair-end library was checked using Salmon, detecting an ISR type: inward, stranded, and read 1 coming from the reverse strand. The Salmon option ‘validateMappings’ was used. The quantified transcript reads were mapped to genes and imported to the R environment (R version 4.2.0) using the library ‘tximport’ (v1.24.0). Then, the ‘DESeq2’ library (v1.36.0) was used to perform the differential expression analysis. Volcano plots were plotted using the R library ‘EnhancedVolcano’ (v1.14.0). Hierarchical clusters were performed using the R library ‘pheatmap’ (v 1.0.12) using the different groups analyzed in the study. In each case, the 80 more variable genes among samples were used, performing the clustering for both the rows (genes) and columns (samples). The enrichment analysis was performed using the R library ‘STRINGdb’ (v 2.8.4), using the genes quantified with an adjusted p-value lower than 0.05. Several ontologies and databases were used in this enrichment analysis: Biological Process (Gene Ontology), Molecular Function (Gene Ontology), Cellular Component (Gene Ontology), and KEGG Pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunohistochemistry against some factors specifically upregulated in subsets of neurons</title><p>Animals ChAT-Cre/Tomato, and Npy2r-Cre/Tomato, either control or 1 week after suffering a nerve crush, were perfused and lumbar DRGs and a lumbar segment of the SC were extracted.

To investigate this question, they harnessed the power of four distinct reporter mouse models featuring fluorescent labeling of these neuronal subtypes. Their findings reveal that axons of nociceptor neurons exhibit faster regeneration than those of motor neurons, with mechanoreceptors, and proprioceptors displaying the slowest regeneration rate.</p><p>To delve into the molecular mechanisms underlying this divergence in regeneration potential, the authors employed the Ribotag technique in mice. This approach enabled them to dissect the differential translatomes of these four neuronal populations after nerve injury, comparing them to uninjured neurons. Their comprehensive expression profiling data uncovers a remarkably heterogeneous response among these neuron subtypes to axon injury.</p><p>To focus on one identified target with a mechanistic experiment as a proof of concept, their analysis highlights a striking upregulation of MED12 in proprioceptors, leading to the hypothesis that this molecule may play an inhibitory role, contributing to the comparatively slower regeneration of proprioceptor axons when compared to other neuronal subtypes. This hypothesis gains support from their in vitro model, where siRNA-mediated downregulation of MED12 results in a significant increase in neurite outgrowth in proprioceptive neurons after plating in cell culture dishes.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study, and in conjunction with similar work from others will be highly valuable for neurobiologists studying how to modulate the regeneration of axons from distinct neuronal subtypes. The quality of data presentation appears to be very good in general, and the manuscript is appropriately written.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>Because there are multiple explanations for the differential regeneration responses, the authors have provided further discussion about how regeneration may be regulated in vitro and in vivo. The detection of a gene, Med12, which is unregulated in proprioceptive neurons, but not nociceptive and mechanoceptors, gives support to the existence of specific programs of responses in the peripheral nervous system after injury. Further investigation is needed to define this responsiveness in detail.</p><p>Another response is the role of neurotrophins and their receptors. The authors have considered outcomes as a result of different Trk receptor signaling and also the effect of TGFbeta and IL6 as cytokine modulators. Add to this list is the possibility that axon guidance molecules and downstream substates may also play a role.</p><p>The original title was considered to be too broad and did not explain all the mechanistic aspects of this study. Therefore a revised title &quot;Neuron-specific RNA-sequencing reveals different response in peripheral neurons after nerve injury&quot; was used. It is appropriately suitable for the results reported in this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91316.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bolívar</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Autonomous University of Barcelona</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bellaterra</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sanz</surname><given-names>Elisenda</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ovelleiro</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peripheral Nervous System, Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca (VHIR), Vall d'Hebron Hospital Universitari, Vall d'Hebron Barcelona Hospital Campus, Passeig Vall d'Hebron 119-129, 08035, Barcelona, Spain</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Barcelona</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zochodne</surname><given-names>Douglas W</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine and the Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edmonton</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Udina</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bellaterra, Barcelona</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for their comments, as well as for the time dedicated to make useful suggestions that have contributed to improve the manuscript. We have responded to the concerns raised by the reviewers, and after that, we have also responded to the different points highlighted in the Recommendations for the authors:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p><p>While in vivo injury was used to assess regeneration from subsets of PNS neurons, different in vitro neurite growth or explant assays were used for further assessments. However, the authors did not assess whether the differential &quot;regenerative&quot; responses in vivo could be recapitulated in vitro. Such results will be important in interpreting the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We included a supplementary figure evaluating the neurite extension in vitro and updated the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Intriguingly, even in individual groups of PNS neurons, not all neurons regenerate to the same extent. It is known that the distance between the cell body and the lesion site affects neuronal injury responses. It would be interesting to test this in the observed regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>Although it is true that the distance can affect the outcome, here we used a physiological model where all neurons are lesioned at the same point in the nerve. Not only distance is different for motoneurons, but also the microenvironment surrounding their somas and therefore the direct comparison of these neurons with sensory neurons is limited. We extended the discussion on this matter in the new manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 1: The authors quantified the number of regenerating axons at two different time points. However, the total numbers of neurons/axons in each subset are different. The authors should use these numbers to normalize their regenerative axons.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1D shows the normalization of data from figure 1C (normalized against the number of control axons in each neuron type). This has been clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 2-5: In explaining differential regeneration of individual groups of neurons, there are at least two possibilities: (1). Each group of neurons has different injury/regenerative responses; (2). The same set of injury/regenerative responses are differentially activated. Some data in this manuscript suggested the latter possibility. But some other data point in the opposite direction. It would be informative for the authors to analyze/discuss this further.</p></disp-quote><p>From our point of view, these two options can be considered differential response to injury and could be potentially used for the modulation of regeneration. However, if the second possibility is correct, the regenerative program could be more influenced by the time chosen to study the response. Given the importance of this, we added some discussion about this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 6: Is it possible to assess the regenerative effects of knockdown Med12 after in vivo injury?</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible, but it is out of the scope of this work. Here, we aimed to describe the regenerative response and validate our data by testing a potential target for specific regeneration. Future studies will focus on the modulation of this specific regeneration both in vitro and in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2</bold></p><p>It seems that the most intriguing outcome of this paper revolves around the role of Med12 in nerve regeneration. The authors should prioritize this finding. Drawing a conclusion regarding Med12's role in proprioceptor regeneration based solely on this in vitro model may be insufficient. This noteworthy result requires further investigation using more animal models of nerve regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>The main goal of this work was to compare the regenerative responses of different neuron subpopulations. We modulated Med12 to validate our data and the potential of our findings. Unfortunately, investigating in depth the role of Med12 in regeneration is out of the scope of this paper. For this reason, we did not prioritise this finding here. As this finding was striking, we strongly agree that the next step should be studying how it modulates regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One critique revolves around the authors' examination of only a single time point within the dynamic and continuously evolving process of regeneration/reinnervation. Given that this process is characterized by dynamic changes, some of which may not be directly associated with active axon growth during regeneration, and encompasses a wide range of molecular alterations throughout reinnervation, concentrating solely on a single time point could result in the omission of critical molecular events.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is probably the main limitation of this study, as we discussed in the text. We chose 7 days postinjury as a standard time point widely described in literature and to have a correlate with our histological data. Although the main aim was to compare populations, analyzing an additional time point after injury could add valuable information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3</bold></p></disp-quote><p>No concerns were expressed by that reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>The authors should assess whether the differential &quot;regenerative&quot; responses in vivo could be recapitulated in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>We included a supplementary figure evaluating the neurite extension in vitro and updated the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Optional:</p><p>It will be interesting to test if the distances between the cell body and the lesion site contribute to the observed differences in individual subsets of PNS neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1D shows the normalization of data from figure 1C (normalized against the number of control axons in each neuron type).

This manuscript presents some interesting findings, but the title is quite broad and may suggest that the authors have unveiled fundamental mechanisms explaining the varying regenerative abilities of peripheral axons. However, the results do not substantiate such a conclusion. Further comments and suggestions follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We eliminated the word “regenerative (response)” from the title, as it could lead to think that all changes seen in these neurons are related only to regeneration. We think that “Neuron-specific RNA-sequencing reveals different responses in peripheral neurons after nerve injury” highlights the differences between neurons that we found without misleading towards thinking that we described regenerative mechanisms in all neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What's notably absent here is the validation of certain genes found with the ribosomes, especially those highlighted in the subsequent figures. The question arises as to whether the changes depicted in the figures align with changes in the DRGs in vivo. Is there concordance between the presence of these genes and their transcriptional changes? It would greatly enhance the study's value if the authors could show evidence of upregulation or downregulation of certain genes over time in tissue sections, utilizing techniques such as in situ hybridization or immunocytochemistry.</p></disp-quote><p>We selected some factors that were specifically upregulated in subsets of neurons to corroborated by immunohistochemistry these findings. Changes in the immunofluorescence of P75 in motoneurons and ATF2 in cutaneous mechanoreceptors, were evaluated in controls and animals that received a nerve crush one week before. Supplementary figures with the images have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors discovered intriguing distinctions, such as the presence of specific signaling pathways unique to neurons projecting to muscle as opposed to those projecting to the skin. Among these pathways were those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases like VEGF, erbB, and neurotrophin signaling among others. The question now arises: do these pathways play a role in natural peripheral regeneration processes? To answer this, it is imperative to conduct in vivo studies. However, the authors employed an in vitro DRG neurite outgrowth assay to demonstrate that various types of neurons exhibit different responses to the presence of different neurotrophins. This does not reflect what actually happens in vivo. While neurotrophins indeed play a role in neuron survival and axon extension during development, their role in postnatal periods changes over time, and it remains unclear whether they play any role in the natural regenerative processes of the peripheral nerve. Therefore, this experiment may not be directly relevant in this case, especially during the early axon extension period of the regenerating axons. if the authors aim to establish a causal link with neurotrophin signaling, it becomes crucial to conduct in vivo experiments by manipulating the expression of key molecules like the receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been widely described that different types of peripheral neurons have a differential expression of Trk receptors, even in the adult, and that these respond differentially to neurotrophins. In our study, we do not stablish a causal relationship between the expression of Trk and neurite extension, but instead we show (as many others) that distinct neurons respond differentially to these neurotrophins. The fact that in vivo studies fail to show a clear effect does not necessarily mean that neurotrophins are not specific. It might mean that their effect is not strong enough to be a useful guide in the complex microenvironment found after an injury. For instance, NGF acts on TrkA (present in some neurons), but in vivo it has been shown to accelerate the clearance of myelin debris in Schwann cells (Li et al., 2020), which could facilitate regeneration of all type of axons, masking any potential specific effect on the subtypes of neurons expressing TrkA. In contrast, in an in vitro setting on neuronal cultures, the specific neuronal effect can be more evident.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, it's worth noting that another paper utilizing the same methodology and experimental setup (PMID: 29756027, &quot;Translatome Regulation in Neuronal Injury and Axon Regrowth&quot; by Rozenbaum et al.) exists. Are there any significant differences or shared findings with that study?</p></disp-quote><p>This study shows the transcriptomic response after an injury 4, 12 and 24 hours after an injury in a very similar experimental setup. They focus on comparing the neuronal vs the glial response to the injury, using a Ribotag line that tags ribosomes from all neurons in the DRG rather than specific neuron subtypes. As the time postinjury (24h vs 7 days) and the cell types studied are different, we could not directly compare our results. We did see an upregulation in both datasets of previously described growth-associated genes (Jun, Atf3, Sox11, Sprr1a, Gal…). We included the article in the references for its relevance in the topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful for readers to illustrate the finding of the fastest axon regeneration of nociceptors by showing fluorescence micrographs of the nerve samples in addition to the graphs shown in Fig. 1 C/D.</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 1B, we show fluorescence micrographs of the nerves 7 days postinjury. As explained in the results, we counted the number of axons at 2 distances from the injury, we did not analyse the fastest axon. This is due to technical reasons: 7 days after the injury the fastest axon has surpassed our evaluation point, which was the further distance that we could assess in our experimental setting in a consistent manner. If the reviewer thinks that we need to include more images from our evaluations (from 9 dpi for example), we could prepare a new figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The labeling in Fig. 2B is confusing. Is the CHAT immunoreactivity shown in the last panel illustrated by green or red signals? Is the red signal counterstaining with beta-tubulin?</p></disp-quote><p>The labelling was changed in the figure to increase clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The references to the supplementary data throughout the manuscript are confusing. For example, where can the &quot;Supp data 2&quot; be found? (mention on p. 14 in the merged pdf file). Are they referring to the Excel spreadsheets?</p></disp-quote><p>We divided the supplementary material in supplementary figures/table (found in the pdf) and supplementary data. Supplementary data refers to excel spreadsheets found outside the pdf file. We hope this will be clearer after the final formatting of the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What does the following statement on p. 14 mean?: &quot;The caveat in these analyses was that molecular classification by these approaches may be arbitrary, and not reflective of protein repurposing.&quot; This reviewer notes that these databases consider the fact that components participate in different pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we aimed to explain that many proteins participate in different pathways, and this is a limitation of the enrichment analysis. We modified the sentence in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First paragraph on p. 15: The PPAR and AMPK pathways have much broader roles, and are not only &quot;related to fatty acid metabolism&quot;. This factual inaccuracy should be corrected in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should consider showing increased TGF-beta signaling in their neurons after downregulation of Med12 given the previous implication of TGF-beta signaling in axon regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to demonstrate the effect of our knockdown in TGF-beta pathway by analyzing the expression of typical targets from this pathway by qPCR in our cultures. However, we could not detect any difference. We think that this can have two explanations: (1) as only a few cells upregulate Med12 whereas many cells downregulate it, the effect is masked (presumably only proprioceptors will have a significant difference in this pathway and, thus, it would be very difficult to see the effect), or (2) Med12 is not exerting its effect through this pathway. We added a supplementary figure with these data and discussed it in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful to eliminate typos and improve syntax/grammar/style.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text to improve style.</p></body></sub-article></article>
