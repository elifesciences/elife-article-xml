State-of-the-art multiphoton holographic optogenetics requires high-power illumination that only addresses relatively small populations of neurons in parallel. Conversely, one-photon holographic techniques can stimulate more neurons with two to three orders lower power, but with limited resolution or addressable volume. Perhaps most problematically, two-photon holographic optogenetic systems are extremely expensive and sophisticated which has precluded their broader adoption in the neuroscience community. To address this technical gap, we introduce a new one-photon light sculpting technique, three-dimensional multi-site random access photostimulation (3D-MAP), that overcomes these limitations by modulating light dynamically, both in the spatial and in the angular domain at multi-kHz rates. We use 3D-MAP to interrogate neural circuits in 3D and demonstrate simultaneous photostimulation and imaging of dozens of user-selected neurons in the intact mouse brain in vivo with high spatio-temporal resolution. 3D-MAP can be broadly adopted for high-throughput all-optical interrogation of brain circuits owing to its powerful combination of scale, speed, simplicity, and cost.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>light field</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>optical microscopy</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd><kwd>brain mapping</kwd><kwd>structured illumination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N66001-17-C-40154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waller</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Adesnik</surname><given-names>Hillel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UF1NS107574</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waller</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Adesnik</surname><given-names>Hillel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New York Stem Cell Foundation Robertson Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adesnik</surname><given-names>Hillel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Weill Neurohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF4562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waller</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5113244</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pégard</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BYI 2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pégard</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A one-photon three-dimensional light sculpture technique has been developed and demonstrated for high spatio-temporal resolution photostimulation and imaging of dozens of neurons in the intact mouse brain in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Optogenetics enables rapid and reversible control of neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deisseroth, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>).

Two-photon photostimulation has the advantages of high spatial resolution for precise neural activity control and relative immunity to tissue light scattering, enabling stimulation of deep brain circuits. However, two-photon holographic optogenetic photostimulation can only stimulate relatively small ensembles of neurons at a time, limited by the very high-power pulsed illumination required to achieve non-linear multiphoton absorption. High photon density heats brain tissue, and can disturb brain activity and cause thermal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mardinly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Podgorski and Ranganathan, 2016</xref>). The accessible volume for holographic two-photon photostimulation is also limited by the coherence length of laser being used, since holographic diffraction of femtosecond pulses to a large angle introduces severe pulse dispersion (‘chirp’), substantially reducing pulse peak power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Mechanically scanning a single focus or a holographic pattern can access a larger volume but is not suitable for studies that require simultaneous illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) to understand the network. Perhaps the two most significant barriers to the broader adoption of multiphoton optogenetic systems is that they are extremely expensive and sophisticated to operate and to maintain. Thus, despite more than a decade since their introduction, multiphoton optogenetics has only been adopted by a small handful of groups, typically with much prior optical expertise.</p><p>In contrast, one-photon photostimulation systems require two to three orders of magnitude less laser power to activate neurons. They are much simpler to implement with far less expensive hardware, and they can still achieve high-resolution photostimulation under limited light scattering conditions. There are three main strategies to generate multiple foci with one-photon photostimulation, yet none is capable of simultaneously stimulating custom ensembles of multiple neurons over a large 3D volume with high spatial resolution. The first approach, scanning-based one-photon photostimulation, stimulates neurons sequentially by rapidly scanning a single focus across small neural clusters with scanning mirrors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>) or acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Losavio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). This method cannot photostimulate distributed ensembles simultaneously. The second approach is to directly project 2D illumination patterns onto samples with a digital micromirror device (DMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhawale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leifer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Werley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakai et al., 2013</xref>). This widefield illumination scheme has a large field-of-view (FOV) and moderate lateral resolution but only modulates light in 2D. There is no axial sectioning ability and unwanted photostimulation may occur both above and below the focal plane. The third approach, computer generated holography (CGH), generates 3D distributed foci by phase modulation of coherent light in Fourier space using a spatial light modulator (SLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lutz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anselmi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reutsky-Gefen et al., 2013</xref>). One-photon CGH has high lateral resolution and moderate axial resolution but has several critical drawbacks that constrain its ability to execute sophisticated optogenetics experiments. First, the throughput of CGH that determines the number of accessible voxels is fundamentally limited by the number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF), which is determined by the number of pixels and the bit depth of the SLM, regardless of magnification and numerical aperture. This generally results in a small FOV when high spatial resolution is required. Second, the refresh rate (tens to hundreds Hz) of SLMs limits the speed of CGH. Third, CGH requires computing a 2D phase mask at the Fourier plane for a 3D hologram pattern, which is an ill-posed problem that requires iterative optimization, with computation time on the order of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerchberg, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leseberg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xue et al., 2019</xref>) when shaping light across multiple z-planes. Although recent work successfully reduces the CGH computation time to milliseconds using a pre-trained deep neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hossein Eybposh et al., 2020</xref>), this will be insufficient when the number of z-planes increases. The extra computational requirements for generating holographic patterns in the Fourier domain (rather than directly projecting patterns on the conjugate image plane) can become limiting when thousands of different patterns are required (as in high-throughput mapping experiments), or when fast online synthesis of custom patterns is needed for closed-loop experiments. The fourth drawback of one-photon CGH is that holograms composed of many illumination spots will suffer spatial cross-talk as out-of-focus light from each focused spot interacts, accidentally stimulating non-targeted neurons. Taken together, despite the power of these previous one-photon techniques, none are suitable for large-scale high-resolution optogenetic activation of 3D distributed ensembles of neurons.</p><p>To overcome this challenge, we developed 3D multi-site random access photostimulation (3D-MAP), a new approach to generate 3D illumination patterns by modulating light both in the angular domain, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, with scanning mirrors, and in the spatial domain, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, with a DMD. For 3D optogenetic photostimulation, illumination patterns are optimized to target an opsin expressed in the neuronal soma (~10 µm). The set of light rays needed to generate each spherical target can be described with a 4D light field, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, in the spatio-angular domain. 3D-MAP generates these rays by rapidly sweeping through the appropriate angles of illumination with scanning mirrors while using the DMD to project the corresponding amplitude masks to pattern each angle’s spatial information. 3D-MAP uses one spatial pattern on the DMD for each unique illumination angle set by the scanning mirrors. The total number of DoF is hence determined by the <italic>product</italic> of the number of angles of the scanning mirror and the number of pixels of the DMD (as opposed to the <italic>sum</italic>), resulting in a much larger DoF than existing one-photon optogenetic stimulation techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lutz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anselmi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reutsky-Gefen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhawale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leifer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Werley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakai et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, 3D-MAP achieves both high spatial resolution and a large accessible volume. Compared to one-photon CGH, 3D-MAP is able to reduce spatial cross-talk by prioritizing illumination angles that minimize the stimulation of non-targeted areas due to its high DoF. Compared to 2D widefield patterning methods, 3D-MAP retains the advantages of high-throughput and computational efficiency, while extending the addressable space from 2D to 3D. Thanks to the use of a DMD instead of an SLM, we can pattern the entire addressable volume at multi-kHz rate (the volumetric pattern refresh rate), which exceeds the bandwidth of most neural circuits and is one order of magnitude faster than 3D CGH. A comparison between strengths and weaknesses of 3D-MAP versus existing photostimulation approaches is shown in (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).</p><p>We present the experimental setup and computational methods for all-optical interrogation of neural circuits in 3D and demonstrate that 3D-MAP achieves high-resolution, high-speed, and high-throughput in brain slices and in vivo recorded by electrophysiology and optical detectors, respectively. We then use 3D-MAP to interrogate neural circuits with both single-spot photostimulation and multi-spot photostimulation in 3D. These experiments validate 3D-MAP as a one-photon technique to manipulate neural circuits on-demand with high spatio-temporal resolution in the intact brain. Our technique can be flexibly used to map neural connectivity at both small and large scales. Its relative simplicity, small hardware footprint, and lower cost should make it broadly adoptable across the neuroscience community.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optical design of 3D-MAP</title><p>The experimental setup for 3D-MAP is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

For example, in the simplest case of patterning a single focus spot at the native focal plane (z = 0), we simply turn on the pixels corresponding to the desired position, keeping the pattern constant for all illumination angles. To create a focused spot at an off-focus plane, a small aperture on the DMD rotates in a circle as the scanning mirrors sweep through a cone of projection angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The center of the aperture’s revolving circle is the lateral position of the target spot, and the circle’s diameter, <italic>D</italic>, determines the spot’s axial position (a larger diameter concentrates light further away from the native image plane at a given illumination angle). To activate multiple neurons simultaneously, we superimpose the patterns corresponding to each target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, we can adjust the laser power in each focused spot flexibly and individually by adjusting the aperture size on the DMD, the number of apertures aimed at a given target, or by adjusting the laser power if needed. The amount of light on any given target is quadratically proportional to the radius of the aperture. For example, changing the aperture radius from 10 pixels to 14 pixels will increase the stimulation power on the target by a factor 2 times.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup for three-dimensional multi-site random access photostimulation (3D-MAP).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A collimated laser beam illuminates the surface of a digital micromirror device (DMD) with a custom illumination angle set by scanning mirrors.

Hence, even complicated 3D target designs can be computed quickly and easily. In contrast, conventional CGH systems synthesize a 3D hologram by modulating a coherent laser beam with a 2D static phase mask at the conjugate Fourier plane, which is an ill-posed problem where the 3D pattern is an approximate solution. CGH uses coherent light that introduces speckle in the hologram pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>), and out-of-focus light above and below each targeted area generates cross-talk that may unintentionally activate non-targeted neurons. Conversely, 3D-MAP modulates light incoherently in time which eliminates speckle. The cross-talk can be reduced by not selecting certain illumination angles to avoid stimulating non-targeted areas, further enhancing the stimulation accuracy and efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Our algorithm can automatically remove rays in the non-targeted areas and generate the corresponding DMD amplitude patterns (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). More strategies to reduce cross-talk are discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>The axial resolution of 3D-MAP depends on the angle and number of beams that are sequentially projected to generate the targeted 3D intensity pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Because the fastest frame refresh rate of the DMD (13 kHz, or 77 μs per frame) is about 52-fold shorter than the stimulation time (4 ms, see later sections for details), we can use up to 52 angles without sacrificing speed. However, the DMD has limited on-chip memory, so we choose to minimize the number of amplitude masks required. In all our experiments, we use 10 illumination angles for each 3D target; additional illumination angles only introduce minor improvements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). The maximum refresh rate of the DMD is 13 kHz, and each 3D volumetric pattern is generated by 10 masks on the DMD, so the maximum volumetric pattern rate is 1.3 kHz, which is more than an order of magnitude faster than conventional CGH with commercial SLMs. Since the characteristic response time of the microbial opsin is much longer than the duration of individual projection masks, the relevant light sculpting pattern seen by the opsin is the time-averaged sum of the intensity of several mutually incoherent masks. In addition, the DMD masks for 3D-MAP are based on ray tracing and can be calculated much faster than phase holograms in CGH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerchberg, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leseberg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xue et al., 2019</xref>), enabling real-time or closed-loop applications such as mapping neural circuits (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Optical characterization of 3D-MAP</title><p>To quantify the optical resolution of 3D-MAP, we first measured the 3D optical point spread function (PSF).

We chose a 4 ms stimulation time (also known as ‘dwell time’) in all experiments to ensure full activation of opsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), followed by 8–40 ms inter-stimulation time (time between two stimulation pulses in successive targets, depending on the opsin type) to avoid photocurrent accumulation and minimize short-term plasticity of the synapses under study. Note that this is a specific choice for our experiments rather than the speed limit of 3D-MAP.

To demonstrate these advantages, we first used 3D-MAP to probe synaptic connectivity in 3D by randomly scanning a single focus point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We expressed soma-targeted ChroME in excitatory neurons of the cortex (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>Table S3) and performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from inhibitory interneurons that do not express ChroME under these conditions, to avoid the confounding effect of direct photocurrents in the patched neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The widefield fluorescent image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) shows the excitatory neurons (in red) and the patched inhibitory interneuron (in green). We first mapped an 800 × 800 µm<sup>2</sup> FOV at low spatial sampling (40 μm grid) to identify the sub-regions that contained most of the presynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We then re-mapped these sub-regions at fine resolution (20 µm/pixel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and again at even higher resolution (9 µm/pixel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Due to variable opsin protein expression levels across neurons, as well as variable intrinsic neural excitability, neurons are differentially sensitive to light. By mapping the same sub-region at different power levels, we were able to take advantage of this variability of photosensitivities to help identify putative individual (i.e., ‘unitary’) sources of presynaptic input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We generated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by sequential photostimulation of the entire volume and observed that most connectivity maps exhibited spatial clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>) as typically observed when mapping synaptic input in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Naka et al., 2019</xref>).

Multi-site photostimulation is crucial for perturbing or mapping brain circuits because only the activation of neural populations in parallel can drive the sophisticated activity patterns needed to understand network dynamics or behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2016</xref>).

We reasoned that mapping neural circuits with multiple foci, rather than a single focus, could scale up the temporal throughput of the system dramatically, since the overall connectivity matrix is remarkably sparse. Instead of randomly shifting a single focus to measure the one-to-one synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we used 3D-MAP to stimulate multiple random voxels simultaneously and reconstructed the spatial map of presynaptic networks via gradient descent.

We projected random sets of foci (five at a time in our experiment but other numbers should work as well, see next paragraph) and repeated this process until all voxels in 3D were stimulated several times (typically 5–10).

Multi-site simultaneous stimulation has two key advantages. First, multi-site stimulation engages the activity of spatially distributed ensembles of neurons (rather than single neurons or small local clusters), which may facilitate polysynaptic network activity and engages network level properties of the circuit. Second, since our approach is compatible with compressed sensing, it becomes possible to reconstruct the same mapping results with fewer measurements compared to single-target stimulation, assuming that the multiple stimulation sites are sparse, and that the readout signal is a linear combination of the inputs from these sites. The assumption is valid when the multiple voxels for concurrent stimulation are randomly drawn from the volume and the number of these voxels is much smaller than the total voxels in the volume (five voxels are randomly drawn from 1600 voxels in our experiment). Since multiple voxels are stimulated at the same time (say <italic>N</italic> voxels), each voxel needs to be measured <italic>N</italic> times with different patterns to estimate the contribution of each voxel to the photocurrent without compressive sensing. Under the assumption of sparsity and linearity, we can reconstruct the map of neural networks using compressive sensing and with less than <italic>N</italic> repetitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>N</italic> = 5).

Here, we tested whether we can use 3D-MAP for all-optical interrogation of a large number of neurons in vivo, and use visible light but maintain high spatial precision. To achieve this, we added an optical detection path to 3D-MAP for fluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). First, we recorded a widefield image stack by mechanically scanning the objective to identify the location of labeled neurons in 3D. Then, we <italic>simultaneously</italic> photostimulated all the identified neurons in the volume with 3D-MAP (a pulse train of 10 pulses at 20 Hz, and each pulse is 4 ms consisting of 10 projection angles and masks), and recorded calcium activity at 10 Hz of all these neurons by widefield imaging with ROI projection using the same DMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> insert plots). Since one-photon widefield imaging has no z-sectioning ability, we took advantage of this feature to capture fluorescence signals from neurons that are above and below the focal plane (dash plane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To improve the image contrast as well as reduce photo-bleaching, we used 2D patterns computed from the maximum z projection of the widefield image stack to selectively illuminate only the neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2019</xref>) rather than the whole field when recording calcium activity. We co-expressed the blue light sensitive opsin soma-targeted stCoChR-p2A-H2B-GFP and the red calcium sensor jRCaMP1a sparsely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010</xref>) in L2/3 neurons in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Forli et al., 2021</xref>) via in utero electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Then, we measured an in vivo all-optical 3D PPSF (a measure of calcium fluorescence change as a function of radial and axial displacements of the excitation target) with L2/3 neurons at the optimized power. The all-optical PPSF reflects the spatial specificity of all-optical 3D-MAP, incorporating the optical PSF, opsin sensitivity, and calcium indicator sensitivity, which is yet another system characterization that differs both from the optical PSF and from electrophysiology PPSF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> for the relation between optical PSF, PPSF, and all-optical PPSF). Averaged measurements of all-optical PPSF across 10 neurons indicate a lateral resolution of 49 ± 21 µm and an axial resolution of 53 ± 28 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

The relatively sparse expression of the opsin and calcium sensor here facilitated targeting specificity (mean distance between neurons in the FOV was 67 ± 37 µm which was larger than the all-optical PPSF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Instead of photostimulating all neurons in the volume simultaneously, we randomly assigned 32 neurons to four ensembles (eight neurons per ensemble) by Poisson disc sampling and we photostimulated each of the four ensembles sequentially while simultaneously imaging all neurons in the four ensembles with patterned illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–J</xref>). The widefield image of the neurons and the four stimulation patterns are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G-H</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6J</xref> show the calcium activity of all neurons under different photostimulation patterns, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref> shows the peak z-score of each neuron versus the stimulated neuron.

Therefore, 3D-MAP is able to generate high-resolution 3D patterns over large volumes that CGH cannot synthesize. 3D-MAP is also able to project 3D patterns at much faster speeds than CGH, not only because the current refresh rate of DMDs is an order of magnitude faster than that of SLMs, but also because calculating the light field parameters with ray tracing in 3D-MAP is much faster than calculating phase masks in 3D CGH. Perhaps most importantly for the broader neuroscience community, one can build a 3D-MAP system for a small fraction of the cost of two-photon holographic optogenetic systems (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). At the expense of lower spatial resolution and depth penetration, 3D-MAP is far simpler to operate and maintain and can readily address just as many neurons with far lower laser power. Since many types of circuit investigation experiments do not require the absolute spatial specificity of two-photon approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhawale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2019</xref>), many groups that would not otherwise leverage patterned illumination approaches could adopt 3D-MAP for their optogenetics research applications.</p><p>3D-MAP is the first demonstration that uses 4D light field patterning for in vivo optogenetic photostimulation. Even though two-photon photostimulation techniques have combined SLMs with scanning mirrors previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Packer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), 3D-MAP is fundamentally different from these techniques because it modulates the 4D light field <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, so the DoF of the system is the <italic>product</italic> of the DMD’s and the scanning mirrors’ DoF.

Hence, 3D-MAP achieves orders of magnitude more DoF without extra hardware. A further advantage of 3D-MAP over previous work is that it synthesizes a custom 3D intensity pattern in 3D <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> with 4D light field control, which is a well-posed problem, whereas controlling 3D intensity with 2D phase control is an ill-posed problem. Note that previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Levoy et al., 2009</xref>) on 4D light field display also used a DMD, along with a microlens array (MLA), but is fundamentally different from 3D-MAP. First, the DoF of 3D-MAP is orders of magnitude higher since scanning mirrors have much more DoF than a fixed MLA. Second, the MLA has a built-in tradeoff between spatial and angular resolution whereas 3D-MAP does not. Therefore, the maximum defocus range of 3D-MAP is 720 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) whereas the MLA-based method only achieves 40 µm range in microscopy applications. Third, we demonstrated 3D-MAP with acute brain slices and in vivo mouse brain where tissue scattering distorts the light field and limits the resolution, whereas the previous work is not used for optogenetics under scattering.</p><p>As a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrated all-optical 3D-MAP in a relatively thin 3D volume (600 × 600 × 40 µm<sup>3</sup>) where two opsin-expressing neurons right on top of each other along the z-axis is very rare under the conditions of relatively sparse labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010</xref>). Also, because we used a patterned widefield imaging system to detect the fluorescence emitted from calcium indicators, the signal-to-noise ratio of the fluorescence images will be lower than the readout noise of the camera if the neuron is too far away from the focal plane. To enable 3D detection over a larger axial range, one could apply pupil encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xue et al., 2019</xref>), light field detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prevedel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pégard et al., 2016</xref>), or remote focusing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Botcherby et al., 2008</xref>) to the imaging path of 3D-MAP.</p><p>Both one-photon and two-photon multi-site photostimulation are subject to spatial cross-talk, as out-of-focus light from one target may accidentally stimulate neurons that are at other focal planes, especially when the density of foci is high or when out-of-focus neurons are more photosensitive than the desired targets. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we demonstrated that the cross-talk in our experiment is minimal under conditions of relatively sparse opsin expression as obtained with conventional in utero electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010</xref>). However, when the separation between two adjacent neurons is closer than the all-optical PPSF, off-target effects are likely, even under sparse expression conditions. Therefore, in addition to expression sparsity, we can also control the stimulation pattern’s sparsity to mitigate spatial cross-talk. When the desired density of foci is high and cross-talk is expected, 3D-MAP could potentially leverage its multi-kHz patterning speed to exploit the temporal domain by multiplexing patterns and targeting smaller subsets of neurons at a time in order to increase pattern sparsity.</p><p>The maximum number of neurons that can be co-stimulated without cross-talk in one-photon or two-photon photostimulation depends on the available laser power, the limits of brain heating, the spatial resolution of the system, the FOV, and the spacing of opsin-expressing neurons. Compared to two-photon photostimulation, 3D-MAP trades on spatial resolution (by a factor of 2–3 in superficial layers) to use two to three orders lower laser power. For example, two-photon photostimulation techniques typically restrict the instantaneous power under the objective below 4 W to avoid photodamage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sridharan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mardinly et al., 2018</xref>). At full power, two-photon photostimulation techniques can simultaneously activate tens to over a hundred neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sridharan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mardinly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dalgleish et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, 3D-MAP is able to photostimulate dozens of neurons simultaneously with only 480 µW out of the objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–G</xref>). 3D-MAP requires sparser expression than for two-photon stimulation to achieve comparable effective specificity, but since total needed power is nearly 100-fold less for comparable stimulation patterns, brain heating is much less of a concern, and the technique can be scaled up to address more neurons in a larger brain area. Many experiments do not need full optical control over all neurons in a volume – for example, when targeting a specific transcriptional subtype, and many other experiments do not absolutely require single-cell specificity. Thus, for many applications 3D-MAP should be preferable to two-photon applications, with the specific exceptions of experiments that demand photostimulation of precise ensembles within a small volume of densely labeled tissue, or when the neural targets are located at brain depths only accessible to infrared light. The simplicity and scalability of 3D-MAP thus provides new experimental capabilities that two-photon photostimulation techniques cannot easily achieve.</p><p>Like any other one-photon photostimulation technique, the effective resolution of 3D-MAP in brain tissue is limited by scattering. As we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, illumination with red shifted sources can reduce Rayleigh scattering and mitigate resolution loss through brain tissue, but the accessible depth remains fundamentally limited to the first few hundreds of microns below the surface of the mouse brain and the scattering effect is more severe the deeper the stimulation is. To photostimulate neurons deeper inside the mammalian brain with 3D-MAP, the cortex can be surgically removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dombeck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marshel et al., 2012</xref>) or implemented with a miniaturized microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stamatakis et al., 2018</xref>) as it is routinely performed to image deep structures such as the hippocampus or the thalamus. Taken together, 3D-MAP is a new volumetric optogenetic projection system that offers advantages over existing one-photon and two-photon optogenetic technologies and should facilitate a wide range of neural perturbation experiments to map the structure and function of brain circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>3D-MAP optical setup</title><p>The laser sources for optogenetic stimulation are diode pumped solid state (DPSS) laser diodes.

Current supplies are externally driven by an analog modulation voltage. The laser beams are scanned by a pair of galvo-mirrors (GVS202, Thorlabs, Newton, N.J.,U.S.), and then the beam size is expanded to fill the DMD (DLP9000X and the controller V4390, ViALUX, Germany) by a 4f system (<italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub> = 45 mm, <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> = 150 mm). The DMD is mounted on a rotation base in order to maximize the output laser power from ‘ON’ pixels and minimize the diffraction pattern from DMD pitches. Then the patterned beam passes through a tube lens (<italic>f</italic> = 180 mm) and the objective lens (XLUMPlanFL N, 20×, NA 1.0, Olympus) to generate multiple foci. The objective lens is mounted on a motorized z-stage (FG-BOBZ-M, Sutter Instrument, Novato, C.A., U.S.). A custom dichroic mirror (zt473/589/635rpc-UF2, Chroma, Bellows Falls, V.T., U.S.) is placed before the objective lens to reflect the stimulation laser beams while transmitting fluorescence photons emitted from the sample. The fluorescence passes through a tube lens (<italic>f</italic> = 180 mm) and a 4f system (<italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub> = 100 mm, <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> = 150 mm), and then is imaged by a camera (Prime95B, Teledyne Photometrix, Tucson, A.Z., U.S., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Brain samples (acute brain slices and anesthetized mice) are placed on a motorized x-y stage (X040528 and the controller MP-285, Sutter Instrument, Novato, C.A., U.S.). The 3D PSF and patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) are measured by capturing the fluorescence excitation in a thin fluorescent film on a microscope slide, with a sub-stage objective (XLUMPlanFL N, 20×, NA 1.0, Olympus) coupled to a camera (DCC1545M, Thorlabs, Newton, N.J., U.S.).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, where the number of foci is five (<italic>N</italic> = 5), it is possible to reconstruct the synaptic connection map coarsely with less than five repetitions (<italic>M</italic> = 1–4) with compressive sensing algorithms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Animal preparation and electrophysiology</title><p>Neonatal mice age P3–P4 (wild type, <italic>Emx1</italic>-IRES-Cre [JAX stock#005628], or <italic>Emx1</italic>-Cre;<italic>Gad1</italic>-GFP [MGI:3590301]) were cryoanesthetized on ice and mounted in a head mold.

In wild type mice we injected AAV-mDlx-ChroME to drive opsin expression in cortical interneurons. All expression vectors co-expressed nuclear-targeted mRuby3 except those in the all-optical interrogation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). Mice were used for brain slice or in vivo recordings at P28–P56. Brain slices were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pluta et al., 2015</xref>). Slices were transferred to a chamber and perfused with ACSF (no receptor blockers) warmed to ~33°C. First the microscope objective was centered over the area of V1 with the highest expression density of the opsin, as indicated by the density of mRuby3-expressing cells. ACSF contained in mM: NaCl 119, KCl 2.5, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.3, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>1.3, glucose 20, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5. Internal solutions contained CsMeSO<sub>4</sub> (for voltage clamp) or KGluconate (for current clamp) 135 mM and NaCl 8 mM, HEPES 10 mM, Na<sub>3</sub>GTP 0.3 mM, MgATP 4 mM, EGTA 0.3 mM, QX-314-Cl 5 mM (voltage clamp only), TEA-Cl 5 mM (voltage clamp only). For loose-patch experiments pipettes were filled with ACSF. The resistance of the patch electrodes ranged from 3 to 5 MΩ. For direct recording of photocurrents or light-induced spiking, we patched neurons (either in loose patch or whole-cell patch clamp) that expressed mRuby3. For recording light-driven synaptic inputs we patched from unlabeled putative interneurons (that did not have pyramidal morphology), or from GFP-expressing neurons in GAD67-GFP mice.</p><p>For optogenetic mapping we generated light spots ~10 µm wide (apertures of 10–20 pixels in radius on DMD). The total stimulation duration was 3–6 ms. For ChroME-expressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A–E</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and CoChR-expressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>) animals, we used 473 nm light, and for Chrimson and ChRmine we used 635 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). All mapping used fully randomized sequences. For measurement of PPSFs and multi-spot synaptic maps, we used the system in full 3D mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For single spot synaptic maps all photostimuli were at the native focal plane, and the microscope was moved mechanically under software control to obtain input maps at different axial planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mapping at the native focal plane requires only one DMD mask per light stimulus as compared to 10 for a full 3D pattern, allowing for many more masks to be stored in the DMD RAM and rapidly displayed. Scanning mirrors scan continuously in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> to enable z-section when mapping at the native focal plane, which is different from direct 2D projection. At the beginning of each mapping experiment, we first took a 10-point laser power dose response curve of the photocurrent or light-induced synaptic current and used this data to choose the power range for photocurrent or synaptic mapping. For spiking PPSFs, the lowest light level that reliably generated spikes when directly targeting the soma was used. For single spot mapping we updated the DMD pattern at 40–80 Hz. For multi-spot mapping we updated the DMD pattern at 10–20 Hz, which minimized network adaptation.</p><p>For in vivo electrophysiology recording and all-optical interrogation, mice were sedated with chlorprothixene (0.075 mg) and anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5–2%). A small stainless steel plate was attached to the skull with Metabond. The skull was protected with cyanoacrylate glue and dental cement (Orthojet). A 2.5 mm craniotomy was made over V1 with a circular biopsy punch. The dura was removed with fine forceps and the craniotomy was covered with 1.2% agarose in ACSF and additional ACSF (electrophysiology) or covered with a cranial window (all-optical interrogation). The mouse was then injected with urethane for prolonged anesthesia (0.04 g), and supplemented with 0.5–1.5% isoflurane at the recording rig. Body temperature was maintained at 35–37°C with a warming blanket. Neurons were recorded under visualization either with epifluorescence (to target opsin-expressing neurons in the upper 100 µm of the brain for PPSF measurements) or in L2/3 via oblique infrared contrast imaging via an optic fiber (200 µm diameter) placed at a ~ 25 degree angle from horizontal located as close as possible to the brain surface underneath the objective. The same procedure for optogenetic mapping used in vitro was used in vivo. All data analysis was performed in MATLAB.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – review and editing, Conceptualization, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Berkeley.

First, lasers with lower cost or even LEDs can photostimulate opsins, but the maximum power is usually much lower than that of expensive 1P lasers. 3D-MAP distributes the total power from the laser across the whole FOV. To keep the same power density for efficient photostimulation, using a lower power laser will result in a smaller FOV for the same sample. Second, sCMOS cameras at lower price may have fewer pixels, higher readout noise, or slower frame rate, which will generate more noisy measurement of calcium signals. Third, a budget DMD has fewer pixels and slower pattern rate (but still above 1 kHz) than a high-performance DMD, and budget scanning mirrors have smaller size and scanning range. These factors will limit the total number of voxels, that is, the system will either have low resolution across a large accessible volume or high resolution across a small volume. Finally, the main factor affecting optical table cost will be the thickness of the table, given 3D-MAP is compact in lateral dimension.</p><table-wrap id="app1table3" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—table 3.</label><caption><title>Summary of experiment details.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Figure</th><th align="left" valign="top">Type</th><th align="left" valign="top">Sample</th><th align="left" valign="top">Label</th><th align="left" valign="top">DMD aperture size</th><th align="left" valign="top">Imaging parameters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></td><td align="left" valign="top">Widefield imaging with a sub-stage camera</td><td align="left" valign="top">Uniform fluorescent calibration slide</td><td align="left" valign="top">Fluorescence paint from Tamiya Color, mouse brain slices are label-free</td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>: 1 pixel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–J</xref>: 10 pixels</td><td align="left" valign="top">Capture one widefield image at each z-plane.

Compared with typical single photon approaches, this new technique is improved in 3D spatial resolution, simultaneous targeting numbers and pattern refresh rate, offering a simple and inexpensive alternative to two-photon optogenetics. Although this technique requires a certain level of expression sparsity especially in a scattering sample, its overall 3D stimulating throughput still makes it valuable in various applications.</p><p>Xue et al., also demonstrated the application of 3D-MAP in in vivo 3D optogenetic photostimulation and all-optical parallel interrogation of mouse brain with impressive results.

I do have a few suggestions that I think would enhance the clarity and strength of this paper.</p><p>1. The authors mentioned that they could unselect certain illumination angels of specific stimulated focus to avoid stimulating non-targeted areas. Is it calculated automatically with the current algorithm? When multiple rays for different foci make a cross section in the 3D space, do they get removed or not?</p><p>2. The authors compared different foci across the large FOV in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 based on the 25 foci located on an oblique plane (Figure 2D). It would be more reliable if the PSF is averaged from multiple measurements taken from randomly distributed foci across the entire FOV.</p><p>3. Is the same 10-pixel radius aperture on the DMD used for all the experiment with mouse brain tissue later? Is the PSF improved in scattering tissue when using a smaller radius?</p><p>4. The authors performed the all-optical interrogation experiment in vivo in L2/3 neurons that are 200μm-300μm deep in the intact mouse brain, yet they only measured the optical PSF under the brain slice up to 150μm. Similarly, the PPSF measurement in Figure 3 only shows the results &quot;in the upper 100μm of the brain&quot;. Since the resolution in Z degraded dramatically with blue light stimulation, it would be better to add the measurement of thicker brain tissue to mimic the in vivo experiment condition in L2/3. Besides, the all optical 3D PPSF under 200μm (Figure 6E) shows a similar axial FWHM compared with the electrophysiology PPSF in the upper 100μm brain (Figure 3I) as well as the optical PSF in under 100μm brain slice (Figure 2H). This is a bit confusing and could be a bit misleading. Please explain further taking the optical PSF, the nonlinear effect of opsin and calcium indicator sensitivity and the imaging system performance into consideration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper proposes a low-cost approach to perform simultaneous calcium imaging recordings and photostimulation of neuronal ensembles. The study of the causal relation between the activity of identified groups of neurons and their behavioral output is a topic of broad interest for the neuroscience community. Recently it has been shown in different brain areas that the identification and further manipulation of neuronal ensembles related to a behavioral task could be achieved using two-photon microscopy. This paper proposes a one photon tool to eventually facilitate the use of all-optical interrogation of neuronal circuits and behavior. However, the main limitations of the system showed in this paper are the necessity of sparse expression of opsins and the spatial resolution that comprises volumes bigger than the somatic region of individual neurons.</p><p>The authors suggest that the proposed 1P system could be used instead of 2P systems but according to the experimental results, this is only valid for a very narrow set of experiments that involve the sparse expression of opsins.</p><p>1. To clearly show the ability of the system to perform simultaneous calcium imaging and photostimulation the authors should show raw calcium transients of photostimulated and non-photostimulated neurons at different trials, as well as a plot showing calcium transients of non-stimulated neurons that express the opsin as a function of the distance between photostimulated neurons.</p><p>2. The manuscript mentioned the cost of budget and high performance realizations of the 1P system but a clear statement of the disadvantages of a budget system is lacking. It would be helpful to include a paragraph indicating what is missing in a budget 1P system compared to a high performance 1P system.</p><p>3. One of the main issues with all-optical interrogation of neural circuits and behavior is the lack of co-expression of opsins and calcium indicators. This is a crucial step since usually the targeted neurons are the ones that have activity in the behavioral task. However, the manuscript mentions that the system proposed is ideal for sparse expression of opsins, but the authors didn't mention the level of co-expression in their experiments. If the level of co-expression in a sparse labeling is low, then the system will not be ideal for the all-optical interrogation of neural circuits and behavior.</p><p>4. The main strength of the paper is the demonstration that the system could be used to map the influence of sparse neurons over a large volume onto a postsynaptic target. So, focusing the rationale, results and conclusions on those experiments could be a better strategy until the 1P system is refined to reach similar performance of a 2P system for broad expression of opsins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73266.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors nicely quantify the optical point spread function both on a fluorescent slide and, importantly, in brain slices and in vivo, and they do so for blue and red light – wavelengths that are suited for single photon optogenetics.

In Figure 4E and the corresponding traces in Figure 4F, the size of each cluster is about 30µm (2-4 pixels, 9µm/pixel), which reaches the limit of the spatial resolution shown in Figure 3A-B (lateral PPSF 29±0.8µm). therefore, we cannot distinguish whether the spatial cluster of candidate presynaptic input contains just a single presynaptic neuron. However, the fact that most of the postsynaptic responses from this cluster had very similar amplitudes and time courses suggest (but does not prove) that most of the responses were indeed due to a single primary source. We added this explanation in the revised manuscript (line 326-329) to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I didn't understand the approach in Figure 6.

Is there a great deal of cross talk in the excitation wavelengths?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. Even though jRCaMP1a is a red light calcium indicator, we noticed the blue light at 473nm can stimulate jRCaMP and result in an increase of fluorescence intensity. Such rise of fluorescence intensity is not due to calcium activity but to cross talk with the excitation wavelengths (the 1P absorption spectrum of jRCaMP1a is reported in the Response ref.1). Therefore, we choose to start imaging the jRCaMP1a after the CoChR stimulation. With this carefully calibrated system, we ensure that any detected rise of fluorescence intensity can be attributed to calcium activity, and not to any other artifacts (see the control experiment in Figure 6B). to clarify this point, we added this explanation in the revised manuscript in line 471-475.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors are very up front about the fact that this stimulation approach works best for very sparsely labeled neurons, this does limit the potential utility of the application.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the requirement of sparsity constrains the applications for our technology for precise ensemble stimulation. However, there are other applications that will not require sparse expression when absolute cellular specificity is not required. Numerous prior studies have used much coarser (non-3D) one-photon stimulation for mapping connectivity and for probing causal relationships between area and cell-type specific activity in behaviour. £d-MAP is preferable to these approached even with dense opsin expression because it still provides a significant leap in spatial resolution, but perhaps even more importantly, volumetric control.</p><p>With respect to precise ensemble stimulation, our manuscript mentions that 3D-MAP is not suitable for experiments that require photo-stimulation of precise ensembles within a small volume of densely labelled tissue, where 2Pphotostimulation is sufficient (line 652-655). Instead, our technology enables at the expense of a slightly lower spatial specificity the scalability that multiphoton techniques will never achieve because of fundamental tissue heating issues built into the low efficiency of nonlinear optical absorption. We indicate that loss of spatial specificity can be addressed either by leveraging sparser labelling (expressing the optogenetic modulator in a smaller number of randomly distributed neurons), or computationally, by targeting smaller patterns significantly faster that the response speed of opsins. We discuss the sparsity requirement in depth in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this is a well written paper that presents a full accounting of a new and potentially quite useful 3D stimulation approach.

We revised the code to add the capability of unselecting certain illumination angles to avoid stimulating non-targeted areas (see “3D-MAP simulation demo” in our github: https://github.com/Waller-Lab/3D-MAP) and mentioned this point in the revised manuscript (line 159-161). We simulated the cases with and without a non-targeted areas shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. The simulation generates two foci of different size, one above the native focal plane and the other one is below the focal plane. When there is no non-targeted area near the centre, the foci are synthesized by 10 illumination angles (Figure 1—figure supplement 21A-C); with a non-targeted area near the centre, one illumination angle of the focus near the non-targeted area is removed (pointed by the yellow arrow, Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>We can either remove rays or alternate illumination angles to avoid stimulation non-targeted areas. Here, we choose to remove rays simply by closing the DMD aperture at the desired location for the frame matched to any particular incident wave direction. Our algorithm first computes a fully populated 3D illumination, with in e ray for each available illumination angle. Then, we check whether the light intensity in the non-targeted areas is above a user-defined threshold. If so, we identify the rays that pass through this area and their corresponding DMD apertures, we then modify the DMD patterns to remove these apertures. All the other apertures remain in place (Figure 1—figure supplement 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The resolution of 3D-MAP will degrade when the focus is not paraxial. We added a statement in line 208-210 to clarify this point:</p><p>“This PSF is measured in the centre of the FOV and represents the best optical resolution of 3D-MAP, while the resolution will degrade when the focus is not paraxial.”</p><p>On the other hand, the 25 foci in Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 is merely chosen to show that we can generate multiple foci simultaneously in 3D, and allows us to quantitatively evaluate the change of the foci’s size in non-ideal conditions, when targets are away from the centre of the FOV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Is the same 10-pixel radius aperture on the DMD used for all the experiment with mouse brain tissue later? Is the PSF improved in scattering tissue when using a smaller radius?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. We used different radius apertures for different experiments, but all of them are equal or larger than 10 pixels. We need to find a balance between laser power, resolution, and scanning speed when we determine the radius of aperture. Since the maximum power density is determined by the lasers, for less sensitive opsin or less expression level, we use a larger aperture to make sure the total power is high enough to evoke photo-activity. The amount of light on any given target is quadratically proportional to the radius of the aperture. For very sensitive opsins, we used smaller apertures to improve the resolution. For course scanning over a large FOV, such as Figure 4C, using a large aperture with fewer scanning steps can quickly scan the entire FOV. If we could use lasers with higher power and more sensitive opsins, we could further reduce the radius of aperture and achieve higher spatial resolution especially in scattering tissues. We added the aperture size to the new Table 3 in the revised manuscript. We also mention this information in line 227-228.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors performed the all-optical interrogation experiment in vivo in L2/3 neurons that are 200μm-300μm deep in the intact mouse brain, yet they only measured the optical PSF under the brain slice up to 150μm. Similarly, the PPSF measurement in Figure 3 only shows the results &quot;in the upper 100μm of the brain&quot;. Since the resolution in Z degraded dramatically with blue light stimulation, it would be better to add the measurement of thicker brain tissue to mimic the in vivo experiment condition in L2/3. Besides, the all optical 3D PPSF under 200μm (Figure 6E) shows a similar axial FWHM compared with the electrophysiology PPSF in the upper 100μm brain (Figure 3I) as well as the optical PSF in under 100μm brain slice (Figure 2H). This is a bit confusing and could be a bit misleading. Please explain further taking the optical PSF, the nonlinear effect of opsin and calcium indicator sensitivity and the imaging system performance into consideration.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. We agree with the reviewer that the measured affective resolution (PPSF) will depend on multiple factors, and that the all-optical PPSF is complicated by sensitivity of the calcium sensor. Acquiring an electrophysical PPSP deeper than 100 microns in tissue is not feasible without 2p imaging. Since the 3D-MAP microscope only has wide-field (1p) imaging this was not possible, however we have added to the text that the electrophysiological PPSF in Figure 3A is a best-case scenario (line 290-292). The all-optical PPSF (PPSF<sub>o</sub>) in new Figure 7E may be similar to the ephys PPSF in Figure 3H-J, despite being 50-100 microns deeper, because jRCaMP1a probably cannot detect very low spike rates. We have also added this to the text in line 1276-1286.</p><p>More generally, the PSF is defined as the response of an imaging system to a point source. Here, we distinguish the optical PSF (PSF<sub>o</sub>), the physiological PSF (PPSF), and the all-optical PPSF (PPSF<sub>o</sub>) as impulse responses to three different systems (see figure 7—figure supplement 2). For example, the of PSF<sub>o</sub> is quantified by measuring the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM), but the light intensity at half maximum may not be enough to evoke photo-induced neural activity. Therefore, the size of the “effective focus” seen by opsin molecules may be smaller than the size of PSF<sub>o</sub>. The PPSF is also related to the fraction of opsin molecules that must be optically gated to drive the neuron to spike, which in turn depends on the opsin conductance, the total opsin expression levels, and the intrinsic excitability of the neuron. This is because the closer one is to saturate the opsin molecules on a given neuron to generate a spike, the broader the PPSF will be. Thus the PPSF evaluates a different system than the optical excitation path alone, On the other hand, PPSF<sub>o</sub> uses calcium indicators and optical detection path to measure neural activity, which evaluates the system consisting of optical excitation path, opsins, calcium indicators, and optical detection path. By comparing PSFs, one can understand how losses of spatial specificity are distributed between limitations of the optical system, optical scattering in tissue, uneven opsin distribution, and nonlinear biological response.</p><p>While we agree that adding the measurement of thicker brain tissue could provide more information of optical scattering, we are confident that the PSF<sub>o</sub> measured through a thicker sample won’t provide enough information to mimic the in vivo experiment condition in L2/3. The purpose of Figure 2E-J is to show how PSF<sub>o</sub> changes with different levels of scattering, rather than mimic in vivo experiment conditions. That is why we measure in vivo PPSF<sub>o</sub> as another system characteristic when we perform in vivo experiments in L2/3 (new Figure 7E).</p><p>To clarify this point, we added to the revised manuscript figure 7—figure supplement 2, as well as this discussion in line 1276-1286.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper proposes a low-cost approach to perform simultaneous calcium imaging recordings and photostimulation of neuronal ensembles.

We agree that much like many one-photon systems, 3D-MAP has lower spatial resolution and requires sparser expression than for 2P photo-stimulation to achieve comparable effective specificity, however, these limitations must be put in perspective with the benefits of scalability. 3D-MAP only needs about 100-fold less laser power for comparable stimulation patterns, and brain heating is much less of a concern, so the technique can be scales up to address more neurons in a larger brain area (line 641-649). Or manuscript highlights how 3D-MAP can enable experiments in conditions that are not suitable for 2P applications, and as such, should be considered, not as a replacement for 2P methods, but as a complimentary approach with a rather orthogonal set of benefits and drawbacks that can enable experiments where 2P technology is particularly unfit.</p><p>Specifically, the sparsity requirement can be satisfied either with sparse expression of the opsin, or, to a certain extent, with sparser photostimulation patterns. The first option is not a conceptual burden for many neuroscience experiments, in fact, the redundancy of the neural code, the hub-like structure of many neural circuits, and the ability of patterns to auto-complete through the network of many neural circuits, and the ability of patterns of activity to auto-complete through the network all allow neuroscientists to usefully and meaningfully address neural circuits even with sparse stimulation. Consider the remarkable results of Carillo-Reid et al., (Cell, 2019 ref. 13) where stimulation a very small population of neurons substantially alters the behaviour of the mouse. Although 2p activation was certainly advantageous, since photo-stimulating such small ensembles can drive major impacts on behaviour, it seems plausible that 3D-MAP, coupled with moderately sparse expression, could be used to execute similar experiments. For instance, even if opsin and calcium indicators were only expressed in ~25% of neurons, it should be possible to impact behaviour with 3D-MAP by identifying and stimulating these specific but highly important neurons. There will be fewer neurons to image/photo-stimulate compared to 2p imaging, but there should still be enough in many cases.</p><p>There are other recent 2p holographic studies that also used small numbers of neurons to impact behaviour, including Marshel et al., (ref 46), Dal Maschio et al., (response ref 2), Daie et al., (ref 15), and Gill et al., (ref 20). Although no doubt the higher spatial resolution of 2p optogenetics is useful, it is conceivable, if not likely, that with 3D-MAP and sparse expression (20-30% of cells) one could accomplish similar outcomes on behaviour in many useful applications. Given the much lower cost of 3D-MAP it could bring this type of important experiment into a much broader array of neuroscience labs around the world.</p><p>With the second option (sparser illumination), digitally sparsifying holograms by addressing subgroups of neurons, 3D-MAP operates as speeds that are significantly faster than the opsins response. Therefore, this approach should elicit the same response as parallel stimulation with little to no difference in action potential timing. Sparsity requirements are overall a manageable constraint more than a performance-limiting factor in many neuroscience applications. This point in clarified in line 622-634.</p><p>In terms of barriers to adoptability in the neuroscience community, 3D-MDP is nearly an order of magnitude less expensive to implement (supplement material – table 2). Therefore, even with the noticeable operational constraints and limitations detailed in our manuscript, our technology remains suitable to explore may applications in a cost-effective manner. We anticipate that many laboratories that already operate 2P systems will consider broadening their capabilities with 3D-MAP, and that many other laboratories that do not have the leverage to purchase 2P technology will consider our approach for a significantly similar price tag.</p><p>With regard to spatial resolution, there have been ample one-photon photo-stimulation studies (response ref 3-4) with far lower spatial resolution than 3D-MAP that still provided useful information about the underlying circuits or behaviour. Overall, we think one-photon photo-stimulation and two-photon photo-stimulation are orthogonal solutions that each have the capacity to respond to different experimental needs. Therefore, we think that even if 3D-MAP will only be a suitable replacement to a few applications where 2P technology is considered the gold standard, it will enable a broad range of new applications that even 2P technology is currently unable to address.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. To clearly show the ability of the system to perform simultaneous calcium imaging and photostimulation the authors should show raw calcium transients of photostimulated and non-photostimulated neurons at different trials, as well as a plot showing calcium transients of non-stimulated neurons that express the opsin as a function of the distance between photostimulated neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. We added a new plot to show calcium transients of Figure 6H (new Figure 7H) as the new Figure 7J.</p><p>We also added an example showing calcium transients of non-photostimulated neurons as a function of the distance to the photostimulation location as new Figure 7-sigure supplement 1I, in addition the Figure 7—figure supplement 1C. This result shows the calcium activity of a neuron expressing opsin located as x=0 while the light focus of 3D-MAP sweeps across it in a ±120µm range. We repeated this experiment in 10 L2/3 cells in vivo and the averaged result in the optical PPSF showing in new figure 7E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The manuscript mentioned the cost of budget and high performance realizations of the 1P system but a clear statement of the disadvantages of a budget system is lacking. It would be helpful to include a paragraph indicating what is missing in a budget 1P system compared to a high performance 1P system.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and we added the discussion under Table 2 that compares the cost of a budget system and a high-performance system. For 1P 3D-MAP, the budget system costs 23% of the high-performance system at an expense of performance. First, lasers with lower cost or even LEDs can photo-stimulate opsins, but the maximum power is usually much lower than that of expensive 1P lasers. 3D-MAP distributes the total power from the laser across the whole FOV. To keep the same power density for efficient phot-stimulation, using a lower power laser will result in a smaller FOV for the same sample. Second, sCMOS cameras at lower price may have fewer pixels, higher readout noise, or slower frame rate, which will generate more noisy measurement of calcium signals. Third, a budget DMD has fewer pixels and slower pattern rate (but still above 1 kHz) than a high performance DMD, and budget scanning mirrors have smaller aperture size and scanning range. These factors will limit the total number of accessible voxels, that it, the system will either have low resolution across a large volume or high resolution across a small volume. Finally, the main factor affecting optical table cost will be the thickness of the table, given 3D-MAP is compact in lateral dimension.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. One of the main issues with all-optical interrogation of neural circuits and behavior is the lack of co-expression of opsins and calcium indicators. This is a crucial step since usually the targeted neurons are the ones that have activity in the behavioral task. However, the manuscript mentions that the system proposed is ideal for sparse expression of opsins, but the authors didn't mention the level of co-expression in their experiments. If the level of co-expression in a sparse labeling is low, then the system will not be ideal for the all-optical interrogation of neural circuits and behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this point to out attention and we added quantitative analysis about the co-expression level to the revised manuscript (line 469-471). We co-expressed CoChR and jRCaMP1a in L2/3 neurons in figure 6. After analyzing a few image stacks, we find the number of neurons expressing CoChR is 114, the number of neurons expressing RCaMP1a is 99, and the number of neurons expressing both is 54. Therefore, the co-expression level is about 50%. We made our best effort to quantify the degree of overlap, although this is likely and underestimate as cells expressing jRCaMP but never firing might not show up as detectably red. Of course, another strategy to ensure 100% co-expression would be to generate a signal bi-cistronic construct co-expressing jRcAMP and CoChR vis a ‘p2A’ signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The main strength of the paper is the demonstration that the system could be used to map the influence of sparse neurons over a large volume onto a postsynaptic target. So, focusing the rationale, results and conclusions on those experiments could be a better strategy until the 1P system is refined to reach similar performance of a 2P system for broad expression of opsins.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to emphasize the complementarity of the 3D-MAP and 2P photo-stimulation. High spatial resolution and low scattering are the advantages of 2P techniques, but heat and photodamage have already set a fundamental limit that prevents future application in which large populations of neurons must be simultaneously stimulated. Therefore, 2P photo-stimulation is suitable to target deep, but small and close-packed neurons. Conversely, 1P 3D-MAP uses 2-3 orders less leaser power and could potentially simultaneously stimulate 2-3 orders more neurons in a larger area than 2P techniques, but an expense of spatial resolution and penetration depth. Therefore, 3D-MAP is suitable to simultaneously stimulate a large group of neurons in a large volume. In addition, 3-D-MAP is almost one-order less expensive than 2P techniques, even with multiple lasers for a broad range of opsins from blue to red. So we think 3D-MAP could become a complementary technique to 2P techniques for broad applications that are inaccessible with 2P photo-stimulation.</p><p>References</p><p>M. Dal Maschio, J. C.
