several of homing receptors during infection. SMAD4 is part of the canonical signaling network used by members of the transforming growth factor family. For this study, genetically modified mice were used to determine how SMAD4 and TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) participate in transcriptional programming of pathogen-specific CTLs. We show that these molecules are essential components of opposing signaling mechanisms, and cooperatively regulate a collection of genes that determine whether specialized populations of pathogen-specific CTLs circulate around the body, or settle in peripheral tissues. TGFβ uses a canonical SMAD-dependent signaling pathway to downregulate Eomesodermin (EOMES), KLRG1, and CD62L, while CD103 is induced. Conversely, in vivo and in vitro data show that EOMES, KLRG1, CX<sub>3</sub>CR1, and CD62L are positively regulated via SMAD4, while CD103 and Hobit are downregulated. Intravascular staining also shows that signaling via SMAD4 promotes formation of long-lived terminally differentiated CTLs that localize in the vasculature. Our data show that inflammatory molecules play a key role in lineage determination of pathogen-specific CTLs, and use SMAD-dependent signaling to alter the expression levels of multiple homing receptors and transcription factors with known functions during memory formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytotoxic T lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>SMAD4</kwd><kwd>TGFβ</kwd><kwd>CD8 T cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>CD8 memory</kwd><kwd>CD8 T cells</kwd><kwd>respiratory virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Listeria monocytogenes</kwd><kwd>Influenza A virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI123864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaech</surname><given-names>Susan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002570</institution-id><institution>American association for Immunologists</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AAI Careers in Immunology Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cauley</surname><given-names>Linda S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017834</institution-id><institution>University of Connecticut Health Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>bridge funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cauley</surname><given-names>Linda S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pathogen-specific CTLs are programmed to provide customized responses against infection, by inflammatory molecules that promote localization in peripheral and lymphoid tissues using alternative signaling mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) make important contributions to protective immunity by eliminating cells that contain intracellular pathogens, however rapid mobilization to infected tissues is a decisive factor in immune control. Defining how activated CTLs differentiate into functionally specialized subsets of memory CD8 T cells is an important priority for vaccine development. Our study sheds new light on this important process by revealing how two intersecting signaling pathways control a major bifurcation in diffrentiation pathway of newly activated CTLs. Multiple subsets of CTLs can be distinguished using surface markers that influence their effector functions, survival properties, and capacity to localize in specific tissues. The major subsets include central memory CD8 T cells (T<sub>CM</sub>) that use the bloodstream to circulate through secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), as well as some effector memory CD8 T cells (T<sub>EM</sub>) and tissue resident memory CD8 T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) that distribute to peripheral tissues. Efforts to understand how this heterogeneity develops have inspired alternative models of CD8 T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Montacchiesi and Pace, 2021</xref>). Some studies suggest that antigen-specific CTLs follow a linear differentiation pathway by transitioning between subsets, while others favor a branching model of differentiation whereby multiple subsets of CTLs arise from pathways that diverge soon after antigen stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bannard et al., 2009</xref>). Although many studies show that environmental cues influence the transcriptional programs of pathogen-specific CTLs, the pathways that promote commitment to specific lineages are poorly defined. Our study focuses on a network of signaling pathways that are used by members of the transforming growth family (TGF). We show that two distinct signaling pathways influence the transcriptional programs of newly activated CTLs to provide customized responses during infections with different types of pathogens. The target genes are transcription factors and adhesion molecules that determine how CTLs distribute in different tissues.</p><p>Pathogen-specific CTLs express many homing receptors that are dynamically regulated during infection. Under resting conditions, SLOs are surveyed by naive CD8 T cells that search for antigen-presenting cells bearing pathogen-derived peptides. Circulating leukocytes enter resting lymph nodes from wide blood vessels known as high endothelial venules (HEVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mionnet et al., 2011</xref>). CD62L (L-selectin) is an adhesion molecule that interacts with carbohydrates expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steeber et al., 1998</xref>). Naive CD8 T cells leave the bloodstream after CD62L initiates an adhesion cascade that results in transendothelial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ding et al., 2000</xref>). Inside the lymph node, signals from antigen receptor and costimulatory molecules induce clonal expansion and CD62L is replaced with adhesion molecules that facilitate migration to the site of infection.</p><p>Cytokines that are released in infected tissues influence the transcriptional programs of activated CTLs. During the acute phase of infection, interleukin (IL)-12 works with other inflammatory molecules to promote formation of short-lived effector T cells (T<sub>EFF</sub>) that are primed for rapid effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chowdhury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keppler et al., 2012</xref>). Some pathogens elicit robust inflammatory responses and generate large populations of terminally differentiated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells that express killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Obar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plumlee et al., 2013</xref>), which is a membrane-bound adhesion molecule with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in the cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rosshart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tessmer et al., 2007</xref>). Although CTLs transiently express KLRG1 during antigen stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herndler-Brandstetter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joshi et al., 2007</xref>), stable expression identifies CTLs that do not convert to a conventional memory phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dominguez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plumlee et al., 2013</xref>). Most T<sub>EFF</sub> cells disappear as the infection resolves, leaving residual populations of memory CD8 T cells in the circulation and peripheral tissues. Intravascular (IV) staining shows that some surviving CTLs maintain KLRG1 expression inside the vasculature during the memory phase of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Similar populations of KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CTLs that were detected after infections with other pathogens are referred to as long-lived effector cells (LLECs), or terminal effector memory CD8 T cells (T<sub>TEM</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Renkema et al., 2020</xref>). As inflammation resolves CD62L is reexpressed on T<sub>CM</sub> cells, while CD69<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> cells remain in the infected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). How these subsets contribute to protective immunity varies according to the type of pathogen.</p><p>TGFβ is an immunosuppressive cytokine with multiple functions during CD8 T cell differentiation. Members of the TGF cytokine family elicit cellular responses via both canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Derynck and Budi, 2019</xref>). Canonical signals are mediated by a cascade of structurally related molecules known as small (Sma) and mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad)-related (SMAD) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Massagué, 2012</xref>). SMAD4 is an adaptor molecule that chaperones phosphorylated receptor-activated SMAD proteins (R-SMADs) into the nucleus to modulate gene expression. We previously used genetically modified mice to explore how pathogen-specific CTLs distribute in the lungs during infection with influenza A virus (IAV) and discovered that several adhesion molecules were regulated via the canonical SMAD signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Extensive phenotypic changes indicated that loss of signaling via SMAD4 caused defects during formation of T<sub>EFF</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). To further define that mechanism that was responsible for these changes, we used multiple strains of genetically modified mice to explore how the SMAD signaling network influences genetic programming of pathogen-specific CTLs during infection. Our data show that SMAD4 and TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) use alternative signaling mechanisms to alter the expression levels of the same genes in opposite directions. The target genes include the T-box transcription factor EOMES, which is normally expressed during formation of T<sub>CM</sub> cells and downregulated by TGFβ during T<sub>RM</sub> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Intlekofer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mackay et al., 2015</xref>). We show that during transcriptional programming of newly activated CTLs, SMAD4 positively regulates EOMES expression and induces phenotypic changes that indicate progression toward a central memory phenotype, while formation of T<sub>RM</sub> cells is inhibited.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SMAD4 modifies homing-receptor expression in the absence of TGFβ</title><p>Several groups have used Cre-lox recombination to prevent expression of either SMAD4 (S4KO) or TGFβ receptor II (TR2KO) in peripheral CD8 T cells and found altered homing-receptor expression on antigen-experienced CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Igalouzene et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang and Bevan, 2013</xref>). For these studies, different promoters were used to induce gene ablation which may account for some variations between the results. CD4-Cre, CD8-Cre, and the proximal Lck promoter (dLck-Cre) are all expressed during early stages of thymic development. When these promoters were to prevent SMAD4 expression in peripheral CD8 T cells, investigators reported modified effector responses after T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2002</xref>). Since our goal was to avoid altering naive CD8 T cells during thymic development, we used the distal Lck promoter (dLck) to prevent SMAD4 expression. When we analyzed pathogen-specific CTLs during IAV infection, very few SMAD4-deficient CTLs expressed KLRG1 or CD62L, while abnormal CD103 expression was detected on CTLs in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). These changes were unexpected, as CTLs displayed a reciprocal phenotype after the TGFβ receptor was ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). We found that the mutation primarily influenced homing-receptor expression, since SMAD4-deficient CTLs proliferated and expressed IFNγ and TNFα at similar levels as wildtype CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>SMAD4 and TGFβRII are components of an interconnected signaling network. To further understand how these molecules control homing-receptor expression, we intercrossed S4KO and TR2KO mice to produce CTLs with both mutations (S4TR2-DKO). The mice were further crossed with OTI mice that express a transgenic antigen receptor that is specific for a peptide (SIINFEKL) derived from chicken ovalbumin (OVA) presented on H-2K<sup>b</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hogquist et al., 1994</xref>). To analyze homing-receptor expression during infection, the mice were infected with recombinant pathogens (X31-OVA and LM-OVA) that express the SIINFEKL peptide derived from chicken OVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jenkins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pope et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>For this study, two pathogens were used to compare homing-receptor expression under different inflammatory conditions. To elicit a mild inflammatory response in the lungs, mice were infected with IAV (X31-OVA) as neuraminidase activates TGFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schultz-Cherry and Hinshaw, 1996</xref>). Other mice were infected with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (LM) to elicit an inflammatory response that supports formation of CTLs that express KLRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plumlee et al., 2015</xref>). To monitor changes in homing-receptor expression during infection, congenically marked OTI-Ctrl (lack Cre), OTI-TR2KO; OTI-S4KO and OTI-S4TR2DKO cells were transferred to B6 mice 48 hr before infection. On different days post infection (dpi), donor cells in the lungs and spleens were analyzed for CD103, KLRG1, and CD62L expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Statistical comparisons are shown in the supplementary data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Prior studies show that KLRG1 is negatively regulated by TGFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanjabi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwartzkopff et al., 2015</xref>). Since latent-TGFβ can be activated by viral neuraminidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schultz-Cherry and Hinshaw, 1996</xref>), only small numbers of OTI-TR2Ctrl cells expressed KLRG1 after IAV infection, whereas most OTI-TR2KO cells expressed KLRG1 at high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, there was little difference between percentages OTI-TR2Ctrl and OTI-TR2KO that expressed KLRG1 during the early stages of infection with LM-OVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating minimal influence of TGFβ during bacterial infection. As the infection progressed, some OTI-TR2KO cells reexpressed CD62L indicating conversion to T<sub>CM</sub> phenotype. The OTI-S4KO cells mostly lacked KLRG1 and CD62L expression after infection with both pathogens, indicating a defect during formation of T<sub>EFF</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). The OTI-S4KO and OTI-S4TR2-DKO cells expressed KLRG1 and CD62L at similar levels, whereas the increase in CD103 expression was slightly more pronounced on S4KO cells than OTI-S4TR2-DKO cells. p values are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. These data are consistent with other studies and show that SMAD4 regulates activated CTLs via a TGFβ-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Igalouzene et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). We also compared cell proliferation during IAV infection using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The data show that OTI-S4TR2DKO and OTI-S4TR2Ctrl cells proliferated at similar rates, indicating normal T cell priming.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SMAD4 ablation alters homing-receptor expression without transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptor II.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Naive donor cells from OTI-Ctrl, OTI-TR2KO, OTI-S4KO, and OTI-S4TR2-DKO were transferred to B6 mice before infection.

In contrast, S23DKO and TR2KO cells both lacked CD103 expression under all conditions analyzed, whereas S4KO, S4TR2KO, and S34KO cells expressed CD103 at intermediate levels. Sloan Kettering Institute (SKI) protein is a nuclear proto-oncogene that inhibits TGFβ signaling through interactions with SMAD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 1999</xref>).

Conversely, CD103 expression did not change when S34KO and S4TR2-DKO cells were stimulated with TGFβ. These data show that R-SMAD2/3 are required for TGFβ to upregulate CD103 in the absence of SMAD4. When R-SMAD2 is absent, R-SMAD3 cooperates with SMAD4 to upregulate CD103 expression.

TR2KO and S23KO cells expressed CD62L at high levels under all conditions analyzed.

Large percentages of CTLs expressed KLRG1 (80–90%) in the absence of R-SMAD2/3 (S23DKO), or a functional TGFβ receptor (TR2KO and ALK5KO), confirming that expression was repressed by TGFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanjabi et al., 2009</xref>).

The phenotypic changes in S34DKO cells were slightly less pronounced. The reason for this is unclear, but may reflect the influence of a feedback mechanism.

Conversely, ES4KO cells expressed CD103 at high levels under all conditions analyzed. These data show that the <italic>Itgae</italic> gene was repressed by two different mechanisms. In wildtype mice, CD62L is present on naive CD8 T cells, then downregulated during T<sub>EFF</sub> formation and reexpressed on T<sub>CM</sub> cells. We analyzed naive CD8 T cells before activation and found similar levels of CD62L expression in each group of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The control CTLs downregulated CD62L at 48 hr after TcR stimulation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), while a majority CTLs reexpressed CD62L during culture with rIL-2. When cultured cells were stimulated with cytokines, the percentages of control CTLs that expressed CD62L increased when the ALK5 inhibitor was present and decreased when TGFβ was used. In contrast, only 50% of S4KO and ES4KO cells expressed CD62L under all conditions analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These data confirmed that antigen-experienced CTLs downregulate CD62L in response to TGFβ, and that SMAD4 is required for CTLs to reexpress CD62L during memory formation.</p><p>To compare homing-receptor expression in vivo, we infected S4KO, EKO, and ES4KO mice (plus littermate controls) with X31-OVA and analyzed CTLs at 30 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Anti-CD8 antibodies were given by i.v. injection 3 min before sacrifice. OVA-specific CTLs were analyzed using MHCI tetramers. The lungs and draining lymph nodes (MLN) from each group of mice contained some CD103<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> cells. Abnormal CD103 expression was detected on OVA-specific CTLs in the spleens of S4KO and ES4KO mice. Approximately 50% of OVA-specific CTLs in the ILNs from control mice expressed CD62L, indicating the presence of T<sub>CM</sub> cells. Smaller percentages of OVA-specific CTLs expressed CD62L in the ILNs of S4KO, EKO, and ES4KO mice (17–22%), supporting the idea that signaling via SMAD4 promotes formation of T<sub>CM</sub> cells.</p><p>We next explored whether ectopic EOMES expression altered the phenotype of S4KO cells. A murine stem cell virus (MSCV) vector that encodes green fluorescent protein (MSCV)-IRES-GFP (pMIG) was used to overexpress EOMES in antigen-experienced CTLs in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The pMIG vector has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pearce et al., 2003</xref>). Naive S4KO and EKO cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 and rIL-2 (48 hr), then transduced with either EOMES-IRES-GFP, or empty vector control (EV-IRES-GFP). At 96 hr after TcR stimulation, the GFP<sup>+</sup> CTLs were analyzed for CD103 expression by flow cytometry. EKO cells were used to verify that the RV-EOMES-GFP vector was functional (overlaid histograms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). When EOMES was expressed ectopically, smaller percentages of S4KO and S4Ctrl cells expressed CD103, while the percentages of CD62L<sup>+</sup> CTLs increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in lungs expressed CD103 at reduced levels after transduction with the EOMES-IRES-GFP vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These experiments show that ectopic EOMES expression partially restored the phenotype of S4KO cells, and induced a shift toward a central memory phenotype. We also used the (MSCV)-IRES-GFP (pMIG) vector to express SMAD4 ectopically and also observed a shift toward a T<sub>CM</sub> phenotype in S4KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Different approaches have been used to determine how specialized subsets of pathogen-specific CTLs acquire heritable traits. Several lines of evidence indicate that naive CD8 T cells are not a uniform cell population. Early studies used limiting-dilution assays and fate-mapping experiments to show that naive CD8 T cells give rise to mixed populations of T<sub>EFF</sub> and memory CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plumlee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stemberger et al., 2007</xref>). Others found unequal inheritance of genetic markers during T<sub>EFF</sub> formation, indicating that T<sub>EFF</sub> and memory CD8 T cells are products of asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollizzi et al., 2016</xref>). Other studies indicate that the differentiation program for memory CD8 T cells begins soon after antigen stimulation, as the IL-7 receptor (CD127) is expressed CTLs that are predisposed toward memory formation and absent from T<sub>EFF</sub> cells that express KLRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaech et al., 2003</xref>). Transcriptome analysis also revealed the presence of T<sub>RM</sub> precursors in a pool of circulating T<sub>EFF</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kok et al., 2020</xref>). Other data indicate that programming occurs at an early stage of diffrentiation, since migratory DCs that activate TGFβ can precondition naive CD8 T cells to become T<sub>RM</sub> cells that localize in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mani et al., 2019</xref>). Although many studies support diverging differentiation pathways, the question of whether specialized traits are genetically programmed, or induced by external stimuli has not been resolved. In an attempt to address this question, investigators used transfer experiments to track clonal populations of antigen-specific CD8 T cells during infections with different type of pathogens. The study showed that the population dynamics reflected the inflammatory environment that developed during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plumlee et al., 2013</xref>). Large numbers of T<sub>EFF</sub> cells expressed KLRG1 during infection with LM, while this marker was less prevalent during infection with <italic>Vesicular Stomatitis Virus</italic>. Our study builds on this observation by revealing the requirement for SMAD-dependent sugnling pathways during fate-determination of pathogen-specific CTLs.</p><p>Several cytokines are known to influence the ‘fate decisions’ of newly activated CTLs, including IL-12 which supports T<sub>EFF</sub> formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mescher et al., 2006</xref>), whereas TGFβ has anti-inflammatory properties and encourages T<sub>RM</sub> cells to settle in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skon et al., 2013</xref>). Several studies show that signaling via SMAD4 is required for formation of T<sub>EFF</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> cells, whereas TGFβ creates a bias toward T<sub>RM</sub> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mackay et al., 2015</xref>). Our current study extends this work by showing that SMAD4 and TGFβ are essential components of two distinct signaling pathways that guide the fate decisions of newly activated CTLs using alternative genetic programs. Importantly, these opposing pathways control a key bifurcation in the differentiation pathway of antiviral CTLs, by regulating the same genes in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We show that SMAD4 upregulates genes that are highly expressed in CTLs in the circulation, including EOMES, KLRG1, and CD62L. The same genes are downregulated by TGFβ as T<sub>RM</sub> cells settle in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mackay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanjabi et al., 2009</xref>). There is evidence that cell-state impacts susceptibility to TGFβ, since we previously found that T<sub>CM</sub> cells did not upregulate CD103 during stimulation with TGFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suarez-Ramirez et al., 2019</xref>) and our current study shows that KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CTLs maintain EOMES expression in the presence of TGFβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Although studies show that SMAD4 acts independently of TGFβ to support commitment to T<sub>EFF</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> lineages, further work is required to determine whether SMAD4-dependent epigenetic modifications are required for CTLs to become terminally differentiated.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Genes that are cooperatively regulated by SMAD4 and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ).</title><p>Diagram shows reciprocal changes in gene expression as CTLs are modified via SMAD-dependent signaling pathways.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76457-fig6-v3.tif"/></fig><p>SMAD proteins modulate gene expression through interactions with numerous transcription factors, including the protooncogene SKI and forms heterodimers that repress the <italic>Itgae</italic> gene (CD103) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Our data show that CD103 is also downregulated via SMAD4-dependent induction of EOMES.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;SMAD4 and TGFβ are architects of inverse genetic programs during fate-determination of antiviral memory CD8 T cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the authors are commended for their presentation of a rather extensive body of well performed experiments concerning reciprocal regulation of memory CD8 T cell development by SMAD4 and TGFbeta. Although most of the results support their conclusions, there is a critical absence of results from in vivo experiments that would yield results validating the in vitro observations. A potential impact of the different KO strains on naive T cell biology also needs to be investigated to obviate any possible bias towards differentiation of circulating Trm cells. While the gene expression regulation is of interest, the functional consequences of the regulation remain uncertain. For those reason, the current work has been considered as preliminary and it would require a serious effort (additional experiments) for it to be deemed meritorious for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. As the authors found SAMD4 regulated CD103 expression, and controlled the Trm/Tcm cells differentiation, was there any difference of Smad4 expression in the Tcm, CD69+CD103+ Trm, and CD69+CD103- Trm?</p><p>2. For most of times, the authors only showed percentage data, please include the cell number/magnitude of responses as well.</p><p>3. The author should clarify if the CD8 T cells in Figure 1 were tissue resident distinguished with i.v. antibody injection, for the mixed circulating and resident CD8 T cells may not be completely distinguished with surface marker expression levels.</p><p>4. The authors suggested that Smad4 altered homing receptor expression via a TGFb independent pathways by Figure 1A, however, I noticed that the DKO cells showed ameliorated features compared with the S4KO cells, and Figure 3 also suggested that TGFb signaling was involved in the phenotypes of S4KO cells.</p><p>5. Did the S4KO affect the effector function of CD8 T cells?</p><p>6. In the Figure 2F and 2G, the authors claimed that the EOMES expression downregulated in both spleen and lung, but T-bet rarely changed; however, I found the T-bet expression changed significantly in the lung, but EOMES didn't show much difference in the lung.</p><p>7. SMAD2/3 are the downstream of TGFbR2, however, in the Figure 3C, why S4TR2 DKO cells showed different features with S34 DKO?</p><p>8. Figure 3C and 3D showed the canonical TGFb pathways and SMAD4 cooperatively regulated CD103, was Eomes be regulated in the same way?</p><p>9. I suggest the authors to examine the effects of SMAD4 expression in CD8 T cells to provide the gain-of-function data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The work is nicely performed. Enthusiasm is dampened by the high number of studies that are performed in vitro. For instance, T cells transduced with LV overexpressing transcription factors (e.g. Eomes) could be transferred and tracked in vivo.</p><p>There is a major concern on the impact of the different KO strains on naive T cell biology, i.e., whether the naive cells are impacted compared to control cells, for instance if they are already biased towards differentiation to circulating of Trm cells. More investigation in this regard (flow cytometry of several molecules, especially activation, or RNA seq) would be appreciated. Has TGFbRII KO an impact (e.g., autoimmunite traits) on the function of peripheral T cells?</p><p>Bar graphs should show values referred to single animals, not aggregate data, so to appreciate variability</p><p>Flow cytometry plots should have scales, so to check if gates are the same (for instance, it seems that different gates were used to define positive expression od CD103 in Figure 5B).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The introduction summarizes a wide range of information, but does not appear to contain a specific research question or goal.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. As the authors found SAMD4 regulated CD103 expression, and controlled the Trm/Tcm cells differentiation, was there any difference of Smad4 expression in the Tcm, CD69+CD103+ Trm, and CD69+CD103- Trm?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we used qPCR to compare SMAD4 expression in T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>RM</sub> cells (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1) and did not find a major difference in SMAD4 expression in these subsets. When other groups compared the transcriptional profiles of different subsets of pathogen-specific CTLs by RNA-sequencing, SMAD4 was not included on the list of differentially-expressed genes. Since SMAD4 chaperones phosphorylated RSMADs into the nucleus, dynamic changes in protein expression are not required to modify gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The author should clarify if the CD8 T cells in Figure 1 were tissue resident distinguished with i.v. antibody injection,</p></disp-quote><p>We did not use IV staining for the phenotypic analyses (Figures1A and 1B), however we used this technique to show that signaling via SMAD4 increases the numbers terminally-differentiated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells that express KLRG1 and CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 in the vasculature (Figure 1C). The text and figure legends have been modified accordingly. P values for Figure 1 are shown in supplementary File 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors suggested that Smad4 altered homing receptor expression via a TGFb independent pathways by Figure 1A, however, I noticed that the DKO cells showed ameliorated features compared with the S4KO cells, and Figure 3 also suggested that TGFb signaling was involved in the phenotypes of S4KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This observation is correct. Our data show that TGFb collaborates with SMAD3 to induce CD103 expression in the absence of SMAD4 (Figure 2A). Consistently, SMAD4-deficient CTLs expressed CD103 at higher levels than S4TR2KO cells in vivo (Figure 1A) and CD103 expression on S4KO cells increased during in vitro stimulation with TGFb (Figure 3E). The text has been modified to further emphasize this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Did the S4KO affect the effector function of CD8 T cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the distal Lck promoter to prevent SMAD4 expression in peripheral CD8 T cells. In a prior study, we showed that SMAD4-deficient CTLs proliferated and expressed IFNγ and TNFa at similar levels as wildtype cells (Hu et al., 2015). In contrast, others reported an altered cytokine response after SMAD4 was ablated using the proximal Lck promoter (Cao <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015). This discrepancy may reflect a loss of signaling via SMAD4 during thymic development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In the Figure 2F and 2G, the authors claimed that the EOMES expression downregulated in both spleen and lung, but T-bet rarely changed; however, I found the T-bet expression changed significantly in the lung, but EOMES didn't show much difference in the lung.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that EOMES is negatively-regulated by TGFb (Figure 4A in vitro and 4B in vivo). Since TGFb can be activated by viral neuraminidase, EOMES was expressed at low levels during IAV infection (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). To minimize the influence of virally-induced TGFb, we performed similar experiments with LMOVA (Figures4B and 4C). The revised figure shows that CTLs express EOMES at reduced levels after SMAD4ablation (Figure 4C). Since we did not find a difference in T-bet expression by RNA-sequencing, the data have been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. SMAD2/3 are the downstream of TGFbR2, however, in the Figure 3C, why S4TR2 DKO cells showed different features with S34 DKO?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that S4TR2DKO and S34DKO cells express CD103 at higher levels than the controls (Figure 2A). Although both changes are statistically significant, the difference in CD103 expression is more pronounced in S4TR2DKO than S34DKO cells. We obtained similar results when CTLs were analyzed in vivo (Figure 2D). Several mechanisms could account for this difference including a feedback mechanism, or alternative TGFb receptor.</p><p>The difference was limited to CD103 expression, since S4TR2DKO and S34DKO cells expressed CD62L and KLRG1 at similar levels (Figure 2B and 2C). This point is discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 3C and 3D showed the canonical TGFb pathways and SMAD4 cooperatively regulated CD103, was Eomes be regulated in the same way?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this question is correct. qPCR (Figure 4A) and flow cytometry (Figures4B and 4C) data both show that EOMES is down-regulated by TGFb and induced via SMAD4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. I suggest the authors to examine the effects of SMAD4 expression in CD8 T cells to provide the gain-of-function data.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended, we used a retroviral vector to re-express SMAD4 in S4KO cells. CD103 expression decreased by approximately 50% when CTLs were analyzed after 6 days in culture (Figure 5 —figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The work is nicely performed. Enthusiasm is dampened by the high number of studies that are performed in vitro. For instance, T cells transduced with LV overexpressing transcription factors (e.g. Eomes) could be transferred and tracked in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>For this study, a reductionist approach was used to reduce the numbers of variables that influence data interpretation. As requested, we provide new experiments showing CTLs analyzed in vivo (Figures 1B, 1C, 1D, 2C, 2D, 4F, 5D, Figure 1 —figure supplement 4, Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). The additional data include phenotypic analysis of OTI-S4KO cells analyzed after ectopic EOMES expression (Figure 5D). As expected, CD103 expression decreased after ectopic EOMES expression, which is consistent with our in vitro data (Figure 5E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a major concern on the impact of the different KO strains on naive T cell biology, i.e., whether the naive cells are impacted compared to control cells, for instance if they are already biased towards differentiation to circulating of Trm cells. More investigation in this regard (flow cytometry of several molecules, especially activation, or RNA seq) would be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the distal Lck promoter to induce gene-ablation at late stage of thymic development and found no evidence of defects during T cell priming. Our prior study shows that SMAD4-deficient CTLs proliferate and express IFNγ and TNFa at similar levels as wildtype cells (Hu et al., 2015). To further address this concern, we provide new data showing that OTI-STDKO and OTI-Ctrl cells proliferate at similar rates during IAV infection (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). We also analyzed pathogen-specific CTLs during infection with LM-OVA (in vivo<italic>)</italic> using MHCI tetramers (Figure 2C and 2D). The data show that CTLs in S2KO and 3KO mice display a normal phenotype, whereas S23KO and ALK5KO cells resemble TR2Kos. These data support our conclusion that SMAD4 and TGFb alter homing-receptor expression via two independent signaling pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Has TGFbRII KO an impact (e.g., autoimmunite traits) on the function of peripheral T cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This question was addressed previously, using two different promoters to prevent TGFbRII expression (Zhang <italic>et al.,</italic> Nat Immol 2012). When CD4-Cre was used for gene-ablation, spontaneous T cell activation caused fatal autoimmune disease within 3-5 weeks. Conversely, after the distal Lck-Cre promoter was used to prevent TGFbRII expression the mice did not develop autoimmune disease before the experiment was terminated at 18 weeks after birth. These data show that early gene-ablation impacts thymic development. Others recently found that autoimmune disease did not develop when CD4-Cre was used to produce CTLs with dual mutations (lacked both TGFbRII and SMAD4) Igalouzene <italic>et al.,</italic> (2022). Since SMAD4 and TGFb support normal thymic development, these studies underscore the importance using the distal Lck-Cre promoter to study peripheral CD8 T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Bar graphs should show values referred to single animals, not aggregate data, so to appreciate variability</p></disp-quote><p>For this study we used P values and error bars representing SD to illustrate variability between samples. New data shown Figures2C and 2D are presented as scatter plots, with p values and SD as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Flow cytometry plots should have scales, so to check if gates are the same (for instance, it seems that different gates were used to define positive expression od CD103 in Figure 5B).</p></disp-quote><p>The contour plots have been revised as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The introduction summarizes a wide range of information, but does not appear to contain a specific research question or goal.
