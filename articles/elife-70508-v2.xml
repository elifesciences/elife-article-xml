evolution. Scorpionflies (Insecta: Mecoptera) are models in sexual conflict research due to their large variety of mating practices, including coercive behaviour and nuptial gift provisioning. However, the role of palaeontology in sexual conflict studies remains negligible, namely due to the paucity of well-preserved fossils. Here, we describe three male scorpionflies from Cretaceous and Eocene ambers. The structure of notal and postnotal organs is analysed in extant and extinct forms; a depression below the base of the notal organ in different panorpid species spatially matches the anterior fold of the female’s wing. Based on disparate abdominal configurations and correlations in extant relatives, we posit that each new fossil taxon had a different mating approach along a nuptial gifting-coercive spectrum. The Eocene specimen possesses extreme female clamping abdominal armature, suggesting a degree of sexual coercion greater than in any other known scorpionfly, extinct or extant. The fossil record of abdominal modifications in male scorpionflies documents a relatively late evolution (Eocene) of long notal organs indicating oppressive behaviour toward a female during mating. Our findings reveal a wider array of mating-related morphological specialisations among extinct Panorpoidea, likely reflecting more diversified past mating strategies and behaviours in this group, and represent first steps towards gaining a deep-time perspective on the evolution of sexual conflict over mating among insects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mating strategies</kwd><kwd>coercive copulation</kwd><kwd>amber</kwd><kwd>Mecoptera</kwd><kwd>Cretaceous</kwd><kwd>Eocene</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004442</institution-id><institution>National Science Centre, Poland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013/09/B/NZ8/03270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soszyńska-Maj</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name><name><surname>Kopeć</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name><name><surname>Krzemiński</surname><given-names>Wiesław</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004442</institution-id><institution>National Science Centre, Poland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016/23/B/NZ8/00936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soszyńska-Maj</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name><name><surname>Krzemińska</surname><given-names>Ewa</given-names></name><name><surname>Skibińska</surname><given-names>Kornelia</given-names></name><name><surname>Kopeć</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name><name><surname>Krzemiński</surname><given-names>Wiesław</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AEI/FEDER, UE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CGL2017-84419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pérez-de la Fuente</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010617</institution-id><institution>Dali University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>High-level Talents KY2096124040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ji-Shen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004442</institution-id><institution>National Science Centre, Poland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018/31/B/NZ8/02113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szpila</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The fossil record of abdominal modifications in male scorpionflies documents a relatively late evolution of oppressive behaviour toward a female during mating and suggest degree of sexual coercion greater in Eocene than in any other known scorpionfly, extinct or extant.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual conflict between two conspecific sexes arises when divergent interests about the timing and duration of copulation, number of mating partners, or parental investment occur, provided that a trait enhancing the reproductive success (~fitness) of one sex may reduce that of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnqvist and Rowe, 2005</xref>). Currently more broadly defined as the sexually antagonistic selection of shared traits, the sexual conflict is now recognised as a “pervasive evolutionary selective force“, leading in many known instances to a male-female coevolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rostant et al., 2020</xref>). At the very core of this conflict lies the struggle for dominance over genetic control in offspring by each sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thornhill, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thornhill, 1979</xref>). The study of mating practices offers one of the most direct ways to address sexual conflict in nature. Two seemingly opposite (yet not necessarily mutually exclusive) mating-related strategies are observed in males: aggressive behaviour toward a female, which allows exerting domination while mating, and the nuptial gifting of food to allure and/or pacify a female during the time of copulation and sperm transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCartney et al., 2013</xref>). Both coercive and nuptial gifting strategies appear costly to males because they are based on the differential allocation of limited resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2015</xref>); therefore, an exaggerated armature may hinder the overall fitness in a male (e.g. in rhinoceros and flour beetles a larger ‘weapon’ is negatively correlated with wing size; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamane et al., 2010</xref>). In order to incline the female to mate, males show aggression (e.g. calopterygid damselflies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rivera and Andrés, 2002</xref>), intimidating behaviour (e.g. water striders; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han and Jablonski, 2010</xref>), and may use special structures, such as modified front legs to clasp the female wings (e.g. sepsid flies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eberhard, 2002</xref>) or adhesive discs to secure grip on the female (e.g. diving beetles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergsten et al., 2001</xref>). Within coercive mating, extreme cases of aggressive behavior by males, which may cause damage or even death to the female, are known among insects and other invertebrate groups, such as true bugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siva-Jothy, 2006</xref>), water bugs, and camel-spiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnqvist and Rowe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hrušková-Martišová et al., 2010</xref>) or snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimura and Chiba, 2015</xref>), but also among vertebrates (e.g. ducks; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennan and Prum, 2012</xref>). Nuptial gifting is also widespread. Crickets and bush crickets (Orthoptera: Tettigonidea, Grylloidea) provide an edible gift attached to a structure containing the sperms. Female consume the nutritious part during fertilisation by the spermatozoans, the time for consumption correlating with that of fertilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCartney et al., 2013</xref>). Males of other orthopterans offer thoracic secretions (Gryllidae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bussière et al., 2005</xref>) or even their own hind wings as nuptial gifts (Haglidae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eggert and Sakaluk, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sakaluk et al., 2004</xref>). Silk-wrapped nuptial gifts of prey are offered by spiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stålhandske, 2001</xref>) and dance flies (Diptera: Empididae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Preston-Mafham, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sadowski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lebas and Hockham, 2005</xref>); the shining silk cover makes a gift more enticing and may deceive the female if it only contains a scarce – or even fully absent – edible portion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghislandi et al., 2017</xref>). In dobson flies (Megaloptera: Corydalidae), the species offering nuptial gifts have a ‘weapon’ armature used for fighting off the rivals smaller than in species whose males rely only (or mostly) on such armature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Among mecopterans, a gift of prey is offered by hangingflies (Bittacidae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thornhill, 1976</xref>) and scorpionflies (<italic>Panorpa</italic> spp.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gwynne, 1984</xref>); the latter may offer hardened salivary masses to the female instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thornhill, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bockwinkel and Sauer, 1994</xref>). Coercive and nuptial-gifting mating approaches can co-occur in same species, which then exhibits a mixed strategy that can serve as a model to study the trade-off between these two tactics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong and Hua, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Scorpionflies (Mecoptera: Panorpidae) are models in sexual conflict research. Their mating practices range from coercive to provisioning nuptial gifts, in extreme cases including mouth-to-mouth salivary transfer until the end of copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhong et al., 2015</xref>). Mecoptera are among the oldest holometabolous insects. They are known since the Permian, when they were a significant component of the flying insect fauna. Whereas scorpionflies flourished in the Mesozoic, most of their lineages rapidly declined during the Cenozoic. In fact, mecopterans are considered to have gone through a degree of extinction unparalleled among holometabolans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimaldi and Engel, 2005</xref>). Extant Mecoptera are classified in nine families, most of which are relict; only two lineages, Panorpidae and Bittacidae, are relatively species-rich. The Panorpidae appeared in the Late Jurassic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2014</xref>) and currently represent the most diverse mecopteran lineage, with about 480 described species classified in seven genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bicha, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 2019</xref>), that is, c. 67% of extant mecopteran species.</p><p>In scorpionfies, the male behaviour towards the female may be coercive in such a degree that the expression ‘rape’ has been used in the past for describing their mating rituals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thornhill, 1980</xref>). In any case, the role of a female in controlling mating and the eventual reproductive outcome appears more active and decisive than initially thought in the group, namely through precopulatory male choice, struggling behaviour to interrupt genital connection, and the selective reception of sperm from gift-providing males (likely through spermathecal muscular action; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kock et al., 2009</xref>). The modifications of panorpid males enabling coercive mating behaviour include a diverse array of structures on different abdominal segments as well as thinned and elongate last segments of the abdomen. Some of these structures, the so-called notal and postnotal organs, effectively act as a ‘clamp’, grasping the female’s wing prior to and during the course of copulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, F</xref>). Depending on the size and shape of these organs in a species, the grasp is more or less coercive. Elongate abdominal segments enable the males to bend the abdomen over that of the female, while additional, usually paired abdominal structures referred to as anal horns are used to achieve and maintain the strained, twisted copulatory position of both abdomens for the long time required for sperm transmission, which could be more than 3 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong and Hua, 2019</xref>). Panorpid species with very long notal organs, capable of clamping the entire width of the female wing, only use coercion, so no food gifts are offered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong and Hua, 2019</xref>). In species with mixed strategies, it is the physical condition of the male which determines the followed strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engqvist and Sauer, 2001</xref>): older and weaker males, as well as smaller ones, primarily adopt an aggressive strategy toward a female, as they are either not able to obtain a prey as a gift or to fabricate it through salivary production, or their gift is often been stolen by a stronger male. Larger males also have an advantage over smaller ones when competing for dead arthropods that can be offered to a female or, if eaten by the male, allow to produce salivary masses. On the other hand, conspecific smaller males bear proportionally larger notal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thornhill, 1990</xref>), which shows the genetic background of this negative allometry.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Baltipanorpa oppressiva</italic> sp. nov.

These structures ensure the eventual genital connection and sperm transfer and extend copulation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhong and Hua, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>). The latter is critical for males, as the more prolonged the copulation, the more sperm can be transferred and, thus, the greater the number of potentially fertilised eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engqvist and Sauer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kullmann and Sauer, 2005</xref>). Aside from genital clamping structures (among which the most conspicuous is a pair of pincer-like gonostyli), panorpids present non-genital clamping systems on their abdomens. These are notal and postnotal organs, as well as anal horns which are used to catch and immobilize female during mating. Based on the size, shape and interlocking mechanism of these clamping structures, the grasp on the body of female becomes more or less secure, therefore facilitating a greater degree of coercion during mating, which has been associated with less investment in costly nuptial gifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong and Hua, 2019</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Notal and postnotal organs</title><p>The notal organ (NO) is a process on abdominal tergite III. The postnotal organ (PO) typically consists of a small process on abdominal tergite IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crampton, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mickoleit, 1971</xref>). In extant scorpionflies, both structures are present in most Panorpidae, the only recent species from the Eomeropidae (the ‘living fossil’ <italic>Notiothauma reedi</italic> MacLachlan, 1877 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacLachlan, 1877</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crampton, 1931</xref>]), and can be vestigial, if present, in the Panorpodidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Hua, 2018a</xref>). Both NOs and POs act jointly by typically creating a clamping structure that grasps the female forewing before and during copulation; in panorpids, these organs allow to achieve and maintain the typical V-shaped mating position (Figure 6A and B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byers and Thornhill, 1983</xref>). Moreover, the NO and the PO bear specialised setae, cephalically directed and thinned terminally, which interlace and/or electrostatically interact with both venational setae and membrane microtrichia from the female’s wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhong and Hua, 2013a</xref>). Observations on three species of <italic>Neopanorpa</italic> van der Weele, 1909 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van der Weele, 1909</xref>) bearing NOs of different lengths have shown different mating strategies in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhong and Hua, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong and Hua, 2019</xref>). Males of two species with short and medium-sized NO, i.e. <italic>N. lui</italic> Chou and Ran, 1981 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou et al., 1981</xref>) and <italic>N. carpenteri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng, 1957</xref>) indirectly transfer a nuptial gift of a salivary secretion prior to copulation. The short NO of <italic>N. lui</italic> ends at the base of the PO, and the medium sized NO in <italic>N. carpenteri</italic> reaches the end of the abdominal segment IV; both stabilize the female wings only partially and apparently play an auxiliary role during copulation. Contrarily, <italic>N. longiprocessa </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hua and Chou, 1997</xref>), with a long NO capable to cover the entire wing width of the female, exclusively relies on coercive copulation, and does not offer nuptial gifts. Short NOs and POs pinch only the anterior margin of female forewings, and both processes are spatially suited to fit the latter. In <italic>Panorpa amurensis</italic> MacLachlan, 1872 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacLachlan, 1872</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), the space created by the clasped NO and PO matches the space of the anterior valley fold of the female wing delimited by the convex costal vein (C), the concave subcostal vein (Sc), and the convex radial vein (R<sub>1</sub>), clamping together with the PO before or at the latter vein. Our measurements of these distances in this and other panorpid species with various NOs indicate that this seems to be an effective arrangement to grip the anterior wing fold of the female (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for measurements).

This species is currently classified in Orthophlebiidae, a Mesozoic polyphyletic panorpoid assemblage ancestral to Panorpidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soszyńska-Maj et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Burmorthophlebia multiprocessa</italic> gen. et sp. nov. the NO, although also short, differs from all the hitherto known in Mecoptera, extinct or extant. The NO is distinctly raised over abdomen but poorly pronounced, not reaching any process to form a clamp with. The PO is here replaced by two elevated areas on tergite IV, the postnotal areas 1 and 2 (PA1 and PA2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The former is mound-like, located after an anterior depression on tergite IV and at a distance from the NO comparable to that of C to R<sub>1</sub>. The PA2 is sharply elevated, and measurements show that it contacted the female wing just at or slightly beyond the concave radial sector vein (Rs). Both PAs were involved in adhering the female’s wing as indicated by their location and specialised setation, consisting of short and dense tufts of hairs different from other abdominal bristles. Apparently, only the costal vein and a brief anterior wing membrane portion were covered by the NO in <italic>B. multiprocessa</italic> gen. et sp. nov., and so the remaining portion of the female wing was to a certain degree immobilised by the setation of both PAs. Among the extant panorpids the hirsute PAs, more flattened than those of <italic>Burmorthophlebia</italic> gen. et sp. nov. and situated on three consecutive tergites, have been described in <italic>Neopanorpa setigera</italic> Wang and Hua, 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang and Hua, 2018b</xref>) and <italic>N. luojishana</italic> Wang and Hua, 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang and Hua, 2019b</xref>), and also exist in <italic>N. longistipitata</italic> Wang and Hua, 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang and Hua, 2018b</xref>). However, in these species the NO is long and able to keep the entire wing of a female pressed against the male’s abdomen to a lesser or greater extent, so the hirsute PAs are probably only of auxiliary importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). This contrasts with the armature in <italic>B. multiprocessa</italic> gen. et sp. nov., where it was the interaction between NO-PO setae and the integumentary structures of the female’s wing that kept a larger portion of the latter in place, although the fixing must have been weaker. Recent panorpids with a short NO (and anal horns) adopt a mixed mating strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neff and Svensson, 2013</xref>). After a courtship ritual, males present nuptial gifts to the female, but if they are not able to get one ready (including if they have been stolen by other males) or the gift is deemed as unsatisfactory by the female (e.g. small salivary secretions due to poor condition of the male), they resort to attempt coercive copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thornhill and Sauer, 1991</xref>). <italic>Burmorthophlebia multiprocessa</italic> gen. et sp. nov., with its short NO and no other armature to immobilize the female’s wing, probably had a similar approach when mating.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Spatial coupling between long male notal organs and female (fore)wings during mating in extant and extinct Mecoptera.</title><p>A–D, <italic>Neopanorpa longistipitata</italic> Wang and Hua, 2018 (Recent): <bold>A</bold>, photograph of mating couple; inset (arrow) shows notal and hypovalves connection magnified; <bold>B</bold>, diagram of mating couple (notal organ depicted in red); <bold>C</bold>, photograph of male abdomen in lateral view; <bold>D</bold>, diagram of coupling mechanism between male notal organ and genital bulb; <bold>E, F</bold>, spatial coupling diagram between male notal-postnotal clip clasping the female wing in two species of <italic>Baltipanorpa</italic> (Eocene): <italic>B. damzeni</italic> Krzemiński and Soszyńska-Maj, 2012 (<bold>E</bold>); <italic>B. oppressiva</italic> sp. nov.

They are present in a small group of species classified in the genera <italic>Panorpa</italic> and <italic>Neopanorpa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong and Hua, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Hua, 2018a</xref>). Instead of a pincer-like clamp composed by a PO and NO, the long NO covers the entire female’s wing across its full width and immobilizes it more or less pressed against the abdomen. As the mating couple of <italic>N. longistipitata</italic> shows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>), the leading edge of the female wing is also accommodated in a small depression of tergite IV under the base of the NO. As can be deduced from measured distances, of the three hirsute PAs on tergites IV–VI the first one supports the wing fold by the convex R<sub>1</sub>; the more distal part of the wing is pressed against the abdomen by the long NO with the help of special muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thornhill, 1990</xref>). The tip of the NO is locked between the genital hypovalves. Although this conformation fully encloses the female wing during mating, the resulting grip is likely not particularly tight. In any case, nuptial gifts are not offered prior or during the mating of <italic>Neopanorpa</italic> species with a long NO, such as <italic>N. longiprocessa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhong and Hua, 2013a</xref>), which would suggest that such process enables highly coercive mating behaviour.</p><p>Among extinct mecopterans, an extremely long NO was hitherto only known in <italic>Baltipanorpa damzeni</italic> from Baltic amber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krzemiński and Soszyńska-Maj, 2012</xref>). In this species, the NO forms together with an unusually elongate PO a clip-like structure able to reach beyond the full width of the female’s wing during mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Both NO and PO possess short tooth-like bristles, which would have increased their holding power. The PO is bent anteriorly, partially securing the clip in this way. <italic>Baltipanorpa oppressiva</italic> sp. nov has a similarly characteristic NO-PO clip bearing inner tooth-like bristles, but its NO is terminally forked in two prongs bent posteriorly at an almost right angle, which embrace the tip of PO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>). The interaction of these structures in the new species results in a full clasp-like mechanism. The female wing enclosed in this remarkable clamp was likely fully immobilised, a withdrawal attempt probably causing risk of tearing the wing membrane. A similar function, although less effective than that in <italic>B. oppressiva</italic> sp. nov, must have been accomplished in <italic>B. damzeni</italic> by a few pairs of elongate bristles on the posterior side of the NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, the NO-PO clamp in <italic>Baltipanorpa</italic> is raised at angle of about 50° from the abdomen, and so the captured female’s forewing was also kept raised and separated from the male’s abdomen. This position is deemed as genuine (not preservational) as it is now known from two different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>) and is unique to this genus. In extant panorpids with very long NOs (<italic>Neopanorpa</italic>), this process is placed at a much lower angle and keeps the female wing rather flat against the abdomen, having no other counterpart such as the long PO in the two fossil <italic>Baltipanorpa</italic> species discussed herein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Anal horns</title><p>The anal horns are distal processes directed posteriorly on abdominal tergite VI.

In conjunction with tergite VII, which is proximally narrowed and/or depressed, the anal horns create a clamping system to accommodate and hold the female’s terminal abdomen into the strained copulatory position necessary for sperm transmission. It has been demonstrated that anal horns play an important role at initiating copulation and in prolonging its duration in the absence of nuptial gifts and under female resistance, and that the lack of anal horns is correlated with the inability to prolong copulation after gift provisioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>Burmorthophlebia multiprocessa</italic> gen et sp. nov. bears a pair of anal horns raised at a 45° angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). By comparison with extant species, these processes must have been involved in manipulating and holding the female abdomen during mating. Paired anal horns in other fossil species are known in <italic>Orthophlebia longicauda</italic> Willmann and Novokschonov, 1998 (Orthophlebiidae; Late Jurassic of Karatau in Kazakhstan) and in two species of <italic>Holcorpa</italic> Scudder, 1878 (Holcorpidae) from two Eocene localities (Florissant, Colorado, USA, and the Okanagan Highlands, British Columbia, Canada) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scudder, 1878</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Willmann and Novokschonov, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archibald, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Other mating-related modifications in males</title><p>Aside from notal-postnotal organs and anal horns, other male abdominal processes involved in the physical interaction with the female during mating are occasionally present in scorpionflies. Among extant panorpids these are positioned on the ventral side, such as a long process on abdominal sternite III (<italic>Neopanorpa furcata</italic> (Hardwicke, 1823)) and a ‘ventral hook’ on sternite VI (<italic>Leptopanorpa linyejiei</italic> Wang and Hua, 2020) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardwicke, 1823</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang and Hua, 2020</xref>). In fossil panorpoids, other male abdominal structures with assumed clamping function occurred in the Late Jurassic species <italic>Orthophlebia heidemariae</italic>. This was the case of a large medial horn-like process on tergite V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Such process has been referred to as ‘tergal spine’, ‘unpaired median tergal process (monocornus)’, or a ‘median tergal horn’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crampton, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mickoleit, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Willmann and Novokschonov, 1998</xref>, respectively). It is probable that this process was also used to fix the female abdomen during mating in conjunction with other more distal structures from the male dorsal abdomen. The abdomen of <italic>O. heidemariae</italic> is preserved in an upturned position and forming a full circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which is a frequent mating position among panorpid males. The large horn-like process is opposite to a small putative process and notch on tergite VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>); both structures likely interlocked with one another to facilitate a strained copulatory position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Willmann and Novokschonov, 1998</xref>). In <italic>Baltipanorpa oppressiva</italic> sp. nov. the horn-like process on tergite V is strongly recurved, and the subsequent tergite VI has an anterior depression and a greatly expanded end, resulting in a notched shape. Both specialised shapes strongly suggest that this horn and the tergite VI were engaged in holding the female abdomen during mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Such conformation was enabled to a certain extent by the position of the female’s wings (at least a forewing) which was raised high (56°) over the male’s abdomen and secured in this position by the extremely long notal-postnotal clip unique to <italic>Baltipanorpa</italic>. Moreover, <italic>Burmorthophlebia multiprocessa</italic> gen. et sp. nov. bears paired processes directed posteriorly at 45° angle on tergite VII, similar to the paired anal horns present on tergite VI, but smaller. Alleged homologous structures have been formerly referred to as ‘paired tergal processes (bicornua)’ or ‘lateral tergal horns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crampton, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mickoleit, 1971</xref>). The most plausible function for these processes in this new species was also holding the female terminal abdomen during mating.</p><p><italic>Cantabra soplao</italic> gen et sp. nov. has greatly elongate abdominal segments VI–VIII. Among extant panorpids, such development is present in species of <italic>Leptopanorpa</italic> MacLachlan, 1875 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacLachlan, 1875</xref>) endemic to Indonesia, and also in a few <italic>Neopanorpa</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang and Hua, 2020</xref>). Although biology of these taxa remains unknown, the greatly elongate abdomens are considered to be influenced by sexual selection, in displays to females and competition among male rivals. Extremely elongate abdomens were also present among other extinct panorpoid lineages: the Orthophlebiidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Willmann and Novokschonov, 1998</xref>), the Holcorpidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archibald, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), and in taxa of uncertain relationships from the Middle Jurassic of China, where abdomen elongation was extreme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Great abdominal elongation is regarded as a result of convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang and Hua, 2020</xref>). Additionally, in the Holcorpidae and Orthophlebiidae swellings on the first tarsomeres of the hind legs in males were most probably used in sexual display; the size and shape of these swellings was likely species specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In the mecopterans presented herein the tarsomeres were not modified (yet in <italic>Cantabra soplao</italic> gen. et sp. nov. the shape of legs is unknown). Tarsal swellings do not occur in Recent Panorpoidea.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The morphology of the male’s abdomen in extant scorpionflies represents a good approximation to the mating strategy used toward a female. Thus, the abdominal structures of fossil specimens have the ability to convey information on the likely reproductive strategies of extinct scorpionflies and, to some extent, on their evolution. Based on the disparate male abdominal shapes of the three fossil taxa described herein, these almost certainly had different mating strategies along a nuptial gifting-coercive gradient as observed among their extant panorpid relatives. Firstly, the Cretaceous species <italic>Cantabra soplao</italic> gen. et sp. nov., currently the only known member of its lineage, bears a small PO, with the absence of other posterior abdominal processes. This suggests that its mating behaviour was devoid of coercion and that nuptial gifting must have played an important role in these scorpionflies. Extant panorpid species which NO-PO system is very small or even absent and lack posterior abdominal processes (‘horns’) either rely on nuptial edible gifts or on mouth-to-mouth feeding during copulation adopting an O-shaped position instead of the typical V-position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhong et al., 2015</xref>). It is plausible that the mating in <italic>C. soplao</italic> gen. et sp. nov. was similar. Regardless, the great degree of elongation of the abdomen in this species was probably involved in sexual selection dynamics.</p><p>Secondly, the Cretaceous <italic>Burmorthophlebia multiprocessa</italic> gen. et sp. nov., the only orthophlebiid specimen described from amber to date, likely exhibited a mixed mating strategy involving both nuptial gifting and coercive behaviour, as observed in some extant Panorpidae species. This inference is based on a weak notal-postnotal clamping system and two sets of paired processes on the abdomen, which likely ensured female restraint and probably extended copulation beyond any possible nuptial gift stages. Noteworthy, abdominal processes are exceptionally abundant in this species, on the dorsal and ventral sides. Such armature is unknown among extant Panorpidae, and can be compared only with that of <italic>Nothiotrauma reedi</italic> of the relict family Eomeropidae.</p><p>Lastly, in the Eocene <italic>Baltipanorpa oppressiva</italic> sp. nov. the NO-PO wing clamp, which resembled a sealing clip, was able to tightly grasp the full wing width of the female. Unlike its previously known congeneric relative <italic>B. damzeni</italic>, this structure bore a sophisticated terminal clasp. Together with a highly recurved abdominal horn in this new species, these traits represent the most extreme set of female clamping devices known among scorpionflies, both extinct or extant. Consequently, a fully coercive mating strategy was likely dominant, even exclusive, in this species. During copulation, the female wings (at least the forewings) were likely kept in the notal-postnotal clamp well raised over the male abdomen, this way being separated from the male’s anal horn, which is positioned more proximally in this species (i.e. on tergite V vs. in tergite VI in other panorpids). This inclined position of the female’s wing(s) enabled the entrapment of her abdomen by the male’s anal horn during mating. In evolutionary terms, the fitness costs of such organs and the resulting coercive mating behaviour might have been too high for <italic>Baltipanorpa</italic>. The very long notal and postnotal processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>) raised over the male’s body might have hindered flight ability; moreover, because of their size (and perhaps their permanently raised position) these processes were likely prone to injury and thus they might entail a risk for their bearers. These factors might have contributed to the extinction of <italic>Baltipanorpa</italic> and its singular morphology, so that the evolution of this extreme clamping device resulted in a blind alley. Moreover, the biology of the female could have also contributed to this extinction if the mating became too oppressive or dangerous, related to the risk of tearing the wing membrane with the teeth and hard bristles of the male’s notal organ.</p><p>The remarkable diversity of abdominal configurations shown herein suggests that panorpoid mecopterans had accordingly disparate mating strategies and behaviours in the past. Data based on fossil and extant species suggest that the coercive mating behaviour in this group is secondary (derived) from the habit of nuptial gifting. According to the current fossil record, long notal organs did not evolve prior to the Eocene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Data from extant mecopterans point at the Choristidae as the sister group of Panorpoidea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Willmann, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang and Hua, 2021</xref>), which lack notal organs or other abdominal modifications (including elongate distal segments) and adopt an O-shaped mating position while the male transfers mouth-to mouth salivary secretion to the female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhong et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, it is assumed that the latter condition is likely plesiotypic for Panorpoidea.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Male abdominal modifications in extinct and extant Panorpoidea on a time scale: <bold>A</bold>, <italic>Orthophlebia heidemariae</italic> Willmann and Novokschonov, 1998 (Orthophlebiidae); <bold>B</bold>, <italic>Cantabra soplao</italic> gen et sp.</title><p>nov.

The detailed scorpionfly morphology reveals specific reproductive morphological adaptations that are clear enough to corroborate hypotheses explaining how these insects may have mated. Based on careful morphological comparisons with extant scorpionfly species, the authors are able to speculate on how sexual conflict evolved and shaped insect mating behavior. The findings are of interest to evolutionary biologists studying reproduction and behavior, entomologists and paleontologists. Given the unusual diversity in insect mating behavior, which is simultaneously fascinating and horrifying, this deep-time perspective is likely to interest not only colleagues in the field, but also the general public.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70508.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lentink</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/012p63287</institution-id><institution>University of Groningen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Ren</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bashkuev</surname><given-names>Alexei</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Azar</surname><given-names>Dany</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Evolution of sexual conflict in scorpionflies&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Molly Przeworski as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ren Dong (Reviewer #1); Alexei Bashkuev (Reviewer #2); Dany Azar (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please comply with the comments and suggestions to your best ability, mark all changes using a blue font to indicate changes in the revised manuscript, and respond in a point-by-point fashion. This is essential to enable the reviewing editor to fully evaluate the merit of your revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>General points</p><p>The following revisions improve both the scientific presentation and clarity for <italic>eLife</italic>'s broad readership. Especially considering the paper has strengths in its unique fossil data, however, there is a need to more clearly and logically support the main points informed by the data. Several sections are unnecessary complex, which makes this manuscript unclear for both specialists and general <italic>eLife</italic> readers alike. Please address the issues thoughtfully and holistically keeping in mind <italic>eLife</italic> serves the entire biology community by publishing exceptionally clear and rigorously supported manuscripts. Any jargon deemed essential in the manuscript should be introduced in a more accessible fashion upon first use so a general reader can follow.</p><p>1) Not only the general readership needs improved higher level framing to enable a clear read. Fellow paleoentomologists would also greatly benefit from a paragraph in the introduction that includes other insects that follow similar strategies (e.g. Tettigoniidae, Megaloptera) together with some of the most relevant and general references. Considering the species found in Spanish amber belong to a new family, it will be challenging to make comparisons with recent relatives. Hence it may serve both the general and specialist reader to present the current findings in the context of mating strategies of other insects with sexual conflicts. To help introduce the general reader to the focus of this study, it would help to present an introductory figure showing this broader context, both in extant and extinct species, highlighting the unique contribution the new fossils make. Optimizing the graphic presentation and introducing key specialist terms in a clear fashion. To find examples for what a general reader would find clear consider how an in-depth National Geographic or New York Times Science article would communicate the context of the new finding and fossil as inspiration for designing an introductory figure. Given the high graphic design quality of the authors other figures, this may be relatively straightforward to add, it will greatly benefit all readers.</p><p>In this introductory figure and the associated introductory text, please consider there are numerous well preserved and diverse fossil scorpionflies (e.g. orthophlebiids sensu lato) from the Mesozoic Lagerstätten in China (Middle Jurassic Daohugou Biota, Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota) that are curated across institutions and museums. These collections have been studied in detail. Introducing this fact to the reader and presenting the new fossils in this established context is essential to clearly frame the new findings and show the scientific significance. In this regard the statement &quot;in older fossil panorpoids, the abdomen is lacking or this portion is obscured&quot; should be updated and clarified to avoid overstatement.</p><p>2) Regarding the relationship between gift-giving and coercive behavior. Most insects do not have nuptial gifts during the mating, coercive behavior is very common, please integrate this in the framing of Mecoptera as models of evolutionary research. The emergence of nuptial gifts seems to have greatly improved the diversity of reproductive behavior in scorpionflies. Considering this, coercive behavior may perhaps still be considered at the lower level of reproduction. In this light nuptial gifts, rather than coercion, may make scorpionflies an important reproductive evolutionary model. Given the discussion of this matter by the reviewers, it is helpful to clarify the manuscript and either integrate this perspective or provide a compelling rebuttal that the reviewers can evaluate to consider the authors preferred perspective.</p><p>3) The abstract could more clearly communicate the key findings and conclusions. Consider further highlighting the new evidence presented for the evolution of reproductive behavior in Mecoptera (/ the Holometabola). Please revise in a fashion that serves the general <italic>eLife</italic> reader.</p><p>4) The introduction should more carefully consider the number of extant species of scorpionflies, which is over 700. Consider that these scorpionflies providing saliva globes typically do not provide the dead arthropods at the same time. This has ramifications for the number of gifts that can be given at one time.</p><p>5) The descriptive and Discussion sections should be separated more clearly so the reader can digest the evidence before considering the authors evolutionary interpretation and hypothesis.</p><p>6) Present the new family, Cantabridae, in the context of other families of Panorpidea beyond Panorpidae. Consider comparing them further with the Holcorpidae based on their similarity in elongated abdomen. At a higher level, provide higher level context for the general <italic>eLife</italic> reader so they can follow the merit and relevance of considering the Cantabridae and contrasting them with other families through the lens of evolutionary diversity.</p><p>7) The discussion benefits from more clearly structuring the sections with informative subtitles that help the general <italic>eLife</italic> reader grasp the big picture points. Examples of dry and challenging concepts discussed include, Notal and postnotal organs; Anal horns; Other male abdominal processes; Male abdominal configurations and mating strategies.</p><p>8) Please better discuss why there may be both coercive behavior and nuptial gifting in some groups, what's the functional / evolutionary reason? Do more groups have a mixed strategy or only the orthophlebiid?

E.g. &quot;notal and postnotal organs …can be vestigially present in Boreidae&quot; is technically incorrect. The males of Boreidae have a non-homologous but functionally similar female-clamping device, which include hook-like rudimentary wings and structures on the 2nd and 3rd abdominal segments (vs on 4th and 5th in panorpids), usually referred to as tergal apophyses (e.g. Mickoleit and Mickoleit, 1976), that can be well-developed in some species. However, it is not apparent that this well-developed (better than in most panorpids) clamping device evolved as a male adaptation to sexual conﬂict over mating duration. Instead, its main function is likely to ease initiation of copulation and to further stabilize the female position throughout mating in order to resist external disturbances (in some species of Boreus, especially European, females usually do not attempt to resist and remain motionless throughout the entire copulation process which may last for hours) (Mickoleit and Mickoleit, 1976; Beutel and Friedrich, 2019). The same may be true for at least some Panorpidae (Kock et al., 2009) so this context may be relevant for extinct scorpionflies too.

These tarsal swellings have been previously known in males of some Late Jurassic Orthophlebiidae (including Orthophlebia longicauda, the one with paired anal horns), and were initially interpreted as possible pheromone glands, tympanal organs (possibly related to premating behavior), or structures for grasping female mates (Novokshonov, 1996; Willmann and Novokschonov, 1998). Either of these assumptions suggests that courtship rituals and nuptial gifting might have already been common among Jurassic scorpionflies. Consider briefly mentioning or discussing this speculative hypothesis so the general reader is aware of the ongoing debate, clarifying how the current fossils relate to the earlier work and may confirm or modify earlier interpretations.</p><p>Line items</p><p>12) Page 3, Line 16-30: Please clarify the abstract to avoid ambiguity in word meaning / interpretation by the reader.

All data provides a critical step and deep-time perspective to illustrate the developmental reasons of gift giving in Mecoptera, and relationship between nuptial gifts and coercive behavior in the most general way.</p><p>The paper does have strengths in data, however, these strengths are not well demonstrated.

Most insects do not have nuptial gifts during the mating, coercive behavior is very common, which can not be a reason for Mecoptera to be models of evolutionary research. Practically, the emergence of nuptial gifts greatly improved the diversity of reproductive behavior in scorpionflies, and all different coercive behavior still at the lower level of reproduction. Therefore, nuptial gifts, rather than coercion, is the important reason for scorpionfly become an important reproductive evolutionary model.</p><p>2) In Abstract part, the most important points or conclusions are not highlighted, how many mating styles there are not the most important, but new finding provide irreplaceable evidence for the evolution of reproductive behavior in Mecoptera, or even in the Holometabola. In addition, key words should not repeat with the title.</p><p>3) In Introduction part, the extant species of scorpionflies is over 700, please pay attention to the numbers. Generally, these scorpionflies that provide the saliva globes do not provide the dead arthropods at the same time, which means usually only offering one gift at one time.</p><p>4) In Description part, should not repeat with diagnosis. Remarks of new family (Cantabridae) should compare with other families of Panorpidea, not only the Panorpidae. In addition, better compare with the Holcorpidae, as they have quite similar elongated abdomen.</p><p>5) In Discussion part, need to add some subtitles, as this part is quite long, not easy to be logical and clear. For example, Notal and postnotal organs; Anal horns; Other male abdominal processes; Male abdominal configurations and mating strategies. There are both coercive behavior and nuptial gifting in some groups, what's the reason? All groups with weak system have mixed strategy or only orthophlebiid? Need more explanation or examples. Furthermore, females have a great deal of choice in mating, and can choose to accept more than one male, based on specific behaviors and structures. Since this study lack of phylogenetic analysis, better delete the discussion on phylogenetic relationships. Of course, providing a phylogenetic analysis of particular male abdomen structures would greatly enhance the logic and comprehension of this study.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors describe new interesting scorpionfly fossils preserved in various Cretaceous and Eocene ambers, with a particular focus on certain striking morphological structures that include notal and postnotal organs and other non-genital abdominal processes. Previously, only a few examples of such structures have been known in fossil scorpionflies and they have never been treated in terms of their possible function and role in mating behavior. Based on comparison with various extant panorpid species, the authors speculate about the possible mating strategies in each new taxon under discussion in context of the evolution of mating-related sexual conflict in Mecoptera and insects in general.</p><p>The manuscript is well designed, clearly written and well structured, I enjoyed reading it. The discussion is compelling and worth publication. The descriptions of the new taxa are correct, but not without some flaws, which would be easy to fix.</p><p>However, there are two important issues that are missing in the manuscript. I think they should be considered before the manuscript is accepted for publication.</p><p>1) The mating behavior of Boreidae is not discussed, although it is well-described in literature (the paper is entitled &quot;Evolution of sexual conflict in scorpionflies&quot;, and Boreidae are scorpionflies, aren't they?). The only mention of this family is when the authors state that &quot;notal and postnotal organs …can be vestigially present in Boreidae&quot;, which is technically incorrect. The males of Boreidae have a non-homologous but functionally similar female-clamping device, which include hook-like rudimentary wings and structures on the 2nd and 3rd abdominal segments (vs on 4th and 5th in panorpids), usually referred to as tergal apophyses (e.g. Mickoleit and Mickoleit, 1976), that can be well-developed in some species. However, it is not apparent that this well-developed (better than in most panorpids) clamping device evolved as a male adaptation to sexual conﬂict over mating duration. Instead, its main function is likely to ease initiation of copulation and to further stabilize the female position throughout mating in order to resist external disturbances (in some species of Boreus, especially European, females usually do not attempt to resist and remain motionless throughout the entire copulation process which may last for hours) (Mickoleit and Mickoleit, 1976; Beutel and Friedrich, 2019). The same may be true for at least some Panorpidae (Kock et al., 2009), and – who knows? – maybe for some extinct scorpionflies, too.</p><p>2) There are hundreds, if not thousands, perfectly preserved and very diverse fossil scorpionflies (mainly orthophlebiids sensu lato) from the famous Mesozoic Lagerstätten in China (Middle Jurassic Daohugou Biota, Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota) available in many institutional and museum collections. I know that some of the authors have extensively studied this material. So, when the authors say that &quot;in older fossil panorpoids, the abdomen is lacking or this portion is obscured&quot;, this is not entirely true.</p><p>Recently, Zhang et al., (2021) (DOI: 10.1186/s12862-021-01771-3) reported striking swollen tarsal segments in males of the Middle Jurassic scorpionflies and proposed a very interesting hypothesis that those might have been associated with nuptial gifting behavior and served to “camouflage a gift in the mating process”. These tarsal swellings have been previously known in males of some Late Jurassic Orthophlebiidae (including Orthophlebia longicauda, the one with paired anal horns), and were initially interpreted as possible pheromone glands, tympanal organs (possibly related to premating behavior), or structures for grasping female mates (Novokshonov, 1996; Willmann and Novokschonov, 1998).

Surprising each of the three specimens represent a different mating behavior within the spectrum known nowadays. However, some of the fossil structures used for mating practices are more diverse and specialized, highlighting the importance of the study of fossils. The manuscript is well written and well organized. The data is nicely presented and informative. For non- scorpionflies specialists, the crucial characters are explained, also with the help of figures.</p><p>The manuscript focuses on scorpionflies for obvious reasons. First, the three specimens in amber are exceptionally well preserved, and because of their rarity in the fossil record, the specimens are of high scientific value. Second, Mecopterans are used as a model in sexual conflict studies already since many generations. Thus, the opportunity to integrate fossil specimens in such studies is crucial to understand its evolution. I considered the topic highly interesting and important not only for studying the evolution of Mecopterans but also in general for studying the evolution of insects.</p><p>Because the topic is treated seldom in the fossil record, the interest in the manuscript for other paleoentomologists would increase with a short paragraph in the introduction that includes other insects that follow similar strategies (Tettigoniidae, Megaloptera) together with some of the most relevant and general references.

Considering this, coercive behavior may perhaps still be considered at the lower level of reproduction. In this light nuptial gifts, rather than coercion, may make scorpionflies an important reproductive evolutionary model.

A spectrum of examples is now presented in the new introduction. Regarding the question which type was first in Mecoptera (at lower level of reproduction), the data presented here, as well as opinion of other authors (Zhong et al., 2015) suggest rather the reverse, i.e, that plesiomorphic (older, primary) behaviour was rather based on nuptial gifts than on coercion.

However, it is not apparent that this well-developed (better than in most panorpids) clamping device evolved as a male adaptation to sexual conﬂict over mating duration. Instead, its main function is likely to ease initiation of copulation and to further stabilize the female position throughout mating in order to resist external disturbances (in some species of Boreus, especially European, females usually do not attempt to resist and remain motionless throughout the entire copulation process which may last for hours) (Mickoleit and Mickoleit, 1976; Beutel and Friedrich, 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>You are right that, indeed, our bringing up the example of Boreidae here makes no sense, as there are their modified retracted wings which are used to hold the female.

These tarsal swellings have been previously known in males of some Late Jurassic Orthophlebiidae (including Orthophlebia longicauda, the one with paired anal horns), and were initially interpreted as possible pheromone glands, tympanal organs (possibly related to premating behavior), or structures for grasping female mates (Novokshonov, 1996; Willmann and Novokschonov, 1998). Either of these assumptions suggests that courtship rituals and nuptial gifting might have already been common among Jurassic scorpionflies. Consider briefly mentioning or discussing this speculative hypothesis so the general reader is aware of the ongoing debate, clarifying how the current fossils relate to the earlier work and may confirm or modify earlier interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>The paper was quoted and the facts added to the discussion.
