interactions are associated with perceptual and self-consciousness. In this line, the neural responses to visceral inputs have been hypothesized to play a leading role in shaping our subjective experience. This study aims to investigate whether the contextual processing of auditory irregularities modulates both direct neuronal responses to the auditory stimuli (ERPs) and the neural responses to heartbeats, as measured with heartbeat-evoked responses (HERs). HERs were computed in patients with disorders of consciousness, diagnosed with a minimally conscious state or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. We tested whether HERs reflect conscious auditory perception, which can potentially provide additional information for the consciousness diagnosis. EEG recordings were taken during the local-global paradigm, which evaluates the capacity of a patient to detect the appearance of auditory irregularities at local (short-term) and global (long-term) levels. The results show that local and global effects produce distinct ERPs and HERs, which can help distinguish between the minimally conscious state and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients. Furthermore, we found that ERP and HER responses were not correlated suggesting that independent neuronal mechanisms are behind them. These findings suggest that HER modulations in response to auditory irregularities, especially local irregularities, may be used as a novel neural marker of consciousness and may aid in the bedside diagnosis of disorders of consciousness with a more cost-effective option than neuroimaging methods.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>consciousness</kwd><kwd>brain-heart interactions</kwd><kwd>heartbeat-evoked responses</kwd><kwd>perception</kwd><kwd>disorders of consciousness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007631</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institute for Advanced Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tallon-Baudry</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-EURE-0017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tallon-Baudry</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10- IAIHU-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sitt</surname><given-names>Jacobo D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019125</institution-id><institution>Sorbonne Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMERGENCE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sitt</surname><given-names>Jacobo D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JTC2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sitt</surname><given-names>Jacobo D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Brain-heart interactions under the processing of auditory irregularities could help to distinguish whether a patient is in a vegetative state or in a minimally conscious state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Theoretical developments in consciousness and experimental research have rooted the basis of consciousness in how the brain responds to visceral inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzalini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Candia-Rivera, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park and Tallon-Baudry, 2014</xref>). In post-comatose patients, the consciousness diagnosis is primarily based on behavioral signs of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayne et al., 2017</xref>), which aims at distinguishing between patients showing only reflex-like responses to the environment, diagnosed as Vegetative State or Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (VS/UWS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laureys et al., 2010</xref>), and patients with fluctuating but reproducible signs of non-reflex behavior, diagnosed as a Minimally Conscious State (MCS), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giacino et al., 2002</xref>), but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Naccache, 2018</xref>. However, recent results demonstrate that behavioral assessment is not sufficient and neuroimaging techniques are used to detect covert states of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondziella et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The classification of MCS and UWS patients using EEG and cardiac features while undergoing processing of auditory regularities has shown an advantage over EEG features alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raimondo et al., 2017</xref>), implying that brain-heart interactions may be involved in the conscious processing of auditory inputs. Recent evidence on automatic classifications of HERs in the resting-state showed that these markers may capture residual signs of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Candia-Rivera et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Candia-Rivera and Machado, 2023a</xref>) suggesting that HERs might convey state-of-consciousness relevant information about how the brain responds to bodily-related stimuli. Further evidence exists in healthy participants, in which the processing of auditory stimuli may cause cognitive modulations to the cardiac cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marshall et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banellis and Cruse, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfeiffer and De Lucia, 2017</xref>), and HERs correlate with perceptual awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banellis and Cruse, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that HERs can be modulated by contextual processing of different levels of auditory regularities, as presented in the local-global paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we analyze HERs following the presentation of auditory irregularities, with special regard for distinguishing UWS (n=40) and MCS (n=46) patients. Note that the automated classification of this cohort was previously performed in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raimondo et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, our aim is to characterize the group-wise differences between UWS and MCS patients that may allow a multi-dimensional cognitive evaluation to infer the presence of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sergent et al., 2017</xref>), but also complement the bedside diagnosis performed with neuroimaging methods that capture neural correlates of covert consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanz et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This study employed high-density EEG recordings to assess the cognitive processing of auditory irregularities in patients with disorders of consciousness using the local-global paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>). This paradigm evaluates auditory regularities at both short-term (local) and long-term (global) levels within trials of five consecutive sounds. The 5<sup>th</sup> sound distinguishes standard from deviant trials at both local and global levels. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, XX, and XY types of blocks were presented. In XX blocks, frequent stimuli consisted of five equal sounds (local and global standard), whereas infrequent stimuli had four equal sounds followed by a different 5<sup>th</sup> sound (local and global deviant). In XY blocks, frequent stimuli involved four equal sounds followed by a different 5<sup>th</sup> sound (local deviant and global standard), while infrequent stimuli featured five equal sounds (local standard and global deviant). We examined the cognitive processing of auditory irregularities with the objective to identify the physiological responses that could differentiate between patients in MCS and those in UWS. We hypothesized that assessing auditory irregularities at both local and global levels could offer valuable insights into the distinction of MCS and UWS patients. Furthermore, that distinction may be further improved by analyzing the physiological modulation of auditory processing in relation to measures of brain-heart interactions. To achieve this, we conducted tests to investigate the local and global effects of ERPs, which involved analyzing the standard average of EEG epochs aligned with the occurrence of auditory deviants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, we explored the HERs, which involved analyzing the average of EEG epochs aligned with the occurrence of heartbeats following the auditory deviants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We aimed to assess whether the neural responses to heartbeats, within the context of auditory irregularity processing, could serve as novel differentiating factors between MCS and UWS patients.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental description and EEG analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Local-global paradigm.

The processing of short- and long-term auditory irregularities, i.e., the local and global effects, shows distinctive responses between MCS and UWS patients in their HERs.</p><p>The correlation analyses revealed that the EEG signals synchronized to heartbeats (HERs) provided complementary information to the ERPs synchronized to auditory irregularities. Examining the local effects using HERs and ERPs yielded better differentiability between MCS and UWS patients (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>It is worth noting that the HER local effect demonstrated higher specificity, as compared to the HER global effect during the permutation test. Only 3% of randomly timed surrogate heartbeats exhibited separability that surpassed what was observed with the original heartbeats. These results align with previous findings that suggest the existence of a short-term auditory-cardiac synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banellis and Cruse, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pérez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfeiffer and De Lucia, 2017</xref>). Moreover, our findings indicate that brain-heart dynamics may serve as markers of the conscious processing of auditory information, particularly in distinguishing short-term changes.</p><p>Our results go in the same direction as previous evidence, in which automatic classifications of these patients showed a higher accuracy when locking EEG to heartbeats, with respect to the classification of EEG segments unrelated to the cardiac cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Candia-Rivera et al., 2021a</xref>). Nevertheless, the measured responses in ERPs and HERs do not separate MCS and UWS patients’ groups completely (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that some patients do not react or only react to some trials that were attenuated when averaging all trials in the time-locked analysis. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the ERP global effect observed in healthy controls did not follow the same trend as MCS patients. These findings may require of further future explorations to determine if the observed effect is exclusive to MCS patients or if healthy controls do not exhibit the same effect due to their lower number of trials performed in the local-global paradigm during this study. However, the response observed in healthy controls does resemble a standard P300 response. These findings align with previous reports indicating that the ERPs during local deviants exhibit superior discriminatory ability between MCS and UWS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faugeras et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, these results suggest that both ERP and HER in processing local auditory irregularities might be predominant for distinguishing between MCS and UWS. This notion is further supported by the higher accuracy of the linear discriminant classifier in classifying MCS and UWS patients by using ERP local and both HER global and local effects, as compared to all other possible feature combinations. Nonetheless, the inclusion of global effects marginally improved the classification performance, indicating that although the global effects are weaker than the local effects, they might provide complementary information to the local effects.</p><p>Our results contribute to the extensive experimental evidence showing that brain-heart interactions, as measured with HERs, are related to perceptual awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzalini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skora et al., 2022</xref>). For instance, neural responses to heartbeats correlate with perception in a visual detection task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2014</xref>). Further evidence exists on somatosensory perception, where a higher detection of somatosensory stimuli occurs when the cardiac cycle is in diastole and it is reflected in HERs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al et al., 2020</xref>). Evidence on heart transplanted patients show that the ability of heartbeats sensation is reduced after surgery and recovered after one year, with the evolution of the heartbeats sensation recovery reflected in the neural responses to heartbeats as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salamone et al., 2020</xref>). The responses to heartbeats also covary with self-perception: bodily-self-identification of the full body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Park et al., 2016</xref>), and face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sel et al., 2017</xref>), and the self-relatedness of spontaneous thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babo-Rebelo et al., 2016</xref>) and imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babo-Rebelo et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, brain-heart interactions measured from heart rate variability correlate with conscious auditory perception as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banellis and Cruse, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pérez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfeiffer and De Lucia, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We showed that ERPs and HERs are repeatedly larger in MCS patients, as compared to UWS, in both local and global effects. Furthermore, the ERPs and HERs (both for the local and global effects) are uncorrelated in all possible comparisons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), in addition to the results show differentiation of clustering effects in HER and ERP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggest that the neuronal mechanisms behind these ERPs and HERs responses are independent. In addition, we found that HER variance is higher in MCS patients than in UWS patients, as previously reported in resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Candia-Rivera and Machado, 2023a</xref>). These results suggest that there are two distinct neuronal signatures that set apart patients in a MCS from those in an UWS. A first process probed with HER variability differentiates, irrespective of the current stimulus types being processed. This first process originates from the central and right temporal scalp areas and has been linked with social cognition but could also correspond to a self-consciousness-state markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Candia-Rivera et al., 2021a</xref>). Second, a modulation of HER in response to local and global auditory irregularities. These responses present several properties related to a neural signature of conscious access to local and global deviant stimuli. Such ERPs and HERs modulations by conscious access to a new stimulus attribute may well correspond to a self-consciousness updating process occurring ‘downstream’ to conscious access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sergent and Naccache, 2012</xref>), and enabled, for instance, in a <italic>global neuronal workspace</italic> architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dehaene and Naccache, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Note that outliers are expected in disorders of consciousness, and an exact physiological characterization of the different levels of consciousness remains challenging. First, the standard assessment of consciousness based on behavioral measures has shown a high rate of misdiagnosis in MCS and UWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stender et al., 2014</xref>). The cause of the misdiagnosis of consciousness arises because consciousness does not necessarily translate into overt behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hermann et al., 2021</xref>). Unresponsive and minimally conscious patients, namely non-behavioral MCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thibaut et al., 2021</xref>), represents the main diagnostic challenge in clinical practice. Second, some of these patients suffer from conditions that may translate into no response to stimuli, even in the presence of consciousness. For instance, when they suffer from constant pain, fluctuations in arousal levels, or sensory impairments caused by brain damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chennu et al., 2013</xref>). Third, these patients were recorded in clinical setups, which may lead to a lower signal-to-noise ratio, and consecutively lead to biased measurements in evoked potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clayson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A plethora of complementary neuroimaging techniques have been proposed to enhance the consciousness diagnosis, including anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondziella et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanz et al., 2021</xref>). However, those methodologies may not be accessible in all clinical setups, because of costs or medical contraindications. The foregoing evidence of EEG-based techniques to diagnose consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engemann et al., 2018</xref>) shows promising and low-cost opportunities to develop diagnostic methods that can capture residual consciousness. Our results contribute more evidence of the potential of EEG as a diagnostic tool, but also to the role of visceral signals in consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzalini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Candia-Rivera, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sattin et al., 2020</xref>).

The paradigm consists of two embedded levels of auditory regularities in trials formed by five consecutive sounds. The 5<sup>th</sup> sound defines whether the trial is standard or deviant at two levels: local and global. The local level of regularity is defined within the trial. The global level of regularities is defined across trials (frequent trials ~80% define the regularity, and rare ones ~20% violate this regularity). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, in the XX blocks, the frequent stimulus corresponds to five equal sounds (local standard and global standard). In contrast, the infrequent stimulus corresponds to four equal sounds followed by a fifth different sound (local deviant and global deviant). In the XY blocks, the frequent stimulus corresponds to four equal sounds and a fifth different sound (local deviant and global standard). The infrequent stimulus corresponds to five equal sounds (local standard and global deviant). The patients included in this study performed at least four blocks (2 XX and 2 XY), in which one block has an approximate duration of 200 s. Each trial is formed by five consecutive sounds lasting 50 milliseconds, with a 150 millisecond gap between the sounds’ onsets and an intertrial interval ranging from 1350–1650 milliseconds.</p><p>The healthy controls participating in this study completed two blocks of the local-global paradigm, one XX and one XY.

Channels exceeding &gt;3 standard deviations were discarded iteratively (11±1 SEM channels rejected on average). Following the procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raimondo et al., 2017</xref>, electrocardiograms (ECG) were recovered from the cardiac field artifact captured in EEG data using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (default parameters from Fieldtrip).

In brief, the cluster-based permutation test included a preliminary mask definition, identification of candidate clusters, and the computation of cluster statistics with Monte Carlo’s p-value correction. The preliminary mask was defined through an unpaired Wilcoxon test, with alpha = 0.05. The identification of neighbor channels were based on the default Fieldtrip channels’ neighborhood definition for 64 channels. A minimum cluster size of four channels was imposed. Adjacent candidate clusters on time were wrapped if they had at least one channel in common. Cluster statistics were computed from 10,000 random partitions. The proportion of random partitions that resulted in a lower p-value than the observed one was considered as the Monte Carlo p-value, with significance at alpha = 0.05. The cluster statistic considered is the Wilcoxon’s absolute maximum Z-value obtained from all the samples of the mask.</p><p>Additionally, to confirm the presence of true effects in HERs, we compared the combined clustered effects with surrogates. We reallocated each heartbeat timing using a uniformly distributed pseudorandom process, between the first and the last sample of each recording.

We computed Monte Carlo p-values as the proportion of the combined clustered effects found in the surrogates with a higher effect and cluster size, with respect to the real heartbeat timings.</p><p>Lastly, in order to assess the complementarity of clusters identified in ERPs and HERs across local and global effects, we employed a fivefold cross-validation to train a linear discriminant classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher, 1936</xref>), as implemented in MATLAB.

by short-term and long-term auditory irregularities in patients diagnosed with a minimally conscious state or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. While the findings would have been more robust had the authors collected data in the same way from a larger group of control subjects, they highlight the potential value of using heartbeat-evoked responses to inform the bedside diagnosis of disorders of consciousness. More generally, they will of interest to researchers studying brain-body interactions and their relationship to perceptual awareness.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75352.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/052gg0110</institution-id><institution>University of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Garrido</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Chait</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02jx3x895</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.27.21265539">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.27.21265539v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Maria Chait as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marta Garrido (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We found the work potentially very interesting, however several key issues, critical for supporting the claims in this paper, were identified. We hope you can address these in a revision.</p><p>1) We were confused by the specificity of HER differences vs straightforward prediction error differences in auditory evoked responses. Is there a significant local and global deviant response in each patient group?</p><p>2) In general, the interpretation of the results seems to rely on significant results for some contrasts but on others being non-significant. Why do you not look for an interaction?</p><p>3) The pattern of results across groups (Panel E; see specific comments from Rev2 and Rev3 below) was somewhat counterintuitive and raises questions about what this neural signature can tell us about the state of consciousness.</p><p>4) We found the Discussion section to be too sparse. We encourage the authors to add a discussion of the implications of these data to our understanding of the consciousness state of MCS and UWS patients.</p><p>Please also see further comments in the individual reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I really enjoyed reading this paper and have comments really to clarify the experimental design and results.</p><p>The design looks like it is a 2x2 design where there is a standard or deviant that is modulated globally or locally. I think it is more complicated than that and I am happy to be wrong on this. The reason for mentioning it is that the analysis focuses on the main effects of global and local and not on the interaction between them. This seems important as the main result here is a significant effect for global and a non significant effect for local. It would be great if this could be shown as a significant interaction. If the design can is not a 2x2 maybe the authors could explain this in the manuscript to help those like me who conceptually struggled with the design.</p><p>The long term goal as described is to be able to use EEG as a diagnostic tool for post-comatose patients. It would be really helpful for the more general reader to have a clearer understanding of where this study fits in this translational pipeline.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Methodology:</p><p>1) ECG signals were determined using ICA on scalp EEG rather than actual electrodes on the chest? I suggest including some discussion on the limitations with this approach – how accurate is this approach relatively to ECG?</p><p>2) It appears that the addition and removal of peaks was performed manually? If so, there is room for subjectivity with this approach making it hard to replicate/reproduce. Can detailed information about which trials etc were excluded be provided together with the dataset, such that these results can be reproduced in the future?</p><p>3) The controls sample (N=11) is relatively quite small when compared to N=59 UWS and N=58 MCS.</p><p>Results:</p><p>4) Figure 1E – could the effect observed driven by the 4 MCS participants that appear to be outliers? I think this is important to check particularly as it seems that UWS is more similar to EMCS and the Healthy group than EMCS, which is counterintuitive – is that really the case? If so, why would that be?</p><p>5) Related to the point above, it would be helpful to know how the variance of HER looks for the other 2 groups (EMCS and Healthy). Is there a relationship between HER variance and consciousness? If not, how to interpret this result?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>6) I was confused about the issues of specificity of HER differences vs straightforward prediction error differences in auditory evoked responses locked to the 5th sound. The results state the following: &quot;Group-wise HER average differs from EEG activity locked to the 5th sound, as compared in the same cluster or the best cluster (MANOVA test, χ 2 153=16.6366, df=3, value=0.0008)&quot;. This seems to reflect the data displayed in Figure 1D third row? (if so, an asterisk could be placed to clearly indicate differences group differences). However, this is not well discussed. It is said: &quot;Various tests showed that locking EEG to heartbeats is necessary to find distinctions between patients, revealing the existence of a possible auditory-cardiac synchrony 207 (Pérez et al., 2021; Pfeiffer and Lucia, 2017). This study gives evidence that HERs detect auditory conscious perception, in addition to residual signs of consciousness in resting state 209 (Candia-Rivera et al., 2021a).&quot; I agree that this study shows that locking EEG to heartbeats shows a difference between UWC and MCS, but it doesn't seem to show that it is necessary given the statistical difference reported for EEG locked to the 5th sound (best cluster). This should be clarified and discussed. What are the implications if it's not specific?</p><p>7) Links are made to studies on social cognition and the global workspace theory but I couldn't see how these data really speak to those theories. The abstract clearly states how this work could be useful in informing diagnosis of the state of consciousness, which is in keeping with the data, and yet the discussion glosses over that.</p><p>8) How do the authors interpret the fact that the HER effect is present for global but nor for local deviants?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I found the Discussion section to be too sparse, especially for a general Neuro journal like <italic>eLife</italic>. I encourage the authors to add a discussion of the implications of these data to our understanding of the consciousness state of MCS and UWS patients. Similarly, the intro should have motivated the specific paradigm used here (local-global) in more detail. Why is this a particularly useful stimulus?</p><p>From an applied perspective – Effects were perhaps present at the group level but the patients show so much variability (more than the two control groups..)….what is the vision for using an approach like this to diagnose consciousness?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Conscious processing of global and local auditory irregularities causes differentiated heartbeat-evoked responses&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Andrew King (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are key remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The post-hoc decision to remove the control data is worrying, especially since the data we originally saw raised some concerns that undermined the main conclusions in the manuscript. The justification for setting the exclusion criteria as they were is not very clear, and instead, it is preferable for the control group data to be improved (e.g. by acquiring appropriate data) and re-included.</p><p>2) Additionally, it is difficult to evaluate the nature of any effects since no scalp level (time domain) data are being presented.</p><p>3) Please also see comments from Reviewer 2 below regarding clarification and interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper investigates the ERPs and HERs evoked in a global/local MMN paradigm in MCS and UWS patients. The critical claim is that local and global effects produce distinct ERPs and HERs for the two groups of patients, which can help distinguish between them and hence improve diagnosis.</p><p>It would be really important to understand how much HERs improve diagnosis above and beyond ERPs. If so, this would be potentially very impactful in clinical practice. By eye-balling 2B, 3B, and 4A, it seems that it might be the case but we'd need some quantification for how much more that is to be fully convinced.</p><p>I thought that the description of the results lacked some context and interpretation. More specifically, I was hoping to see more of &quot;in order to test hypothesis X we performed the following analysis… We found Y which means Z&quot;. This applies to all results figures.</p><p>In Figures 2B and 3B, it's unclear what exactly is meant by &quot;the clustered effects were combined into a single value&quot; – can the authors clarify what the computation is? Averaged across time points, or something else?</p><p>&quot;The local effect, as evaluated with HERs, showed a better separability between MCS and UWS patients, and a greater specificity with respect to surrogate heartbeat analysis.&quot; Unclear what is the data/figure/analysis that supports this claim – table 2, Figure 4D? Suggest making this explicit either in the discussion or results.</p><p>&quot;Nevertheless, the measured responses in ERPs and HERs do not separate MCS and UWS patients' groups completely – do we have a quantification of the degree of overlap?&quot; Figure 4 is illustrative but it would be good to have some sort of quantification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This revised manuscript differs substantially from the originally submitted manuscript. A Post Hoc inclusion criterion imposed on the data resulted in the removal of the control group altogether. I do not think this is correct to do. That group was important to allow one to compare responses in patients relative to controls. The appropriate course of action, if it is deemed that original data were not of sufficient quality is to collect more data.</p><p>This, and the fact that ERP responses are not plotted (e.g. in Figure 2, 3) make it very difficult to interpret findings.</p><p>I am not an expert in heart-brain interactions (but am an expert in EEG/auditory oddball responses) and found it very difficult to evaluate the results without seeing the actual EEG time-domain data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75352.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We found the work potentially very interesting, however several key issues, critical for supporting the claims in this paper, were identified.

However, those methodologies may not be accessible in all clinical setups, because of costs or medical contraindications. The foregoing evidence of EEG-based techniques to diagnose consciousness (Bai et al., 2021; Engemann et al., 2018) shows promising and low-cost opportunities to develop diagnostic methods that can capture residual consciousness. Our results contribute more evidence of the potential of EEG as a diagnostic tool, but also to the role of visceral signals in consciousness (Azzalini et al., 2019; Candia-Rivera, 2022; Sattin et al., 2020). This study gives evidence that HERs detect auditory conscious perception, in addition to the residual signs of consciousness in resting-state (Candia-Rivera et al., 2021a).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Methodology:</p><p>1) ECG signals were determined using ICA on scalp EEG rather than actual electrodes on the chest?

Note that the use of ICA-ECG instead of a standard ECG measured from the rib cage was successfully used in other two studies (Candia-Rivera et al., 2021a; Raimondo et al., 2017).

We have included a paragraph in the discussion about this:</p><p>“Note that outliers are expected in disorders of consciousness and exact physiological characterization of the different levels of consciousness remains challenging. First, the standard assessment of consciousness based on behavioral measures has shown a high rate of misdiagnosis in MCS and UWS (Stender et al., 2014). The cause of the misdiagnosis of consciousness arises because consciousness does not necessarily translate into overt behavior (Hermann et al., 2021). Unresponsive and minimally conscious patients, namely non-behavioral MCS (Thibaut et al., 2021), represent the main diagnostic challenge in clinical practice. Second, some of these patients suffer from conditions that may translate to no response to stimuli, even in presence of consciousness. For instance, when they suffer from constant pain, fluctuations in arousal levels, or sensory impairments caused by brain damage (Chennu et al., 2013). Third, these patients were recorded in clinical setups, which may lead to a lower signal-to-noise ratio, and lead to biased measurements in evoked potentials (Clayson et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Related to the point above, it would be helpful to know how the variance of HER looks for the other 2 groups (EMCS and Healthy). Is there a relationship between HER variance and consciousness? If not, how to interpret this result?</p></disp-quote><p>It was shown in Candia-Rivera et al., 2021 (J Neurosci) in an independent cohort of UWS and MCS patients that HER variance in the right hemisphere contributed to the classification of these patients up to 87% accuracy. Importantly, HER variance in that specific scalp region do not separate by itself patients’ groups, and it rather contribute to all features used in the automatic classifier (HER average and variance in all channels at different timings between 200-400 ms). In this study we show that HER variance also may contribute to distinguish UWS and MCS patients. Likewise, that measure cannot fully separate these patients’ groups in this cohort.</p><p>Note that HER variance is a measure not explored before Candia-Rivera et al., 2021. Therefore, no further evidence exists on this marker in healthy participants, nor other paradigms. Given the sample size limitation of these groups in the initial inclusion criteria: EMCS (n=20) and healthy (n=10), and the new inclusion criteria did not include EMCS and healthy participants, we did not explore further differences on HER variance on those participants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>6) I was confused about the issues of specificity of HER differences vs straightforward prediction error differences in auditory evoked responses locked to the 5th sound.

In this study, we analyze HERs following the presentation of auditory irregularities, with special regard on distinguishing UWS (n=40) and MCS (n=46) patients. Note that the automated classification of this cohort was previously performed in another study (Raimondo et al., 2017). Therefore, our aim is to characterize the group-wise differences between UWS and MCS patients that may allow a multi-dimensional cognitive evaluation to infer the presence of consciousness (Sergent et al., 2017), but also complement the bedside diagnosis performed with neuroimaging methods that capture neural correlates of covert consciousness (Sanz et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) How do the authors interpret the fact that the HER effect is present for global but nor for local deviants?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, with the new analyses we now show that both, local and global responses exist.

Furthermore, the ERPs and HERs (both for the local and global effects) are uncorrelated in all possible comparisons (see Figure 4A), in addition to the results showing differentiation of clustering effects in HER and ERP (see Figure 4B). These results suggest that the neuronal mechanisms behind these ERPs and HERs responses are independent. In addition, we found that HER variance is higher in MCS patients than in UWS patients, as previously reported in resting state (Candia-Rivera et al., 2021a). Put together these results suggest that two different neuronal signatures differentiate MCS from UWS patients. A first process probed with HER variability differentiates, irrespective of the current stimulus type being processed. This first process originates from central and right temporal scalp areas and has been linked with social cognition but could also correspond to a self-consciousness-state marker (Candia-Rivera et al., 2021a). Second, a modulation of HER in response to local and global auditory irregularities. These responses present several properties related to a neural signature of conscious access to local and global deviant stimuli. Such ERPs and HERs modulations by conscious access to a new stimulus attribute may well correspond to a self-consciousness updating process occurring ‘downstream’ to conscious access (Sergent and Naccache, 2012), and enabled for instance in a global neuronal workspace architecture (Dehaene and Naccache, 2001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I found the Discussion section to be too sparse, especially for a general Neuro journal like eLife.

For instance, neural responses to heartbeats correlate with perception in a visual detection task (Park et al., 2014). Further evidence exists on somatosensory perception, where a higher detection of somatosensory stimuli occurs when the cardiac cycle is in diastole and it is reflected in HERs (Al et al., 2020). Evidence on heart transplanted patients shows that the ability of heartbeats sensation is reduced after surgery and recovered after one year, with the evolution of the heartbeats sensation recovery reflected in the neural responses to heartbeats as well (Salamone et al., 2020). The responses to heartbeats also covary with self-perception: bodily-self-identification of the full body (Park et al., 2016), and face (Sel et al., 2017), and the self-relatedness of spontaneous thoughts (Babo-Rebelo et al., 2016) and imagination (Babo-Rebelo et al., 2019). Moreover, brain-heart interactions measured from heart rate variability correlate with conscious auditory perception as well (Banellis and Cruse, 2020; Pérez et al., 2021; Pfeiffer and Lucia, 2017).”</p><p>We have included a commentary on the clinical impact of our findings:</p><p>“A plethora of complementary neuroimaging techniques have been proposed to enhance the consciousness diagnosis, including anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (Kondziella et al., 2020; Sanz et al., 2021). However, those methodologies may not be accessible in all clinical setups, because of costs or medical contraindications. The foregoing evidence of EEG-based techniques to diagnose consciousness (Bai et al., 2021; Engemann et al., 2018) shows promising and low-cost opportunities to develop diagnostic methods that can capture residual consciousness. Our results contribute more evidence of the potential of EEG as a diagnostic tool, but also to the role of visceral signals in consciousness (Azzalini et al., 2019; Candia-Rivera, 2022; Sattin et al., 2020). This study gives evidence that HERs detect auditory conscious perception, in addition to the residual signs of consciousness in resting-state (Candia-Rivera et al., 2021a).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are key remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The post-hoc decision to remove the control data is worrying, especially since the data we originally saw raised some concerns that undermined the main conclusions in the manuscript. The justification for setting the exclusion criteria as they were is not very clear, and instead, it is preferable for the control group data to be improved (e.g. by acquiring appropriate data) and re-included.</p><p>2) Additionally, it is difficult to evaluate the nature of any effects since no scalp level (time domain) data are being presented.</p><p>3) Please also see comments from Reviewer 2 below regarding clarification and interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the editor's comments and acknowledge that it would be ideal validating our results with a larger cohort. In the first revision, we recognized that the unrestricted inclusion criteria inadvertently compromised the statistical power of our study. Consequently, the results did not align with our expectations, particularly in relation to the healthy controls. This heterogeneity within the statistical analysis potentially led to an overestimation of the observed effects.</p><p>To address these issues, we decided to narrow our focus in the second version of this manuscript. We specifically targeted the population of interest, allowing us to investigate the underlying factors that differentiate MCS and UWS/VS patients. By refining the inclusion criteria, we were able to establish a clearer contrast between the two patients’ groups. This refinement facilitated a more accurate assessment of the impact of auditory irregularities on the measures of brain-heart interaction that were studied.</p><p>We understand the concerns raised about the exclusion of the healthy control group. In this revision, we have re-included them, but solely for qualitative analysis purposes. Our intention was to address the limitation of the current population by demonstrating that the new results obtained from comparing MCS and UWS/VS patients exhibit more reliable differences, as MCS generally align with the expected trends observed in healthy controls.</p><p>We fully acknowledge the potential concerns raised regarding the exclusion and subsequent re-inclusion of the healthy control group. In order to justify this decision, we would like to provide a detailed explanation of how it strengthens the robustness and validity of our findings.</p><p>Furthermore, we would like to stress that due to current circumstances, acquiring new data has become very challenging, particularly because some of the authors are no longer affiliated with the laboratory where this study was conducted.</p><p>Considering these justifications, we kindly request that you consider our rationale for including healthy controls in the study analysis during the second revision of our manuscripts. We have prepared a revised version of the manuscript that incorporates the initial 11 healthy controls for qualitative analysis. We kindly request the editor and reviewers to evaluate our revised proposal, which we believe adequately addresses your concerns regarding our results. We believe that this decision significantly contributes to the methodological soundness and validity of our research.</p><p>Thank you for your time and consideration. We appreciated your valuable insights and feedback, which undoubtedly contributed to improving the quality of our study. Please find our responses to the specific comments from the reviewers below. The first and second points are further addressed in our responses to reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper investigates the ERPs and HERs evoked in a global/local MMN paradigm in MCS and UWS patients. The critical claim is that local and global effects produce distinct ERPs and HERs for the two groups of patients, which can help distinguish between them and hence improve diagnosis.</p><p>It would be really important to understand how much HERs improve diagnosis above and beyond ERPs. If so, this would be potentially very impactful in clinical practice. By eye-balling 2B, 3B, and 4A, it seems that it might be the case but we'd need some quantification for how much more that is to be fully convinced.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We have included a panel C in Figure 4 a new analysis performing a linear discriminant classifier to quantify the complementarity of the ERPs and HERs</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I thought that the description of the results lacked some context and interpretation. More specifically, I was hoping to see more of &quot;in order to test hypothesis X we performed the following analysis… We found Y which means Z&quot;. This applies to all results figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a short paragraph to explicitly state the objective of the study:</p><p>“In this study, we examined the cognitive processing of auditory irregularities in patients with disorders of consciousness using the local-global paradigm. This paradigm assesses the processing of both local (short-term) and global (long-term) auditory regularities. Our objective was to identify physiological responses that could differentiate between patients in MCS and those in UWS. We hypothesized that assessing auditory irregularities at both local and global levels could offer valuable insights into the distinction of MCS and UWS patients. Furthermore, this distinction may be further improved by analyzing the physiological modulation of auditory processing in relation to measures of brain-heart interactions. To achieve this, we conducted tests to investigate the local and global effects in ERPs, which involved analyzing the standard average of EEG epochs aligned with the occurrence of auditory deviants. Additionally, we explored the HERs to assess whether the neural responses to heartbeats, within the context of auditory irregularity processing, could serve as novel differentiating factors between MCS and UWS patients.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 2B and 3B, it's unclear what exactly is meant by &quot;the clustered effects were combined into a single value&quot; – can the authors clarify what the computation is? Averaged across time points, or something else?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have included a description of the averaging procedure, as follows:</p><p>“The clustered effects were combined to obtain a single value for each patient, corresponding to ERP global and local effects. To combine the clustered effects, we computed the average of all points (channel x time) identified in the cluster permutation analysis, which effectively distinguished between patients diagnosed with MCS and UWS.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The local effect, as evaluated with HERs, showed a better separability between MCS and UWS patients, and a greater specificity with respect to surrogate heartbeat analysis.&quot; Unclear what is the data/figure/analysis that supports this claim – table 2, Figure 4D? Suggest making this explicit either in the discussion or results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have included a description of that result, as follows:</p><p>“It is worth noting that the HER local effect demonstrated higher specificity compared to the HER global effect during the permutation test. Only 3% of randomly timed surrogate heartbeats exhibited separability that surpassed what was observed with the original heartbeats.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Nevertheless, the measured responses in ERPs and HERs do not separate MCS and UWS patients' groups completely – do we have a quantification of the degree of overlap?&quot; Figure 4 is illustrative but it would be good to have some sort of quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As mentioned above, we included a new analysis on patients’ classification. The overlap in classifications is shown in the confusion matrices in Figure 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This revised manuscript differs substantially from the originally submitted manuscript. A Post Hoc inclusion criterion imposed on the data resulted in the removal of the control group altogether. I do not think this is correct to do. That group was important to allow one to compare responses in patients relative to controls. The appropriate course of action, if it is deemed that original data were not of sufficient quality is to collect more data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment. We have made a few modifications to answer to the reviewer’s concerns.</p><p>In the new figures, we have incorporated the initial 11 healthy controls as a reference group. Although the healthy controls had fewer trials compared to the patients, we included them to provide context based on the new inclusion criteria. We have clarified this in the participants description as follows:</p><p>“The healthy controls participating in this study completed two blocks of the local-global paradigm, one XX and one XY. It is important to note that they were included solely as a reference group for qualitative analyses. The purpose of including healthy controls in our study was to determine if MCS patients exhibit similar trends in markers where a differentiation between MCS and UWS/VS patients was observed.”</p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, the healthy controls did not exhibit the expected trend in the measured HERs. However, with the analysis conducted using the new inclusion criteria, we observed different clustered effects between the comparisons of MCS and UWS, which also affected the trend observed in the healthy controls. In this revised version of the manuscript, we have included again the distributions of the healthy controls as a reference point.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that healthy controls exhibit a similar trend to MCS patients in ERP local, HER global, and HER local. However, the ERP global effect was the only feature that deviated from this trend, as discussed below:</p><p>“Furthermore, it is worth noting that the ERP global effect observed in healthy controls did not follow the same trend than MCS patients. These findings may require of further future explorations to determine if the observed effect is exclusive to MCS patients or if healthy controls do not exhibit the same effect due to their lower number of trials performed in the local-global paradigm during this study. However, the response observed in healthy controls does resemble a standard P300 response. These findings align with previous reports indicating that the ERPs during local deviants exhibit superior discriminatory ability between MCS and UWS patients (Faugeras et al., 2012). Furthermore, these results suggest that both ERP and HER in processing local auditory irregularities might be predominant for distinguishing between MCS and UWS. This notion is further supported by the higher accuracy of the linear discriminant classifier in classifying MCS and UWS patients by using ERP local and both HER global and local effects, as compared to all other possible feature combinations. Nonetheless, the inclusion of global effects marginally improved the classification performance, indicating that although the global effects are weaker than the local effects, they might provide complementary information to the local effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This, and the fact that ERP responses are not plotted (e.g. in Figure 2, 3) make it very difficult to interpret findings.</p><p>I am not an expert in heart-brain interactions (but am an expert in EEG/auditory oddball responses) and found it very difficult to evaluate the results without seeing the actual EEG time-domain data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As shown above, we have included a new panel C in the figures 2 and 3 with the time-varying responses for ERPs and HERs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
