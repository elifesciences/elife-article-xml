cortical microcircuit computations, but the significance of PV<sup>+</sup> axon myelination to the temporal features of inhibition remains elusive. Here, using toxic and genetic mouse models of demyelination and dysmyelination, respectively, we find that loss of compact myelin reduces PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron presynaptic terminals and increases failures, and the weak phasic inhibition of pyramidal neurons abolishes optogenetically driven gamma oscillations in vivo. Strikingly, during behaviors of quiet wakefulness selectively theta rhythms are amplified and accompanied by highly synchronized interictal epileptic discharges. In support of a causal role of impaired PV-mediated inhibition, optogenetic activation of myelin-deficient PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons attenuated the power of slow theta rhythms and limited interictal spike occurrence. Thus, myelination of PV axons is required to consolidate fast inhibition of pyramidal neurons and enable behavioral state-dependent modulation of local circuit synchronization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain contains billions of neurons that connect with each other via cable-like structures called axons. Axons transmit electrical impulses and are often wrapped in a fatty substance called myelin. This insulation increases the speed of nerve impulses and reduces the energy lost over long distances. Loss or damage of the myelin layer – as is the case for multiple sclerosis, a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system – can cause serious disability.</p><p>However, a fast-firing neuron within the brain, called PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron, has short, sparsely myelinated axons. Even so, PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons are powerful inhibitors that regulate important cognitive processes in gray matter areas, including the outermost parts, in the cortex. Yet it remains unclear how the unusual, patchy myelination affects their function.</p><p>To examine these questions, Dubey et al. used genetically engineered mice either lacking or losing myelin and studied the impact on PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons and slow brain waves. As mice progressively lost myelin, the speed of inhibitory signals from PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons did not change but their signal strength decreased. As a result, the power of slow brain waves, no longer inhibited by PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons, increased. These waves also triggered spikes of epileptic-like brain activity when the mice were inactive and quiet. Restoring the activity of myelin-deficient PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons helped to reverse these deficits.</p><p>This suggests that myelination, however patchy on PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons, is required to reach their full inhibitory potential. Moreover, the findings shed light on how myelin loss might underpin aberrant brain activity, which have been observed in people with multiple sclerosis. More research could help determine whether these epilepsy-like spikes could be a biomarker of multiple sclerosis and/or a target for developing new therapeutic strategies to limit cognitive impairments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parvalbumin interneuron</kwd><kwd>demyelination</kwd><kwd>neocortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG-1602-07777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kole</surname><given-names>Maarten HP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vici 865.17.003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kole</surname><given-names>Maarten HP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>013.18.002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kushner</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERA-NET</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JTC2018-024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kushner</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Demyelination disrupts fast inhibition of pyramidal neurons, thereby changing neocortical rhythms and causing the emergence of brief epileptic-like discharges.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>GABAergic interneurons play fundamental roles in controlling rhythmic activity patterns and the computational features of cortical circuits. Nearly half of the interneuron population in the neocortex is parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) and comprised mostly of the basket cell (BC) type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). PV<sup>+</sup> BCs are strongly and reciprocally connected with pyramidal neurons (PNs) and other interneurons, producing temporally precise and fast inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>). The computational operations of PV<sup>+</sup> BCs, increasing gain control, sharpness of orientation selectively, and feature selection in the sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zucca et al., 2017</xref>), are mediated by a range of unique molecular and cellular specializations. Their extensive axon collaterals targeting hundreds of PNs are anatomically arranged around the soma and dendrites, and electrotonically close to the axonal output site. In addition, the unique calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) sensor in PV<sup>+</sup> BCs terminals, synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2), is tightly coupled to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels mediating fast and synchronized release kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sommeijer and Levelt, 2012</xref>), powerfully shunting excitatory inputs and increasing the temporal precision of spike output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Somogyi et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomson et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Recent findings have shown that the proximal axons of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons are covered by myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peters and Proskauer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Somogyi et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). How interneuron myelination defines cortical inhibition remains, however, still poorly understood. Myelination of axons provides critical support for long-range signaling by reducing the local capacitance that results in rapid saltatory conduction and by maintaining the axonal metabolic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nave and Werner, 2014</xref>). For PV<sup>+</sup> BCs, however, the average path length between the axon initial segment (AIS) and release sites involved in local circuit inhibition is typically less than ~200 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Micheva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>), and theoretical and experimental studies indicate the acceleration by myelin may play only a limited role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Micheva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>). Another notable long-standing hypothesis is that myelination of PV<sup>+</sup> axons may be critical for the security and synchronous invasion of presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Somogyi et al., 1983</xref>). In support of a role in reliability, in Purkinje cell axons of the long Evans shaker (<italic>les</italic>) rat, which carries a deletion of <italic>Mbp</italic>, spike propagation shows failures and presynaptic terminals are disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barron et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, in a genetic model in which oligodendrocyte precursor cells lack the γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit, fast-spiking interneuron axons in the neocortex are aberrantly myelinated and feedforward inhibition is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benamer et al., 2020</xref>). At the network level, PV<sup>+</sup> BC-mediated feedback and feedforward inhibition is critical to produce local synchronization between PNs and interneuron at the gamma (γ) frequency (30–80 Hz), which is a key rhythm binding information from cell assemblies, allowing synaptic plasticity and higher cognitive processing of sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Veit et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we determined whether PV<sup>+</sup> BC-driven neocortical rhythms require myelination by using de- and dysmyelination models, studying the cellular properties of genetically labeled PV<sup>+</sup> BCs and examining the functional role of myelin by longitudinally examining the frequency spectrum of cortical oscillations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral state-dependent increase in theta power and interictal epileptiform discharges</title><p>We investigated in vivo cortical rhythms by recording local field potential (LFP) in layer 5 (L5) together with surface electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals from both primary somatosensory (S1) and visual (V1) areas. Freely moving mice (C57BL/6, 7–9 weeks at the start of the experiment) were recorded in their home cage every second week (18–24 hr/week) across an 8-week cuprizone treatment, inducing toxic loss of oligodendrocytes in white- and gray matter areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamada and Kole, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kipp et al., 2009</xref>). Remarkably, after 6 weeks of cuprizone feeding we detected high-voltage spike discharges (approximately five times the baseline voltage and ~50–300 ms in duration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>). These brief spike episodes on the ECoG and LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) occurred bilaterally and near synchronously in S1 and V1, resembling the interictal epileptiform discharges (also termed interictal spikes) that are a hallmark of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dubey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoffmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tóth et al., 2018</xref>). Automated detection of interictal spikes in the raw ECoG–LFP signal was performed with a machine-based learning classifier (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods), revealing a progressively increasing number of interictal spikes, from ~5/hr at 4 weeks up to ~70/hr at 8 weeks of cuprizone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Interestingly, interictal spikes were highly dependent on vigilance state and present exclusively during quiet wakefulness (30 out of 30 randomly selected LFP segments from awake or quiet wakefulness, chi-square test p&lt;0.0001, n = 6 cuprizone mice), with no other discernible association to specific behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> ). Whether the pathological cortical oscillations were specific to certain frequency bands, including gamma (γ, 30–80 Hz), was examined by plotting the power spectrum density of the LFP in S1 during periods of quiet wakefulness or active movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). During quiet wakefulness, LFP power in cuprizone-treated mice was selectively amplified in the theta frequency band (θ, 4–12 Hz, Šidák’s multiple comparisons test, p=0.0013, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In contrast, during active states when mice were moving and exploring no differences were observed in the power spectrum, in none of the frequency bands (Šidák’s multiple comparisons test, p&gt;0.166, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). Finally, to more firmly establish whether interictal epileptiform discharges result from the lack of myelin, we analyzed ECoG signals in the dysmyelinated shiverer mice (<italic>Mbp</italic><sup>Shi</sup>) lacking compact myelin due to a truncating mutation in <italic>Mbp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Readhead et al., 1987</xref>).

ECoG recordings at 8 weeks showed that in addition to ictal discharges interictal spikes were detected with a rate of ~1/min, comparable to cuprizone-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g and h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the waveform of interictal spikes in shiverer was substantially longer in duration (~100–500 ms), analysis of the power across the four frequency bands around interictal spikes revealed no difference in comparison to the cuprizone-treated mice (two-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] p=0.7875, n = 6 mice for both groups, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of compact myelin causes interictal spikes and behavioral state-dependent amplification of theta rhythms.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) and local field potential (LFP) recordings in freely moving mice.

Interictal discharges identified as spikes on the EEG are an important diagnostic criterium in epilepsy and reflect hypersynchronized burst firing of PNs and interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tóth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). The brief episodic and generalized nature of ECoG spikes we recorded in both demyelinated and dysmyelinated cortex (~50–500 ms in duration and ~1/min) resemble interictal spikes reported in epilepsy models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kleen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>) and are concordant with recordings in the hippocampus of cuprizone-treated mice by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoffmann et al., 2008</xref>. Here, we fundamentally extend the insights into interictal spikes by showing their spatiotemporal synchronization across cortical areas and hemispheres and a selective manifestation during the vigilance state of quiet wakefulness. During brain states of quiescence, for example, when whiskers are not moving, whole-cell in vivo recordings in the barrel cortex reveal low-frequency (&lt;10 Hz) highly synchronized membrane potential fluctuations of PNs and interneurons, during which fast-spiking PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons are dominating action potential firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gentet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poulet and Petersen, 2008</xref>). Consistent with the state-dependent increased activity of cortical interneuron firing, we found a selective amplification of the LFP theta power during quiet wakefulness, which may be explained by the reduced intrinsic excitability of PV<sup>+</sup> BCs and deficiency of fast inhibitory transmission in the demyelinated cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In support of this conjecture, optogenetic inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons in the normally myelinated cortex is sufficient to increase PN firing rates, elevating the power of slow oscillations and triggering epileptiform activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Veit et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). While our optogenetic activation of demyelinated PV<sup>+</sup> BCs normalized the power in the theta bandwidth, these interneurons are not critical for generating theta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>). Physiological theta oscillations are strongly driven by the long-range corticothalamic circuitry and cortical PN firing during non-rapid eye movement (NREM), also called thalamocortical spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steriade, 1997</xref>). Interestingly, recordings in epilepsy patients showed that interictal discharges occur frequently during NREM sleep stages and coupled with the spindle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dahal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ujma et al., 2017</xref>). Whether interictal spike-spindle coupling occurs in cuprizone-treated mice or specific sleep stages are affected is not known, but the present results warrant investigation of the corticothalamic loop in the generation of interictal discharges during demyelination.</p><p>A major limitation of the experimental toolbox available to experimentally study myelination is the lack of axon- or cell-type selectivity. Whether amplified theta- and abolished gamma-frequency oscillations are the consequence of PV<sup>+</sup> axon demyelination, the loss of excitatory axon myelination or the combination thereof, remains to be further examined when more refined genetic or molecular methods become available to interrogate oligodendroglial myelination of specific cell types. In the absence of such strategies, however, our in vivo experiments optogenetically driving selectively PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons or activating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) uncover important converging evidence for a role of interneurons in the amplification and synchronization of slow oscillations and epileptic discharges. Interestingly, while tonically driving action potential firing in myelin-deficient PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons with optogenetic activation was able to rescue theta hypersynchrony, using a 30 Hz stimulation regime failed to entrain the LFP in the low-gamma frequency. This may suggest that for gamma, precisely timed spike generation of PV<sup>+</sup> BCs alone is insufficient and may require in addition synchronized inhibitory synaptic transmission, which is selectively reduced in demyelinated PV<sup>+</sup> BCs. Alternatively, a specific circuit connectivity or presynaptic GABA release dynamics may be lost in cuprizone-treated mice. In future studies, the role of myelination could be further examined by exploring whether remyelination restores the ability of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons to modulate gamma oscillations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Myelination of PV<sup>+</sup> axons determines synapse assembly and maintenance</title><p>The requirement of myelination of PV<sup>+</sup> BCs to generate gamma rhythms is surprising in view of its sparse distribution in patches of ~25 µm across &lt;5% of the total axon length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Micheva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stedehouder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The sparseness of interneuron myelination previously raised the question whether myelin speeds conduction velocity in these axon types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stedehouder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stedehouder and Kushner, 2017</xref>). In a genetic mouse model with aberrant myelin patterns along fast-spiking interneuron axons, the inferred conduction velocity was reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benamer et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, we found that the average uIPSC latency (~800 µs) in completely demyelinated axons was normal and well within the range of previous paired recordings between myelinated PV<sup>+</sup> BC and PNs (700–900 µs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miles, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rossignol et al., 2013</xref>). Assuming a typical axonal path length of ~200 µm between the AIS and presynaptic terminals connected with a PN, combined with an ~250 µs delay for transmitter release, the calculated conduction velocity would be 0.4 m/s, consistent with optically recorded velocities in these axons (~0.5 m/s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casale et al., 2015</xref>). Our paired recordings, made near physiological temperature (34–36°C), may have had a limited resolution to detect temporal differences and are not excluding changes in the order of microseconds. To study submillicecond changes, it may be necessary to employ simultaneous somatic and axonal whole-cell recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu and Jonas, 2014</xref>) and/or high-resolution anatomical analysis of myelin along the axon path, which recently showed a small albeit positive correlation between percentage of myelination and conduction velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Micheva et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, conduction velocity tuning by myelination of GABAergic axons may become more readily apparent for long-range projections. Another constraint of the present study is the lack of information on the nodes of Ranvier along demyelinated PV<sup>+</sup> BC axons. Aberrant interneuron myelin development, causing myelination of branch points, impairs the formation of nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benamer et al., 2020</xref>). Reorganization of nodal voltage-gated ion channel clustering also occurs with the loss of myelin or oligodendroglial-secreting factors causing deficits in action potential propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freeman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lubetzki et al., 2020</xref>).

All mice were kept on a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle (lights on at 07:00, lights off at 19:00) with ad libitum food and water. For cuprizone treatment, either PV-Cre; Ai14 or C57BL/6 male or female mice, from 7 to 9 weeks of age, were fed ad libitum with normal chow food (control group) or were provided 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone (Bis(cyclohexanone)oxaldihydrazone, C9012, Merck) added either to grinded powder food or to freshly prepared food pellets (cuprizone group). Cuprizone-containing food was freshly prepared during every second or third day for the entire duration of the treatment (6–9 weeks). The average maximum weight loss during cuprizone feeding was ~11% (n = 31). All animal experiments were done in compliance with the European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/EU effective from 1 January 2013. The experimental design and ethics were evaluated and approved by the national committee of animal experiments (CCD, application number AVD 80100 2017 2426). The animal experimental protocols were designed to minimize suffering and approved and monitored by the animal welfare body (IvD, protocol numbers NIN17.21.04, NIN18.21.02, NIN18.21.05, NIN19.21.04, and NIN20.21.02) of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Science (KNAW).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>In vitro electrophysiology</title><p>Mice were briefly anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and decapitated or received a terminal dose of pentobarbital natrium (5 mg/kg) and were transcardially perfused with ice-cold artificial CSF (aCSF) of the composition (in mM): 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 6 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 kynurenic acid, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4. After decapitation, the brain was quickly removed from the skull and parasagittal sections (300 or 400 µm) containing the S1 cut in ice-cold aCSF (as above) using a vibratome (1200S, Leica Microsystems). After a recovery period for 30 min at 35°C, brain slices were stored at room temperature. For patch-clamp recordings, slices were transferred to an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus Nederland) equipped with oblique illumination optics (WI-OBCD; numerical aperture, 0.8). The microscope bath was perfused with oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) aCSF consisting of the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 25 D-glucose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

The access resistance was typically &lt;20 MΩ and fully compensated for bridge balance and pipette capacitance. All reported membrane potentials were corrected for experimentally determined junction potential of –14 mV.

Both the slow- and fast pipette capacitance compensation were applied, and series resistance compensated to ~80–90%. Patch pipettes were filled with high chloride solution containing (in mM) 70 K-gluconate, 70 KCl, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 MgATP, 4 K-phosphocreatine, 0.4 GTP, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH, 285 mOsmol/kg and IPSCs isolated by the presence of the glutamate receptor blockers 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 20 µM), d-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (d-AP5, 50 µM) and the sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 µM Tocris). Individual traces (5 s duration) were filtered with a high-pass filter of 0.2 Hz and decimated in AxoGraph software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014284">SCR_014284</ext-link>). Chart recordings of mIPSCs were analyzed with a representative 30 ms IPSC template using the automatic event detection tool of AxoGraph. Detected events were aligned and averaged for further analysis of inter-event intervals (frequency) and peak amplitude. For mEPSC recordings from PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons, we filled patch pipettes with a solution containing (in mM) 130 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 4 Mg- ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP, 10 HEPES, and 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH, 280 mOsmol/kg and both gabazine (4 µM) and TTX (1 μM) were added to the bath solution. The mEPSCs were analyzed using events detection tool in AxoGraph.

Only responses with 2× S.D. of baseline noise were considered being connected. Both fast and slow capacitances were fully compensated, series resistance compensation was applied to ~80–90%, and the current and voltage traces acquired at 50 kHz. For stable recordings with &gt;50 uIPSCs, the episodes were temporally aligned to the AP and the uIPSCs were fit with a multiexponential function in Igor Pro. The curve fitting detected the baseline, uIPSC onset, rise time, peak amplitude, and decay time and was manually monitored. Fits were either accepted or rejected (e.g., when artifacts were present) and the number of uIPSC failures was noted for each recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vitro optogenetics</title><p>50 nL of AAV1 particles (titer 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> cfu/mL) produced from pAAV-EF1a-double-floxed-hChR2(H134)-EYFP-WPRE-HGHpA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.addgene.org/">Addgene.org</ext-link> #20298, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_20298">Addgene_20298</ext-link>) was injected into L5 of S1 (coordinates from bregma; AP 0.15 mm, ML 0.30 mm, and DL 0.75 mm) of 6–9-week-old PV-Cre; Ai14 mice. About 7 days after the injection, a subset of mice was placed on 0.2% cuprizone diet for 8–9 weeks. PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons expressing hChR2 were identified using td-tom and YFP co-expression. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from L5 PNs and oIPSCs were evoked with a X-cite 120Q, fluorescent lamp using filter BA460-510 (Olympus) in the presence of CNQX (50 µM) and dAP5 (20 µM) in the bath solution. The oIPSCs were evoked by illumination of large field with five light pulses of each 1 ms and 100 ms apart. Peak amplitude and area under the curve (charge) of oIPSC were quantified using AxoGraph. Only the first pulse was used for the quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo electrophysiology and automated event detection</title><p>Chronic ECoG and LFP recordings were performed using in-house-made electrodes of platinum-iridium wire (101R-5T, 90% Pt, 10% Ir, complete diameter of 200 µm with 127 µm metal diameter, Science Products). The perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFA)-coated wire platinum-iridium wire was only exposed at the tip to record the LFP. For placement of the recording electrode, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (3%, flow rate 0.8 L/min with maintenance 1.5–1.8%, flow rate 0.6 L/min). A 1 cm midline sagittal incision was made starting above the interaural line and extending along the neck to create a pocket for subcutaneous placement of the transmitter along the dorsal flank of the animal. The recording electrodes in each hemisphere (stereotaxic coordinates relative to bregma: S1; –0.15 mm anterior and ±0.30 mm lateral; for LFP; ventral 0.75 mm, V1; 0.40 mm anterior and ±0.30 mm lateral; for LFP; ventral 0.75 mm) and ground electrode (6 mm posterior and 1 mm lateral) were implanted subdurally through small holes drilled in the skull, held in place with stainless steel screws (A2-70, Jeveka), and subsequently sealed with dental cement. Mice were provided with Metachem analgesic (0.1 mg per kg) after surgery and allowed to recover for 4–7 days before recordings. To obtain multiple hours recordings of ECoG-LFP at multiple weeks, mice remained in their home cage during an overnight recording session. ECoG-LFP data were collected using a ME2100-system (Multi Channel Systems); ECoG-LFP data were acquired at a sampling rate of 2 kHz using the multi-channel experimenter software (Multi Channel Systems). An additional 0.1–200 Hz digital bandpass filter was applied before data analysis. Large noise signals, due to excessive locomotion or grooming, were manually removed from the data. The ECoG and LFP recordings were processed offline with the Neuroarchiver tool (Open Source Instruments, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.opensourceinstruments.com/Electronics/A3018/Seizure_Detection.html">http://www.opensourceinstruments.com/Electronics/A3018/Seizure_Detection.html</ext-link>). To detect interictal spikes, an event detection library was built as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dubey et al., 2018</xref>). During the initial learning phase of the library, the observer, if needed, overruled the identity of each new event by the algorithm until automated detection reached a false positive rate &lt;1%. Subsequently, the ECoG-LFP data were detected by using a single library across all ECoG-LFP recordings. For determining the interictal rate, only S1 LFP signals were used for quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo optogenetics with simultaneous ECoG-LFP recordings</title><p>50 nL of AAV1 particles (titer 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> cfu/mL) produced from pAAV-EF1a-double-floxed-hChR2(H134)-EYFP-WPRE-HGHpA (Addgene #20298, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_20298">Addgene_20298</ext-link>) was injected unilaterally into the L5 of S1 (coordinates from bregma; AP 0.15 mm, ML 0.30 mm, and DL 0.75 mm) of 6–9-week-old PV-Cre; Ai14 mice. ECoG-LFP electrode (stereotaxic coordinates relative to bregma: –0.15 mm anterior and ±0.30 mm lateral; for LFP; ventral 0.75 mm) and ground electrode (6 mm posterior and 1 mm lateral) were implanted through small holes drilled in the skull, held in place with stainless steel screws (A2-70, Jeveka). Through the drilled hole, a polished multimode optical fiber (FP200URT, Thorlabs) held in ceramic ferrule (CFLC230-10, Thorlabs) was driven into layer 5 and ~50 µm above virus injection site. Once optical fiber and electrode were correctly placed, the drilled hole subsequently sealed with dental cement. A blue fiber-coupled laser (473 nm, DPSS Laser T3, Shanghai Laser &amp; Optics Co.) was used to activate the ChR2. Cyclops LED Driver (Open Ephys), together with customized program, was used to design the on and off state of the laser. The driving signal from LED driver was also recorded at one of the empty channels in multichannel systems. This signal was used to estimate the blue light on or off condition. For gamma entrainment in S1, 40 pulses of blue light were flashed with 1 ms on and 28 ms off pulse.</p><p>To inhibit interictal spikes, 300 pulses of blue light were flashed with 1 s on and 100 ms off by manual activation of light pulses when periods of high interictal spikes were observed (&gt;10 interictals/min). Aged-matched control mice were stimulated during the resting phase of the EEG, which was estimated using online EMG signal and video observation. For interictal counts, 5 min LFP signals were used from before light stimulation, during, and post light stimulation. Interictals were detected using event detection library. For analysis of the cortical rhythms, epochs were extracted using 2 s window at the start and after 180 pulses of blue light. Epoch-containing interictals were not included in the analysis.</p><p>For pharmacology experiment, continuous LFP recordings of &gt;10–12 hr duration from the circadian quiet phase (from 19:00 to 09:00) of six cuprizone mice (7-week treatment) and three control mice were used for the analysis. To activate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in cuprizone-treated mice, we used diazepam (Centrafarm Nederland B.V) prepared in a 10% solution of (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclo-dextrin (Sigma-Aldrich). A nonsedative dose of 2 mg/kg diazepam was injected intraperitoneally, and data was acquired for a period of 10 hr, starting 15 min after injection of drug in control and cuprizone mice. The automated event detection library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was used to determine the event frequency before and after diazepam injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vivo power spectrum analysis</title><p>Power spectral density (PSD) analysis was done using multitaper PSD toolbox from Igor Pro 8.0 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link>). The absence of high-voltage activity in the EMG electrode was classified as quiet wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). For PSD analysis during interictal activity, a 2 s window was used to extract LFP signal epochs. Epochs from control animals were selected comparing the EMG activity with cuprizone EMG activity. The interictal activity itself was excluded from the analysis. Selected LFP epochs were bandpass filtered between different frequency bands; delta, δ (0.5–3 Hz), theta, θ (4–12 Hz), beta, β (12.5–25 Hz), and gamma, γ (30–80 Hz). Multitaper PSD function (Igor Pro 8.0) was applied to the filtered data to plot the power distribution within each frequency band. Area under the curve was measured for each frequency band to compare power density between the control and cuprizone groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>L5 PNs were filled with 10 mg/mL biocytin during whole-cell patch-clamp recording for at least 30 min.

When quantifying the axosomatic puncta, the soma was defined to extend into the apical dendrite maximally ~4 μm and a boundary was drawn around the maximum edges (ROI). For counting apical dendritic puncta, a 200 µm length of apical dendrite was selected as ROI. Linear immunofluorescent signals from ßIV-spectrin were identified as AIS and used as ROI. For all analyses, the RGB images were separated into single-color channels using the color deconvolution plugin in ImageJ. The single-color channel containing boutons signals was subjected to thresholding and particle filter of 0.5 μm. The threshold was saved and applied to all images in the same staining group. The boutons were selected by scanning through the 3D projection of ROI with 0.35 µm z-steps. Trained experimenters identified the boutons either by colocalization of the ROI and PV/Syt2 or direct contact of the two. The boutons were characterized as round spots with a minimal radius of 0.5 μm ranging to almost 2 μm. Three experimenters blinded to the identity of the experiment group independently replicated the results.

Is this because, even if action potentials are generated, the decrease in Syt2+ release sites results in insufficent GABA release onto the pyramidal cells?</p><p>(12) In Figure 5A legend, does the statement &quot;Blue light was switched on during high interictal activity (&gt;10 spikes/min).&quot; apply to all of the rest of the figure? If so, say so.</p><p>(13) Line 379: Shouldn't &quot;hypermyelinated&quot; read HYPOmyelinated&quot;?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study tests the presumption that demyelination of inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex impairs neuronal oscillations. This is an important hypothesis because the function of myelin to speed impulse conduction along long-distant projections in white matter seems irrelevant to short-distance communication by interneurons, and it has been suggested that grey matter myelin facilitates appropriate intercortical oscillations, notably γ oscillations that are strongly influenced by inhibitory interneurons.</p><p>The approach used is to induce demyelination by cuprizone administration and measure the effects on optogenetically-induced γ oscillations in vivo and patch clamp recording of IPSCs in brain slice. The results show demyelination is associated with increased interictal discharges detected by ECoG, which is indicative of hypersynchronized burst firing; increased theta oscillation power during quiet wakefulness, but not when mice were actively exploring; impaired inhibition without a measurable change in conduction velocity, a loss of PV+ BC presynaptic terminals, and impaired entrainment with activity induced by optogenetic stimulation at the γ frequency. The data provided on these points are compelling and evaluated by appropriate statistical tests.</p><p>The studies provide needed data on the effects of demyelination of interneurons, which expands understanding of the functions of myelin in grey matter and has clinical relevance to demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis.</p><p>A concern is that the system-wide demyelination is induced, not demyelination restricted specifically to the inhibitory neurons, but these difficulties are acknowledged in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Cognitive processing is thought to depend on theta and γ rhythms that are generated in part by inhibitory interneurons, notably parvalbumin-expressing cells. These interneurons are unusual in that they are wrapped by myelin over the proximal part of their axonal tree, even though the normal role of myelin (to speed conduction of the nerve impulse) seems irrelevant here because none of the axonal branches are very long.</p><p>Previous work by the Angulo group showed that disrupting the normal development of this myelin led to a weakening of the inhibition that these cells generate in excitatory pyramidal cells and thus led to cognitive changes. The current paper disrupts myelin in older animals by a different method – cuprizone – and also finds that this results in reduced inhibition, in part by increasing the cell capacitance and thus making the cell harder to excite, and in part by decreasing the number of release sites for the inhibitory transmitter GABA. Importantly the paper then goes on to assess how this affects the theta and γ rhythms generated in the cortex, and to show that the reduction of inhibition promotes epileptic seizures. The mechanisms are assessed using histology and immunohistochemistry (to quantify myelination, axon structure and transmitter release sites), electrophysiology (to assess synapse strength and cell spiking behavior), and optogenetics (to control the spiking of the cells).</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but the following points need to be clarified.</p><p>(1) For the reader to fully understand the effects on theta and γ rhythms, it would be useful to briefly summarise somewhere the circuitry that produces these oscillations.</p><p>(2) For clarity: state in the methods, and also early in the main text, that data are (I assume, from reading Table S1 legend) displayed as mean+/-s.e.m.

This is an important hypothesis because the function of myelin to speed impulse conduction along long-distant projections in white matter seems irrelevant to short-distance communication by interneurons, and it has been suggested that grey matter myelin facilitates appropriate intercortical oscillations, notably γ oscillations that are strongly influenced by inhibitory interneurons.</p><p>The approach used is to induce demyelination by cuprizone administration and measure the effects on optogenetically-induced γ oscillations in vivo and patch clamp recording of IPSCs in brain slice. The results show demyelination is associated with increased interictal discharges detected by ECoG, which is indicative of hypersynchronized burst firing; increased theta oscillation power during quiet wakefulness, but not when mice were actively exploring; impaired inhibition without a measurable change in conduction velocity, a loss of PV+ BC presynaptic terminals, and impaired entrainment with activity induced by optogenetic stimulation at the γ frequency. The data provided on these points are compelling and evaluated by appropriate statistical tests.</p><p>The studies provide needed data on the effects of demyelination of interneurons, which expands understanding of the functions of myelin in grey matter and has clinical relevance to demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis.</p><p>A concern is that the system-wide demyelination is induced, not demyelination restricted specifically to the inhibitory neurons, but these difficulties are acknowledged in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of the manuscript and fully agree that there is a need for cell-type specific demyelination methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Cognitive processing is thought to depend on theta and γ rhythms that are generated in part by inhibitory interneurons, notably parvalbumin-expressing cells. These interneurons are unusual in that they are wrapped by myelin over the proximal part of their axonal tree, even though the normal role of myelin (to speed conduction of the nerve impulse) seems irrelevant here because none of the axonal branches are very long.</p><p>Previous work by the Angulo group showed that disrupting the normal development of this myelin led to a weakening of the inhibition that these cells generate in excitatory pyramidal cells and thus led to cognitive changes. The current paper disrupts myelin in older animals by a different method – cuprizone – and also finds that this results in reduced inhibition, in part by increasing the cell capacitance and thus making the cell harder to excite, and in part by decreasing the number of release sites for the inhibitory transmitter GABA. Importantly the paper then goes on to assess how this affects the theta and γ rhythms generated in the cortex, and to show that the reduction of inhibition promotes epileptic seizures. The mechanisms are assessed using histology and immunohistochemistry (to quantify myelination, axon structure and transmitter release sites), electrophysiology (to assess synapse strength and cell spiking behavior), and optogenetics (to control the spiking of the cells).</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but the following points need to be clarified.</p><p>(1) For the reader to fully understand the effects on theta and γ rhythms, it would be useful to briefly summarise somewhere the circuitry that produces these oscillations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is important information and we have updated the text in the revised version.
