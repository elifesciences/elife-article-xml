chemotaxis. Loss-of-function variants of TREM2 are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Because abnormalities in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling have been observed in several AD models, we investigated TREM2 regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iPSC-microglia) with genetic deletion of TREM2. We found that iPSC-microglia lacking TREM2 (TREM2 KO) show exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to purinergic agonists, such as ADP, that shape microglial injury responses. This ADP hypersensitivity, driven by increased expression of P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors, results in greater release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum stores, which triggers sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Orai channels and alters cell motility in TREM2 KO microglia. Using iPSC-microglia expressing the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe, Salsa6f, we found that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> tunes motility to a greater extent in TREM2 KO microglia. Despite showing greater overall displacement, TREM2 KO microglia exhibit reduced directional chemotaxis along ADP gradients. Accordingly, the chemotactic defect in TREM2 KO microglia was rescued by reducing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> using a P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist. Our results show that loss of TREM2 confers a defect in microglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to purinergic signals, suggesting a window of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling for optimal microglial motility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iPSC-derived microglia</kwd><kwd>TREM2</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>P2Y receptor</kwd><kwd>Ca<sup>2+</sup>

Purinergic metabolites (ATP, ADP, UTP, UDP) in the brain constitute key signals driving microglial activation and chemotaxis, and are detected by microglial cells over concentrations ranging from hundreds of nM to μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davalos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Simone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Honda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koizumi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yegutkin, 2008</xref>). ATP released from both homeostatic and damaged cells is hydrolyzed locally by nucleosidases such as the ectonucleotidase NTPDase1 (CD39) or pyrophosphatase NPP1 to produce ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dissing-Olesen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Madry and Attwell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). ADP is then detected by P2Y purinergic receptors on microglia, causing IP<sub>3</sub>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen.

Consistent with this possibility, peak cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to partial store depletion with ADP and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> readdition was elevated in TREM2 KO microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To examine if the higher magnitude of SOCE in TREM2 KO cells is due to depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by ADP, we sequentially treated cells with ADP followed by ionomycin to completely release stores in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer. While TREM2 KO cells showed greater peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> with ADP as expected, the ionomycin Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak – which reflects the residual ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> pool – was significantly reduced, indicating that ADP depletes ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores to a greater extent in TREM2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similar results were obtained when residual ER store content was depleted using TG instead of ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).

Both WT and TREM2 KO microglia showed similar linear relationships between SOCE and store release, further suggesting that SOCE is activated by similar mechanisms in the two cell lines, but is recruited to a greater extent in TREM2 KO cells due to increased ER store release. We also note that increased sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> in TREM2 KO cells is unlikely to be due to differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump activity based on similar Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>), consistent with comparable transcriptomic expression of major SERCA and PM Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA) isoforms in WT and TREM2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, quantification of cumulative cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases after maximally depleting ER stores with ionomycin alone suggested that overall ER store content is not altered in microglia lacking TREM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

We find that sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in response to ADP regulates microglial process extension, motility speed, and turning behavior. A key observation in our study is that microglia lacking TREM2 are highly sensitive to ADP-mediated signaling and show exaggerated cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Using novel iPSC-microglia lines that express a ratiometric, genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe, Salsa6f, we found that the motility characteristics of human WT and TREM2 KO microglia are differentially tuned by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Informed by these discoveries, we were able to rescue chemotactic deficiencies in TREM2 KO microglia by dampening purinergic receptor signaling.</p><p>We provide several lines of evidence to show that hyper-responsiveness to purinergic ADP signaling in TREM2 KO microglia is driven primarily by increased purinergic P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor expression: (1) Ca<sup>2+</sup> response is completely abrogated in the presence of P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor inhibitors; (2) RNA-sequencing data shows significant increase in expression of P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor transcripts but minimal fold change in other regulators of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (IP3R, STIM, Orai, SERCA, and PMCA); and (3) labeling of surface P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors shows greater PM expression in the TREM2 KOs. Furthermore, functional assays rule out any role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance mechanisms or any difference in maximal IP<sub>3</sub> and SOCE activity as a cause of increased sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in TREM2 KO cells. Mechanistically, this increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is driven by enhanced IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated ER store release coupled to SOCE. Indeed, based on the dose–response curves for peak ADP-Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer, TREM2 KO cells have an EC<sub>50</sub> at least 10-fold lower than WT cells. As a functional consequence, TREM2 KO microglia exhibit a defect in turning behavior and show greater displacement over time despite moving with similar speeds as the WT cells. The increased frequency in turning in WT microglia (relative to TREM KO cells) reflects greater canceling of the velocity vectors, which take the direction of motility into account. This restricts cell motility to more confined regions, potentially allowing for more frequent path correction. It is important to note that these motility differences with ADP are observed after acute treatment and in the absence of any gradient.</p><p>Interestingly, deletion of TREM2 had no significant impact on scratch wound closure rates, over a time scale of 24 hr in the presence of a constant concentration of ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ilina and Friedl, 2009</xref>). However, we find in a directional chemotaxis assay toward a gradient of ADP concentration that TREM2 KO cells are unable to migrate as efficiently as WT cells, concordant with previous studies showing reduced migration of TREM2 KO cells toward Aβ plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McQuade et al., 2020</xref>). Enhanced ADP signaling likely abolishes the ability of TREM2 KO cells to distinguish gradations of the agonist, and this loss of gradient sensing results in an inability to perform directed migration. We speculate that increased ADP Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in TREM2 KO cells may result in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains that are no longer restricted to the cell region near to the highest ADP concentrations and disrupt the polarity of key signaling molecules that drive directed cell motility.</p><p>The amplitude and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals shape specificity of downstream cellular responses. Our experiments with ADP in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium revealed that a transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is insufficient to induce microglial motility in either WT or TREM2 KO cells. Previous studies have shown that mouse microglia with genetic deletion of STIM1 or Orai1 also show defects in cell migration to ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Michaelis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lim et al., 2017</xref>), likely because diminished SOCE renders them unable to sustain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to ATP. The dependence of motility on prolonged purinergic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals may thus be a general feature of microglia. In contrast, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient can initiate some process extension in TREM2 KO but not in WT microglia, suggesting a threshold for ADP signaling that is reached in KO but not WT cells, and highlighting subtle differences in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirement for motility and process extension in TREM2 KO microglia.</p><p>To directly monitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and motility simultaneously in individual cells, we developed a novel iPSC-microglia cell line expressing a genetically encoded, ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Salsa6f, a GCaMP6f-tdTomato fusion protein. Because Salsa6f allows simultaneous measurement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and tracking of processes, this Salsa6f iPSC line is likely to be a useful tool to dissect the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and the function of various iPSC-derived human cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. In addition, this line may be readily xenotransplanted for use with human/microglia chimeric models to examine functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to injury and pathology in vivo. Using Salsa6f-expressing microglia, we uncovered critical differences in how Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels tune motility in WT and TREM2 KO microglia. By tracking instantaneous velocity at the same time as Salsa6f Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratios in individual cells, we found that TREM2 KO cell motility showed a greater sensitivity to changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with significantly higher speeds than WT cells at lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a more dramatic reduction in cell speed at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. It is possible that high cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> serves as a temporary STOP signal in microglia similar to its effects on T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Negulescu et al., 1996</xref>); we further speculate that TREM2 KO cells may be more subject to this effect with ADP, given the higher expression of P2RY<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors. Accordingly, reducing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, resulted in increased mean speed, displacement, and straighter paths for TREM2 KO iPSC-microglia, but had no effect on these motility metrics in WT cells, suggesting that TREM2 KO cells may display a greater dynamic range in regulating their motility in response to sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations. Consistent with this observation, chemotaxis in TREM2 KO cells was restored by partially inhibiting P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors. In response to neurodegenerative disease, microglia downregulate P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krasemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sala Frigerio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lou et al., 2016</xref>). Active regulation of purinergic receptor expression is critical for sensing ADP gradients and decreasing motility near the chemotactic source. In vivo studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hasselmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krasemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McQuade et al., 2020</xref>) suggest that TREM2 KO microglia are unable to downregulate P2Y receptor expression upon activation, which may lead to the known chemotactic deficits in these cells.</p><p>The studies presented here provide evidence that reducing purinergic receptor activity may be clinically applicable in Alzheimer’s patients with TREM2 loss-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng-Hathaway et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parhizkar et al., 2019</xref>). Pharmacologically targeting P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors to dampen both the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (PLC) and -independent (DAG) arms of the GPCR signaling pathway may be useful to control microglial activation and motility. However, our results suggest that altering downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux may be sufficient, and thus, CRAC (Orai1) channel blockers that would specifically inhibit the sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals without affecting the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient or the activation of DAG may provide a more targeted approach.</p><p>Currently, TREM2 activating antibodies are being examined in early stage clinical trials for AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alector Inc, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), making it critically important to understand the broad consequences of TREM2 signaling. Therefore, an understanding of how TREM2 influences responses to purinergic signals and regulates cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in human iPSC-microglia is critical. Beyond TREM2, we have found that protective variants in MS4A6A and PLCG2 gene expression also decrease P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor expression (unpublished data), suggesting that this mechanism of microglial activation could be common across several microglial AD risk loci.</p><p>In summary, deletion of TREM2 renders iPSC-microglia highly sensitive to ADP, leading to prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which increases cell displacement by decreasing cell turning. Despite this, TREM2 KO microglia show a defect in chemotaxis that is likely due to their inability to sense ADP gradients and make appropriate course corrections. Decreasing purinergic signaling in TREM2 KO microglia rescues directional chemotactic migration. We suggest that purinergic modulation or direct modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling could provide novel therapeutic strategies in many AD patient populations, not solely those with reduced TREM2 function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

California, Irvine Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (UCI ADRC) Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Core from subject fibroblasts under approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and human Stem Cell Research Oversight (hSCRO) committee protocols. Informed consent was received from all participants who donated fibroblasts. Reprogramming was performed with nonintegrating Sendai virus in order to avoid integration effects. To validate the karyotype and identity of iPSC lines, cells were examined via Microarray-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH, Cell Line Genetics). Sterility and confirmation of mycoplasma negativity was examined every 10 passages and proceeding experimentation via MycoAlert (Lonza). Pluripotency was verified by Pluritest Array Analysis and trilineage in vitro differentiation. Additional GFP- and RFP-αtubulin-expressing iPSC lines (AICS-0036 and AICS-0031-035) were purchased from Coriell and originally generated by Dr. Bruce Conklin. Each Coriell line is provided with a corresponding certificate of analysis that verifies the correct reporter sequence insertion site, lack of plasmid integration, growth rate, expression of pluripotency markers, normal karyotype, sterility including mycoplasma negative, and identity of line via short tandem repeat (STR).

Briefly, iPSCs were nucleofected with ribonucleoprotein complex targeting the second exon of TREM2 and allowed to recover overnight. Transfected cells were dissociated with pre-warmed Accutase then mechanically plated to 96-well plates for clonal expansion. Genomic DNA from each colony was amplified and sequenced at the cut site. The amplification from promising clones was transformed via TOPO cloning for allelic sequencing. Knockout of TREM2 was validated by Western blotting (AF1828, R&amp;D) and HTRF (Cisbio) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McQuade et al., 2020</xref>). A similar strategy was used to delete ORAI1 using an RNP complex of Cas9 protein coupled with a guide RNA (5′ <named-content content-type="sequence">cgctgaccacgactacccac</named-content>) targeting the second exon of ORAI1. The resulting ORAI1 clones were then validated to exhibit a normal for karyotype, identity, pluripotency, and sterility via Microarray-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH, Cell Line Genetics), tri-lineage differentiation, and MycoAlert mycoplasma testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>iPSC-microglia differentiation</title><p>iPSC-microglia were generated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McQuade et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McQuade and Blurton-Jones, 2021</xref>.

Cells were washed with medium to remove excess dye, and 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> Ringer’s solution was added to the 35 mm dish before being mounted on the microscope for live-cell imaging. We note that iPSC-microglia are sensitive to shear forces and produce brief Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to solution exchange that are dependent on extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and that these are more prominent at 37°C. To minimize these confounding effects, cells were imaged at RT and perfusion was performed gently. Salsa6f-expressing iPSC-microglia were prepared for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in the same way as conventional microglia, but without the dye loading steps. The following buffers were used for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging: (1) 1 or 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> Ringer’s solution comprising 155 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH); (2) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free Ringer’s solution containing 155 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Live-cell imaging was performed as described earlier. Cells were treated with ADP as indicated in the ‘Results’ section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>Time-lapse images were acquired in a single Z-plane at 512 × 512 pixels (X = 318.2 μm and Y = 318.2 μm) and at 2–3 s time intervals using Olympus FV3000 software. Images were time averaged over three frames to generate a rolling average and saved as .OIR files.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Time-lapse videos were exported to Fiji-(ImageJ; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Fiji">https://imagej.net/Fiji</ext-link>), converted to TIFF files (16-bit), and background-subtracted. Single-cell analysis was performed by drawing ROIs around individual cells in the field, and average pixel intensities in the green and red channels were calculated for each ROI at each time point. GCaMP6f/ TdTomato (G/R Ratio) and Fluo-4/Fura-red ratio was then obtained to further generate traces showing single-cell and average changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> over time. Single-cell ratio values were used to calculate peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and responses at specific time points after agonist application as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jairaman and Cahalan, 2021</xref>). Peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal for each cell was baseline-subtracted, which was calculated as an average of 10 minimum ratio values before application of agonist. SOCE rate was calculated as Δ(ratio)/Δt(s<sup>–1</sup>) over a 10 s time frame of maximum initial rise after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addback. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the AUC function in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Microglia process extension analysis</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>GFP-expressing iPSC-microglia were plated overnight on 35 mm glass-bottom dishes at 40–50% confluence. Cells were imaged by excitation of GFP on the confocal microscope at 37°C as described earlier. To study process extension in response to ADP, two sets of GFP images were obtained for each field of view across multiple dishes: before addition of ADP (baseline) and 30 min after application of ADP. Images were acquired as a Z-stack using the Galvo scanner at Nyquist sampling. Adjacent fields of view were combined using the Stitching function of the Olympus FV3000 Software and saved as .OIR files.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Process analysis</title><p>The basic workflow for microglia process analysis was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morrison et al., 2017</xref>. Image stacks (.OIR files) were exported to Fiji (ImageJ) and converted into 16-bit TIFF files using the Olympus Viewer Plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/OlympusImageJPlugin">https://imagej.net/OlympusImageJPlugin</ext-link>). Maximum intensity projection (MIP) image from each Z-stack was used for further processing and analysis. MIP images were converted to 8-bit grayscale images, to which a threshold was applied to obtain 8-bit binary images. The same threshold was used for all sets of images, both before and after ADP application. Noise reduction was performed on the binary images using the Process -&gt; Noise -&gt; Unspeckle function. Outlier pixels were eliminated using Process -&gt; Noise -&gt; Outliers function. The binary images were then skeletonized using the Skeletonize2D/3D Plugin for ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/plugins/skeletonize3d">https://imagej.net/plugins/skeletonize3d</ext-link>). Sparingly, manual segmentation was used to separate a single skeleton that was part of two cells touching each other. The Analyze Skeleton Plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/plugins/analyze-skeleton/">https://imagej.net/plugins/analyze-skeleton/</ext-link>) was then applied to the skeletonized images to obtain parameters related to process length and number of branches for each cell in the imaging field. Processes were considered to be skeletons &gt; 8 μm. The data was summarized as average process length and number of branches, before and after ADP application for a specific imaging field, normalized to the number of cells in the field that allowed for pairwise comparison. Additionally, single-cell data across all experiments were also compared in some instances.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>IP<sub>3</sub> uncaging</title><p>Whole-field uncaging of i-IP<sub>3</sub>, a poorly metabolized IP<sub>3</sub> analog, was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lock et al., 2016</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, iPSC-microglia were loaded for 20 min at 37°C with either Cal520 AM or Cal590 AM (5 μM, AAT Bioquest), and the cell-permeable, caged i-IP<sub>3</sub> analog ci-IP<sub>3</sub>/PM (1 μM, SiChem) plus 0.1% Pluronic F-127 in Microglia Basal Medium. Cells were washed and incubated in the dark for further 30 min in a HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS) whose composition was (in mM) 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 2.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and pH 7.4. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) changes were imaged by employing a Nikon Eclipse T<italic>i</italic> microscope system (Nikon) equipped with a 40× oil immersion objective (NA 1.3; Nikon) and an Orca Flash 4.0LT CMOS camera (Hamamatsu). Cal520 or Cal590 were excited by a 488 or a 560 nm laser light source (Vortran Laser Technologies), respectively. i-IP3 uncaging was achieved by uniformly exposing the imaged cells to a single flash of ultraviolet (UV) light (350–400 nm) from a xenon arc lamp. UV flash duration, and thus the amount of released i-IP<sub>3</sub> was set by an electronically controlled shutter.</p><p>Image acquisition was performed by using Nikon NIS (Nikon) software. After conversion to stack TIFF files, image sequences were analyzed with Flika, a custom-written Python-based imaging analysis software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flika-org.github.io/">https://flika-org.github.io/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellefsen et al., 2014</xref>). After background subtraction, either Cal520 or Cal590 fluorescence changes of each cell were expressed as ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is the basal fluorescence intensity and ∆F the relative fluorescence change (F<sub>x</sub> – F<sub>0</sub>). Data are reported as superplots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lord et al., 2020</xref>) of at least three independent replicates. Experiments were reproduced with two independent lines.

Blocking was performed at RT for 1 hr in 5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton5 X-100. Primary antibodies were added at 1:200 overnight 4°C (IBA1, 019-19741, FUJIFILM Wako). Plates were washed 3× before addition of secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit 555, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Hoechst (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were captured on an Olympus FV3000RS confocal microscope with identical laser and detection settings. Images were analyzed with Imaris 9.7.0 software. We note that our attempt to verify Orai1 expression at the protein level was unsuccessful as the antibody used (Alomone, Cat# ALM-025, clone# 3F11/D10/B9) did not stain WT microglia in either immunostaining or western blot experiments.</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>iPSC-derived microglia were seeded on fibronectin-coated 12-well plates at 200,000 cells/well.

Fc receptors were blocked with a blocking buffer (BioLegend TruStain FcX in 1× PBS + 10% FCS). Cells were then incubated with Brilliant Violet 421-labeled anti-human P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antibody (clone S16001E, BioLegend, Cat# 392106) or with IgG2a isotype control antibody (clone MOPC-173, BioLegend, Cat# 400260) for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were washed, pelleted, and then resuspended in FACS buffer. Clone S16001E binds to the extracellular domain of the P2Y<sub>12</sub> and permits labeling of PM P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors.

Scratches were repeated 4× to remove all cells from the wound area. Scratch wound confluency was imaged every hour until scratch wound was closed (15 hr). Confluence of cells within the original wound ROI was calculated using IncuCyte 2020C software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Imaris cell tracking</title><p>For motility assays, iPSC-microglia were tracked using a combination of manual and automatic tracking in Imaris 9.7.0 software. For videos of GFP lines, cells were tracked using spot identification. For videos of Salsa6f lines, surface tracking was used to determine ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence and motility per cell. In both conditions, tracks were defined by Brownian motion with the maximum distance jump of 4 µm and 10 frame disturbance with no gap filling. Tracks shorter than 3 min in length were eliminated from analysis. After automated track formation, tracks underwent manual quality control to eliminate extraneous tracks, merge falsely distinct tracks, and add missed tracks. After export, data was plotted in Prism 9.1.0 or analyzed in Excel using DiPer Macros for Plot_At_Origin (translation of each trajectory to the origin) and MSD(t) = 4D(t-P(1-e^(-t/P))), where D is the diffusion coefficient, t is time, and P represents directional persistence time (time to cross from persistent directionality to random walk) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorelik and Gautreau, 2014</xref>). From Imaris, speed was calculated as instantaneous speed of the object (μm/s) as the scalar equivalent to object velocity. These values were transformed to μm /min as this time scale is more relevant for the changes we observed. Mean track speed represents the mean of all instantaneous speeds over the total time of tracking. 10 min displacement is calculated by (600) * (TDL/TD), where TDL is the track displacement length (distance between the first and last cell position) represented as TDL = p(n) - p(1) for all axes, where the vector p is the distance between the first and last object position along the selected axis, and TD is the track duration represented as TD = T(n) - T(1), where T is the time point of the first and final time point within the track. Frame-to-frame displacement is calculated as p(n) – p(n-1) for all the different frames in a cell track. Track straightness is defined as TDL/TL, where TDL is the track displacement as described above and TL is the track length representing the total length of displacements within the track TL = sum from t = 2 to n of |p(t)-p(t-1)|.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Generation of Salsa6f-expressing iPSC lines</title><p>iPSCs were collected following Accutase enzymatic digestion for 3 min at 37°C. 20,000 cells were resuspended in 100 μL nucleofection buffer from Human Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit 2 (Lonza). Salsa6f-AAVS1 SHL plasmid template (2 μg; Vector Builder) and RNP complex formed by incubating Alt-R S.p. HiFi Cas9 Nuclease V3 (50 μg; IDTDNA) was fused with crRNA:tracrRNA (IDTDNA) duplex for 15 min at 23°C. This complex was combined with the cellular suspension and nucleofected using the Amaxa Nucleofector program B-016. To recover, cells were plated in TeSR-E8 (STEMCELL Technologies) media with 0.25 μM thiazovivin (STEMCELL Technologies) and CloneR (STEMCELL Technologies) overnight. The following day, cells were mechanically replated to 96-well plates in TeSR-E8 media with 0.25 μM thiazovivin and CloneR supplement for clonal isolation and expansion. Plates were screened visually with a fluorescence microscope to identify TdTomato<sup>+</sup> clones. Genomic DNA was extracted from positive clones using Extracta DNA prep for PCR (Quantabio) and amplified using Taq PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to confirm diallelic integration of the Salsa6f cassette.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mohamed Trebak (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Reviewers had concerns on two broad aspects of the paper: the calcium signaling studies, and the results relating to cell motility. In addition, other concerns were raised which are described in the individual reviewer comments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more rigorous examination of protein expression should be performed with antibody validation to determine if there are compensatory changes at the protein level of other relevant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins (Figure 1 Suppl2) that could affect the results. Westerns should be performed for STIM1 and STIM2, Orai1 and IP3R 1/2/3, for which there are reliable Abs. Although the IF as performed for Orai1 is acceptable, the authors do not show positive and negative controls and a thorough validation of this Orai1Ab in IF. This is strongly recommended given the poor quality of Orai1 Abs in general. Likewise, staining for P2YR12 appears internal and the Ab should be validated. A WB on P2YR12 and P2RY13 in addition would help.</p><p>2) Important: It is clear that the TREM2 KO cells have significantly lower STIM1 expression, which would be expected to impact SOCE under conditions of physiological agonists stimulation (ADP, ATP). The conclusion based on maximal activation with thapsigargin does not address this issue. What is the impact of reduced STIM1 expression on the Ca signals and motility?</p><p>3) A Ca<sup>2+</sup> off/on protocol with ADP (Figure 1) as done for thapsigargin should be performed. In Figure 2B, ADP was applied in the absence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but sadly those recordings did not subsequently replenish Ca<sup>2+</sup> to gauge Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Low concentrations of Gd3+ (which should not alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> release) reduce the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release peak, suggesting that there is a contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to this initial response. Also, it would have been helpful to include in Figure 1 Suppl1 the control (non KO cells) in these experiments for reference.</p><p>4) The conclusion that SOCE is mediated by Orai1 should be validated with a genetic approach as 2-APB and La3+ are non-specific.</p><p>5) Conversely, it is not clear if store content is depleted to a greater extent following ADP receptor stimulation in the KO cells. Assess ER calcium content in response to ADP in WT and KO cells or with an ionomycin pulse.</p><p>6) Figure 3: The WT data in this figure don't include KO cells. How do the TREM2 KOs compare to WT in the scratch wound closure assay? The KO cells seem to be tested, but only in the absence of ADP (Figure 4 Sup 1A). Is there a difference in wound closure after ADP treatment? This point should be evaluated to assess the effects of altered ADP Ca signaling on non-directional cell movement in a physiologically relevant paradigm.</p><p>7) Terminology: The term &quot;Ca clamp&quot; in the way it has been used here could be misconstrued by readers. Cellular Ca is not clamped. It varies within each cell depending on the activity of the pumps and other clearance mechanisms in the cell. The motility measurements are simply done after extracellular Ca is restored to the cells after thapsigargin treatment, at time points where the cytosolic Ca is lower in 0.2 mM Ca compared to 2 mM Ca. This phrasing (Ca clamp) needs to be changed to eliminate confusion that cellular calcium is &quot;clamped&quot; analogous to voltage-clamp.</p><p>8) Figure 6D TREM2 KOs (but not WT) cells show differences in motility between 0.2 mM and 2 mM extracellular Ca even after thapsigargin treatment with no ADP exposure. This is strong indication that motility differences in TREM2 KO cells are due to more than just alterations in purinergic signaling. (Consistent with lack of additional ADP effects in Figure 6 Supplement 1). What is the role of these intrinsic changes in cell motility in response to cellular Ca elevations in the presence and absence of nucleotides?</p><p>9) Figure 6D: The data for WT cells should be directly compared to the KOs at each extracellular Ca concentration to dissect out differences in KO cells at each Ca condition.</p><p>10) The data in Figure 4K should be reanalyzed to compare differences in the absolute levels of branch complexity (# of branches and process length) in the two groups.</p><p>11) The apparent disconnect between the larger mean square distance travelled in the absence of nucleotides in the KO with no change in the mean speed needs to be clarified. Is this due to cancelling of speed vectors with opposite directions?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Figure 3: The WT data in this figure don't include KO cells. How do the KOs compare to the WT in the scratch wound closure assay? The KO cells seem to be tested, but only in the absence of ADP (Figure 4 Sup 1A). Is there a difference in wound closure after ADP treatment? This point should be evaluated to assess the effects of altered ADP Ca signaling on non-directional cell movement in a physiologically relevant paradigm.</p><p>2) Figure 4: This reviewer is not convinced that reduced turning accounts for the similar speed in the KO despite the larger mean square distance travelled. If turning is reduced and the mean square distance is doubled in the KO, then effectively, the average distance travelled over time (speed) should be greater in the KO than in the WT. The logic of this inference and how it explains the data (similar average speed but much greater root mean square displacement in the KO) needs to be better clarified. Since the mean square distance is so much larger, it suggests that the speed vectors with opposite directions are cancelling out in the KO cells to yield the same average velocity (which could theoretically even occur from increased, not decreased turning).</p><p>3) Figure 4K: It seems that the baseline branch complexity is low to start with in the KOs, hence the fold change from baseline seems larger. From the images shown, there appears to be no difference following ADP treatment between the two groups. This data should be reanalyzed to compare differences in the absolute levels of branch complexity (# of branches and process length) in the two groups.</p><p>4) The use of the term Ca clamp is misleading in the way it has been used here. Cellular Ca is, in fact, not clamped, but changes within each cell depending on the activity of pumps and other calcium clearance mechanisms. The motility measurements are simply done after extracellular Ca is restored to cells after thapsigargin treatment, at time points where the cytosolic Ca is lower in 0.2 mM Cacompared to 2 mM Ca. This phrasing (Ca clamp) needs to be changed to eliminate confusion that cellular Ca levels are &quot;clamped&quot; to defined values analogous to voltage clamp.</p><p>5) Figure 6D: It is noteworthy that TREM2 KOs, but not WT cells, show differences in motility between 0.2 mM and 2 mM extracellular Ca even after thapsigargin treatment with no ADP exposure. This is strong suggestion that motility differences in TREM2 KO cells are due to more than just alterations in purinergic signaling. In fact, this inference is consistent by the lack of additional effects of adding ADP in Figure 6 Supplement 1. These intrinsic changes in cell motility in response to cellular Ca elevations need further clarification.</p><p>6) Figure 6D: Related to this figure, the data for WT cells should be directly compared to the KOs at each extracellular Ca concentration to dissect out differences in KO cells at each Ca condition.</p><p>Other:</p><p>– Stim1 is expressed at different levels between the WT and TREM2 KO. It has a significant p-value (Figure 1 Sup2D). This decrease could affect multiple aspects of microglia including cell motility in the presence of physiologically relevant agonists. This needs to be addressed.</p><p>– A technical point related to Figure 4 is that figures 4C and 4G should be labelled &quot;velocity&quot; rather than speed, as it seems the only way in which the mean squared distance can be twice as large in the KO but not the velocity if the speed vectors with opposite directions are cancelling out in the KO.</p><p>– The dose of ADP used in Figure 7 is extremely high. 100ng/mL (which is 234uM by my calculation). By contrast, Figure 4 used 2.5uM. The 100 fold higher concentration in the chemotaxis assay needs to be justified. Further, it should be determined whether the ADP used diffuses into both chambers might be expected. This super high dose of ADP may have non-physiological effects that could explain the seemingly differing phenotypes in Figures 4 and 7.</p><p>– Figure 5 is a great set of experiments to show that the Salsa6f does not affect end points of the study, but may be better as a supplementary figure rather than a main figure. If the paper is about the TREM2 KO versus WT then the main figures should stick with looking at differences between the two with maybe a sub figure to show validation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– A more rigorous approach could be used to document the presence or absence of compensatory changes at the protein protein level of other Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins (Figure 1 Suppl2). Preferably Westerns should be performed for STIM1 and STIM2, Orai1 and IP3R 1/2/3, for which there are reliable Abs. Although IF as performed for Orai1 is acceptable, the authors do not show positive and negative controls and a thorough validation of this Orai1Ab in IF.</p><p>– Along the same lines as comment above, Staining for P2YR12 appears internal. Has the Ab been validated? Can authors perform a WB on P2YR12 and P2RY13 in addition?</p><p>– Did the authors check on whether the expression of SECRA is altered at the protein level? Did the authors perform CRAC channel recordings in Control and TREM2 KO cells?</p><p>– It is quite surprising that the authors did not opt to use the Ca<sup>2+</sup> off/on protocol with ADP (Figure 1) as they have done with thapsigargin. In Figure 2B, ADP was applied in the absence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but sadly those recordings did not subsequently replenish Ca<sup>2+</sup> to gauge Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. One can rationalize the result of 2-APB (Figure 1 Suppl1), a non-specific channel blocker that also inhibits IP3Rs. However, the fact that low concentrations of Gd3+ (which should not alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> release) reduce the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release peak, suggests that there is a contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to this initial response. Also, it would have been helpful to include in Figure 1 Suppl1 the control (non KO cells) in these experiments for reference.</p><p>Additional thoughts to the attention of the authors:</p><p>– The authors have speculated on the fact that increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> might lead to a &quot;spill&quot; outside the restricted Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomain, thus disrupting polarity. Do the authors have any evidence of altered location of leading edge vs trailing edge proteins or focal adhesion proteins in TREM2 KO cells?</p><p>– Have the authors performed RNAseq on WT control and TREM2 KO cells? If so, does pathway analysis shows changes in the Cell motility genes between these two groups? This might offer some interesting clues to pursue in future studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study by Jairaman et al. describes how iPSC-derived microglia exhibit exaggerated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to ADP stimulation in TREM2KO cells, and that this leads to a defect in turning behaviour and hence no directed migration to a chemotactic signal.</p><p>Overall, the experiments are well conducted, carefully controlled and the findings are new and exciting. The authors nicely dissect out the underlying molecular basis for the exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to ADP and then extend their findings to cell movement and directed migration. Given the substantial body of evidence linking microglia to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and the role for TREM2, the work by Jairaman et al. is of translational significance. As an aside, the introduction of the calcium-sensitive reporter Salsa6F is a welcome new tool in the arsenal for recording cytosolic calcium. Overall, this is an elegant, novel and important study. Nevertheless, I have a few comments/suggestions.</p><p>1. The authors argue that the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateau to ADP in TREM2KO cells is due to enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the stores ie greater store depletion. Evidence is presented that maximal SOCE is not compromised in TREM2KO cells, that store content under resting conditions is unaffected, InsP3R activities are similar. But the authors do not demonstrate that store content falls more following ADP receptor stimulation in the KO cells. This could be shown by directly measuring ER calcium to ADP in WT and KO cells or by applying ADP in Ca-free solution and then assessing store content with an ionomycin pulse. The ionomycin response should be smaller in the TREM2KO cells, after ADP exposure.</p><p>2. The authors suggest that an increase in P2Y12 and P2Y13 receptor expression in the KO cells accounts for the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER. However, the increase in P2Y12 protein levels is modest at best, and the increase for P2y13 is less than 2-fold. The authors' point would be strengthened by showing InsP3 levels are increased in the KO cells compared with WT ones, for the same dose of ADP. Single cell InsP3 probes are available. Alternatively, a population measurement could be carried out.</p><p>3. The evidence for an involvement of SOCE is based on two rather non-specific inhibitors (2-APB and Gd3+). P2YRs, like other GPCRs, activate TRPC proteins and these Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels could contribute to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateau. The authors should therefore knock down Orai1 or at least use more selective inhibitors such as Synta66 or the GSK compound.</p><p>4. The authors should include some controls to show the P2Y antibodies are indeed specific. For example, they could use a cell line that lacks P2Y12/13. In Figure 2I, J, what happens to the ADP response when both P2Y inhibitors are present at the same time? It would be important to show that the combination of P2Y12 and P2Y13 suppress ADP responses fully.</p><p>5. The authors should add a justification for the concentrations of agonists they have used (ADP, ATP, UTP). A dose-response curve is included for ADP but a comment on the doses selected would be helpful.</p><p>6. It is nicely shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in TREM2 KO cells leads to microglia motility and process extension to a greater extent than WT cells. This is attributed to the increased SOCE. If so, then one might expect raising external Ca<sup>2+</sup> in WT cells to have the same effect. Is this the case?</p><p>7. Is anything known mechanistically how the exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal leads to a chemotaxis defect? The authors' data would suggest that chemotaxis might have a bell-shaped dependence on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with too little or too much impeding migration towards a cue.</p><p>8. Do the authors know whether the effects of SOCE are mediated through a local Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise or via a global cytosolic Ca elevation?</p><p>9. Perhaps I missed something but Figure 1 S2(D) seems to show a significant decrease in STIM1 levels in the KO cells.</p><p>10. The authors present SOCE as the peak signal remaining after 5 minutes. It is not clear whether the value has been subtracted from the pre-stimulation levels. In some graphs, the signal after 5 minutes looks the same as the resting level, but the bar charts show higher values.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73021.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers had concerns on two broad aspects of the paper: the calcium signaling studies, and the results relating to cell motility. In addition, other concerns were raised which are described in the individual reviewer comments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more rigorous examination of protein expression should be performed with antibody validation to determine if there are compensatory changes at the protein level of other relevant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins (Figure 1 Suppl2) that could affect the results. Westerns should be performed for STIM1 and STIM2, Orai1 and IP3R 1/2/3, for which there are reliable Abs. Although the IF as performed for Orai1 is acceptable, the authors do not show positive and negative controls and a thorough validation of this Orai1Ab in IF. This is strongly recommended given the poor quality of Orai1 Abs in general. Likewise, staining for P2YR12 appears internal and the Ab should be validated. A WB on P2YR12 and P2RY13 in addition would help.</p></disp-quote><p>Our approach in this study relies on functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging readouts in combination with pharmacological and genetic tools to assess P2Y receptor sensitivity to agonists and antagonists and downstream signaling events that include IP<sub>3</sub>R activation, ER store-release, and SOCE in WT and TREM2 KO microglia. Given our focus on functional data that are concordant with RNA expression results and point toward the differential expression of P2Y receptors, we did not see a strong rationale for further dissecting the expression of various STIM, Orai, IP<sub>3</sub>R or pump isoforms at the protein level. New data in the paper strengthen this conclusion. These include the ionomycin and TG-pulse experiments (Figure 3E, and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B) together with the ADP-Ca<sup>2+</sup> addback experiments (Figure 3D), showing that ADP depletes ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores to a greater extent in TREM2 KO cells. The new data reinforce the conclusion that increased expression of P2Y receptors in TREM2 KO microglia drives downstream calcium signaling events.</p><p>We concur with the reviewer that appropriate antibody controls are needed to support data related to protein expression, and we attempted to address this issue for the Orai1 antibody and P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor antibodies as described below.</p><p>In response to reviewer comments, we generated Orai1 CRISPR-knockout iPSC-microglia and further tested the Orai1 Ab (Alomone, Cat# ALM-025, Clone 3F11/D10/B9) for immunostaining in WT and Orai1 KO iPSC-microglial cell line; antibody staining was found to be nonspecific. We therefore agree with the reviewer that, because of poor quality, Orai1 antibody staining does not provide solid and quantifiable evidence for Orai1 expression or function. Accordingly, we have removed Orai1 immunofluorescence staining data (old Figure 1—figure supplement 2E) from the revised manuscript. Instead, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements in the newly generated Orai1 KO iPSC-microglia cell-line, and with a more specific pharmacological inhibitor of Orai channels (Synta66) to unambiguously establish the role of Orai1 in mediating SOCE and in maintaining sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by ADP in microglia (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and F).</p><p>Concerning P2Y expression, we performed control experiments using iPSC microglia treated with siRNA against P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors to validate the P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor antibodies (P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor Ab: Sigma, cat# HPA014518, polyclonal; P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor Ab: Alomone, cat# APR-017, polyclonal) for immunostaining. We agree with the reviewer that there is significant non-membrane staining of the cells with the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antibody making visualization of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors on the membrane problematic. Upon further investigation, the P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor antibody was also found to be non-specific, in line with recent reports on the widespread lack of efficacy and specificity of available antibodies to label P2Y13 receptors in ex vivo and in vitro settings including the one used in our study (Alomone, Cat# APR-017; see PMID: 31520551; Suppl. Figure 1). We have therefore removed P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> immunofluorescence data from the paper. Instead, we now include flow cytometry data using a different antibody that targets the extracellular domain of the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor (clone 16001E) to show that these receptors are expressed to a greater level on the plasma membrane (PM) of TREM2 KO cells (new Figure 2G). The appropriate isotype control is included in this assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Important: It is clear that the TREM2 KO cells have significantly lower STIM1 expression, which would be expected to impact SOCE under conditions of physiological agonists stimulation (ADP, ATP). The conclusion based on maximal activation with thapsigargin does not address this issue. What is the impact of reduced STIM1 expression on the Ca signals and motility?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing attention to this issue. The volcano plot comparing the transcriptomic expression of STIM1 in WT and TREM2 KO cells shows that STIM1 mRNA expression is below the threshold for what would be considered significant in an RNA seq experiment. In fact, this is the case for all the STIM and Orai isoforms. For RNAsequencing experiments, tens of thousands of genes are tested against the null hypothesis which has led to the use of false discovery rates (FDR) rather than traditional p-values (PMID: 12883005). However, statistical significance based on FDR alone is not enough to determine a meaningful result in RNA-sequencing experiments. Due to highly accurate sequencing, samples may show low variability leading to highly “significant” FDRs with a fold change less than 1. In many cases, this small change in expression would not yield biological differences. For these reasons, we consider only genes that reach both the FDR threshold and the fold change threshold. The data shown here were originally published in (PMID: 33097708) with cutoffs of FDR &lt; 0.05 and -1 &lt; FC &lt; 1.</p><p>Unfortunately, the bar-graph in old Figure 1—figure supplement 2D may have given the false impression that differences in STIM1 expression are quite large. We have now remade this bar-graph (Y-axis range from 0 – 1.2) and have also included relative expression of P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor transcripts for comparison (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). STIM1 mRNA expression is modestly reduced in TREM2 KO cells which is consistent with the modestly reduced maximum functional SOCE response (measured after store-depletion with TG). To address the issue about SOCE under conditions of physiological agonist stimulation, we also measured SOCE in response to store-depletion with ADP; new Figure 3D shows that ADP produces greater store-release and therefore engages SOCE to a greater extent in TREM2 KO cells. Based on this, we conclude that the modestly reduced STIM1 expression in TREM2 KO microglia does not play a significant role in determining the differences in ADP-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals between WT and TREM2 KO cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A Ca<sup>2+</sup> off/on protocol with ADP (Figure 1) as done for thapsigargin should be performed. In Figure 2B, ADP was applied in the absence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but sadly those recordings did not subsequently replenish Ca<sup>2+</sup> to gauge Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Low concentrations of Gd3+ (which should not alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> release) reduce the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release peak, suggesting that there is a contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to this initial response. Also, it would have been helpful to include in Figure 1 Suppl1 the control (non KO cells) in these experiments for reference.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for three excellent suggestions (see our replies i, ii, and iii below).</p><p>3a (i) To demonstrate SOCE in response to ADP, we now include a Ca<sup>2+</sup> off/on protocol in the presence or absence of Synta66, a more specific inhibitor of Orai channels than Gd<sup>3+</sup> or 2-APB. Synta66 significantly inhibited SOCE triggered by TG and ADP in WT and TREM2 KO microglia (Figure 3A, B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B). Additionally, we compared ADP-induced SOCE in WT and TREM2 KO microglia (Figure 3D). The implications of this experiment have been discussed above in Essential revision comment 1 and 2.</p><p>3a (ii) We re-examined the issue of whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx contributes to the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak in two ways. First, we compared the height of the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak after application of ADP in 1mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> free buffer (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C); there was no significant difference between the two conditions in either WT or TREM2 KO microglia suggesting that the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak is driven primarily by store-release. We further tested this by acute addition of Gd<sup>3+</sup> or 2-APB with ADP without pre-incubation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D). In this instance, we did not find an inhibition of initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak. We speculate that the pre-incubation of cells with Gd<sup>3+</sup> before addition of ADP in old Figure 1—figure supplement 1 might have non-specifically caused reduction of the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak.</p><p>3a (iii) Given the complex effects of Gd<sup>3+</sup> and 2-APB on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in microglia, we did not repeat the Gd<sup>3+</sup> and 2-APB experiments in WT microglia. Instead, we include new data as outlined above in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 showing involvement of Orai channels using Synta66 and using the Orai1 KO line (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusion that SOCE is mediated by Orai1 should be validated with a genetic approach as 2-APB and La3+ are non-specific.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. As described above, we now include data using a more specific inhibitor (Synta66) and a newly generated Orai1 KO microglial cell line (Figure 3A, B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B, E, F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Conversely, it is not clear if store content is depleted to a greater extent following ADP receptor stimulation in the KO cells. Assess ER calcium content in response to ADP in WT and KO cells or with an ionomycin pulse.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We examined the extent of ER store-depletion in response to ADP by sequentially pulsing the cells first with ADP and then with ionomycin in Ca<sup>2+</sup> free buffer. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> release peak in response to ADP was higher in the TREM2 KO cells as expected, and the subsequent ionomycin peak was significantly reduced. These results (Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B) indicate greater ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store-release by ADP in TREM2 KO cells. As for the suggestion to directly monitor ER calcium content, transfection of iPSC-microglia shifts them from a resting to a highly activated state in which they downregulate their P2Y receptors, as reported (PMID: 17115040, 28602351, 28930663). Thus, transfection of genetically-encoded probes to measure ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> or to measure IP3 levels is problematic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3: The WT data in this figure don't include KO cells. How do the TREM2 KOs compare to WT in the scratch wound closure assay? The KO cells seem to be tested, but only in the absence of ADP (Figure 4 Sup 1A). Is there a difference in wound closure after ADP treatment? This point should be evaluated to assess the effects of altered ADP Ca signaling on non-directional cell movement in a physiologically relevant paradigm.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed the scratch wound assay in the presence of ADP (data now included as Figure 7—figure supplement 1, and described in lines 309-313). Interestingly, while ADP speeds up closure of scratch wounds, we found no differences in the wound closure rates between WT and TREM2 KO microglia. The differences in purinergic signaling are more decisive in shaping chemotaxis to ADP. The effects of TREM2 deletion, and the subsequent effects of increased purinergic signaling on microglial motility appear to depend on the specific physiological context, and this will require further investigation in a follow up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Terminology: The term &quot;Ca clamp&quot; in the way it has been used here could be misconstrued by readers. Cellular Ca is not clamped. It varies within each cell depending on the activity of the pumps and other clearance mechanisms in the cell. The motility measurements are simply done after extracellular Ca is restored to the cells after thapsigargin treatment, at time points where the cytosolic Ca is lower in 0.2 mM Ca compared to 2 mM Ca. This phrasing (Ca clamp) needs to be changed to eliminate confusion that cellular calcium is &quot;clamped&quot; analogous to voltage-clamp.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, and have accordingly removed the term “Ca<sup>2+</sup> clamp” from the manuscript. Instead, we refer to this protocol as a method to investigate the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation that bypasses purinergic receptor activation on microglial motility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 6D TREM2 KOs (but not WT) cells show differences in motility between 0.2 mM and 2 mM extracellular Ca even after thapsigargin treatment with no ADP exposure. This is strong indication that motility differences in TREM2 KO cells are due to more than just alterations in purinergic signaling. (Consistent with lack of additional ADP effects in Figure 6 Supplement 1). What is the role of these intrinsic changes in cell motility in response to cellular Ca elevations in the presence and absence of nucleotides?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment. The question raised has great potential for further work that is beyond the scope of this study. Purinergic stimulation produces a complex downstream response that includes activation of both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and -independent (Gβ/γ -&gt; PI3K -&gt; PIP3, Ras, cAMP etc) pathways. Experiments in Figure 6 (using a protocol to maintain different levels of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> over time using thapsigargin) were done with the goal of isolating the effects of sustained cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels on motility. The key observation is that motility in TREM2 KO microglia responds to changes in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels to a greater extent than in WT cells, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> tunes motility differently in WT and TREM2 KO cells. Addition of ADP had no further effect, as the reviewer correctly observes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We speculate in the Results section (lines 291-292) that the rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in this assay may override the complex effects of ADP on motility; this may reflect intrinsic differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of motility between WT and TREM2 KO cells. We note that the baseline motility characteristics are similar between WT and TREM2 KO microglia (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 6D: The data for WT cells should be directly compared to the KOs at each extracellular Ca concentration to dissect out differences in KO cells at each Ca condition.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is shown in Figure 6F: instantaneous speeds of WT and TREM2 KO microglia over a range of different cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Additionally, the histogram in Figure 6G compares the percent of cells with instantaneous speeds &gt; 10 µm/min as a function of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in WT and TREM2 KO cells. This comparison reveals a unimodal relationship in TREM2 KO cells with low cell speeds at high and low cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and higher speeds at intermediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The data in Figure 4K should be reanalyzed to compare differences in the absolute levels of branch complexity (# of branches and process length) in the two groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that the lower baseline branch complexity in the KOs explains the greater fold change in the KOs after ADP application. We also agree that the absolute number and length of branches (normalized to cell number) after ADP treatment is similar between WT and KOs. Based on these comments, we made the following change in the Results section (lines 267-270<italic>),</italic> “Comparison of the absolute number of branches and process length after ADP treatment, as well as the relative fold-increase in these parameters from baseline indicated that process extension is not affected in TREM2 KO microglia”. We note that the absolute number of branches and the process length (normalized to cell number in each imaging field) was calculated and is shown in the left panels of Figure 5L and M. These results are also shown as paired plots comparing the absolute increase in the average number of branches and length of the processes after ADP treatment in the WT and KO groups per imaging field (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B, top row).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The apparent disconnect between the larger mean square distance travelled in the absence of nucleotides in the KO with no change in the mean speed needs to be clarified. Is this due to cancelling of speed vectors with opposite directions?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing attention to this. The MSD vs time plots (Figure 5B) show that TREM2 KO cells travel farther away from the origin than WT cells after ADP treatment. This could either be because (1) KO cells move faster than WT cells or (2) because they change direction less frequently (or travel in straighter paths) than WT cells while moving at similar speed. Comparing mean track speeds and track straightness (Figure 5C) affirms the latter possibility. The mean track speed (Figure 4C-E, Figure 5C, H) is the mean of all instantaneous speeds for a given track. It is calculated without any regard to the direction of cell motility, and therefore does not have negative values. We agree with the reviewer that the velocity vectors (which take into account the direction of cell movement) cancel each other out to a greater degree in the WT cells, which is reflected in lower values of track straightness. Our data suggest that WT cells remain confined to a smaller region of random walk because they turn more frequently. We have observed analogous distinctions in motility patterns between regulatory T (Treg) cells and inflammatory Th17 cells in the spinal cord of mice, with Treg cells executing a back-n-forth motion with similar mean speeds as Th17 cells, and being confined to smaller regions of the cord while Th17 cells traverse larger regions because they change directions less frequently (PMID:32732436). We now include a sentence in the Discussion section (lines 349-350) to indicate that velocity vectors cancel each other out to a greater extent in WT cells. For clarity, we added a new paragraph in the methods section (lines 922-937) detailing how the motility parameters were calculated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Figure 3: The WT data in this figure don't include KO cells.

The logic of this inference and how it explains the data (similar average speed but much greater root mean square displacement in the KO) needs to be better clarified. Since the mean square distance is so much larger, it suggests that the speed vectors with opposite directions are cancelling out in the KO cells to yield the same average velocity (which could theoretically even occur from increased, not decreased turning).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing attention to this issue.

This phrasing (Ca clamp) needs to be changed to eliminate confusion that cellular Ca levels are &quot;clamped&quot; to defined values analogous to voltage clamp.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, and have accordingly removed the term “Ca<sup>2+</sup> clamp” from the manuscript (Essential revision comment no. 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 6D: It is noteworthy that TREM2 KOs, but not WT cells, show differences in motility between 0.2 mM and 2 mM extracellular Ca even after thapsigargin treatment with no ADP exposure. This is strong suggestion that motility differences in TREM2 KO cells are due to more than just alterations in purinergic signaling. In fact, this inference is consistent by the lack of additional effects of adding ADP in Figure 6 Supplement 1. These intrinsic changes in cell motility in response to cellular Ca elevations need further clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this under Essential revision comment no. 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6D: Related to this figure, the data for WT cells should be directly compared to the KOs at each extracellular Ca concentration to dissect out differences in KO cells at each Ca condition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this under Essential revision comment no. 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other:</p><p>– Stim1 is expressed at different levels between the WT and TREM2 KO. It has a significant p-value (Figure 1 Sup2D). This decrease could affect multiple aspects of microglia including cell motility in the presence of physiologically relevant agonists. This needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. This point was made by other reviewers as well and needs better clarification. We have addressed this under Essential revision comment no. 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A technical point related to Figure 4 is that figures 4C and 4G should be labelled &quot;velocity&quot; rather than speed, as it seems the only way in which the mean squared distance can be twice as large in the KO but not the velocity if the speed vectors with opposite directions are cancelling out in the KO.</p></disp-quote><p>These graphs (current Figure 4C-E, current Figure 5C, H) plot the mean track speed, which represents the mean of all instantaneous speeds over the total time of tracking. The instantaneous speed is calculated at each time point for a given track as the scalar equivalent to object velocity, without taking into account directionality (hence no negative values). We agree that MSD is lower in WTs; this is because WT cells turn more frequently (reflected as lower track straightness compared with TREM2 KOs), leading to greater cancellation of velocity vectors. For clarification, we now include definition of the different motility parameters in lines 922-937 of the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The dose of ADP used in Figure 7 is extremely high. 100ng/mL (which is 234uM by my calculation). By contrast, Figure 4 used 2.5uM. The 100 fold higher concentration in the chemotaxis assay needs to be justified. Further, it should be determined whether the ADP used diffuses into both chambers might be expected. This super high dose of ADP may have non-physiological effects that could explain the seemingly differing phenotypes in Figures 4 and 7.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s calculation of concentration is incorrect. 100 ng/ml of ADP is equivalent to a concentration of 234 nM, not 234 µM. In the methods section on the chemotaxis assay (line 962), we now also report the concentration of ADP in nM. This dose of ADP is not super high.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5 is a great set of experiments to show that the Salsa6f does not affect end points of the study, but may be better as a supplementary figure rather than a main figure. If the paper is about the TREM2 KO versus WT then the main figures should stick with looking at differences between the two with maybe a sub figure to show validation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and are happy to comply. Because we ended up using the Salsa6f expressing lines in several additional experiments to confirm key findings in the study, the Salsa6f validation data are now presented in Figure 1 figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– A more rigorous approach could be used to document the presence or absence of compensatory changes at the protein protein level of other Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins (Figure 1 Suppl2). Preferably Westerns should be performed for STIM1 and STIM2, Orai1 and IP3R 1/2/3, for which there are reliable Abs. Although IF as performed for Orai1 is acceptable, the authors do not show positive and negative controls and a thorough validation of this Orai1Ab in IF.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and suggestions. We have addressed this under Essential revision cmment no. 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Along the same lines as comment above, Staining for P2YR12 appears internal. Has the Ab been validated? Can authors perform a WB on P2YR12 and P2RY13 in addition?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this under Essential revision comment no. 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Did the authors check on whether the expression of SECRA is altered at the protein level? Did the authors perform CRAC channel recordings in Control and TREM2 KO cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not looked at the expression of SERCA at the protein level. However, we further examined our published RNAseq data on WT and TREM2 KO iPSC-microglia (PMID: 33097708) and compared the relative read counts of PMCA and SERCA isoforms that are known to be expressed in WT and TREM2 KO microglia and found no significant differences. Data for the relative expression of relevant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling molecules (STIM1, Orai1, IP3R2, SERCA2 and 3, PMCA1) are now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E. We note that among these, only P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor transcripts showed significant fold change in expression between WT and TREM2 KO cells, which prompted us to focus our efforts in that direction. Additionally, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance rate after SOCE is similar in WT and TREM2 KO cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, F). Based on this, we find it unlikely that the higher sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in TREM2 KO cells is due to differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance mechanisms, including Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump activity. We did not attempt to record Icrac in iPSC microglia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is quite surprising that the authors did not opt to use the Ca<sup>2+</sup> off/on protocol with ADP (Figure 1) as they have done with thapsigargin. In Figure 2B, ADP was applied in the absence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but sadly those recordings did not subsequently replenish Ca<sup>2+</sup> to gauge Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. One can rationalize the result of 2-APB (Figure 1 Suppl1), a non specific channel blocker that also inhibits IP3Rs. However, the fact that low concentrations of Gd3+ (which should not alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> release) reduce the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release peak, suggests that there is a contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to this initial response. Also, it would have been helpful to include in Figure 1 Suppl1 the control (non KO cells) in these experiments for reference.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and suggestions. We have accordingly performed new experiments and address this under Essential revision comment no. 3a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional thoughts to the attention of the authors:</p><p>– The authors have speculated on the fact that increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> might lead to a &quot;spill&quot; outside the restricted Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomain, thus disrupting polarity. Do the authors have any evidence of altered location of leading-edge vs trailing edge proteins or focal adhesion proteins in TREM2 KO cells?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we did not investigate the interesting question regarding the polarity of membrane proteins or focal adhesion proteins in TREM2 KO cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals play a role in generating cell polarity and regulating membrane protrusion and retraction in some migratory cell-types (PMID: 25977921). Local Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses have been detected at the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts in response to PDGF gradients (PMID: 19118385), and in migrating sheets of endothelial cells in response to a scratch wound (PMID: 24463606). More recently, localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been proposed to correlate with process extension in murine microglia based on intravital imaging, though it’s role in chemotaxis was not explored (PMID: 32716294). We have now rephrased the relevant sentence in the Discussion section (lines 360-363) to make it clear that we are speculating on the possible mechanism by which excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can impede gradient sensing. Reflecting the uncertainties, we have removed Figure 8 considering it may be overly speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Have the authors performed RNAseq on WT control and TREM2 KO cells? If so, does pathway analysis shows changes in the Cell motility genes between these two groups? This might offer some interesting clues to pursue in future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors have performed and previously published RNA-seq on WT and TREM2 KO cells (Figure 1 in PMID: 33097708). Using gene ontology analysis, the authors did find differences in motility including “regulations of natural killer cell chemotaxis”, “Positive regulation of cell migration”, and “regulation of smooth muscle cell migration”. Even in the more selective gene ontology of genes which change in opposite directions after TREM2 KO and TREM2 antibody stimulation, we find “positive regulation of leukocyte chemotaxis” as one of the most significant gene family suggesting differences in motility. These gene lists included P2RY<sub>12</sub> and P2RY<sub>13</sub> receptors and were part of what stimulated our work presented here. However, some other chemotactic molecules including CCL2 and CCL3 are also included in this reciprocal gene list and warrant further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study by Jairaman et al. describes how iPSC-derived microglia exhibit exaggerated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to ADP stimulation in TREM2KO cells, and that this leads to a defect in turning behaviour and hence no directed migration to a chemotactic signal.</p><p>Overall, the experiments are well conducted, carefully controlled and the findings are new and exciting. The authors nicely dissect out the underlying molecular basis for the exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to ADP and then extend their findings to cell movement and directed migration. Given the substantial body of evidence linking microglia to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and the role for TREM2, the work by Jairaman et al. is of translational significance. As an aside, the introduction of the calcium-sensitive reporter Salsa6F is a welcome new tool in the arsenal for recording cytosolic calcium. Overall, this is an elegant, novel and important study. Nevertheless, I have a few comments/suggestions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive and insightful comments. We have done new experiments to address specific suggestions as outlined below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors argue that the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateau to ADP in TREM2KO cells is due to enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the stores ie greater store depletion. Evidence is presented that maximal SOCE is not compromised in TREM2KO cells, that store content under resting conditions is unaffected, InsP3R activities are similar. But the authors do not demonstrate that store content falls more following ADP receptor stimulation in the KO cells. This could be shown by directly measuring ER calcium to ADP in WT and KO cells or by applying ADP in Ca-free solution and then assessing store content with an ionomycin pulse. The ionomycin response should be smaller in the TREM2KO cells, after ADP exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting the ionomycin pulse experiment. We have accordingly performed new experiments, and address this under Essential revision comment# 3b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors suggest that an increase in P2Y12 and P2Y13 receptor expression in the KO cells accounts for the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER. However, the increase in P2Y12 protein levels is modest at best, and the increase for P2y13 is less than 2-fold. The authors' point would be strengthened by showing InsP3 levels are increased in the KO cells compared with WT ones, for the same dose of ADP. Single cell InsP3 probes are available. Alternatively, a population measurement could be carried out.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that the suggested experiment with InsP3 probe would further bolster our conclusion, we have noted in essential revision comment no. 4 that transfection of iPSC-microglia shifts them from a resting to a highly activated state leading to downregulation of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors, which confounds our ability to accurately compare P2Y receptor activity. Although the antibodies against P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors were found to be nonspecific (see also essential revision comment No. 1), we now include flow cytometry data showing increased PM expression of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor in live TREM2 KO cells (Figure 2G); these data complement the functional assays and transcriptomic data (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E) showing &gt;2 fold increase in P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptor RNA expression in TREM2 KO microglia. These differences are likely to be biologically relevant for downstream signaling, given the positive feedback mechanisms and signal amplification associated with GPCR signaling (PMID: 29074251). Increased protein expression of P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors has also been reported in <italic>Trem2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and in a mouse AD model, and we now include this point in the Introduction section of the manuscript (line 87-89).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The evidence for an involvement of SOCE is based on two rather non-specific inhibitors (2-APB and Gd3+). P2YRs, like other GPCRs, activate TRPC proteins and these Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels could contribute to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateau. The authors should therefore knock down Orai1 or at least use more selective inhibitors such as Synta66 or the GSK compound.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have performed additional pharmacological experiments and CRISPRbased Orai1 KO to address this point in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1. The results confirm involvement of Orai channels in SOCE activated by store-depletion with TG and ADP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should include some controls to show the P2Y antibodies are indeed specific. For example, they could use a cell line that lacks P2Y12/13. In Figure 2I, J, what happens to the ADP response when both P2Y inhibitors are present at the same time? It would be important to show that the combination of P2Y12 and P2Y13 suppress ADP responses fully.</p></disp-quote><p>Per reviewer suggestion, we examined Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to ADP in the presence of both P2RY<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> inhibitors. This combination inhibited the ADP Ca<sup>2+</sup> response completely in both WT and TREM2 KO microglia (Figure 2G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors should add a justification for the concentrations of agonists they have used (ADP, ATP, UTP). A dose-response curve is included for ADP but a comment on the doses selected would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Extracellular concentration of purinergic signals range from hundreds of nanomolar to μM levels, and are shaped by a variety of factors including baseline secretion, extent of local tissue damage and the prevalence of ectonucleotidases that cleave purinergic ligands (PMID: 18302942). Studies in microglial field have often used tens of μM ADP (PMID: 17115040, 11245682) to study the biology of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors, but microglial cells experience a range of concentrations depending on the pathophysiological context, and depending on distance from the injury site. We now include a sentence in the Introduction (line 54) about purinergic concentrations in the brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It is nicely shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in TREM2 KO cells leads to microglia motility and process extension to a greater extent than WT cells. This is attributed to the increased SOCE. If so, then one might expect raising external Ca<sup>2+</sup> in WT cells to have the same effect. Is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not examined effects of increasing the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in WTs to test whether that results in a higher magnitude of cell speed and process extension (compared to TREM2 KOs). Our data in Figure 5 and Figure 5 figure supplement 1 shows that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pathways are required for optimal cell motility and process dynamics in iPSC microglia in general (based on greater increases in cell track speeds, process length and branching in response to ADP in 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared with 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> extracellular solution for both WT and TREM2 KO microglia). We should also note that the effects of TREM2 deletion on process branching/ lengthening is not as drastic as its effects on cell motility. We have addressed this particular point in response to comments from reviewer No. 1 under Essential revision, comment no. 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Is anything known mechanistically how the exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal leads to a chemotaxis defect? The authors' data would suggest that chemotaxis might have a bell-shaped dependence on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with too little or too much impeding migration towards a cue.</p></disp-quote><p>The fundamental issue in chemotaxis is how shallow gradients of a chemokine translates to steep polarization of signaling proteins within the cell. This is generally thought to occur downstream of the chemokine receptor and upstream of actin cytoskeleton (PMID: 33990789), but the specific role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in this process remains poorly understood. Please also see our earlier response (comment No. 5 by reviewer# 2) on how excessive cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> may disrupt cell polarity. The histogram in Figure 6G comparing the percent of fast-moving cells as a function of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> further indicate that there may indeed be a bell-shaped effect with regard to effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on instantaneous cell speeds in TREM2 KO cells. This is reflected in the chemotaxis assay in Figure 7B and C in which reducing ADP signaling in TREM2 KO cells rescues the defect in chemotaxis. It is possible that high cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> serves as a temporary STOP signal in microglia similar to its effects on T cells. We note this point in the Discussion (lines 386-388) and speculate that TREM2 KO cells may be more subject to this effect with ADP, given the higher expression of P2RY<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Do the authors know whether the effects of SOCE are mediated through a local Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise or via a global cytosolic Ca elevation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not looked at role of local vs. global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in regulating microglial cell motility in the current study but hope to explore this aspect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as part of a follow up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Perhaps I missed something but Figure 1 S2(D) seems to show a significant decrease in STIM1 levels in the KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. This point was made by other reviewers as well and needs clarification. We have addressed this under Essential revision comment no. 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors present SOCE as the peak signal remaining after 5 minutes. It is not clear whether the value has been subtracted from the pre-stimulation levels. In some graphs, the signal after 5 minutes looks the same as the resting level, but the bar charts show higher values.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the reviewer is referring to the traces and bar-graphs in current Figure 1B, D, E and F showing both peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> response and Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 5 minutes. The data-points (single cell values) in the bar-graphs are all baseline subtracted, as described in the legend. The Y-axis is now labelled “Fluo-4/Fura-Red Ratio (baseline subtracted)” to make this point clear. We also note that the bar-graph summary includes data from multiple experiments, while the average traces are from a single imaging run.</p></body></sub-article></article>
