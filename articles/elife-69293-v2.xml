subunit, characterized by treatment-resistant epilepsy, temperature-sensitive seizures, developmental delay/intellectual disability with features of autism spectrum disorder, and increased risk of sudden death. Convergent data suggest hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) pathology in DS (<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) mice. We performed two-photon calcium imaging in brain slice to uncover a profound dysfunction of filtering of perforant path input by DG in young adult <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. This was not due to dysfunction of DG parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons (PV-INs), which were only mildly impaired at this timepoint; however, we identified enhanced excitatory input to granule cells, suggesting that circuit dysfunction is due to excessive excitation rather than impaired inhibition. We confirmed that both optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal cortex and selective chemogenetic inhibition of DG PV-INs lowered seizure threshold in vivo in young adult <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. Optogenetic activation of PV-INs, on the other hand, normalized evoked responses in granule cells in vitro. These results establish the corticohippocampal circuit as a key locus of pathology in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice and suggest that PV-INs retain powerful inhibitory function and may be harnessed as a potential therapeutic approach toward seizure modulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Dravet syndrome</kwd><kwd>SCN1A</kwd><kwd>Nav1.1</kwd><kwd>gabaergic interneurons</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25 NS065745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mattis</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08 NS097633</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldberg</surname><given-names>Ethan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS110869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldberg</surname><given-names>Ethan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001068</institution-id><institution>Dana Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>David Mahoney Neuroimaging Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldberg</surname><given-names>Ethan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award for Medical Scientists</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldberg</surname><given-names>Ethan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08 NS121464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mattis</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007929</institution-id><institution>Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Translational Biomedical Imaging Center (TBIC)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mattis</surname><given-names>Joanna H</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldberg</surname><given-names>Ethan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiology, optogenetics, and imaging in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome reveals dentate gyrus circuit dysfunction driven by hyperexcitability of the perforant path input from entorhinal cortex that can be modulated by recruitment of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pathogenic variants in <italic>SCN1A</italic>, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel α subunit Nav1.1, cause a spectrum of epilepsies including Dravet syndrome (DS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claes et al., 2001</xref>), the most common developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. DS is characterized by treatment-resistant epilepsy, developmental delay/intellectual disability, features of or formal diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, and motor dysfunction (hypotonia, ataxia, gait impairment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Villas et al., 2017</xref>). DS-associated <italic>SCN1A</italic> variants are due to loss of function leading to haploinsufficiency of Nav1.1. The heterozygous <italic>Scn1a</italic> mutant (<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) mouse is a well-established preclinical model of DS that recapitulates key phenotypic features of the human condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mistry et al., 2014</xref>). When expressed on a 50:50 129S6:C57BL/6J genetic background, these mice exhibit spontaneous seizures beginning at approximately post-natal day (P) 18, and high rates of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mistry et al., 2014</xref>). These mice also exhibit temperature-sensitive seizures, akin to seizures triggered in the setting of fever or hyperthermia in human patients with DS, which represents a key experimental advantage of this mouse model as it readily facilitates study of inducible but naturalistic seizures in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tran et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The prevailing theory as to how reduction in sodium current leads to epilepsy in DS is the so-called ‘interneuron hypothesis’, which posits that haploinsufficiency of Nav1.1 results in selective deficits in inhibitory interneuron excitability based on the relative reliance of this cell class on Nav1.1 for action potential generation. Nav1.1 is prominently expressed in parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (PV-INs) in neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>), as well as by somatostatin (SST-INs) and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneurons (VIP-INs). Electrophysiological recordings from acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons from <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice found decreased sodium current density in bipolar-shaped presumptive GABAergic interneurons, but not in pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2006</xref>); impaired excitability of inhibitory interneurons – PV-INs as well as SST and VIP-INs – has been demonstrated in acute brain slices from <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Favero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goff and Goldberg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tai et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this, human DS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated to form developing interneurons with biophysical deficits, whereas derived excitatory neurons were normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). This ‘interneuron hypothesis’ is further supported by the fact that the DS phenotype is recapitulated by selective loss of Nav1.1 exclusively in GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dutton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rubinstein et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the pathophysiology of epilepsy in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice is more complex than impairment of inhibition. First, the net circuit effect of VIP-INs is disinhibition, so the abnormal excitability of this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goff and Goldberg, 2019</xref>) should in fact increase inhibition in neocortical circuits. Second, contradictory data from the <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mistry et al., 2014</xref>) and from human-derived iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) suggest that subsets of excitatory neurons in DS may in fact be hyperexcitable. Third, recent work found that impaired action potential generation present at early developmental time points in neocortical PV-INs normalized by P35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Favero et al., 2018</xref>), whereas DS mice continue to exhibit epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and SUDEP. Finally, several in vivo studies have failed to find a clear decrease in baseline interneuron activity in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Stasi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tran et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Hence, mechanisms of seizure generation and maintenance of chronic epilepsy in DS remain unclear despite this now growing literature characterizing deficits in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice at a single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dutton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Favero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goff and Goldberg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tai et al., 2014</xref>). This may be in part due to the lack of data linking cellular deficits to circuit-level abnormalities. Convergent data suggest that the dentate gyrus (DG) may be a key locus of pathology and seizure generation in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. Although <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit multifocal epilepsy, temperature-induced seizures have been shown to prominently emanate from the temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liautard et al., 2013</xref>), and focal hippocampal Nav1.1 reduction is sufficient to confer temperature-sensitive seizure susceptibility in conditional <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stein et al., 2019</xref>). Although the DG receives a strong excitatory input from entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaral et al., 2007</xref>), inhibition within the DG typically regulates population activity such that granule cells (GCs) are only sparsely activated under physiologic conditions both in reduced preparations in vitro and in experimental animals in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chawla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diamantaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dieni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ewell and Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). However, seizure-evoked immediate early gene activation is most apparent in the DG granule cell layer in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutton et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting an underlying circuit-level hyperexcitability.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate a profound hyperexcitability of the corticohippocampal circuit in young adult <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice that is not present at epilepsy onset using two-photon calcium imaging and cellular and synaptic physiology in an acute slice preparation. We find this circuit dysfunction is likely driven by excessive excitation, as opposed to impaired inhibition. We then extend these findings in vivo using optogenetics in awake, behaving mice during temperature-sensitive seizures to demonstrate a role for this corticohippocampal dysregulation in ictogenesis. Finally, we selectively inhibit DG PV-INs (via chemogenetics) to exacerbate seizures in vivo, and recruit PV-INs (via optogenetics) to decrease evoked DG granule cell response to perforant path input in brain slice in vitro. These findings highlight the corticohippocampal circuit as a critical locus of pathology in DS and suggest that PV-INs retain powerful regulation of excitability within the circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Response of dentate gyrus to entorhinal cortical input is selectively impaired in young adult <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice</title><p>Emerging data suggest an important role for the hippocampus and, more specifically, the dentate gyrus (DG), in DS pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dutton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liautard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stein et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the circuit function of DG – filtering input from the entorhinal cortex to limit propagation of activity through the limbic system – might be impaired in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice.

We used a quantum dot-labeled pipette tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrásfalvy et al., 2014</xref>) for 2P-guided targeted electrophysiological recording during simultaneous calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This allowed us to correlate calcium transients within individual cells against a gold-standard quantitative measure of action potentials (APs). Action potentials were evoked via PP stimulation. However, given the normally sparse activation of DG in response to PP stimulation in wild-type mice, we bath-applied picrotoxin (PTX), a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist that is known to induce widespread PP-driven recruitment of GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dengler et al., 2017</xref>), such that nearly all GCs were activated by PP stimulation. We found that the number of APs and the magnitude of the calcium signal were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.769). This linear relationship between AP and calcium signal was the same in wild-type and <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice for single APs and across a measured range (0–14 APs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We next evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of GCaMP7s in detecting single APs in the absence of PTX as GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated responses in dentate GCs can be depolarizing even in the adult DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>), and could therefore cause subthreshold calcium transients which may mimic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stocca et al., 2008</xref>). We fit a normal distribution to the d<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>0 values associated with 0 APs (with an AP defined as an increase in calcium signal (d<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>0) of at least three times the standard deviation above the mean noise), set a global threshold defined by this data (p = 0.001), and verified that subthreshold responses (n = 9) could be resolved from single APs (n <italic>=</italic> 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Finally, we deconvolved the d<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>0 signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>) to extract the number of action potentials from the calcium transients and verified the deconvolution algorithm on the ‘ground truth’ AP dataset (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.83; p &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Thus, GCaMP7s reports APs in GCs similarly in both genotypes, with single-AP resolution, validating 2 P calcium imaging in brain slice as a method for comparing large-scale DG excitability between wild-type and <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup>.</p><p>In order to quantify the extent of DG activation in response to entorhinal cortex input, we stimulated the PP while performing 2 P imaging of the evoked responses across hundreds of GCs simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We tested early postnatal (P14-21; at/around epilepsy onset) and young adult (P50-100; chronic phase) mice. We delivered either a single pulse or a train of 4 pulses at 20 Hz across a range of stimulation intensities, similar to prior studies of this circuit in acute brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dengler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ewell and Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). We then identified activated GCs within the imaging field in response to each stimulation condition, defining activation as an increase in calcium signal (d<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>0) at least three times the standard deviation above the mean noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, columns 1–4) and/or if one or more action potentials were extracted using deconvolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, columns 5–6). To determine if the responses across stimulation intensities differed by genotype, we employed a statistical approach based on mixed-effects modeling, to account for potential variation between individual imaging fields in a slice, slices from a given mouse, and/or between mice.

We validated these data in two different ways to account for the possibility that some GCs might be unresponsive due to deafferentation during the slice preparation, as opposed to this being due to physiologic circuit inhibition. First, we excluded from analysis all GCs that failed to respond to maximal PP stimulation in the presence of PTX (‘Responds to PTX’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Note that most ( &gt; 85%) GCs did respond under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating a high level of connectivity within the HEC slice; hence, results were similar whether considering all cells or only PTX-responsive cells. Second, we excluded from analysis those GCs that failed to respond to the highest amplitude PP stimulation delivered in the absence of PTX (‘Responds to max stim’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, we quantified the magnitude of the evoked calcium signal (d<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>0; columns 1–4) or estimated the action potential numbers calculated via deconvolution (columns 5–6) and used a mixed-effects model to compare across genotypes, using a normal distribution fitted with a logarithmic link function. Note that we included in this analysis only GCs activated under each specific condition (‘Responds to each stim’); that is we quantified how many spikes occurred per active cell. We additionally analyzed the data including all GCs activated under highest amplitude PP stimulation (‘Responds to max stim’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) to quantify the total activation of the population: that is how many spikes occurred, averaged across cells.</p><p>We saw enhanced activation at the early postnatal timepoint for both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, columns 1–2), with only a subtle difference between genotypes. Consistent with the known increase in sparsity of GC activation that occurs with development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), the wild-type activity pattern was markedly decreased at the young adult relative to the early postnatal timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, columns 3–6). However, the <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> activation pattern remained markedly enhanced at the young adult relative to the early postnatal timepoint, resulting in a robust, statistically significant difference between genotypes at this later timepoint. For instance, proportional <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> GC activation at the young adult timepoint was over threefold larger than that of wild-type (0.51 ± 0.08 vs 0.16 ± 0.00; p &lt; 0.001) in response to 4 × 400 µA pulses (subset of data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> 4), and d<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>0 was increased by ~130% (p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> 4).

In this study, we employed 2 P calcium imaging in acute slice in an experimental mouse model of DS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) to demonstrate a profound abnormality in a corticohippocampal circuit element strongly linked to temporal lobe seizures and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This abnormality was not prominent in early postnatal mice (P14-21) yet became more profound in the chronic phase of the disorder. In contrast, defects in PV-IN excitability became less pronounced at this later timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and hence could not account for the identified circuit dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice had no impairment in disynaptic feedforward inhibition from entorhinal cortex onto GCs; rather, there was increased strength of monosynaptic excitatory input from entorhinal cortex to DG, with evidence of increased release probability implicating pre-synaptic mechanisms of PP dysfunction driving circuit dysregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We then extended our study in vivo and found that both optogenetic activation of the perforant path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and chemogenetic inhibition of PV-INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) significantly decreased the temperature threshold for seizure generation in <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Finally, we targeted and corrected this circuit abnormality in vitro by recruiting inhibitory reserve via optogenetics in slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate a clear locus of dysfunction despite complex circuit abnormalities and suggest unexpected plastic rearrangements in corticohippocampal circuity that may relate to the dynamic clinical evolution and maintenance of chronic epilepsy and intellectual disability in DS.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Calcium imaging enables large-scale comparison of dentate gyrus activation in wild-type and <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice</title><p>2 P imaging allows simultaneous read-out of the activity of hundreds (and now even many thousands or more <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>) of neurons, with cellular resolution and at high speeds. Our aim was to use 2 P imaging for a large-scale comparison of GC activation between genotypes (<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> versus wild-type), which is a valid approach only if there is no genotype difference in the relationship between the number of action potentials that a neuron fires and its resulting calcium signal (d<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>0). This is indeed a theoretical concern as previous studies have demonstrated dysregulation of voltage gated calcium channel expression patterns in hippocampal neurons in rodent models as well as human patients with TLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu and Tang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yaari et al., 2007</xref>). Expression of calcium binding proteins, such as calmodulin and calbindin, may also be altered by, and play a role in, the pathological process of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu and Tang, 2018</xref>). We therefore directly tested the ability of GCaMP7s to report action potentials in both <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and wild-type GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), confirming that we could detect single action potentials in both genotypes under our experimental conditions and that there was no difference between genotypes in the relationship between action potentials and calcium-induced fluorescence increases. That this was the case may relate to the relative homogeneity of GCs and the fact that intrinsic GC cellular physiology does not appear to change in <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Corticohippocampal circuit hyperexcitability and ictogenesis in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice</title><p>Consistent with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), we found that, in wild-type mice, the response of GCs to PP stimulation is robust in early postnatal mice (P14-21), becoming sparse by the young adult timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This developmental pattern was disrupted in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice: the GC response was only mildly abnormal via selected measures in early postnatal mice (P14-21), whereas relative to wild-type age-matched controls, GCs were profoundly hyper-activated in young adult mice across all conditions and analyses.</p><p>A central mechanistic hypothesis in acquired temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is that epileptogenesis results from uncontrolled excitatory input from EC to vulnerable downstream hippocampal areas, leading to damage to CA3 and propagation of epileptiform activity throughout the hippocampal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behr et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dengler et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings additionally implicate this corticohippocampal circuit in ictogenesis in the <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mouse model during the chronic phase. Specifically, we found that either challenging the circuit (via entorhinal cortical stimulation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) or further disrupting it (via DG PV-IN inhibition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) significantly exacerbated hyperthermia-evoked seizures in <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Thus, corticohippocampal circuit hyperexcitability may be a convergent circuit-level feature shared across acquired TLE and DS in the chronic phase, although the inciting insult is completely different between these epilepsy types. Firm establishment of such a shared mechanistic link may require further investigation.</p><p>In chronic acquired TLE after brain injury (such as due to status epilepticus induced by a chemoconvulsant agent) in rodents, the current operating model is a transient (weeks) impairment of corticohippocampal circuit function during the so-called latent period, followed by reconstitution of normal/near-normal operations, then secondary temporoammonic (TA) pathway failure and/or chronic impairment of DG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dengler et al., 2017</xref>). We did not directly investigate the TA pathway in this study, although our in vivo optogenetic stimulation of cell bodies within entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) likely activated TA as well as PP projections to hippocampus. Disambiguating the relative contribution of PP and TA pathway to ictogenesis in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice would be an interesting future direction.</p><p>Note that it is highly unlikely that this corticohippocampal circuit hyperexcitability provides a complete mechanistic explanation for seizures in <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, which places several important limitations on the scope of our interpretation. First, we only tested the impact of this circuit on hyperthermia-evoked seizures, and it is possible that spontaneous seizures are mechanistically dissimilar. Second, spontaneous seizures in this model begin at approximately P16-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>), at which time this circuit is only mildly hyperexcitable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); hence, this circuit abnormality likely does not underlie epilepsy onset in these mice (which may instead relate to the transient but profound hypoexcitability of PV-INs at early developmental time points), although it may contribute to ongoing seizures in the chronic phase. Finally, although there is evidence of temporal lobe dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaily et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kasperaviciute et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Siegler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tiefes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Van Poppel et al., 2012</xref>) in human patients with DS, DS is a multifocal epilepsy and seizures do not exclusively emanate from the temporal lobe.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanisms of corticohippocampal hyperexcitability in DS: expanding beyond the interneuron hypothesis</title><p>As PV-INs in DG have been shown to powerfully regulate the GC response to entorhinal cortical input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ewell and Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) and GABAergic interneurons are known to be abnormal in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mistry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2006</xref>), we initially hypothesized that PV-IN dysfunction would be the primary mechanism underlying the GC hyperactivation observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, our findings were not compatible with this conclusion, for multiple reasons.</p><p>First, we did observe severe impairment of <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> DG PV-INs at the early postnatal timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), consistent with previous studies characterizing hippocampal PV-INs in younger (≤ P21) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hedrich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>). However, the PP stimulation-evoked disynaptic feedforward IPSCs onto GCs were not impaired at this timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the observed differences at the rightward extreme of the <italic>I-</italic>F curve may be less physiologically relevant to DG circuit function.</p><p>Second, our analysis of <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> DG PV-INs at the young adult timepoint showed only a subtle impairment in action potential generation, characterized by run-down of action potential peak during prolonged trains at high frequency in response to large-amplitude current injections, likely due to accumulation of sodium channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This near-normalization of DG PV-INs in young adult <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) is consistent with prior work demonstrating that PV-IN dysfunction (in layer 2/3 barrel cortex) is limited to early developmental time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Favero et al., 2018</xref>). Our finding is also consistent with recent work demonstrating that sensorimotor cortex PV-INs in adult <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit normal activity levels during quiet wakefulness in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tran et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Third, we observed durable hyperactivation of GCs in response to PP activation in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice relative to wild-type even in the presence of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blockade (using PTX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which argues against impaired inhibition as the explanation for the genotype difference. In contrast, in a prior study showing increased evoked GC activation following status epilepticus-induced TLE, dentate hyperactivation in the epilepsy condition relative to control was eliminated by PTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dengler et al., 2017</xref>, p.201). This illustrates how disparate underlying epilepsy types (genetic mutation versus brain injury) could converge at the level of the circuit (DG hyperactivity), yet via disparate cellular and/or synaptic mechanisms. This compelling idea requires further investigation.</p><p>Finally, we found that, although application of the Nav1.1-specific activator Hm1a corrected PV-IN cellular dysfunction, it failed to normalize the PP-evoked circuit-level response across GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This highlights the conclusion that, by the young adult time point, the mechanism underlying abnormal circuit-level corticohippocampal dysfunction is more complex than Nav1.1 insufficiency (although Hm1a application does not act by increasing sodium current density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osteen et al., 2017</xref>). This distinction may have treatment implications: recent preclinical work using antisense oligonucleotide (ASOs) to increase <italic>Scn1a</italic> expression showed promising improvement in the disease phenotype when delivered at P2 or P14, prior to seizure onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2020</xref>). However, it remains to be seen whether boosting Nav1.1 expression with ASOs or via another approach would be effective in the chronic phase of the disorder, after secondary circuit deficits may already be in place. Another recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamagata et al., 2020</xref>), using CRISPR/dCas9-based gene activation to increase Nav1.1 expression in GABAergic interneurons at P28, found an increased temperature threshold of seizure induction; however, the treatment cohort had a marked increase in early mortality (prior to intervention at P28) versus other groups, rendering comparisons of the surviving mice difficult to interpret.</p><p>If inadequate inhibition does not underly the <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> corticohippocampal circuit hyperexcitability, what does? Our measurement of evoked post-synaptic currents onto GCs unexpectedly revealed increased synaptic excitatory PP input to GCs in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). We found no genotype difference in GC response to puffed glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This argues against a post-synaptic locus of the observed genotype difference, although the measured response to exogenous application of glutamate could be mediated by synaptic and/or extrasynaptic receptors. Future experiments, such as measurement of miniature EPSC amplitude and frequency, or use of strontium to probe presynaptic release, could further bolster this conclusion. Notably, we observed a lower PPR with repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This may suggest a higher pre-synaptic release probability at excitatory PP synapses in young adult <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice relative to age-matched wild-type control. However, we cannot exclude a role for differences in relative recruitment of lateral versus medial PP fibers, which are known to exhibit different short-term synaptic dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Petersen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our findings demonstrate excessive excitation in the cortico-hippocampal circuit that may reflect an increase in pre-synaptic release probability. The genotype differences in EPSC/IPSC ratio, evoked EPSC amplitude, and PPR, were not seen at the early postnatal timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), providing correlative evidence that such changes are important for the emergence of severe circuit hyperexcitability seen in the chronic phase of the disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our findings are consistent with previous studies showing hyperexcitability and increased synaptic excitation in downstream hippocampal CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hedrich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liautard et al., 2013</xref>), as well as one prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>) in a related mouse model which showed increased release probability with PP stimulation as well as increased frequency of spontaneous EPSCs in GCs.</p><p>The mechanism underlying the developmental pattern of the corticohippocampal circuit deficit remains unclear. The typical development of the corticohippocampal circuit – in which PP-evoked DG firing becomes more sparse – is at least in part mediated by increases in local circuit inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dieni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2013</xref>); thus, it is not simply the case that the <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> circuit remains in an ‘immature’ state. Rather, persistent GC hyperactivation could reflect accumulated or repetitive insult from ongoing seizures, a complex interaction between genotype and seizure burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Salgueiro-Pereira et al., 2019</xref>), and/or a pathologic compensatory increase in synaptic strength of the PP in response to loss of Nav1.1. These possibilities could be further explored using experimental manipulations to exacerbate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Salgueiro-Pereira et al., 2019</xref>) or ameliorate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>) the epilepsy phenotype of <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice; subsequent testing of the excitability of the corticohippocampal circuit could help parse the contribution of the genotype (common across cohorts) versus, for example, the effect of ongoing seizures, to disease severity. Conversely, it would be of interest to focally rescue <italic>Scn1a</italic> levels exclusively in dentate gyrus and/or entorhinal cortex of <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colasante et al., 2020</xref>), to test whether the corticohippocampal circuit would remain abnormal (assuming continued seizures involving the hippocampus). Finally, while we did not directly assess dendritic integration by GCs – which are known to exhibit strong voltage attenuation that modulates dendritic integration and contributes to their sparse activation in response to PP input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krueppel et al., 2011</xref>) – we do show that (a) the intrinsic excitability of GCs (as measured at the soma) is unchanged in <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice at both developmental time points and (b) the response to exogenous glutamate application is the same between genotypes (with attendant caveats noted above).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Rescue of corticohippocampal circuit excitability via targeted recruitment of PV-INs</title><p>To test the impact of local inhibitory interneurons on the recruitment of GCs by PP input, we combined 2 P imaging with optogenetic stimulation with the red-shifted channelrhodopsin variant ChrimsonR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This technique enabled us to perform simultaneous imaging (of anatomically defined GCs) and photostimulation (of genetically defined interneuron subtypes; that is PV-INs or SST-INs) within the same slice. We found that targeted PV-IN activation in acute slice significantly decreased GC activation in response to PP input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Optogenetic activation of PV-expressing cells (and fibers) within hippocampus has been shown to truncate seizures in vivo in a mouse model of TLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2013</xref>). It remains to be seen whether a similar strategy may be successfully employed against temporal lobe-onset (or other) seizures in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. Our data shows that, while DG PV-INs do exhibit minor abnormalities in spike generation during the chronic phase of the disorder, these cells remain capable of discharging short trains of action potentials at high frequency ( &gt; 200 Hz for trains of 10+ action potentials) such that there is sufficient inhibitory ‘reserve’ that would enable these cells to be exogenously recruited to balance aberrant excitatory activity.</p><p>Improved understanding of the mechanisms of ictogenesis in DS is critical toward the development of novel therapies for what is currently an incurable and treatment-resistant disorder associated with high mortality. Our results indicate complex network dysfunction attributed to excessive excitation – rather than exclusively due to dysfunction of GABAergic subsystems – in the chronic phase of the disease. We provide evidence that the corticohippocampal circuit is hyperexcitable in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, as has been shown in animal models of acquired temporal lobe epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dengler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that DG circuits play a key role in temporal lobe vulnerability to seizure onset and/or propagation. Thus, corticohippocampal circuits may be an attractive target for seizure suppression or interruption across diverse forms of epilepsy. Specifically, DG PV-INs powerfully regulate seizures and circuit excitability in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice and may thus be an attractive candidate population for targeted therapeutic intervention. As sparse GC firing is also thought to be crucial for cognitive functions subserved by the hippocampus, such as pattern separation and memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rolls, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Treves et al., 2008</xref>), correction of this circuit dysfunction may also potentially modulate the severe and chronic intellectual disability characteristic of DS and even more difficult to approach than epilepsy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">129S-Scn1atm1Kea/Mmjax</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jax</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MMRRC_037107-JAX">MMRRC_037107-JAX</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. Jennifer A.

Anesthesia depth was monitored by response to toe pinch and by breathing rate. Animals were injected subcutaneously with buprenorphine (0.5–1.0 mg/kg, sub-Q), cefazolin (500 mg/kg, sub-Q), and meloxicam (5 mg/kg, sub-Q), for post-operative analgesia and anti-bacterial prophylaxis. Mice were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments) while resting on a heating pad. After removal of fur and sterilization of the scalp, a scalpel was used to expose the skull, and target regions were identified in relation to skull surface landmarks (lambda and bregma). Craniotomies were made using a hand-held drill. Injections were performed with 200–250 nL of virus per site, at a rate of 100 nL/min, using a 10 µL syringe (Hamilton) and a 33 G beveled needle (World Precision Instruments). Injection coordinates for entorhinal cortex (relative to Bregma, in mm) were –4.5 (A/P) / 3.0 (M/L) / 4.5 (D/V); –4.5 (A/P) / 3.6 (M/L) / 4.2 (D/V); and –4.8 (A/P) / 3.2 (M/L), 3.2 and 3.8 (D/V). Dorsal and ventral DG were targeted via 10–12 injections per animal, spanning from –1.5 to –3.8 A/P, 0.7–2.6 M/L, and 2.0–3.8 D/V. Injections were unilateral (R hemisphere) except for mice used for in vivo chemogenetics experiment, which had bilateral injections.

Hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (HEC) slices were obtained to preserve within the slice the PP connection between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>). A mid-sagittal cut was made to divide the hemispheres, and one hemisphere was mounted onto an angled agar block. The blade therefore passed through the block at an acute (15°) downward angle from rostral to caudal, resulting in modified horizontal/axial HEC slices. Slices were sectioned at a 300 µm thickness using a Leica VT-1200S vibratome. Slices were transferred to a holding chamber containing the same sucrose solution. After a recovery period of 30 min at 30°C–32°C, the holding chamber was removed from the water bath and allowed to return to room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Perforant path stimulation</title><p>The perforant path was stimulated using a 125 µm diameter concentric bipolar microelectrode (FHC Inc NC0950490). The electrode was placed in the entorhinal cortex adjacent to the apex of the dentate gyrus granule cell layer and approximately 100 µm from the hippocampal fissure so as not to directly stimulate GCs. Since GCs are known to be more readily activated by PP stimulation in younger mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), we selected different ranges of stimulation intensity for the two groups (25–400 µA for early postnatal; 100–500 µA for young adult).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Slice electrophysiology</title><p>Slices were transferred to a recording chamber (shielded from light in the case of opsin-containing slices) and continuously perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; in mM: NaCl, 125; KCl, 2.5; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.0; MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.0; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 26; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25; glucose, 10), continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, at a rate of approximately 3 mL/min.

Dried Quantum Dots (625 nm emission) were reconstituted in hexane. Freshly pulled borosilicate glass electrodes (7–9 MΩ) were dipped 5–10 times into the solution, while maintaining positive pressure to avoid clogging the pipette tip. A subset of cell-attached recordings was performed with 100 µM picrotoxin added to the bath solution to increase the proportion of cells responsive to PP stimulation.</p><p>Signals were sampled at 50 kHz, amplified with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 10 kHz, digitized using a DigiData 1550, and acquired using pClamp10 software. Data were not included for final analysis if the cell had a membrane potential greater (less negative) than –60 mV (for GCs) or greater than –50 mV (for PV-INs), or if access resistance was greater than 30 MΩ. Series resistance compensation (bridge balance) was applied throughout current clamp experiments with readjustments as necessary.

Consecutive seizures were triggered 24 hr apart.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of whole-cell electrophysiology data</title><p>All analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goff, 2022</xref>) was performed blind to genotype using Matlab (Mathworks) or Python (custom software using Python 3.7 and the pyABF model) with quality control using manual confirmation in Clampfit (pCLAMP). Resting membrane potential (<italic>V</italic>m) was measured directly using the average value of a 1 s sweep with no direct current injection. Input resistance (<italic>R</italic>m) was calculated using the average response to a small hyperpolarizing step near rest, using <italic>R</italic>m = Δ<italic>V</italic>/<italic>I</italic> for each sweep. Membrane time constant was calculated from the single exponential fit to the hyperpolarizing response to a negative current injection. Rheobase was determined as the minimum current injection that elicited APs using a 600ms sweep at 10–25 pA intervals. AP threshold was calculated as the value at which the derivative of the voltage (d<italic>V</italic>/dt) first reached 10 mV/ms. AP peak refers to the absolute maximum voltage value of an individual AP. AP amplitude was the difference between AP peak and AP threshold; AP rise time was the time from AP threshold to AP peak. AP half-width is defined as the width of the AP (in ms) at half-maximal amplitude (half the voltage difference between the AP threshold and peak). AHP amplitude was calculated as the depth of the after-discharge potential (in mV) relative to AP threshold. Sag (produced by <italic>I</italic>h), was calculated as the steady state relative to maximal hyperpolarization in response to a negative current injection, expressed as a percentage. Maximal instantaneous firing was calculated as the inverse of the smallest inter-spike interval elicited during a suprathreshold 600ms current injection. Maximal steady-state firing was defined as the maximal mean firing frequency during a suprathreshold 600ms current injection. Spikes were defined as having a clear threshold, at which the derivative of the voltage (d<italic>V</italic>/dt) is greater than 10 mV/ms, a spike height overshooting 0 mV, and an amplitude of at least 40 mV. All quantification of single spike properties was done at the first spike to the current injection twice rheobase. <italic>I</italic>-f plots were created using the steady-state firing calculated for each current step.</p><p>Paired-pulse ratio was defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the second EPSC to amplitude of the first EPSC (extrapolating a new baseline following the prior EPSC), in response to 20 Hz perforant path stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Analysis of 2P imaging data</title><p>Analysis was performed using custom code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Somarowthu, 2022</xref>) in Matlab. All conditions under each field of view were grouped together as a raw data file. Motion was minimal or absent in most cases, but there was some drift during longer imaging sessions, such as with pharmacologic application. Therefore, within each raw data file, all individual frames were motion corrected using the Non-Rigid Motion Correction (NoRMCorre) Matlab toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pnevmatikakis, 2019</xref>). The first 200 frames were used for the template. The motion corrected individual frames were averaged to obtain an average image for the respective field of view. Regions of interest (ROIs) were identified from the average image. ROIs were individual GCs, and were identified using NeuroSeg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guan et al., 2018</xref>), a Matlab toolbox with both automatic and manual options for selection of regions of cells; we primarily relied upon the manual option as we observed that the automated algorithm was not able to effectively identify the densely packed GCs.</p><p>The raw traces from each identified cell were extracted and low-pass filtered. The first 50 frames of each trace in each condition were considered as a baseline to compute d<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>0 for each trace. Peaks of the traces were detected using the findpeaks function in Matlab. A threshold of (mean + 3*standard deviation) was used to define significant peaks. A cell was detected as active if a significant peak is shown in the respective trace for that particular condition. The results were summarized for each condition by both the proportion of active cells and the individual significant peak amplitudes.</p><p>A mixed modeling approach was implemented for statistical analysis of data across populations. This was performed due to the hierarchical experimental design, in which sources of variance could arise from effects of imaging fields, slices, and/or mice. The proportion of activated cells were modeled as a binomial distribution with a probit link function. The amplitude of peaks was modeled as a normal distribution with a logarithmic link function.</p><p>For analyses involving comparisons within a given imaging field (e.g. response to PP stimulation alone versus PP stimulation plus optogenetic activation of PV-INs), mixed modeling was used to test the hypothesis that any difference between the paired data is significantly different from zero; if the difference between pairs is significantly different than zero, that implies the paired data are significantly different from each other. Mouse, slice, field, and cell information are again used as the random factors in the mixed modeling.</p><p>Some analyses (‘responds to each stim’) include for each condition only the cells that are active that condition. Other analyses (‘responds to max stim’) include for every condition all cells that are active under maximal stimulation conditions.</p><p>For spike deconvolution, spikes were extracted using constrained non-negative matrix factorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>). The deconvolution parameters such as rise time and decay time were fine-tuned based on the ground truth data. A cell was defined as active if there were one or more spikes detected. Deconvolution yielded a single spike or multiple spikes based on the perforant path stimulation pattern (1 pulse versus four pulses). Irrespective of the stimulation, the total deconvolved spikes are derived by summing the individual deconvolved spikes obtained during the total time range of stimulation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The authors describe circuit changes in a hemizygous mouse model that potentially contribute to the severe epilepsy disorder Dravet syndrome. They show that hyperactivation of the dentate gyrus results from enhanced synaptic excitation rather than reduced synaptic inhibition, the latter being the widespread view in the field. They provide some evidence that this alteration occurs in the age range when inhibitory interneuron dysfunction has been normalized, providing an interesting potential mechanism by which neural circuit function is altered even after deficits in inhibition are seemingly corrected. The reviewers agreed that the main conclusion of enhanced synaptic excitation independent of inhibition is largely convincing and new. Enthusiasm for the topic and approach is tempered, however, by shared concerns about some weaknesses in data presentation, some claims that were not fully supported, missing controls and a need for a deeper analysis of the synaptic basis of enhanced excitation. These essential revisions will need to be addressed in a revised manuscript as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Outcome measures from the ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments should be presented consistently across figures, and in a manner that clearly summarizes the differences between conditions (including blocking inhibition).</p><p>2) What is the circuit reorganization that generates larger EPSCs? Some additional insight using standard synaptic assays would provide mechanistic depth, and parallel experiments at the younger age would strengthen the conclusion about the developmental time course (which currently has conflicting data depending on the analysis shown in Figure 2).</p><p>3) Address whether fidelity of spike detection is affected by intact inhibition.</p><p>4) Either temper claims or provide additional data about intrinsic excitability of GCs and PVs.</p><p>5) Some experiments are missing controls, including a lack of counter-balance design in testing the ictogenicity of ChR2 stimulation, control groups in Figures4, 6, 7, and lack of characterization of the specificity and variability viral and Cre-based cell targeting. These limitations could be addressed by additional data and/or acknowledging limits of the interpretations. Likewise, conclusions in the abstract should be fully supported by the current data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Figure 1 provides a nice validation for spike detection by ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using simultaneous cell-attached recordings. However, these experiments were performed in the presence of a GABAA antagonist rather than conditions mimicking the other imaging experiments (Figure 2). The authors should highlight in the text (rather than just methods) that these experiments are performed in an antagonist and also address whether block of GABAA receptors alters the fidelity of spike detection. This is important because subthreshold ca<sup>2+</sup> transients can mimic spikes (i.e. Stocca et al., J Physiol 2007) and GABAA-mediated responses even in mature dentate GCs are typically depolarizing (Chiang et al., 2012).</p><p>2) In Figure 2, These are important and interesting results. However, how should the result in Figure 2B, columns 1-2 be interpreted? Does this mean there is a difference in the young mice (in contrast to the conclusion in the discussion)? If the difference relies on analyzing only the &quot;best fields&quot; it doesn't seem very reproducible. Rather, it seems that the PTX approach taken in Figure B3-B5 is far more informative, because the continued difference in in activation rules out the involvement of GABAA mediated inhibition (already ruling out feed-forward or feed-back inhibition suggested by subsequent experiments). This could be repeated in the early postnatal mice in place of the &quot;best field analysis&quot;. But it is surprising that PTX appears to have very little effect on GC activation, for example, the blue lines in A3-5 and B3-5 appear nearly identical. It would be useful to have an additional summary analysis of &quot;estimated activation&quot; in each condition to highlight the magnitude of the differences (akin to panel 5D but related to %activation) to provide a clearer interpretation of the timing and magnitude of these effects.</p><p>My impression is also that the analysis in panel D5 underestimates magnitude of the differences between genotypes, which primarily generates greater recruitment of the active cell population rather than an increase in the number of spikes per active cell (this also seems more consistent with the interpretation of a lack of changes in intrinsic GC excitability). It is also not clear whether D5 represents both 1 and 4 pulses, postnatal and adult slices and PTX.</p><p>3). Based on data in Table 1, the authors conclude that altered intrinsic excitability does not contribute to spiking. However, this is not fully convincing – additional measures of intrinsic excitability that could contribute to afferent-induced spiking should be assessed, including AP threshold and measures related to integration of EPSPs including active dendritic potentials like Ih and membrane time constant. It would be useful if the authors measure APs during repetitive stimulation in GCs as in the interneuron recordings (Figure 3). Also, individual cell values are not typically averaged across mice – this should be corrected or justified.</p><p>4). The experiment with acute application of Hm1a is important, but the analysis of ca<sup>2+</sup> does not seem comprehensive. The authors should provide analysis of the Estimated Activation (as in Figure 2A) to more strongly support the conclusion that the identified deficits in PV-IN spike generation and impairment in repetitive firing does not underlie the observed large-scale circuit impairment.</p><p>5) Along with Figure 2B3-5, Figure 5 is strong data supporting an increase in EPSCs in Scn1a slices, but the interpretation of the IPSCs is unclear. Is synaptic inhibition altered or not? The authors might want to avoid interpretation of the IPSCs without additional experiments to address it more convincingly.</p><p>More importantly the authors should address what underlies the larger EPSCs – is it more synapses, larger synapses, greater release probability? A more in-depth analysis would provide greater insight into this very interesting and unexpected finding.</p><p>6). There is huge variability in Figure 6C – possibly due to variability in ChR2 expression. How was this taken into account across mice? This is a similar concern for the interpretation of Figure 7 – how many SST interneurons were labeled versus PV interneurons? Did PV or SST interneuron activation have a different effect in WT mice? What is the specificity of the Cre lines? In general, it is well-established that activation of interneurons in DG suppresses spiking and seizure activity, so the results in Figure 7 don't add new understanding about the main novel finding of enhance excitatory transmission. This seems like a departure from the main topic so I'm not sure that it is necessary to perform all the relevant controls but rather the interpretations of these experiments might be tempered.</p><p>7) Some conclusions in the first paragraph of the discussion are oversimplifications that are not entirely consistent with the results. I.e. this abnormality was not present in early postnatal mice (P14-21) yet appeared during the chronic phase of the disorder. What about evoked EPSCs at the early age?</p><p>8) Some conclusions go beyond the present data. The idea that the identified circuit abnormality mirrors that seen in models of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy and suggests convergent mechanisms linking genetic and acquired causes of temporal is interesting and worthy of discussion. However, it seems beyond the scope of the current dataset to be included as a conclusion in the abstract. While the authors have identified hyperexcitation in the EC-DG circuit that results from greater synaptic excitation, they have not addressed whether similar dysfunction is present in other circuits nor whether this dysfunction in the EC-DG circuit is necessary for seizure activity in DS. This point might be worthy of discussion.</p><p>The statement in the abstract that excitability of parvalbumin interneurons (PV- INs) was normal and selective activation of PV-INs rescued circuit impairments is also an overstatement. Acute inhibition from either PVs or SSTs does not rescue circuit reorganization – it likely masks the effect of stronger excitatory drive. It is not clear that there is in fact, a circuit reorganization – the authors have just shown that EPSCs are larger which could mean more synapses, more receptors per synapse, or higher release probability – none of which would necessarily qualify as a &quot;circuit reorganization&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This work would be much more impactful with experiments examining how and why the changes to synaptic signaling come about and how that translates into increased activation of DG. The major findings are of great interest, but the mismatch between the stimulation that reveals the differences in Figure 2 (1 or 4 synaptic inputs) and those used to test intrinsic properties Figure 3 and 4 limit the relevance of those intrinsic property experiments. While wild type control experiments often don't show differences (or in the case of Figure 7 may not show a response to change), leaving these experiments out suggests a lack of rigor in the design of the experiments and presentation of the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would just like to expand on the criticism about the pharmacology.</p><p>1. Would it be possible to add to these results (Figure 4 and Figure 5) plots like those in figure 2?</p><p>2. More importantly – could you add the baseline dF/F0 to Figure 5F? I think it is necessary to show that picrotoxin causes an increase in dF/F0 in the control condition- just as a sanity check.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Corticohippocampal circuit dysfunction in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree this manuscript covers an important topic, provides novel data that will be of broad interest, and has gone to great lengths to address the comments of past reviewers. Please enhance the clarity of interpretations and presentation by addressing the following:</p><p>1) Tone down the strength of the conclusions related to pre- vs. postsynaptic locus based on the limitations specified in the comments below.</p><p>2) Include additional methodological details and clarifications as requested.</p><p>3) Strengthen the conclusions by moving essential data from the supplemental figures to main figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done a commendable job addressing the concerns raised by the reviewers. I have a few remaining points that should be addressed, but these do not reduce my enthusiasm for the significance of these results.</p><p>1. I am not very confident about conclusion that the dramatic increase in the EPSC is due to an increase in release probability for two reasons. First, the authors exclude the influence of post-synaptic component from the increased evoked EPSC using glutamate puffing experiments. But this is not the best approach to address this question due to the high variability/glutamate receptor desensitization, as well as ambiguity about whether synaptic vs extrasynaptic receptors mediate the response. A more conventional and sensitive approach is to compare mEPSC amplitude and frequency, or strontium-evoked uEPSCs, between Scn1a+/- and WT mice.</p><p>Second, the authors used the reduction in paired-pulse ratio (PPR) as a measure of higher release probability from Scn1a+/- PP synapses. While this is a reasonable interpretation, synapses from lateral and medial entorhinal cortex exhibit different PPR ratios that need to be taken into account. The uniformly high facilitation (PPR&gt;1) shown in WT slices in Figure 5 H and I is indicative of transmission from the lateral perforant path, whereas the variable (PPR=1) in the other panels including the wt slices in Figure 5 Supp 1D is indicative of transmission from a mixed population of lateral and medial synapses (see Petersen et al., Neuroscience 2013). Interpretation of PPR changes in DG requires identification of the pathway stimulated. But since the pre vs postsynaptic locus is not essential to the main conclusions, this concern could be address by toning down the conclusion and discussing these caveats. Also, the glutamate-evoked currents should not be called EPSCs in the text and legends.</p><p>2. Further clarification would be beneficial for Figure 5 —figure supplement 2 panel A, where authors showed a statistically significant difference in magnitude of evoked GC responses between Scn1a+/- and WT using ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. However, panel C-F and title indicate no difference.</p><p>3. Finally, figure 3A and 4A require better representative traces with reduced line width. It is helpful that the authors use the same color scheme consistently, and it would be even easier to have the colors labeled within the figures instead of in the legend.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69293.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Outcome measures from the ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments should be presented consistently across figures, and in a manner that clearly summarizes the differences between conditions (including blocking inhibition).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful feedback.

Our revised manuscript includes substantial new data to address this critique, including:</p><p>– A parallel characterization in juvenile mice of the intrinsic properties of granule cells and PV cells in wild-type and <italic>Scn1a</italic>+/- mice</p><p>– Isolation of the post-synaptic component of the response in granule cells via local application of glutamate</p><p>– Determination of the EPSC paired-pulse ratio to measure pre-synaptic release probability to provide evidence in support of a pre- vs. post-synaptic mechanism.</p><p>Together, these findings are aligned to suggest that the larger EPSCs are driven by a presynaptic mechanism.

These limitations could be addressed by additional data and/or acknowledging limits of the interpretations. Likewise, conclusions in the abstract should be fully supported by the current data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this very helpful feedback, which has improved the transparency and rigor of our manuscript.</p><p>– For the Hm1a experiment (Figure 4), we now present wild-type control data for both PV electrophysiology and 2P circuit-level imaging (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>– Despite what we perceive as the novelty of this optogenetic stimulation approach, we have elected to remove the optogenetic imaging data (previously Figure 6C), as we indeed found results to be highly variable across mice and between slices from an individual mouse.</p><p>– As previously designed, the entorhinal cortex ictogenicity experiment could not be performed with counter-balancing due to a kindling-like effect. We therefore fully redesigned the experiment as a single-day experiment with relevant controls for both photostimulation and genotype (now Figure 6).</p><p>– We have added an in vivo experiment in which we chemogenetically inhibit dentate PV cells and demonstrate a lower temperature threshold for seizure generation. This experiment was performed with a counter-balanced design and with controls for genotype and for CNO.</p><p>– For the experiment demonstrating a decrease in circuit activation in response to PV stimulation (now Figure 8), we were not able to perform a wild-type control due to very low levels of granule cell activation in wild-type mice under those conditions (see Figure 2, panel A3 – response to 1 pulse in young adult wild-type mice). In other words, in the wild-type mice, there was essentially no signal to block. This is consistent with previously published data showing low recruitment of dentate gyrus granule cells in response to perforant path activation (e.g., Yu et al., 2013 J Neurosci; Ewell and Jones 2010 J Neurosci; Dieni et al., 2013 J Neurosci; etc.). However, in this experiment, we in fact conceptualize the SST activation as the control group (for the PV activation), which we have clarified in the text.</p><p>– We now include data to characterize the PV- and SST-Cre based cell targeting (Figure 8; Figure 8 —figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Figure 1 provides a nice validation for spike detection by ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using simultaneous cell-attached recordings. However, these experiments were performed in the presence of a GABAA antagonist rather than conditions mimicking the other imaging experiments (Figure 2). The authors should highlight in the text (rather than just methods) that these experiments are performed in an antagonist and also address whether block of GABAA receptors alters the fidelity of spike detection. This is important because subthreshold ca<sup>2+</sup> transients can mimic spikes (i.e. Stocca et al., J Physiol 2007) and GABAA-mediated responses even in mature dentate GCs are typically depolarizing (Chiang et al., 2012).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important point. We have added clarity to the main text as suggested regarding the use of picrotoxin in the validation experiment and we have also added the above references to the text. To address the possibility of subthreshold calcium transients resulting in “false positive” spike detection, we have performed a separate experiment in which we measured calcium signals in the absence of picrotoxin, focusing on cells that fired either 0 or 1 action potentials (Figure 1H). We confirmed that we were still able to resolve single action potentials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2, These are important and interesting results. However, how should the result in Figure 2B, columns 1-2 be interpreted? Does this mean there is a difference in the young mice (in contrast to the conclusion in the discussion)? If the difference relies on analyzing only the &quot;best fields&quot; it doesn't seem very reproducible. Rather, it seems that the PTX approach taken in Figure B3-B5 is far more informative, because the continued difference in in activation rules out the involvement of GABAA mediated inhibition (already ruling out feed-forward or feed-back inhibition suggested by subsequent experiments). This could be repeated in the early postnatal mice in place of the &quot;best field analysis&quot;. But it is surprising that PTX appears to have very little effect on GC activation, for example, the blue lines in A3-5 and B3-5 appear nearly identical. It would be useful to have an additional summary analysis of &quot;estimated activation&quot; in each condition to highlight the magnitude of the differences (akin to panel 5D but related to %activation) to provide a clearer interpretation of the timing and magnitude of these effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #1 for these helpful comments.</p><p>– First, we agree that the picrotoxin approach was preferable to the perhaps somewhat arbitrary “best fields analysis”, and we have therefore discarded this “best fields analysis” and collected a new dataset at the early postnatal timepoint, including a picrotoxin wash-on condition for each imaging field. Figure 2 is now updated with these results, and the conclusion is essentially unchanged. (Note that Figure 1A1-2, C1-2, and D1-2 are pooled across the two datasets which were very similar, whereas B1-2 includes only this new dataset.). This new presentation of data achieves the standardization requested by the Reviewers mentioned above.</p><p>– Second, to explain why row B (only those cells that <italic>do</italic> respond to maximal stimulation in the presence of PTX) appears qualitatively similar to row A (all identified cells), we now include a supplemental figure quantifying the percentage of cells activated by picrotoxin in each imaging field (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2). We note that this is a very high percentage (~88-96%); in other words, the large majority of the cells do fire in response to a strong stimulus in the presence of picrotoxin. We have clarified this in the text as well.</p><p>– Third, we agree that the continued genotype difference in activation in the presence of PTX is an important finding. We now show expanded analysis (Figure 5E) to highlight this result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My impression is also that the analysis in panel D5 underestimates magnitude of the differences between genotypes, which primarily generates greater recruitment of the active cell population rather than an increase in the number of spikes per active cell (this also seems more consistent with the interpretation of a lack of changes in intrinsic GC excitability). It is also not clear whether D5 represents both 1 and 4 pulses, postnatal and adult slices and PTX.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. Indeed, Figure 2D5-6 answers the question “How activated were the activated cells?” (i.e., how many spikes were there per active cell). We thus only included cells that were activated under each individual stimulation condition (such that the “<italic>n</italic>” varies across the x-axis). However, per Figure 2A-C we know that there was also a genotype difference in the proportion of activated cells. We have thus added a supplemental figure (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3) designed to answer the different question: “How much activation was there overall?” (i.e., how many spikes were there across the population). In this new supplemental figure, we include all cells that respond to the maximal stimulation condition (no PTX); i.e., averaging many 0 values in the lower stimulation conditions. We have updated the text to make this distinction clear. (Overall, the genotype findings persist across these analysis conditions.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3). Based on data in Table 1, the authors conclude that altered intrinsic excitability does not contribute to spiking. However, this is not fully convincing – additional measures of intrinsic excitability that could contribute to afferent-induced spiking should be assessed, including AP threshold and measures related to integration of EPSPs including active dendritic potentials like Ih and membrane time constant. It would be useful if the authors measure APs during repetitive stimulation in GCs as in the interneuron recordings (Figure 3). Also, individual cell values are not typically averaged across mice – this should be corrected or justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated both tables to include a more comprehensive set of parameters, and no longer average across mice. We now present data from repetitive stimulation of GCs at both timepoints, which shows no significant genotype differences (Figure 2 —figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4). The experiment with acute application of Hm1a is important, but the analysis of ca<sup>2+</sup> does not seem comprehensive. The authors should provide analysis of the Estimated Activation (as in Figure 2A) to more strongly support the conclusion that the identified deficits in PV-IN spike generation and impairment in repetitive firing does not underlie the observed large-scale circuit impairment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated this experiment and now present both proportional activation and amplitude data, for both <italic>Scn1a</italic>+/- (Figure 4), and wild-type (now Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Along with Figure 2B3-5, Figure 5 is strong data supporting an increase in EPSCs in Scn1a slices, but the interpretation of the IPSCs is unclear. Is synaptic inhibition altered or not? The authors might want to avoid interpretation of the IPSCs without additional experiments to address it more convincingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include EPSC/IPSC data recorded from the early postnatal timepoint as well. We agree that the IPSC data is less straightforward: at both timepoints we do find a very slight increase in the magnitude of the IPSC in <italic>Scn1a</italic>+/- mice, reaching statistical significance as determined by comparison of curve fits, but without significant differences at the individual data points. Overall, we agree that it is not clear whether this difference is physiologically meaningful. We do now mention this difference in the Discussion in reference to the early postnatal dataset, highlighting that, although PV-INs fail much sooner than wild-type, their higher input resistance and slightly left-shifted <italic>I-</italic>F curve (now Figure 3) complicates interpretation of their function within the circuit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly the authors should address what underlies the larger EPSCs – is it more synapses, larger synapses, greater release probability? A more in-depth analysis would provide greater insight into this very interesting and unexpected finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We address this important point as follows:</p><p>– We performed two experiments in the young adult timepoint: (1) We measured the response to puffed glutamate (to eliminate the presynaptic component) and (2) we determined the paired pulse ratio (PPR) from repetitive stimulation (to assess release probability). As shown in Figure 5 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1, we found no difference in the response to puffed glutamate, but a significantly lower PPR in the <italic>Scn1a</italic>+/- mice to suggest that indeed the release probability is higher in <italic>Scn1a</italic>+/- mice.</p><p>– We further measured EPSCs and IPSCs in the juvenile timepoint (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2) and found no increase in EPSCs in <italic>Scn1a</italic>+/- mice at the juvenile time point, as well as no genotype difference in release probability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6). There is huge variability in Figure 6C – possibly due to variability in ChR2 expression. How was this taken into account across mice? This is a similar concern for the interpretation of Figure 7 – how many SST interneurons were labeled versus PV interneurons? Did PV or SST interneuron activation have a different effect in WT mice? What is the specificity of the Cre lines? In general, it is well-established that activation of interneurons in DG suppresses spiking and seizure activity, so the results in Figure 7 don't add new understanding about the main novel finding of enhance excitatory transmission. This seems like a departure from the main topic so I'm not sure that it is necessary to perform all the relevant controls but rather the interpretations of these experiments might be tempered.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these critiques, which we have addressed as follows:</p><p>– Regarding Figure 6C, as noted above, we performed additional experiments with optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal cortex and 2P imaging in DG slice, but found a continued high degree of variability within and across mice; we also observed variability even within an imaging field, with difficulty reproducing the same response across trials of identical stimulation. Hence, we consider that further work is required to further refine the approach and decided to remove this data from the manuscript, despite the perceived novelty and promise of this type of experiment.</p><p>– We attempted to test the response of PV and SST activation in WT mice but found that the baseline signal was too low to perform the experiment. (Note that this experiment was performed with a single pulse at 500 µA, which activates very few cells in the WT condition; see Figure 2 panel A3.) Overall, we conceptualize SST as a control for the PV experiment (within the <italic>Scn1a</italic>+/- mouse), which we have clarified in the text.</p><p>– We in fact observed <italic>more</italic> ChrimsonR-labeled SST cells than PV cells per field (quantified in the Results section), although (as we note in the Discussion section), our stimulation will activate both cell bodies and fibers, making a true quantitative comparison challenging.</p><p>– We now address Cre-line specificity with immunostaining (Figure 8 —figure supplement 1) as well as differential anatomic localization of ChrimsonR-expressing fibers (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Some conclusions in the first paragraph of the discussion are oversimplifications that are not entirely consistent with the results. I.e. this abnormality was not present in early postnatal mice (P14-21) yet appeared during the chronic phase of the disorder. What about evoked EPSCs at the early age?</p></disp-quote><p>We now present data at the early postnatal timepoint (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2), with no difference seen in E/I ratio, EPSC magnitude, or PPR. We have edited the Discussion section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Some conclusions go beyond the present data. The idea that the identified circuit abnormality mirrors that seen in models of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy and suggests convergent mechanisms linking genetic and acquired causes of temporal is interesting and worthy of discussion. However, it seems beyond the scope of the current dataset to be included as a conclusion in the abstract. While the authors have identified hyperexcitation in the EC-DG circuit that results from greater synaptic excitation, they have not addressed whether similar dysfunction is present in other circuits nor whether this dysfunction in the EC-DG circuit is necessary for seizure activity in DS. This point might be worthy of discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the Abstract to remove this verbiage, and have included consideration of this point in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statement in the abstract that excitability of parvalbumin interneurons (PV- INs) was normal and selective activation of PV-INs rescued circuit impairments is also an overstatement. Acute inhibition from either PVs or SSTs does not rescue circuit reorganization – it likely masks the effect of stronger excitatory drive. It is not clear that there is in fact, a circuit reorganization – the authors have just shown that EPSCs are larger which could mean more synapses, more receptors per synapse, or higher release probability – none of which would necessarily qualify as a &quot;circuit reorganization&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have edited the abstract accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This work would be much more impactful with experiments examining how and why the changes to synaptic signaling come about and how that translates into increased activation of DG. The major findings are of great interest, but the mismatch between the stimulation that reveals the differences in Figure 2 (1 or 4 synaptic inputs) and those used to test intrinsic properties Figure 3 and 4 limit the relevance of those intrinsic property experiments. While wild type control experiments often don't show differences (or in the case of Figure 7 may not show a response to change), leaving these experiments out suggests a lack of rigor in the design of the experiments and presentation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>These recommendations have been addressed in detail above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would just like to expand on the criticism about the pharmacology.</p><p>1.

I have a few remaining points that should be addressed, but these do not reduce my enthusiasm for the significance of these results.</p><p>1. I am not very confident about conclusion that the dramatic increase in the EPSC is due to an increase in release probability for two reasons. First, the authors exclude the influence of post-synaptic component from the increased evoked EPSC using glutamate puffing experiments. But this is not the best approach to address this question due to the high variability/glutamate receptor desensitization, as well as ambiguity about whether synaptic vs extrasynaptic receptors mediate the response. A more conventional and sensitive approach is to compare mEPSC amplitude and frequency, or strontium-evoked uEPSCs, between Scn1a+/- and WT mice.</p><p>Second, the authors used the reduction in paired-pulse ratio (PPR) as a measure of higher release probability from Scn1a+/- PP synapses. While this is a reasonable interpretation, synapses from lateral and medial entorhinal cortex exhibit different PPR ratios that need to be taken into account. The uniformly high facilitation (PPR&gt;1) shown in WT slices in Figure 5 H and I is indicative of transmission from the lateral perforant path, whereas the variable (PPR=1) in the other panels including the wt slices in Figure 5 Supp 1D is indicative of transmission from a mixed population of lateral and medial synapses (see Petersen et al., Neuroscience 2013). Interpretation of PPR changes in DG requires identification of the pathway stimulated. But since the pre vs postsynaptic locus is not essential to the main conclusions, this concern could be address by toning down the conclusion and discussing these caveats. Also, the glutamate-evoked currents should not be called EPSCs in the text and legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these helpful comments:</p><p>– Conclusions based on the glutamate puff experiments have been toned down in both the Results and Discussion section, and the ambiguity of synaptic versus extrasynaptic receptor activation has been acknowledged.</p><p>– Interpretation of the meaning of the change in PPR has also been toned down, and the important caveat as to the proportionate activation of lateral versus medial perforant path has been added to the Discussion section, along with the Peterson et al., reference suggested by Reviewer #1.</p><p>– The term “EPSC” has been replaced in all references to exogenous glutamate puff-evoked currents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Further clarification would be beneficial for Figure 5 —figure supplement 2 panel A, where authors showed a statistically significant difference in magnitude of evoked GC responses between Scn1a+/- and WT using ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. However, panel C-F and title indicate no difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that Reviewer #1 has pointed this out. Indeed, as shown in Figure 2D1, there is a small but significant difference in d<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F0</italic> at this juvenile timepoint. We find that the genotype difference persists in the presence of PTX (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2A) and is therefore independent of synaptic inhibition. However, we did not find evidence of increased synaptic excitation onto GCs at this timepoint (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2) and, thus, the mechanism of this finding remains to be fully clarified. We have now highlighted this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Finally, figure 3A and 4A require better representative traces with reduced line width. It is helpful that the authors use the same color scheme consistently, and it would be even easier to have the colors labeled within the figures instead of in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these helpful comments towards improving the manuscript.</p><p>– Representative traces in Figure 3 have been modified (expanded on the horizontal axis) such that individual action potentials are now visible.</p><p>– Explicit color labeling has been added to those Figures for which it is not already provided using different color(s) of text, namely:</p><p>Figure 1; Figure 2 and associated Figure 2 —figure supplements; Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 and 2</p><p>– However, for Figure 4A, even with maximally reduced line width it would not be possible to resolve individual action potentials without greatly increasing the size of the traces. Since the purpose of this figure panel is to qualitatively illustrate the spike rundown and eventual failures at baseline and correction after addition of Hm1a, we believe that the current formatting is appropriate. We have added a comment in the text along these lines.</p></body></sub-article></article>
