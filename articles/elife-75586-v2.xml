A neurobiological model of long-term memory proposes a mechanism by which memories that are initially unstable can be strengthened through subsequent novel experiences. In a series of studies, we demonstrate NITESGON’s capability to boost the retention of memories when applied shortly before, during, or shortly after the time of learning by enhancing memory consolidation via activation and communication in and between the locus coeruleus pathway and hippocampus by plausibly modulating dopaminergic input. These findings may have a significant impact for neurocognitive disorders that inhibit memory consolidation such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>behavioral tagging</kwd><kwd>locus coeruleus</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>interference</kwd><kwd>brain stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alzheimer Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AARG-21-848486</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vanneste</surname><given-names>Sven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Non-invasive transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve using direct current promotes strengthening of memories using late-phase synaptic activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Research on enhancing and preserving human memory has substantially increased in the last few decades due largely to the prevalence and inexorable condition of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Early behavioral indicators of AD include a decline in an individual’s ability to retain learned information and remember events, situations, and objects, alluding to synaptic connections losing strength as AD emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reza-Zaldivar et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, recent investigations have begun assessing the perspective clinical significance of therapeutic non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to modify neuroplasticity and upregulate neuronal excitability in different neurological conditions, including memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lefaucheur et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There is an ongoing debate about whether non-invasive electrical stimulation of the scalp modulates the excitability of neurons directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vöröslakos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, a series of experiments in rats and humans isolated the transcranial and transcutaneous mechanisms of non-invasive electrical stimulation and showed that the reported effects are mainly caused by transcutaneous stimulation of peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vöröslakos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asamoah et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, it was demonstrated that nerve stimulation paired with an auditory or motor task could induce targeted plasticity in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engineer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Porter et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, our recent work suggests that non-invasive transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (NITESGON) using direct current utilizes a pathway that arises from the C2 spinal nerve to establish communication gateways from the periphery to the brain via afferent fibers that project to the brainstem and synapse onto the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS); various rodent studies have used anterograde neuronal tracers to demonstrate these connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adair et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caous et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Sousa Buck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Menétrey and Basbaum, 1987</xref>). From the NTS, the information is then integrated among networks within the complex reticular formation and relayed across the brainstem through major cortical and subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawai, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, our work demonstrated that NITESGON during learning induces improvements in memory recall in younger (18–25 years) and older (&gt;55 years) adults up to 28 days after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luckey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vanneste et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, NITESGON yielded a long-term memory effect but did not trigger an immediate effect on learning, suggesting that the effect is generated during the consolidation of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vanneste et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luckey et al., 2020</xref>) as opposed to during the learning or encoding of new memories.</p><p>Most episodic-like memories that are formed are forgotten, while others are retained for longer periods of time and are subject to memory stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Squire, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Squire et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tonegawa et al., 2018</xref>). This is referred to as synaptic consolidation, a process that stabilizes new information into memory over a timespan of minutes to hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Squire et al., 2015</xref>). To illustrate the neurobiological account of synaptic consolidation, Frey and Morris introduced a plasticity model known as the synaptic tag-and-capture hypothesis that has proposed a cellular mechanism explaining how new memories that are initially weak and unstable are tagged to be captured by late-phase long-term potentiation (LTP) to become stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morris and Frey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frey and Morris, 1997</xref>). This synaptic tag-and-capture mechanism has since been translated into a learning and memory paradigm referred to as behavioral tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moncada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Viola et al., 2014</xref>). Behavioral tagging proposes weak training that typically generates short-term memory can utilize the tag-and-capture process to consolidate into a stabilized long-term memory when a weak event is preceded or followed by a strong or novel event within a limited time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moncada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Viola et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunsmoor et al., 2022</xref>). The neural mechanism that controls this novelty response is the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline (LC–NA) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vankov et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>). Animal research further indicates that direct electrical stimulation of the LC modulates hippocampal synaptic consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lemon and Manahan-Vaughan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGaugh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahill and McGaugh, 1998</xref>). We hypothesize that NITESGON modulates projections to the hippocampus via the LC–NA system and induces memory stabilization by modulating synaptic consolidation in the hippocampus via the mechanism of behavioral tagging.</p><p>The present study tests the above hypothesis questioning if NITESGON induces a long-term memory effect by strengthening memories via behavioral tagging across eight experiments. The first set of experiments aims to confirm the behavioral tagging hypothesis as the potential mechanism inducing memory consolidation via NITESGON, whereby the second set of experiments examines the underlying brain network involved in synaptic consolidation and investigates the underlying neural mechanism that is associated with behavioral tagging induced by NITESGON.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1. NITESGON during or immediately after training</title><p>The idea behind behavioral tagging suggests that weak memories that are regularly unstable and likely to be forgotten will solidify following a novel experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moncada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Viola et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunsmoor et al., 2022</xref>). That is, consolidation is facilitated by applying a strong stimulus alongside a weak stimulus within a critical time window. Recent research revealed a direct link between the LC and behavioral tagging, attributable to the pivotal role the LC plays during the presentation of a salient or arousing event (i.e., strong stimulus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sara, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Poe et al., 2020</xref>), as well as being at the helm of regulating the synthesis of new proteins required for memory consolidation in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moncada, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, studies have shown modulation of memory consolidation with increases in stress and arousal that are mediated via the LC pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGaugh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahill and McGaugh, 1998</xref>). Moreover, animal research has indicated that direct electrical stimulation of the LC modulates hippocampal synaptic transmission fundamental for memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lemon and Manahan-Vaughan, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Seeing that NITESGON activates the LC pathway, which plays an important role in memory consolidation, we hypothesize that participants will be able to establish long-term memories upon modulating the LC both during learning, as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luckey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vanneste et al., 2020</xref>), as well as immediately after learning. This will directly test if NITESGON plays a more central role during encoding or the consolidation phase of memory. To test this hypothesis, participants learned a word-association task and were tested 7 days later on how many word associations they were able to recall correctly. Active or sham NITESGON was applied via electrodes placed over the left and right C2 nerve dermatome at a constant current of 1.5 mA either during or immediately after learning the word-association task on visit 1.</p><p>To further explore the effect of NITESGON, resting-state EEG (rsEEG) and salivary α-amylase (sAA) were collected immediately before and after NITESGON on visit 1. Previous research has revealed an increase in sAA, a putative marker of endogenous NA activity, immediately following NITESGON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luckey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vanneste et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, previous investigations have demonstrated that LC discharge enhances the synchronization of gamma activity in the hippocampus in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hajós et al., 2003</xref>) and have identified gamma oscillations’ critical role in long-term memory formation and the potential to predict subsequent recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Osipova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sederberg et al., 2003</xref>). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that NITESGON would induce an increase in sAA and gamma activity in the medial temporal lobe that will correlate with successful recall during the second visit 7 days after learning the task.</p><p>On visit 1, no difference was observed regarding the number of word associations learned between the three condition groups (i.e., sham NITESGON during learning and after learning, active NITESGON during learning and sham NITESGON after learning, or sham NITESGON during learning and active NITESGON after learning) (<italic>F</italic> = 0.24, p = 0.79; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), thus indicating that NITESGON had no effect on learning the word-association task. Results revealed a significant difference in memory recall 7 days after NITESGON was applied either during learning (46.09 ± 15.06%, p = 0.012) or after learning the task (47.65 ± 13.27%, p = 0.005) relative to the sham condition employed during both learning and immediately after learning the task (33.38 ± 12.57%) (<italic>F</italic> = 5.24, p = 0.009; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). However, no difference was attained on recall 7 days later between the conditions of NITESGON applied during learning the task or immediately after learning the task (p = 0.75). A significant increase in sAA (<italic>F</italic> = 7.69, p = 0.010; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) was revealed during learning (before: 88.79 ± 50.48 vs. after: 149.82.6 ± 82.67; p &lt; 0.001) and after learning in comparison to the sham group (before: 100.28 ± 41.95 vs. after: 114.30 ± 41.02; p = 0.14).

NITESGON during second task – retroactive strengthening of memories</title><p>Experiment 1 suggests that NITESGON generates an effect during the consolidation phase as opposed to the learning-encoding phase due to no effect of NITESGON being exhibited during learning between the different groups, but both stimulating during and after learning the task induced a long-term memory effect. Bearing in mind the definition of behavioral tagging that indicates that the pairing of a strong stimulus and a weak stimulus within a critical time window can induce memory stabilization of the weak stimulus, NITESGON can be seen as the mechanism that induces a similar action as a strong stimulus, and through the mechanism of behavioral tagging strengthen the weak stimulus (i.e., the word-association task).</p><p>Prior research on behavioral tagging has shown that items paired with an electric shock (i.e., Pavlovian fear conditioning task) had a retroactive memory effect on items learned before the fear conditioning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunsmoor et al., 2015</xref>). This provided evidence for a generalized retroactive memory enhancement, whereby information can be retroactively credited as relevant, and therefore remembered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunsmoor et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, LC activation occurs in close relation to the intensity of the Pavlovian behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouret and Richmond, 2009</xref>). Hence, to explore the effect of the LC on behavioral tagging, we verified if NITESGON applied during a second task would result in a significant retroactive memory effect on the first task as predicted by behavioral tagging.</p><p>To test the hypothesis, Experiment 2 had participants take part in a word-association task followed by a spatial-navigation object-location task while receiving active or sham NITESGON during the second task. These two types of tasks were selected because they would not interfere with one another, seeing that both require different episodic information. rsEEG data and sAA were collected immediately before and after the two tasks on visit 1. Two memory tests were taken 7 days after learning the word-association and spatial-navigation tasks.</p><p>On visit 1, no difference in learning (<italic>F</italic> = 0.32, p = 0.73; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) was observed for both the first (<italic>F</italic> = 0.09, p = 0.98) and second (<italic>F</italic> = 0.64, p = 0.43) tasks between the active and sham NITESGON groups. On visit 2, 7 days after initial learning, a significant effect was obtained for recall (<italic>F</italic> = 0.6.82, p = 0.007; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) for both the first (<italic>F</italic> = 6.28, p = 0.022) and second tasks (<italic>F</italic> = 7.51, p = 0.013), revealing an increase in word recall (46.26 ± 3.76% vs. 37.88 ± 9.88%), as well as object-location recall (51.82 ± 7.75% vs. 44.39 ± 3.68%) for the active group in comparison to the sham group. Furthermore, a significant increase in sAA (<italic>F</italic> = 7.44, p = 0.014; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) was revealed in the active group (before: 74.01 ± 26.58 vs. after: 107.01 ± 25.98; p &lt; 0.001) in comparison to the sham group (before: 60.61 ± 37.93 vs. after: 69.61 ± 35.07; p = 0.18). This increase in sAA correlated with how many items they recalled 7 days after the learning phase for both the word-association task (<italic>r</italic> = 0.52, p = 0.019; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>; <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.62, p = 0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the object-location task (<italic>r</italic> = 0.57, p = 0.008; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>; <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.49, p = 0.03 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Looking at each group separately, we found no significant correlation for the active groups (first task: <italic>r</italic> = 0.43, p = 0.21; second task: <italic>r</italic> = 0.42, p = 0.22) between memory recall 7 days later and sAA levels on visit 1 (pre vs. post).

NITESGON increases activity in the LC and hippocampus during and immediately after stimulation and increases connectivity between these two areas, thus instigating initial memory consolidation and increasing the retention of memories that are formed within a window of opportunity spanning before and after LC activation. This is in accordance with the construct of behavioral tagging, which explains how memories that would normally be forgotten will endure in memory preceding, during, and following activation of the LC pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lemon and Manahan-Vaughan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGaugh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahill and McGaugh, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Notably, NITESGON does not generate an immediate memory effect during learning, however, a favorable behavioral effect is seen 7 days after initial learning. Although previous research has suggested that millisecond pairing between nerve stimulation and auditory or motor learning is essential to induce targeted plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engineer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conlon et al., 2020</xref>), our data revealed that this design may not be as crucial as previously thought. This is comparable to the concept of behavioral tagging which suggests that there is a critical time window before and after training to transform a weak memory into a strong memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moncada et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings revealed that NITESGON induced a proactive and retroactive memory effect. More intriguingly, when we introduced a second word-association task (e.g., Japanese–English) that was highly anticipated to interfere with another word-association task (e.g., Swahili–English), we found that NITESGON diminished the interference effect. Interestingly, within the synaptic tag-and-capture literature, memory interference has been proposed to be the result of synaptic competition, a proposed ‘fight for proteins’ that arises between tagged synapses among limited proteins that leads to one memory converting to long-term memory at the expense of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Okuda et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it could be postulated that NITESGON could enable optimal availability of plasticity-related proteins, thus decreasing synaptic competition and subsequent interreference. However, further investigations are needed to support this postulation. Moreover, this effect induced by NITESGON did not appear to be task specific given that we saw an advantageous effect for both spatial-navigation and word-association tasks. This suggests a generalized memory enhancement effect similar to prior studies of post-encoding increases in consolidation via the LC due to inducing stress and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGaugh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahill and McGaugh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kalbe and Schwabe, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Previous research demonstrated that LC discharge enhances synchronization of gamma activity in the hippocampus in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hajós et al., 2003</xref>) and that gamma oscillations play an important role in long-term memories and could potentially predict subsequent recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Osipova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sederberg et al., 2003</xref>). Our results confirm this by revealing that NITESGON induces gamma changes in the medial temporal lobe that correlate with successful recall.</p><p>The role of the LC–NA system in synaptic plasticity and molecular memory consolidation has been well established over the past decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sara, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sara, 2015</xref>). However, recent animal studies on enhancement of memory persistence have found that LC tyrosine-hydroxylase neurons, originally defined by their canonical NA signaling, mediate post-encoding enhancement of memory in a manner consistent with possible corelease of DA from the LC axons in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNamara et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, electrical stimulation of the LC increases DA levels that modulate hippocampal synaptic transmission up to 30 min after encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lemon and Manahan-Vaughan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devoto and Flore, 2006</xref>). Our results corroborate these findings, indicating that utilizing a DA antagonist can reduce the effect of NITESGON and that sEBR, a proxy for DA, increases after NITESGON. In addition, we demonstrated changes in sAA immediately after NITESGON that correlate with memory recall 7 days later overall (including both active and sham groups). However, if we only looked at the active group, we need to be nuanced these findings as sAA levels immediately after NITESGON did not correlate with memory recall 7 days later for every experiment. Previous research indicated that α-amylase is a marker of endogenous NA activity, with human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showing LC activity rising concomitantly with sAA levels during the viewing of emotionally arousing slides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Stegeren et al., 2007</xref>). However, original research on amylase secretion indicates that α-amylase is mediated by both DA in addition to NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sundström et al., 1985</xref>).</p><p>A prevailing hypothesis is that hippocampus-dependent memory is mediated by a subiculum–accumbens–pallidum–VTA pathway via DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rossato et al., 2009</xref>). Our results indicated that the VTA was activated during NITESGON, however, the VTA activation ceased post-stimulation. No increased connectivity was revealed between the VTA and hippocampus during or after NITESGON. This corresponds with recent research that suggests hippocampal projections in the VTA are sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNamara et al., 2014</xref>) and therefore may only have a limited role in late-phase LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNamara et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is possible that the VTA indirectly contributes to the formation of memories via other brain areas. Recent animal research has suggested that VTA DA neurons project to the amygdala and may contribute to fear memory in addition to the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giustino et al., 2020</xref>), and that the VTA may contribute to synaptic consolidation independently and complementary to the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moncada, 2017</xref>). Additionally, it is well known that the amygdala is not the final place of memory storage, but rather has major modulatory influences on the strength of a memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McGaugh, 2000</xref>). Similar to the VTA in the current study, prior research has shown that the amygdala is activated during NITESGON but ceased post-stimulation; however, NITESGON was not accompanied by a task during the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vanneste et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, a recent fMRI study spotlights the dynamic behavior of the LC during arousal-related memory processing stages whereby emotionally arousing stimuli triggered engagement from the LC and the amygdala during encoding; however, during consolidation and recollection stages, activity shifted to more hippocampal involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobs et al., 2020</xref>). Considering the impact of the VTA and amygdala can have on memory, future experimental investigations are needed to establish their role in the memory-enhancing effects of NITESGON. One note, is that we need to be careful with the results of the LC, as this area is notoriously difficult to image due to its small size (~1–2 mm across in humans) and susceptibility to MR signal artifacts from cardiac pulsation and partial volume effects from the fourth ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astafiev et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we re-analyzed our data using no smoothing to better approximate the size of the LC, showing similar results.</p><p>Although our results reflect the putative tag-and-capture mechanism, several emotional arousal and/or noradrenergic-related frameworks may explain advantages during the consolidation phase that lead to memory enhancement effects that were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sara, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McGaugh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mather and Harley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nielson et al., 2005</xref>); therefore, future research needs to be conducted to determine whether behavioral tagging explains the behavioral effects shown here. The observation supports the theory that the effect of NITESGON generated during memory consolidation were not seen immediately, but were observed 7 days later and were not affected by sleep when observed at the 12 hr mark. This is analogous to studies showing that arousal-mediated consolidation effects are time dependent but less dependent on sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Park, 2005</xref>).</p><p>When interpreting the current findings, it must be considered that some limitations exist within the research; limitations on experimental design are noted below, followed by a discussion of utilizing indirect proxy measures. The task order for Experiment 4 was randomized during the first visit for training and the recall-only memory test 7 days later; however, the word-association and spatial-navigation task used in Experiments 2 and 3 were not counterbalanced; therefore, the findings of Experiments 2 and 3 could have been impacted by a potential order effect. Additionally, in Experiment 5, the learning and test phases for the two groups were conducted at different times of day (i.e., sleep group: training at 8 p.m. and testing at 8 a.m., sleep deprivation group: training at 8 a.m. and testing at 8 p.m.), thus introducing the potential for circadian effects between the two groups. Furthermore, the recall-only memory testing occurred at the 12 hr point rather than 7 days later, allowing us to conclude that the observed effect seen 12 hr later was not affected by sleep; however, it remains unclear whether the 7-day long-term memory effects of NITESGON are sleep dependent. Moreover, it must also be acknowledged that Experiments 5 and 8 did not include a control-sham stimulation group, thus limiting the interpretation of these two experimental findings. Control-sham stimulation groups would increase our confidence in our findings that NITESGON’s memory-enhancing effects depend not on sleep but on DA receptor activity.</p><p>Although the use of indirect proxy measures, such as sAA for NA activity and sEBR for DA activity, enabled the tracking of LC–NA activity changes from baseline measurements and demonstrated the potential of an LC–DA relationship, caution must be advised when interpreting results considering these proxy measures are affiliated with limitations, such as being substantially variable, as well as the potential of other brain regions and monoamine neurotransmitters being associated with changes seen in sAA concentration levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones et al., 2020</xref>), an enzyme that is provoked by both central parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activation, including acute stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nater and Rohleder, 2009</xref>). Additionally, although sEBR has been increasingly linked to DA, it has been defined as a more viable measure of striatal DA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jongkees and Colzato, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ortega et al., 2022</xref>). At the same time, our research suggests that sEBR and DA are related as well as with the peak-to-peak amplitude for deviant and pupil size suggesting a possible common underlying mechanism. Yet, these results can only be obtained at a group level including both the active and the sham group. Lastly, it must be recognized that the effects of NITESGON obtained could be explained by activating other neuromodulatory mechanisms. Previous animal research indicates that peripheral nerve stimulation, such as vagus nerve stimulation, also activates the dopaminergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brougher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Perez et al., 2014</xref>), serotonergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hulsey et al., 2019</xref>), and cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulsey et al., 2016</xref>) pathways, all of which play an essential role in inducing long-term plasticity changes related to memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avery and Krichmar, 2017</xref>). Further studies regarding the role of additional neuromodulators would be worthwhile.</p><p>In conclusion, our work provides evidence that NITESGON is involved in the consolidation of information rather than encoding. Our findings support an implication previously put forward in the formulation of the synaptic tag-and-capture mechanism proposing late-phase LTP of synaptic activity could explain enhanced memories. As deficits in episodic memory specifically related to memory consolidation are one of the earliest detectable cognitive abnormalities in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Weston et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wearn et al., 2020</xref>), NITESGON might have the potential of improving memory recall by hampering the disruption of memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All experiments were designed as a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel-group study where the researcher and the participant were blinded to the stimulation conditions. Experiment 6 was alone a single-blinded study where the participant was blinded to the stimulation condition, but not the researcher. All experiments were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Experiments 1–7 were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas at Dallas (#15-06; #17-08; #17-34; #17-84; #17-96; #18-144). All participants signed a written informed consent and consent to publish was obtained.</p><p>In all experiments, direct current was transmitted via a saline-soaked (1.3% saline) pair of synthetic sponges (5 × 7 cm) and was delivered by a specially developed, battery-driven, constant current stimulator with a maximum output of 10 mA (Eldith; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuroconn.de">http://www.neuroconn.de</ext-link>). For each participant receiving NITESGON, the anodal electrode was placed over the left C2 nerve dermatome and the cathodal electrode was placed over the right C2 dermatome. To maintain consistency across all participants, research assistants were trained to map out the placement according to the length of the participant’s head.</p><p>To minimize skin sensations and to acclimate participants to the stimulation types, the current intensity was ramped-up (gradually increasing) until it reached its programmed maximum output (1.5 mA). After stimulating for the desired duration per group (active or sham), the current was ramped-down (gradually decreased) denoting the end of the stimulation. The impedance under each electrode was maintained under 10 kΩ. The ramp-up, ramp-down, and stimulation times were different depending on condition (active vs. sham) and experimental needs.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experiment 1. NITESGON during or immediately after training</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 48 healthy, right-handed, native-English speaking adults (24 males, 24 females; mean age was 20.02 years, standard deviation [Sd] = 1.75 years) with a similar educational background (i.e., enrolled as undergraduate students at UT Dallas) with normal to corrected vision, who all had the maximum score on the Mini Mental State Examination. Participants were screened (e.g., tES contraindications, neurological impairments, not participated in a tES study) prior to enrolling into the study. None of the participants had a history of major psychiatric or neurological disorders, or any tES contraindications, including previous history of brain injuries or epileptic insults, cardiovascular abnormalities, implanted devices, taking neuropsychiatric medications, prescribed stimulants use, or chronic use of illicit drugs (i.e., marijuana and cocaine).</p><p>Participants were excluded from the study if screening discovered they were familiar with Swahili/Arabic language or Swahili culture due to the nature of the stimuli. Furthermore, participants received instructions advising them to abstain from the following products for the associated time window prior to their study session: dental work for 48 hr, alcohol for 24 hr, caffeine and nicotine for 16 hr, and hair styling products the day of. Participants provided written, informed consent on the day of the study session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Word-association task</title><p>Associative memory performance was measured using a computerized Swahili–English verbal paired-associative learning task. This task was adapted from a well-established study design published in Science by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karpicke and Roediger, 2008</xref>. Using an SDT<sub>N</sub> paradigm (S: study phase, D: distraction phase, T<sub>N</sub>: test phase with non-recalled word pairs), participants were instructed to read and remember 75-sequentially presented Swahili–English (e.g., Swahili: bustani, English: garden) word pairs made up of common day-to-day words. The Swahili–English word pairs were taken from the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nelson and Dunlosky, 1994</xref>. Participants had the opportunity to learn the list of 75-word pairs repetitively across a total of four alternating study and test periods each. During the study period, the word pairs were presented together on a computer screen for 5 s with the Swahili word on top and the English translation at the bottom (5 × 75 = 375 s). The study period was followed by a cued-recall test period: Swahili cue words were presented for 8 s each during which participants had to type-in the correct English translation remembered from the study period. Correctly recalled word pairs were dropped from further testing but remained to be studied in each subsequent learning period (i.e., 4 blocks of studying 75-word pairs). The order of the words being studied or tested was randomized. Previous research has demonstrated the critical role of retrieval practice in learning of a new foreign language; therefore, the paradigm ensures that all participants were well exposed to the stimuli and avoided a ceiling effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karpicke and Roediger, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>NITESGON</title><p>There were three groups – active NITESGON during learning (i.e., study phases of the word-association task) and sham NITESGON immediately after the word-association task; sham NITESGON during learning and active NITESGON immediately the word-association task in the memory consolidation period and sham NITESGON both during and after learning of the word-association task – with 16 participants each. Active NITESGON consisted of ramp-up time of 30 s followed by a constant current of 1.5 mA (current density 0.4285 A/m<sup>2</sup>) during each of the 4 study blocks, resulting in a total stimulation time of 25 min (i.e., 375 s × 4 blocks) and ramp-down time of 30 s. For the sham NITESGON group, the current intensity was ramped-up to 1.5 mA over 30 s and immediately ramped-down over 30 s. Hence, sham NITESGON only lasted 60 s per study period, resulting in a total time of 240 s (60 s × 4 blocks) of stimulation when delivered during the study phase. For the group that received active NITESGON after the word-association task, this consisted of 30 s ramp-up and ramp-down time with 25 min of constant current stimulation at 1.5 mA. The sham NITESGON delivered after the word-association task only consisted of 30 s of ramp-up and ramp-down time resulting in 60 s of stimulation. The rationale behind the sham procedure was to mimic the transient skin sensation at the beginning of active NITESGON without producing any conditioning effects on the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Resting-state EEG</title><p>Continuous EEG data were collected from each participant pre- and post-NITESGON procedures. The data were collected using a 64-channel Neuroscan Synamps2 Quick Cap configured per the International 10–20 placement system with the midline reference located at the vertex and the ground electrode located at AFZ using the Neuroscan Scan 4.5 software (Neuroscan, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compumedicsneuroscan.com">http://compumedicsneuroscan.com</ext-link>). The impedance on each electrode was maintained at less than 5 kΩ. The data were sampled using the Neuroscan Synamps<sup>2</sup> amplifier at 500 Hz with online band-pass filtering at 0.1–100 Hz.</p><p>Eyes-closed recordings (sampling rate = 1 kHz, band passed DC–200 Hz) were obtained in a dark room which was dimly lit with a small lamp with each participant sitting upright in a comfortable chair; data collection lasted approximately 5 min. Participants were instructed not to drink alcohol 24 hr prior to EEG recording or caffeinated beverages 1 hr before recording to avoid alcohol- or caffeine-induced changes in the EEG stream. The alertness of participants was checked by monitoring both slowing of the alpha rhythm and appearance of spindles in the EEG stream to prevent possible enhancement of the theta power due to drowsiness during recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moazami-Goudarzi et al., 2010</xref>). No participants included in the current study showed such EEG changes during measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Saliva collection</title><p>Saliva was collected twice during each experiment: once immediately prior to NITESGON stimulation and once immediately after NITESGON stimulation. When the participants were ready to collect saliva, they were requested to gently tip their head backwards and collect saliva on the floor of their mouth and when ready, passively drool into the collection aid mouthpiece provided by Salimetrics laboratory (Salimetrics, LLC, USA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://salimetrics.com">https://salimetrics.com</ext-link>). The participants were requested to collect 2 ml of saliva in one straight flow and avoid breaks between drool as much as possible. The length of time to collect 2 ml of saliva was noted and the timer was started only when participants began to passively drool into the tube. All saliva samples were stored in 2 ml cryovials, and immediately stored in an −80°C laboratory freezer. Prior to saliva collections, all participants were instructed to avoid food, sugary drinks, excess caffeine, nicotine, and acidic drinks for at least 1 hr before collecting the saliva samples. Participants were also instructed to avoid alcohol and vigorous exercise 24 hr prior to and avoid dental work 48 hr prior to their appointment. In addition, participants were instructed not to brush their teeth within 45 min of sample collection in order to avoid any risk of lowering pH levels and influencing bacterial growth. If the study was scheduled for the afternoon, participants were requested to avoid taking naps during the day. Upon completion of the collection procedures, all saliva samples were packed in dry ice and sent to the Salimetrics laboratory for analysis. We chose to use sAA as a biomarker for norepinephrine as it provided a non-invasive yet valid indicator of central sympathetic nervous system activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nater and Rohleder, 2009</xref>). sAA levels have been shown to co-vary significantly with circulating NA levels, with human fMRI showing LC activity rising simultaneously with sAA levels during viewing of emotionally arousing slides; these increases were then significantly reduced by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Stegeren et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-6"><title>Procedure</title><p>Eligible participants were scheduled for two visits to complete the study. Visit 1 consisted of the word-association task and administration of NITESGON. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups during the study period. The researcher who controlled the NITESGON device was not involved in instructing the participant; this was performed by a second researcher who was blind to the stimulation protocol. rsEEG and saliva were collected twice for all participants, once immediately before and once immediately after NITESGON application. Participants were asked to refrain from studying or searching for the learned word pairs throughout the week. Participants returned 7 days after their first visit for memory testing to measure possible (long-term) effects on associative memory performance, but did not receive NITESGON, nor were they able to review word pairs.

The EEG data were then plotted for a careful inspection for artifacts. All episodic artifacts suggestive of eye blinks, eye movements, jaw tension, teeth clenching, or body movements were manually removed from the EEG stream. In addition, an independent component analysis was conducted to further verify whether all artifacts were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-8"><title>EEG source localization</title><p>Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was used to estimate the intracerebral electrical sources that generated the scalp-recorded activity in each of the gamma frequency bands (30.5–44 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pascual-Marqui, 2002</xref>). sLORETA computes neuronal activity as current density (A/m<sup>2</sup>) without assuming a predefined number of active sources.

Objects were presented within a white-box background (4.88 × 4.88 cm) and had a red dot superimposed at the object center to mark the precise location. Participants were instructed to study and remember the object-locations as accurately and precisely as possible. After each study phase, a cued-recall test was administered. During the test period, the studied objects were presented one at a time in the center of the screen (in a randomized order), and participants were required to recall the studied locations.

Visit 1 consisted of two word-association tasks, whereby task 1was paired with either active or sham NITESGON followed by a second word-association task (i.e., task 2) paired with sham NITESGON. The order of the two word-association tasks was randomized over the participants in a 1:1 ratio to remove a possible order effect. The researcher who controlled the NITESGON device was not involved in instructing the participant; this was performed by a second researcher who was blind to the stimulation protocol. rsEEG and saliva were collected twice for all participants, once immediately before and once immediately after NITESGON application. Participants were asked to refrain from studying or searching for the learned word pairs throughout the week. Participants returned 7 days after their first visit for memory testing on both tasks 1 and 2 to measure possible (long-term) effects on associative memory performance, but did not receive NITEGSON, nor were they able to review word pairs. A third researcher who was not responsible for the task or NITESGON conducted the second visit. As during the first visit, the two word-association tasks were randomized over the participants in a 1:1 ratio to remove a possible order effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>EEG preprocessing and source localization</title><p>The continuous EEG data were preprocessed and the source-level gamma activity pre- and post-NITESGON procedures for the two groups was determined as detailed in Experiment 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Statistics task</title><p>For visit 1 learning, a repeated measures ANOVA was applied with the cumulative learning rate over the different study periods for both tasks as within-subjects variable and group (active vs. sham) as between-subjects variable.

In addition, an interference effect was determined by calculating how many words recalled during memory task 2 had an overlap from memory task 1. The higher percentage the more overlap in remembering the English translation for both exact word in tasks 1 and 2, the lesser the interference effect. A one-way ANOVA was applied with the interference effect as dependent variable and group (active vs. sham) as between-subjects variable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-9"><title>Statistics saliva</title><p>Using the saliva collected via the passive drool method, sAA levels were measured which were compared between the groups as detailed in Experiment 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-10"><title>Statistics EEG – whole brain analysis</title><p>A whole brain analysis was used to compare gamma activity before and after NITESGON.

The total stimulation time was 25 min (i.e., 375 s × 4 blocks). Before the start of the first study period, an additional 15-s habituation period was added to make sure the participants got used to the sensation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Procedure</title><p>Eligible participants were scheduled for two visits to complete the study. Visit 1 consisted of the word-association task paired with active NITESGON. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two groups (sleep vs. no sleep).</p><p>As Experiment 4 reveals that NITESGON is involved in synaptic consolidation that occurs over a timespan of minutes to hours after encoding the information, where sleep that has been association with systems consolidation does not play a central role. To cross validate these findings, we opted for the parallel design not including a control condition, as the aim of this study is to see if sleep mediates the memory effect induced by NITESGON, rather than the effect of NITESGON or the interaction between sleep and NITESGON on memory.</p><p>Ten participants learned the word-association task at 8:00 a.m. and were tested the same day at 8:00 p.m., while the other 10 participants learned the word-association task at 8:00 p.m. and were tested the next day at 8:00 a.m. after a night of sleep. Participants were asked to refrain from studying or searching for the learned word pairs for at least the next 12 hr. The researcher who controlled the NITESGON device was not involved in instructing the participant; this was performed by a second researcher who was blind to the stimulation protocol. A third researcher who was not responsible for the task or NITESGON conducted the second visit (12 hr later).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Statistics task</title><p>A one-way ANOVA with group (sleep vs. no sleep) as between-subjects variable and number of words correctly recalled as dependent variable was performed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Experiment 6.

Participants were screened and enrolled similar to Experiment 1. Experiment 6 added the exclusion of those participants who had any contraindication for MRI (i.e., metallic implants, pregnancy, claustrophobia).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Resting-state fMRI</title><p>The resting-state fMRI data were collected on a 3T MR scanner (Achieva, Philips, Netherlands) using a 32-channel SENSE phased-array head coil. The dimensions of the coil was 38 (height) × 46 (width) × 59 (length) cm<sup>3</sup>. During scanning, foam padding and earplugs were used to minimize the head movement and scanner noise. An MR-compatible, battery powered NITESGON system manufactured by MR NeuroConn Co (Germany) was applied to each participant inside the MR scanner. All the operating parts and devices that go into the scanner room were MR compatible and everything else was in the control room, connected via the waveguide. The NITESGON system was fully charged before each session and its impedance level was measured regularly to test if it was maintained at approximately 5 kΩ on each end (i.e., 10 kΩ total).</p><p>The MR session with NITESGON was divided into three consecutive blocks of scanning: before stimulation, during stimulation, and after stimulation. At the beginning of the pre-stimulation session, routine survey and T1 anatomical images were acquired for a total time of 5 min. Before acquiring the T1 image, saline-soaked NITESGON electrodes were positioned on the subject for three consecutive blocks of rsfMRI. For each of the scanning blocks, we acquired 20-min long rsfMRI images.</p><p>For the T1 (MPRAGE) anatomical scan, parameters included a repetition time (TR) of 2300 ms, an echo time (TE) of 2.94 ms, an inversion time (TI) of 900 ms, and a flip angle of 9°. One hundred and sixty sagittal slices were taken, using a matrix size of 256 × 256 mm<sup>2</sup>, at a 1 × 1 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup> resolution.</p><p>Resting-state fMRI sequences were acquired with the following imaging parameters (echo-planar imaging protocol): TR/TE = 3000/30 ms, field-of-view  = 220 × 220 mm<sup>2</sup>, matrix  = 64 × 64, number of slices  = 53 with voxel size = 3 × 3 × 4 mm<sup>3</sup> with no gap between slices. The total number of acquired volumes was 400, counting for 20 min.</p><p>MR images were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12b, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, UK). Images from the first five TRs in the beginning of each session were discarded. We normalized high-resolution structural images to a standard MNI template, and segmented for three structural components, which were gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. Functional images were realigned to the middle volume to correct for motion artifacts. Slice-timing correction was adjusted for temporal discrepancies between <italic>z</italic>-direction slices acquired in an interleaved manner. After co-registration of functional volumes to the structural image (T1), volumes that contain extreme movements were linearly regressed out as covariates using Artifact Detection Tool (Gabrieli Lab, MIT, US, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/">http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/</ext-link>). Functional images were normalized to the standard template using nonlinear transformation parameters acquired by the process of normalizing structural image to the standard template. The normalized functional images were smoothed using 6 mm Gaussian kernel.</p><p>After preprocessing, the images were processed to account for motion-related and physiological noises using an independent component analysis. Confounding factors of signals from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid were linearly regressed out from the global average brain signal using CompCor. Global signal regression was performed using the grand averaged signal from the gray matter volume. When removing confounding effect, the signal was simultaneously filtered from 0.01 to 0.17 Hz, where the maximum detectable frequency of the signal is 0.167 Hz (TR = 3 s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>NITESGON</title><p>Shielded cables connected the MR-compatible box and electrodes, and the stimulation data were transferred via the CAT.6 LAN cable that runs throughout the MR scanner room to the non-MR-compatible stimulation devices in the control room. For the active NITESGON group, the current was ramped-up for 30 s followed by a constant current of 1.5 mA for 20 min and a 10-s ramp-down period. For sham NITESGON, the current was ramped-up over 30 s to reach the intensity of 1.5 mA followed by 15-s of constant current stimulation at 1.5 mA and 10 s ramp-down. Hence, sham NITESGON only lasted 15 s (as opposed to 20 min in the active group).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants were scanned immediately before, during, and immediately after the NITESGON stimulation. The researcher who controlled the NITESGON device was not blinded to the stimulation group, but the participant was blinded to which stimulation group they were placed in. Sixteen participants received active NITESGON and 16 received sham NITESGON.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Statistics rsfMRI</title><p>A functional connectivity analysis was performed using the CONN toolbox. The ROI considered in the analysis were the right hippocampus (based on previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vanneste et al., 2020</xref>]), LC, and VTA. Both the LC and VTA were selected using probabilistic atlas (as conducted in a study across 44 adults by localizing its peak signal level in high-resolution T1 turbo spin-echo images and verified the location using post-mortem brains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tona et al., 2017</xref>). The probabilistic templates were created using processing steps specifically designed to address these difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tona et al., 2017</xref>). To remove potential artifacts such as head motion, respiration, and other global imaging artifacts including potential stimulation effects, we regressed out the global average brain signal.</p><p>We conducted an rALFF analysis for the LC, VTA, and hippocampus. The time series for each voxel of each ROI was transformed to the frequency domain and the power spectrum was then obtained. Since the power of a given frequency is proportional to the square of the amplitude of this frequency component, the square root was calculated at each frequency of the power spectrum and the averaged square root was obtained across 0.01–0.17 Hz at each voxel. This averaged square root was taken as the rALFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu-Feng et al., 2007</xref>). The rALFF of each voxel was divided by the individual global mean of the rALFF within a brain-mask, which was obtained by removing the tissues outside the brain using software MRIcron. Spatial smoothing was conducted on the maps with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 8 mm of full width at half-maximum. A repeated measures ANOVA was used including group (active vs. sham) as between-subjects variable and rALFF before, during and after NITESGON as within-subjects variable for the different ROIs (ALFF for the VTA, LC, and hippocampus). A simple contrast analysis was included to compare the difference between active and sham stimulation for each ROI before, during, and after stimulation separately including a correction for multiple comparison (Bonferroni correction).</p><p>In addition, the average BOLD time series across all voxels within the ROIs were extracted from the smoothed functional images. A partial correlation analysis was performed, and the resulting <italic>r</italic>-value converted to Fisher’s <italic>Z</italic>-transformed coefficients were used for further statistical analyses. The <italic>Z</italic>-transformed connectivity weights were compared between the active and sham groups for the LC and hippocampus, LC and VTA, and VTA and hippocampus, respectively, using a repeated measures ANOVA. A simple contrast analysis was applied to compare the different in active and sham condition using a Bonferroni correction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experiment 7.

Twelve participants received active NITESGON and 12 participants received sham NITESGON.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Continuous EEG data were collected from each participant in response to the auditory oddball paradigm, before and after the application of NITESGON. The auditory oddball task is a simple and well-established paradigm for the investigation of the robust P3b component which has a predictable standard tone and an unpredictable deviant tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>). The data were collected using a 64-channel Neuroscan Synamps<sup>2</sup> Quick Cap configured per the International 10–20 placement system with the midline reference located at the vertex and the ground electrode located at AFZ using the Neuroscan Scan 4.5 software. The impedance on each electrode was maintained at less than 5 kΩ. The data were sampled using the Neuroscan Synamps<sup>2</sup> amplifier at 500 Hz with online band-pass filtering at 0.1–100 Hz. Data were preprocessed using Matlab and EEGLAB in a manner similar to the original paper that showed a relationship between ERP and LC–noradrenergic arousal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Peak-to-peak P3b amplitude</title><p>Peak-to-peak amplitude was defined as the amplitude difference between the N200 peak and the P300 peak for the P3 electrode. The N200 component was identified as the most negative peak between 200 and 375 ms after the stimulus onset. The P300 component was identified as the most positive peak between 250 and 600 ms after the stimulus onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>Spontaneous eyeblink rate</title><p>To retain the eyeblinks, the eyeblink rate was calculated using the data before cleaning the artifacts using an independent component analysis. Furthermore, the continuous dataset before epoching was used to visualize the entire temporal profile of the eyeblink potential to avoid any cutting-off of the potential due to epoching. An eyeblink was determined to be a sharp negative peak followed immediately by a positive peak located in the frontal electrodes such as FP1, FP2, and FPz. In some cases, the negative peak was not prominent, but the positive peak was a signatory. The topography of this potential was observed to have a clear dipole covering the frontal and frontotemporal electrodes. This potential was marked manually by a researcher, who scanned the entire EEG recording manually for all the participants in the active and sham groups, in the pre- and post-stimulation conditions. The number of eyeblinks in the length of recording was obtained and the eyeblink rate was calculated as the number of eyeblinks/minute. The same procedure was performed by a second researcher who was blinded to the conditions and the inter-rater validity was calculated. The average score was calculated from both independent researchers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-6"><title>Saliva collection</title><p>Saliva was collected twice during each experiment: once immediately prior to NITESGON stimulation and once immediately after NITESGON stimulation as detailed in Experiment 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-7"><title>Pupil dilation</title><p>The response of the pupil to three types of light stimulation (blue, 470 nm; white 8000k color temperature; and red, 624 nm) was recorded in real time using a binocular Basler Dart Near Infrared (NIR) cameras. The lenses have a fixed focal length of 8 mm with an M12x0.5 body. The images were recorded at a frame rate of 120 Hz. There is a constant NIR illumination of the eye (850 nm) and the cameras are equipped with a ‘daylight cut filter’ which passes NIR and blocks any wavelengths below ~800 nm. Surface-mounted LEDs were used for light stimulation and the cameras were all mounted on a single eyepiece, which communicated with a Windows laptop through a USB 3.0 cable. Each color was shown for 200 ms first in the left eye and then in the right eye with an ISI of 8 s. This left–right trial was repeated three times for each color. The average total duration of the procedure was 2 min per participant. The participant was requested to focus on a point inside the eyepiece and open their eyes as wide as possible. They were asked to avoid rapid and frequent blinking of eyes, movement of eyes, and specifically to avoid blinking during stimulus presentation. The videos were then post-processed to obtain the dilation of the pupil. The pupil was extracted as an ellipse from each frame with a segmentation algorithm and the diameter was calculated from the average of the major and minor axes of the resulting pupil ellipse. The difference between the maximum dilation and maximum constriction of both pupils in response to each color for every trial was calculated for each person immediately before and after NITESGON. The pupil size was measured as a direct response to the NITESGON and did not include a specific task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-8"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants performed the auditory oddball task twice, once immediately before and once immediately after the NITESGON session. In addition, saliva and pupil dilation were also collected immediately before and immediately after the NITESGON session. The reason why we collected auditory oddball task and pupil size before and after NITESGON is to avoid a direct effect of the learning taks or inference of the current sent to the scalp. Participants were randomly assigned to the active or sham NITESGON group. The researcher who controlled the NITESGON device was not involved in instructing the participant; this was performed by a second researcher who was blind to the stimulation protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-9"><title>Statistics peak-to-peak P3b amplitude</title><p>EEG data were compared using a repeated measures ANOVA with groups (active vs. sham) and condition (deviant vs. standard) as the between-subjects variable, and the peak-to-peak amplitude before and after stimulation as the within-subjects variable.

The authors provide compelling evidence that applying NITESGON during learning causally influences memory behavior. This method is novel and the work presented herein will be valuable to a broad range of scientists and clinicians interested in manipulations to improve memory and cognition more broadly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75586.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Davachi</surname><given-names>Lila</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hj8s172</institution-id><institution>Columbia University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Wahlstrom</surname><given-names>Krista L</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03r0ha626</institution-id><institution>The University of Utah</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.06.498966">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.06.498966v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Krista L Wahlstrom (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Thank you for an experimental tour-de-force! This manuscript has several strengths and the data definitely point to the result that this stimulation method and protocols do improve memory. That said, the mechanisms are oversold in the manuscript. Both reviewers agreed that several of the claims made in the paper were not warranted by the data. While the inclusion of several separate experiments is impressive and thorough, it also does limit the conclusions that can be made across experiments. A thorough and successful revision will roll back interpretational claims that are not justified by the approach or results. The critical ones to attend to are outlined clearly and thoughtfully in both reviews so I will not restate them in detail here. It is absolutely critical that the authors be upfront about the lack of specificity in their proxy measures of DA and NA activity (eyeblink and sAA). They are both indirect measures and deserve less emphasis than is currently there. In addition to addressing the reviewer comments in full, I want to highlight that the revision should address the lack of control/sham groups in Exp 5 and 8 to justify and explain how the lack of a control group changes their interpretation of the findings. The revision should better differentiate Exp 3 and 4, how do they differ? It was also noted that the interpretation of an interference effect needed to be further justified by making it clear what behavioral measure of interference was used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Missing background information:</p><p>It would strengthen the paper to describe the central and autonomic pathways engaged by NITESGON. Elaborating on this neuroanatomy is important because this stimulation method doesn't target the LC specifically or directly but rather upstream targets like the vagus nerve and NTS. While the data do align with the a priori prediction that it engages learning-relevant processes in the LC, the paper would be more accessible if there was a deeper discussion of NITESGON and how it affects brainstem pathways.</p><p>Considerations for correlations:</p><p>The individual differences correlations are compelling. One key strength of the paper is how consistently some of these findings replicate. But it is also important to include separate correlations for the sham and stimulation groups. A qualitative comparison suggests that, in some cases, stimulation might decorrelate the two variables of interest (e.g., Figure 3d). This makes it difficult to interpret the linearity of the effect. Qualitatively, the between-group differences appear to obscure within-group effects, which casts some doubt on whether the relationship is linear and, importantly, remains linear in the stimulation group alone. The sample sizes are also quite small, which makes the regressions sensitive to outliers. Please report whether the correlations meet assumptions of linearity and if they are violated, adopt methods that are less sensitive to outliers (e.g., nonparametric tests).</p><p>To strengthen the argument that stimulation-induced increases in sEBR and sAA relate to oddball-evoked responses (Figure XX), it would also be useful to account for within-subject effects. Please use subtraction scores to account for these differences (Figure 6).</p><p>Spatial resolution of MRI:</p><p>The LC is notoriously difficult to image due to its small size (~1-2mm across in humans) and susceptibility to MR signal artifacts from cardiac pulsation and partial volume effects from the fourth ventricle (for a discussion, see Astiev et al., 2010). The current MRI parameters are sub-optimal for imaging the LC due to their low spatial resolution of 3 x 3 x 4 mm3 as well as the very large smoothing kernel (8mm). To help make claims about the LC, it is critical to re-analyze this data using no smoothing to better approximate the size of the LC. In its current form, the data may reflect the contribution of signals from other neighboring nuclei and brainstem regions engaged by NITESGON. In addition to performing this analysis, these issues should still be raised as important caveats in the discussion.</p><p>In addition, global signal regression in resting-state fMRI has courted much controversy and may lead to spurious correlations. It would be useful to demonstrate that the results still hold without using this preprocessing step.</p><p>It's been shown that VNS can enhance widespread effects on the BOLD signal across the brain (Cao et al., 2017). The authors observe significant increases in activation across all regions of interest in this study. To verify the specificity of stimulation effects, it would be helpful to also report the effects in at least one control region, such as the primary motor cortex. Again, VNS is a different technique than NITESGON, so more broadly it would help to differentiate whether the effects of these methods on neural function would differ. This would ground the current findings in similar prior work and highlight the advantages of using this specific method of stimulation to boost memory.</p><p>Considerations about physiological measures and interpretations:</p><p>On Page 15, it is hypothesized that sEBR would correlate with pupil diameter. However, there is no mention of pupillometry data or analysis throughout the paper. This is unfortunate because pupil diameter is perhaps the best indirect proxy of LC activity (Reimer et al., 2016; Varazzani et al., 2015; Joshi et al., 2016; Murphy et al., 2014). Is this data available? That would provide more convincing evidence of a link between learning and noradrenergic signaling.</p><p>On a related note, it has been previously shown that tVNS, which also engages the vagus nerve, elicits increases in sAA but does not affect pupil diameter (Warren et al., 2019). Furthermore, sAA is not always closely coupled with other indices of norepinephrine release (Petrakova et al., 2015). Together, these findings raise the possibility that sAA isn't a direct marker of (only) LC activation. Unfortunately, a direct relationship can't be verified in this study because LC activity and sAA weren't collected in the same study/sample. Please address the caveat that sAA might not relate directly to LC activation in the discussion.</p><p>While spontaneous blink rate has been increasingly linked to dopamine, these studies typically examine the relationship between sEBR and striatal dopamine (e.g., Jongkees and Colzato, 2016). By comparison, little work has explored the link between sEBR and hippocampal memory processes, and there is no way to explicitly link them in the current dataset. Prior work on sEBR also typically link sEBR phenomena to prefrontal executive functions (or frontostriatal loops), such as working memory or updating (Ortega et al., 2022). Thus, sEBR in effects in Experiment 7 may relate to attentional effects, as the oddball paradigm suggests, but not necessarily memory encoding. There is also some evidence that the sEBR and DA levels may be unrelated (Dang et al., 2017; Sescousse et al., 2018). While I find the current findings interesting, it's a very big stretch to interpret blink rate as reflecting LC dopamine. Like sAA, blink rate could reflect other neural processes that are engaged by NITESGON but aren't driven by a common underlying mechanism. This framing/interpretation needs to be tempered significantly. It would be more appropriate to frame the goals of that section as examining possible relationships with DA, but not LC-DA specifically. It's fair to speculate they may be related, but that is very much open to interpretation and belongs in the discussion.</p><p>Figures:</p><p>1) Correctly recall should be &quot;correctly recalled&quot;.</p><p>2) The use of blue and red colors for both sham and stimulation conditions as well as before and after is very confusing. Please use different colors and keep consistent throughout.</p><p>3) In Figure 6i-m, keep the axes consistent (i.e., physiological measure switches from y to x for sAA and sEBR) for clarity.</p><p>4) Similarly, for Figures 3 and 4, keep A and B consistent (lines or bars) since they convey similar things.</p><p>5) The “δ deviant” etc. y-axes aren’t very descriptive. Please use clear variable names pertaining to that measure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In line 68 “LC-NA pathway” is abbreviated before those abbreviations are written out as text.</p><p>2) Citation needed in line 95 when the authors state &quot;as shown before…&quot;.</p><p>3) Citation needed in line 340 – &quot;However, recent research revealed that mainly LC DA…&quot;.</p><p>4) In line 388 it would be helpful for the authors to clarify what the memory test 3 to 4 days after initial learning is and if there are results for those tests. Similarly, in Experiment 8, a justification for the 3-4 day memory test instead of the 7-day test would be helpful.</p><p>5) Typo in lines 440 and 464 – &quot;NTESGON&quot;.</p><p>6) Line 753 – Would read easier from the perspective of the active stimulation group. i.e. &quot;Experiment 3 had all participants receive NITESGON during each study period of task 1…&quot;.</p><p>7) Line 754 – shouldn't the active NITESGON stimulation be during the first task for this experiment?</p><p>8) It would be helpful to include individual participant data points in the bar graphs across all experiments/figures.</p><p>9) In Figure 1D there is a green sham data point in the panel legend.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Making memories last using the peripheral effect of direct current stimulation.&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Floris de Lange (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers both commend the authors on a very responsive revision which steps back from making causal claims that are not justified and the manuscript is more transparent now about shortcomings of the design. That said, there are some outstanding concerns that should be addressed.</p><p>The first concerns the statistical reporting of correlations that Reviewer 1 had recommended initially and still requires attention. It is important for the authors to report their correlations separately by group or to include a group as a covariate in the statistical analyses. If the correlations uncouple within a group, this should be reported and discussed.</p><p>Second, there was confusion about pupil data acquisition and when and how they were acquired. I will point your attention to Reviewer 1's specific comment here.</p><p>Third, it is important that your discussion be as specific as possible about the manipulation and the effects noted. For example Reviewer 2 points out, and correctly so, that the dependent measure of # of words recalled after stimulation may or may not reflect interference effects, as is claimed. It is recommended that the authors use a specific measure of interference if allowable, or refrain from claiming their measure(s) reflect interference.</p><p>See the reviewers' specific comments below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>First, I commend the authors on the substantial work they invested in this revision. They have addressed most of my comments and this was no small effort. I especially appreciate that they have acknowledged the lack of causality and direct associations between neuromodulators and some of these indirect biomarkers. However, I do have a few outstanding concerns that I believe warrant consideration prior to publication.</p><p>1) The pupil analyses were a little puzzling. It would more sensible to measure discrete pupil dilations to the deviant vs. standard stimuli, as LC responses are most often measured to reflect &quot;cognitive activity&quot; rather than luminance. The LC will be stimulated by blue light, but it would be stronger to report oddball-evoked effects. I'm not sure if I misunderstood whether the pupil wasn't recorded during the task itself.</p><p>2) I'd still recommend reporting separate correlations by group. Many of the correlation effects appear to uncouple in the stimulation condition, which could alter some interpretations of the data. If this happens, additional discussion is warranted.</p><p>3) The addition of the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; (blue/yellow colors) in some of the keys was a useful change. However, these names could be more descriptive. It's not readily apparent what these mean when the other variable also describes timepoints (e.g., during stimulation).</p><p>4) There are quite a number of grammatical and spelling errors throughout, which I won't point out individually. The paper should be proofread again and revised before final acceptance.</p><p>5) It would be useful to foreground the &quot;competition&quot; effects of tag-and-capture in the Results section for the interference studies. This is described well in the discussion, but the same point should be repeated higher up. Otherwise, this buries the lead for the reader.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75586.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Thank you for an experimental tour-de-force!

Within this paragraph, we have emphasized that the indirect proxy measures of sAA and sEBR are associated with being substantially variable and that sAA may also reflect changes in monoamine neurotransmitters of other brain regions. Here we advise that readers take caution when interpreting the results due to these limitations and lack of specificity in the proxy measures.</p><p>Please see the newly added text from the Discussion section on page 22 below:</p><p>“Although the use of indirect proxy measures, such as sAA for NA activity and sEBR for DA activity, enabled the tracking of LC-NA activity changes from baseline measurements and demonstrated the potential of an LC-DA relationship, caution must be advised when interpreting results considering these proxy measures are affiliated with limitations, such as being substantially variable, as well as the potential of other brain regions and monoamine neurotransmitters being associated with changes seen in sAA concentration levels(82), an enzyme that is provoked by both central parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activation, including acute stress responses(83). Additionally, although sEBR has been increasingly linked to DA, it has been defined as a more viable measure of striatal DA activity (54, 84). At the same time, our research suggests that sEBR and DA are related as well as with the peak-to-peak amplitude for deviant suggesting at least a possible common underlying mechanism. Lastly, it must be recognized that the effects of NITESGON obtained could be explained by activating other neuromodulatory mechanisms. Previous animal research indicates that peripheral nerve stimulation, such as vagus nerve stimulation, also activates the dopaminergic (87, 88), serotonergic (89), and cholinergic (90) pathways, all of which play an essential role in inducing long-term plasticity changes related to memory consolidation(91). Further studies regarding the role of additional neuromodulators would be worthwhile.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to addressing the reviewer comments in full, I want to highlight that the revision should address the lack of control/sham groups in Exp 5 and 8 to justify and explain how the lack of a control group changes their interpretation of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon review of your comment, we have addressed the lack of control/sham groups in Experiment 5 and 8 in the Discussion section when acknowledging the limitations of the research.

Moreover, it must also be acknowledged that Experiments 5 and 8 did not include a control-sham stimulation group, thus limiting the interpretation of these two experimental findings. Control-sham stimulation groups would increase our confidence in our findings that NITESGON’s memory-enhancing effects depend not on sleep but on DA receptor activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The revision should better differentiate Exp 3 and 4, how do they differ?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to clarify what the differences were between Experiment 3 and Experiment 4, we added text in the paragraph introducing Experiment 4 clarifying that the object-location task used in Experiment 3 was replaced in Experiment 4 with a Japanese-English verbal associative learning task.</p><p>Please see the paragraph from the Experiment 4 subsection on page 10 below:</p><p>“Experiments 2 and 3 revealed both retroactive and proactive memory effects 7-days after initial learning of the two tasks. To further explore if NITESGON is linked to behavioral tagging and evaluate if interference impacts NITESGON as the strong stimulus, Experiment 4 removed the object-location task used in Experiments 2 and 3 and replaced it with a Japanese-English verbal associative learning task similar to the Swahili-English verbal associative task. Considering how memory formation and persistence are susceptible to interference occurring pre-and post-encoding(37-39) and are heavily influenced by commonality amongst the learned and intervening stimuli(40); it is believed that conducting two consecutive, like-minded word-association (i.e., Swahili-English and Japanese-English) tasks will result in one’s consolidation process interfering with that of the other(41). Considering how our previous experiments suggest the effect obtained by NITESGON improves the consolidation of information via behavioral tagging, it is possible that NITESGON on the first task might help reduce the overall interference effect on the second task.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It was also noted that the interpretation of an interference effect needed to be further justified by making it clear what behavioral measure of interference was used.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon review of this comment, we thought that it was best to modify the paper in two ways. First, we explained in further detail that comparing the percentage of correctly recalled word pairs on the second task 7-days after learning from the percentage of correctly recalled word pairs on the first task 7-days after learning was done to measure for an interference effect.</p><p>Please see the adapted text from the Experiment 4 subsection on page 11 below:</p><p>“Upon assessment for a potential interference effect, the active group displayed no significant difference in how many words participants were able to recall between the first and the second task (difference:.76 ±4.93) (F = .29, p = .60), whereas the sham group demonstrated the first task rendered an interference effect on the second task (difference: 5.16 ±5.99) (F = 14.11, p = .001).”</p><p>Additionally, the methods section describing how the interference effect was calculated was changed.

From the NTS, the information is then integrated amongst networks within the complex reticular formation and relayed across the brainstem through major cortical and subcortical regions(12).”</p><p>We have also acknowledged how the effects of NITESGON may be explained via the activation of other neuromodulatory pathways via peripheral nerve stimulation.

By comparison, little work has explored the link between sEBR and hippocampal memory processes, and there is no way to explicitly link them in the current dataset. Prior work on sEBR also typically link sEBR phenomena to prefrontal executive functions (or frontostriatal loops), such as working memory or updating (Ortega et al., 2022). Thus, sEBR in effects in Experiment 7 may relate to attentional effects, as the oddball paradigm suggests, but not necessarily memory encoding. There is also some evidence that the sEBR and DA levels may be unrelated (Dang et al., 2017; Sescousse et al., 2018). While I find the current findings interesting, it's a very big stretch to interpret blink rate as reflecting LC dopamine. Like sAA, blink rate could reflect other neural processes that are engaged by NITESGON but aren't driven by a common underlying mechanism. This framing/interpretation needs to be tempered significantly. It would be more appropriate to frame the goals of that section as examining possible relationships with DA, but not LC-DA specifically. It's fair to speculate they may be related, but that is very much open to interpretation and belongs in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon consideration of your comment, we have included a paragraph in the Discussion section highlighting limitations that exist within the research.

That said, there are some outstanding concerns that should be addressed.</p><p>The first concerns the statistical reporting of correlations that Reviewer 1 had recommended initially and still requires attention. It is important for the authors to report their correlations separately by group or to include a group as a covariate in the statistical analyses. If the correlations uncouple within a group, this should be reported and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the correlations for each group separately for each of the experiments. A description was included for each experiment in the Results section. All figures include also the correlation and regression line for each group separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, there was confusion about pupil data acquisition and when and how they were acquired. I will point your attention to Reviewer 1's specific comment here.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarify this in the paper. “Pupil dilation. The response of the pupil to three types of light stimulation (blue, 470 nm; white 8000k color temperature; and red, 624 nm) was recorded in real-time using a binocular Basler Dart Near Infrared (NIR) cameras. The lenses have a fixed focal length of 8 mm with an M12x0.5 body. The images were recorded at a frame rate of 120 Hz. There is a constant NIR illumination of the eye (850 nm) and the cameras are equipped with a “daylight cut filter” which passes NIR and blocks any wavelengths below ~800 nm. Surface-mounted LEDs were used for light stimulation and the cameras were all mounted on a single eyepiece, which communicated with a Windows laptop through a USB 3.0 cable. Each color was shown for 200 ms first in the left eye and then in the right eye with an ISI of 8 seconds. This left-right trial was repeated three times for each color. The average total duration of the procedure was two minutes per participant. The participant was requested to focus on a point inside the eyepiece and open their eyes as wide as possible. They were asked to avoid rapid and frequent blinking of eyes, movement of eyes, and specifically to avoid blinking during stimulus presentation. The videos were then post-processed to obtain the dilation of the pupil. The pupil was extracted as an ellipse from each frame with a segmentation algorithm and the diameter was calculated from the average of the major and minor axes of the resulting pupil ellipse. The difference between the maximum dilation and maximum constriction of both pupils in response to each color for every trial was calculated for each person immediately before and after NITESGON. The pupil size was measured as a direct response to the NITESGON and did not include a specific task.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, it is important that your discussion be as specific as possible about the manipulation and the effects noted. For example Reviewer 2 points out, and correctly so, that the dependent measure of # of words recalled after stimulation may or may not reflect interference effects, as is claimed. It is recommended that the authors use a specific measure of interference if allowable, or refrain from claiming their measure(s) reflect interference.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern and apologies for the confusion. We recalculated the interference effect as suggested by reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>See the reviewers' specific comments below:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>First, I commend the authors on the substantial work they invested in this revision. They have addressed most of my comments and this was no small effort. I especially appreciate that they have acknowledged the lack of causality and direct associations between neuromodulators and some of these indirect biomarkers. However, I do have a few outstanding concerns that I believe warrant consideration prior to publication.</p><p>1) The pupil analyses were a little puzzling. It would more sensible to measure discrete pupil dilations to the deviant vs. standard stimuli, as LC responses are most often measured to reflect &quot;cognitive activity&quot; rather than luminance. The LC will be stimulated by blue light, but it would be stronger to report oddball-evoked effects. I'm not sure if I misunderstood whether the pupil wasn't recorded during the task itself.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarify this in the paper. “Pupil dilation.

In addition, saliva and pupil dilation were also collected immediately before and immediately after the NITESGON session. The reason why we collected auditory oddball task and pupil size before and after NITESGON is to avoid a direct effect of the learning taks or inference of the current sent to the scalp. Participants were randomly assigned to the active or sham NITESGON group. The researcher who controlled the NITESGON device was not involved in instructing the participant; this was performed by a second researcher who was blind to the stimulation protocol.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I'd still recommend reporting separate correlations by group. Many of the correlation effects appear to uncouple in the stimulation condition, which could alter some interpretations of the data. If this happens, additional discussion is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the correlations for each group separately for each of the experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The addition of the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; (blue/yellow colors) in some of the keys was a useful change. However, these names could be more descriptive. It's not readily apparent what these mean when the other variable also describes timepoints (e.g., during stimulation).</p></disp-quote><p>We included this in the paper by indicating that before or after NITESGON.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are quite a number of grammatical and spelling errors throughout, which I won't point out individually. The paper should be proofread again and revised before final acceptance.</p></disp-quote><p>I asked a native speaker to double check for typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be useful to foreground the &quot;competition&quot; effects of tag-and-capture in the Results section for the interference studies. This is described well in the discussion, but the same point should be repeated higher up. Otherwise, this buries the lead for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We include this in the paper under experiment 4. “Experiments 2 and 3 revealed both retroactive and proactive memory effects 7-days after initial learning of the two tasks. To further explore if NITESGON is linked to behavioral tagging and evaluate if interference impacts NITESGON as the strong stimulus, Experiment 4 removed the object-location task used in Experiments 2 and 3 and replaced it with a Japanese-English verbal associative learning task similar to the Swahili-English verbal associative task. Considering that memory formation and persistence are susceptible to interference occurring pre-and post-encoding(39-41) and are heavily influenced by commonality amongst the learned and intervening stimuli(42); it is believed that conducting two consecutive, like-minded word-association (i.e., Swahili-English and Japanese-English) tasks will result in one’s consolidation process interfering with that of the other(43). Furthermore, research on the synaptic tag-and-capture hypothesis suggest that memory interference is the result of synaptic competition, a proposed “fight for proteins” that arises between tagged synapses amongst limited proteins that leads to one memory converting to long-term memory at the expense of the other(68). Considering how our previous experiments suggest the effect obtained by NITESGON improves the consolidation of information via behavioral tagging, it is possible that NITESGON on the first task might help reduce the overall interference effect on the second task.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
