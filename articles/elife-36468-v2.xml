The hair follicle dermal condensate is the precursor to the permanent mesenchymal unit of the hair follicle, the dermal papilla, which regulates hair cycling throughout life and bears hair inductive potential. Dermal condensate morphogenesis depends on epithelial Fibroblast Growth Factor 20 (Fgf20). Here, we combine mouse models with 3D and 4D microscopy to demonstrate that dermal condensates form de novo and via directional migration. We identify cell cycle exit and cell shape changes as early hallmarks of dermal condensate morphogenesis and find that Fgf20 primes these cellular behaviors and enhances cell motility and condensation. RNAseq profiling of immediate Fgf20 targets revealed induction of a subset of dermal condensate marker genes. Collectively, these data indicate that dermal condensation occurs via directed cell movement and that Fgf20 orchestrates the early cellular and molecular events.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36468.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All mammal hair springs from hair follicles under the skin. These follicles sit in the dermis, beneath the outermost skin layer, the epidermis. In the embryo, hair follicles develop from unspecialized cells in two tissues, the epithelium and the mesenchyme, which will later develop into the dermis and epidermis, respectively. As development progresses, the cells of these tissues begin to cluster, and signals passing back and forth between the epithelium and mesenchyme instruct the cells what to do. In the mesenchyme, cells called fibroblasts squeeze up against their neighbors, forming patches called dermal condensates. These mature into so-called dermal papillae, which supply specific molecules called growth factors that regulate hair formation throughout lifetime.</p><p>Fibroblasts in the developing skin respond to a signal from the epithelium called fibroblast growth factor 20 (Fgf20), but we do not yet understand its effects. It is possible that Fgf20 tells the cells to divide, forming clusters of daughter cells around their current location. Or, it could be that Fgf20 tells the cells to move, encouraging them to travel towards one another to form groups.</p><p>To address this question, Biggs, Mäkelä et al. examined developing mouse skin grown in the laboratory. They traced cells marked with fluorescent tags to analyze their behavior as the condensates formed. This revealed that the Fgf20 signal acts as a rallying call, triggering fibroblast movement. The cells changed shape and moved towards one another, rather than dividing to create their own clusters. In fact, they switched off their own cell cycle as the condensates formed, halting their ability to divide. A technique called RNA sequencing revealed that Fgf20 also promotes the use of genes known to be active in dermal condensates.</p><p>Dermal papillae control hair growth, and transplanting them under the skin can form new hair follicles. However, these cells lose this ability when grown in the laboratory. Understanding how they develop could be beneficial for future hair growth therapy. Further work could also address fundamental questions in embryology. Condensates of cells from the mesenchyme also precede the formation of limbs, bones, muscles and organs. Extending this work could help us to understand this critical developmental step.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair follicle</kwd><kwd>dermal condensate</kwd><kwd>Fgf20</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006306</institution-id><institution>Sigrid Juséliuksen Säätiö</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mikkola</surname><given-names>Marja L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004012</institution-id><institution>Jane ja Aatos Erkon Säätiö</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mikkola</surname><given-names>Marja L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Helsinki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Program in Integrative Life Science</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mäkelä</surname><given-names>Otto JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>268798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mikkola</surname><given-names>Marja L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>307421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mikkola</surname><given-names>Marja L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The hair follicle dermal condensate is populated via migration, and the cells exhibit early changes in cell shape and cell cycle status; Fgf20 primes these cellular and molecular events.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mesenchymal condensation, first recognized in limb bud condensations and named ‘precartilage condensates’ by Dame Honor Fell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fell, 1925</xref>), is a tissue-level structure preceding organ development. Since then, mesenchymal condensations have been described in the precursors of several organs, occurring in most ectodermal appendages (tooth, hair, mammary gland, feather, scales) as well as in bone and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Widelitz and Chuong, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hall and Miyake, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newman and Bhat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">da Rocha-Azevedo and Grinnell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biggs and Mikkola, 2014</xref>). The condensation has been suggested to be the basic cellular unit of a tissue, and to function as the driver of morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atchley and Hall, 1991</xref>), yet the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Condensations are morphologically distinguishable and are defined as a local increase in cell density. Characteristics of condensing mesenchymal cells include a change in cell shape, close surface contact between adjacent cells, and increased nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thorogood and Hinchliffe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Searls et al., 1972</xref>) (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hall and Miyake, 2000</xref>]). Signals from the epithelium are critical for mesenchymal cell condensation. The question of how a local increase in cell density is achieved remains to be addressed. Several modes of cell condensation have been proposed, including i) increase in mitotic activity, ii) active migration of cells, and iii) failure of cells to disperse due to changes in cell-cell and/or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hall and Miyake, 1992</xref>).</p><p>The hair follicle (HF) is an excellent model to study the early attributes of mesenchymal condensation. HFs of the mouse dorsum develop in three waves as a result of reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal signaling events with the first subset initiating morphogenesis at embryonic day (E) E13.5 and eventually producing guard hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hardy, 1992</xref>). Within 24 hr, the previously homogenous epidermis exhibits discrete, focal thickenings, known as placodes, which are accompanied by condensation of the adjacent mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biggs and Mikkola, 2014</xref>). Coincident with dermal fibroblast condensation, their transcriptome profoundly alters. In particular, genes involved in cell-cell signaling such as Bmp4 and Wnt pathway components, p75 neurotrophin receptor, and many transcription factors including Sox2, one of the earliest markers of incipient dermal condensates (DC), are upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Driskell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sennett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Botchkareva et al., 1999</xref>). Another hallmark of DC formation is the differential expression of ECM molecules including tenascin, NCAM, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, as well as syndecan-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>). As HF morphogenesis continues, the DCs become enveloped by the down-growing follicular epithelium and subsequently mature into the permanent, mesenchymal component of the HF termed the dermal papilla (DP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morgan, 2014</xref>). The DP directs HF cycling throughout life and its miniaturization or absence results in a thinner or absent hair shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rompolas et al., 2012</xref>). Of note, the DP has inductive capacity demonstrated by transplantation of freshly isolated or cultured (low passage) rodent DP cells under glabrous epithelium, which results in induction of hair follicle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oliver, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jahoda et al., 1984</xref>). By comparison, human DP cells lose their inductive capacity even faster in vitro but some activity can be sustained in 3D culture in aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that cellular condensation is tightly linked with DP cell fate specification and maintenance.</p><p>The molecular regulators of DC/DP morphogenesis have slowly begun to emerge. Absence of platelet-derived growth factor A (Pdgf-A) results in smaller DPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karlsson et al., 1999</xref>); however, the entire dermis is thinner, likely accounting for the DP phenotype as indicated by more recent studies in which the PDGF receptors were conditionally deleted in the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rezza et al., 2015</xref>). Another placode-derived factor implicated in DC formation is Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karlsson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiang et al., 1999</xref>). However, conditional dermal deletion of Shh receptor Smoothened indicates a role in DC maintenance rather than induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Woo et al., 2012</xref>). Several other known DC markers such as Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clavel et al., 2012</xref>), Tbx18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grisanti et al., 2013a</xref>), Cxcr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sennett et al., 2014</xref>), and Enpp2/autotaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grisanti et al., 2013b</xref>) have also been conditionally ablated, but none of them results in absence of the DC.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, the most informative genetic studies uncovering the molecular basis of DC formation have been those targeting the epithelium. Wnt signaling is believed to be the at the top of the hierarchy of signaling factors guiding HF morphogenesis, and expression of stabilized β-catenin in the epidermis results in broad adoption of placode fate as well as condensed mesenchyme concomitant with DC marker expression throughout the upper dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Närhi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>). The ectodysplasin (Eda)/Edar pathway is another essential pathway for placode morphogenesis: in its absence only rudimentary primary hair placodes form transiently and DCs are missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Headon and Overbeek, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laurikkala et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmidt-Ullrich et al., 2006</xref>). Downstream of Wnt and Eda signaling, placodal factor Fgf20 is expressed early during HF morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>). Deletion of Fgf20 results in absent DC in guard hairs and many secondary (awl and auchene) hairs as shown by morphological and molecular analyses, as well as failure in placode invagination, and ultimately, absent hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huh et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the condensed mesenchyme observed in embryos expressing stabilized epithelial β-catenin was ablated in the absence of Fgf20 further confirming the indispensable function of Fgf20 in DC induction.</p><p>Although these molecular players have been investigated, the cellular mechanism of DC development and the role that Fgf20 plays in DC morphogenesis remain unknown. We therefore aimed to define the hallmarks of DC morphogenesis and the function that Fgf20 plays in this process. We applied a multifaceted approach to determine the cellular and molecular changes leading to DC morphogenesis using murine back skin primary hair follicle as the model due to its feasibility for manipulation and ex vivo imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahtiainen et al., 2014</xref>). We identify cell shape changes and cycle exit as early hallmarks of DC morphogenesis. Live confocal imaging and lineage tracing showed that fibroblasts were recruited from the near vicinity and not from a pre-specified pool of Sox2+ cells, and migrate toward placodal epithelium. Further, Fgf20 induced fibroblast migration and cell shape change, as well as transcriptional responses that suggest its involvement in cell cycle exit. Collectively, our data show that Fgf20 governs multiple cellular and molecular events critical for DC formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dermal fibroblasts condense and change shape below the developing hair follicle placode</title><p>To determine to what extent the fibroblasts within the dermal condensate are more densely packed than the interfollicular fibroblasts, we examined primary HFs in E14.5 whole skin in 3D using confocal microscopy.

Primary hair placode induction is a continuous process first occurring near the mammary line and proceeding dorsally and caudally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dhouailly et al., 2004</xref>), and hence the same embryo contains hair placodes in different developmental stages. To better capture the dynamic nature of DC formation, we categorized hair placodes in four developmental stages. Follicular epithelium was identified by the <italic>Fgf20<sup>β-gal</sup></italic> knock-in allele, one of the earliest placode markers ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huh et al., 2013</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Stage I was defined as a single layered placode, and stage II as a multilayered placode. Stage III is a placode that has invaginated into the dermis, and stage IV placodes have an anterior pocket where DC cells reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The number and distance from placodes of Sox2+ cells was analyzed in 3D. Throughout these stages, the number of Sox2+ cells associated with each placode increased significantly (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Quantification of their distance from the placode revealed a progressive decrease in median distance (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). At stage I, some dispersed Sox2+ cells were observed, which by stage II were preferentially oriented on the anterior side of the placode. By stage III, the cells appeared to be closer to the placode, and at stage IV, the Sox2+ cells maintained their proximity but increased in number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).</p><p>Mesenchymal cell condensation is often accompanied by cell shape changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ray and Chapman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mammoto et al., 2011</xref>). Our 3D analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>) also suggested that DC formation correlates with cell shape changes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that E14.5 DC cells have an elongated, convex shape and display a characteristic alignment next to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). 3D rendering of nuclear shapes in whole mount and subsequent quantifications of nuclear sphericity during DC formation showed that the change in nuclear shape is an early indicator of DC formation (all stages p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Consistent with the TEM and nuclear data, 3D rendering of cell shapes based on a ubiquitous cell membrane marker confirmed that Sox2+ DC cells exhibited a convex shape, whereas the non-DC fibroblasts were relatively spherical (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dermal condensate cells acquire Sox2 expression de novo</title><p>Given that the number of Sox2+ cells increased while their distance to placode decreased over time, and that the dermis contains Sox2+ Schwann cell precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jessen and Mirsky, 2005</xref>), we next asked whether the DC cells were recruited from a pre-existing pool of Sox2+ cells or whether they acquired Sox2 expression de novo. To this end, we utilized <italic>Sox2<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26R<sup>tdTomato/+</sup></italic> embryos and analyzed tdTomato expression after 24 or 48 hr of tamoxifen (TAM) exposure beginning at E12.5 (before morphological and molecular appearance of HF), E13.5 (earliest molecular sign of HF), and at E14.5 (placode stage of HF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>−F). To minimize the effect of variation in HF development, we examined hair follicles from the same region in all embryos (ventro-lateral skin) and quantified the total number of Sox2+ cells using Sox2 antibody and analyzed the proportion of tdTomato-labeled cells amongst them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). When labeling was induced at E14.5 and cells analyzed 24 hr later, 65% of Sox2+ cells were tdTomato+, indicating that the TAM dosage used results in a relatively high labeling efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,G</xref>).

We quantified this phenomenon in E15.5 HFs labeled at E14.5 (where 65% of the Sox2+ were tdTomato+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>) and measured the median distance of the tdTomato+ cells to the center of the placode surface.

Our quantifications revealed that when TAM was administered at E13.5, on average 20% and 53% of Sox2+ cells were tdTomato+ at E14.5 and 15.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Given that the average number of Sox2+ DC cells increased only by seven cells (from 67 to 74) from E14.5 to E15.5 in the same dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), our findings suggest that either TAM remains active for longer than 24 hr as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayashi and McMahon, 2002</xref>), or that Sox2+ cells labeled between E13.5 and E14.5 increase in number by proliferation. To test whether locally enhanced proliferation could drive DC formation, we assessed cell cycle dynamics during DC morphogenesis with the aid of a bitransgenic cell cycle indicator Fucci mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>) in which mKusabira Orange (mKO) is expressed during the G<sub>1/</sub>G<sub>0</sub> phase (hereafter G<sub>1</sub>) and mAzami Green (mAG) during the S/G<sub>2</sub>/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The interfollicular dermal cells (Sox2-) were equally distributed between G<sub>1</sub> and S/G<sub>2</sub>/M phases at all stages of placode morphogenesis analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, the Sox2+ cells showed progressive exit from the cell cycle. At stage I, the Sox2+ cells were nearly evenly distributed between proliferative and non-proliferative phases. By stage II, the majority of Sox2+ cells were in G<sub>1</sub>, which persisted through stages III and IV (<italic>p<sub>I</sub></italic> = 0.0166, <italic>p<sub>II</sub></italic> = 0.002, <italic>p<sub>III, IV</sub></italic> &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Further, the percent non-proliferating cells in the stage I DC was significantly lower than the following stages (<italic>p<sub>IvsII</sub></italic> = 0.0211), suggesting that DC fate acquisition occurs before cell cycle exit. This cell cycle exit was not transient as the vast majority of DC cells remained in G<sub>1</sub> through E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). To determine whether this cell cycle exit is dependent on Fgf20, we analyzed the cell cycle status of E14.5 <italic>Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fibroblasts. Immediately below the placode, in a volume equivalent to a wild-type stage IV DC, the proportion of G<sub>1</sub> and S/G<sub>2</sub>/M cells did not differ from that of the interfollicular dermal cells (p=0.473, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>).

We initially tracked all Sox2-GFP+ DC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>−C), but observed that many of the cells that were present in the condensates at the beginning of tracing displayed low velocity suggesting that their movement is restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, cells that were initially further than 30 µm (the average DC diameter) from the center of the condensate at the beginning of tracing behaved differently. Notably, these cells showed a preferential movement direction towards the condensate center, while interfollicular cells exhibited no directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). We observed that the condensate-forming fibroblasts also moved at a significantly higher velocity than interfollicular cells (p=0.0051) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) yet there was no significant difference between the straightness of cell movement or net velocity (p=0.8945 and p=0.1390, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Furthermore, when we analyzed migration of condensate-forming fibroblasts only until they enter the dermal condensate, not only were they preferentially moving toward the DC center but also migrated on a significantly straighter track (p=0.0232) and had higher net velocity than the interfollicular cells (p=0.0006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>As cell migration is associated with remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Svitkina, 2018</xref>]), we investigated whether Sox2-GFP cells presumably <italic>en route</italic> to the DC could be distinguished from other dermal fibroblasts or Sox2-GFP cells already present in the DC based on the organization of their actin cytoskeleton. The non-DC Sox2-GFP cells displayed a slightly higher intensity of F-actin than dermal fibroblasts, which may be indicative of their migratory status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). However, the Sox2-GFP cells within the DC displayed even higher levels of F-actin intensity compared to non-DC Sox2-GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Further, the intensity of F-actin increased as the DC progressed through morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). As these cells exhibited reduced motility, this suggests that the F-actin is involved in maintaining the 3D configuration of the DC. Together, these results suggest that directed migration of the dermal fibroblasts is driving DC formation, but once the cells have entered the DC, their motile behavior changes, likely due to limitations posed by increased cell density, a finding in line with our lineage tracing/nearest neighbor analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Transcriptional responses of Fgf20 in the dermis</title><p>In order to address the function of Fgf20 in DC formation, we first aimed to identify its immediate transcriptional targets.

We confirmed upregulation of <italic>Edar</italic> expression in the entire basal epithelium by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

FGF20 induced significantly faster wound closure compared to control fibroblasts (p=0.0177), an effect that was abolished in the presence of an Fgfr inhibitor, SU5402 (p=0.6100), confirming the specificity of the response to FGF20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).

To assess whether Fgf20 could function as a chemotactic factor, we analyzed migration of growth-arrested E13.5 primary dermal fibroblasts in a transwell assay. When FGF20 was present in the lower chamber only, the number of migrating cells was significantly higher than in control wells (p=0.0003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). When the FGF20 gradient was abolished by adding FGF20 also to the upper chamber, again a significantly higher number of cells migrated to the lower chamber (p&lt;0.0001), however, there was no difference between the two types of FGF20 treatments (p=0.2256) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Similar data was obtained when FGF9 was used instead of FGF20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that Fgf20 induces migration of embryonic dermal fibroblasts in vitro and that this effect is likely chemokinetic.</p><p>Next, we wanted to test the impact of Fgf20 in a more physiological setting. To this end, we introduced FGF20 locally via a bead on E13.5 dermis explants to mimic the in vivo situation in which Fgf20 is produced locally in the placode. First, we investigated the activity of FGF20 in this context by assessing its ability to upregulate the expression of <italic>Spry4</italic> and <italic>Dusp6</italic>, two known Fgf pathway feedback inhibitors also differentially expressed in our RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), using whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization. While we observed a robust induction of both genes after a 3 hr treatment, no consistent responses were detected after 8- and 16 hr treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), suggesting that the FGF20 protein loses its activity in intact dermal explants over this period of time. Vehicle-loaded control beads showed no induction of gene expression after any treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). We further analyzed whether FGF20 bead incubation results in upregulation of <italic>Sox2</italic>, but observed no induction at any time point analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). FGF9 beads led to a prominent induction of <italic>Spry4</italic> and <italic>Dusp6</italic> after all analyzed treatment periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, an overnight treatment also led to a robust increase in cell proliferation around the FGF9 bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This response is in contrast to what we observed during dermal condensate formation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) indicating that this experimental set-up may not represent a physiologically relevant model to study DC cell behavior and thus we concentrated on FGF20.</p><p>We next used the bead assay to test the impact of FGF20 on fibroblast cell behavior. To do this, we quantified the density of nuclei in E13.5 dermal explants cultured 3 hr with FGF20 or BSA vehicle control beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). We observed a significant, 35% increase in cell density 15 µm around the FGF20 bead compared to the control bead (p=0.002), indicating that a localized Fgf20 source can induce aggregation of mesenchymal cells. We observed a similar increase in cell density upon treatment with FGF9 bead (p=0.033) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nuclear shape analysis showed that cells in the immediate vicinity of the FGF20 bead displayed a significant decrease in nuclear sphericity compared to control bead (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>), similarly to DC cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). We also tested whether cell cycle exit was induced upon local addition of FGF20. We could not detect <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> induction and no significant increase in Fucci-mKO+ cells were observed around the bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together this data suggests that Fgf20 can induce some of the cellular changes observed during DC morphogenesis. Finally, we analyzed whether ectopic expression of <italic>Fgf20</italic> could also lead to condensation of the mesenchyme in the <italic>K14-Edar</italic> model. We did not detect any significant difference in the cell density in the upper dermis between control, <italic>K14-Edar</italic>, and <italic>K14-Edar;Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup></italic> genotypes (p&gt;0.115) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, given that <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> was expressed throughout the upper dermis in <italic>K14-Edar</italic> embryos, a lack of condensation in this model could be due to a lack of supply of cells available to condense.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Inhibition of Fgf signaling impairs both recruitment and maintenance of DC cells ex vivo</title><p>The <italic>Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model lacks all molecular and cellular signs of DC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huh et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and therefore offers limited tools to assess the effect of Fgf20 on cellular mechanisms governing DC formation. Therefore, we decided to inhibit Fgf signaling using SU5402 ex vivo which allows precise temporal manipulation of pathway activity followed by DC analysis in 3D. The same concentration of SU5402 that blocked the ability of Fgf20 to induce migration of E13.5 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), also fully suppressed DC formation when applied to E13.5 skin cultured for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Yet, it led to the expansion of <italic>Fgf20<sup>β-Gal</sup></italic> knock-in allele expression into a stripe-like pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), as also observed in E14.5 <italic>Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huh et al., 2013</xref>) confirming the applicability of this approach. SU5402 can also inhibit VEGFR and thus we used an inhibitor more specific to VEGFR, XL184, to test the effects of VEGFR-inhibition on DC formation. We added XL184 at an equivalent dose to inhibit VEGFR as 20 µM SU5402 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7s2sdata1">Figure 7—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>) as well as at five-times higher concentration and observed normal DC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). Finally, we confirmed that the absence of DCs in the SU5402-treated samples was due to inhibition of FGFR-signaling by using BGJ398, an inhibitor more specific to FGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). An equivalent dose to inhibit FGFR as 20 µM SU5402 and a 2.5-times higher dose blocked formation of the DCs in the skins and altered the <italic>Fgf20<sup>β-Gal</sup></italic> knock-in allele expression similar to the <italic>Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), confirming the effects of the SU5402 to be due to FGFR-inhibition.</p><p>Next, we applied SU5402 slightly later, when DC formation had initiated. Skin explants were divided into two halves: one was used as the control and the other one treated with SU5402 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). At this stage, the inhibitor did not result in absence of dermal condensates, but the number of Sox2+ cells was significantly lower in the SU5402-treated samples compared to the controls (p=0.0061) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating that Fgf signaling is necessary for further addition of Sox2+ cells. Analysis of the average distances of DC cells to their nearest neighbor, however, showed no difference between control and SU5402 treated samples (p=0.7319) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) suggesting that inhibition of Fgf signaling does not affect the density of the existing DC. To assess whether Fgf20 could also play a role in the maintenance of DC cells, we compared dermal condensates at the start (T0) of experiment with condensates after 12 hr SU5402 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). A significant reduction in the number of Sox2+ DC cells was observed (p=0.0036) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Again, Sox2+ DC cell density was not affected by SU5402 treatment (p=0.3010) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Taken together, these results highlight the role of Fgf signaling both in recruitment and maintenance of DC cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36468.031</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of Fgf signaling blocks morphogenesis of dermal condensate ex vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal optical sections of paired E14.25 <italic>Fgf20<sup>+/-</sup></italic> skins explants cultured for 12 hr with SU5402 (20 µM) or DMSO vehicle control.

Despite the critical role of dermal condensation for organ development, the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hall and Miyake, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Widelitz and Chuong, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newman and Bhat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">da Rocha-Azevedo and Grinnell, 2013</xref>). Here, we have used 3D and 4D imaging to study DC morphogenesis in murine pelage primary hair follicles. The data presented here support two key conclusions. First, our findings show that early morphogenesis of the HF DC is characterized by cell shape changes, exit of the cell cycle, and directed migration. Second, our data indicate that Fgf20 regulates these processes, further corroborating the critical role of Fgf20 in HF dermal condensation. Our results reveal ~2-fold higher cell density in the DC compared to the interfollicular dermis. Ablation of Fgf20 results in the absence of all the DC markers analyzed thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huh et al., 2013</xref>), and here, we show by 3D analysis that the cells below the primary placode show no evidence of condensation. These data confirm that DC marker expression and fibroblast condensation are closely associated, although whether DC fate and condensation can be uncoupled remains unclear. Furthermore, this finding supports our previous conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huh et al., 2013</xref>) that hair follicle patterning is governed by and first arises in the epithelium rather than the mesenchyme.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>DC does not form from a pre-existing pool of Sox2+ cells</title><p>The origin of the DC/DP population is poorly understood. Tissue recombination and mouse mutant studies (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biggs and Mikkola, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morgan, 2014</xref>]) together with the ex vivo Fgf inhibitor experiments (this study) show that early DC fate is plastic and reversible. Yet, these findings do not preclude the existence of a predetermined pool of DC cells. Previous studies have shown that DPs of the dorsum largely derive from the early fibroblast precursor population marked by expression of <italic>Delta-like homologue 1</italic> (<italic>Dlk1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Driskell et al., 2013</xref>), and are polyclonal in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins et al., 2012</xref>).

Lineage tracing of neural crest cells with <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> or <italic>Ht-PA-Cre</italic> reveals that the whisker DP (along with non-DC head/facial fibroblasts) is neural crest-derived, but that neural crest cells or their progeny are rare in back skin DP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fernandes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wong et al., 2006</xref>). Our short-term lineage-tracing experiments show that Sox2 expression is de novo acquired in DC cells, confirming that the dorsal DCs do not arise from a pre-existing pool of Sox2+ cells, for example the neural crest-derived Schwann cell lineage of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adameyko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sennett et al., 2015</xref>). Studies in an adult model of ectopic hair follicles via forced epithelial β-catenin also argue against a pre-specified DC/DP subpopulation of dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, all available data suggest that the unique attributes of DC/DP cells do not reflect a distinct fibroblast lineage but are induced by placode-derived signals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cell shape change and cell cycle exit are early hallmarks of HF dermal condensation</title><p>We show in 3D that HF DCs exhibit a less spherical shape in vivo, and that this shape change is an early event during DC morphogenesis. Previous studies in other organs (bone, tooth, feather) have also revealed an altered cell shape in condensed mesenchyme when compared to the adjacent non-condensed tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thorogood and Hinchliffe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ray and Chapman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mammoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wessells, 1965</xref>). However, these analyses were conducted in 2D and thus their similarity or difference with the HF DC is not apparent. What is of note is that the cells within condensed mesenchyme display a distinct morphology. Indeed, a critical role for actomyosin contractility has been proposed to drive cytoskeletal rearrangements, and that the resulting cell shape changes are required for mesenchymal condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ray and Chapman, 2015</xref>). Here, we show that in the hair follicle DC the intensity of F-actin is increased in the DC compared to the surrounding mesenchyme, likely playing a critical role in maintaining cell shape. We show that in hair follicle DC, the cell shape changes depend on and can be induced by Fgf20. The utility of this cell shape change along with cell compaction could be manifold, including increased cell-cell contacts to foster cell-cell communication and further to maintain the structure of the DC. Transcriptomic analysis has indicated the expression of cell-cell adhesion factor <italic>R-cadherin</italic> and <italic>cadherin11</italic> (encoded by <italic>Cdh4</italic> and <italic>Cdh11</italic>, respectively) in the DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sennett et al., 2015</xref>) and cadherin-based junctions were detected between DP cells at E17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nanba et al., 2003</xref>), but their functional importance for condensation remains to be tested.</p><p>During DC morphogenesis, Sox2+ cells were found to exhibit a rapid exit from the cell cycle and maintain the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> status through E15.5, a finding in line with a previous study showing that morphologically distinct DC cells fail to incorporate H<sup>3</sup>-thymidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wessells and Roessner, 1965</xref>). Even as the size of the DC is increased by genetic means (<italic>K14-Eda</italic>), the DC cells remain quiescent supporting the idea that the increase in DC cell number is not a result of proliferation. Further, mitotic inactivity is a prominent feature of the mature HF DP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pierard and de la Brassinne, 1975</xref>). During the growth (anagen) and rest (telogen) phases of the hair cycle, however, the DP dynamically increases and decreases in cell number. Yet, the increase in DP cell number upon reentering anagen phase does not arise via proliferation but instead DP cells are recruited from the proximal dermal sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tobin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McElwee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, hair reconstitution experiments show that mitotically inhibited cells are fully competent to generate the DP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins et al., 2012</xref>) indicating that proliferation is not necessary for DC/DP formation.</p><p>We have previously shown that expression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> is an early marker of DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huh et al., 2013</xref>), and recent transcriptome profiling study showed that <italic>Cdkn1c </italic>(a.k.a. <italic>p57</italic>), another cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, is also expressed at high levels in the DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sennett et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, Fgf20 target transcriptome analysis displayed upregulation of cell-cycle-related genes, such as <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and <italic>Bcl6</italic>, which suggests that Fgf signaling could provide the cue for the G<sub>0</sub>-arrest observed in the DC fibroblasts. Despite this, FGF20 was unable to induce cell cycle arrest in the dermis in a short-term experiment when supplied in a localized manner. However, <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> was ectopically expressed in our model of <italic>Fgf20</italic> overexpression (<italic>K14-Edar</italic>) in an <italic>Fgf20</italic>-dependent manner.

A recent study tracking movements of Wnt-responsive cells using <italic>TCF/Lef::H2B-GFP</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glover et al., 2017</xref>) is consistent with our findings. In vitro scratch wound assay revealed that Fgf20 enhances cell motility. Although transwell assays did not support a chemotactic role for Fgf20, we showed that local delivery of FGF20 via beads on dermal explants induces an increase in cell density, suggesting that Fgf20 induces directed migration and in a tissue context, dermal condensation. Further, we find that inhibition of Fgfr signaling ex vivo blocks accumulation of Sox2+ fibroblasts in the DC while Fgf20 does not appear to directly regulate <italic>Sox2</italic> expression. These data support the conclusion that Fgf20 signaling regulates directed movement of dermal fibroblasts. An additional factor that we did not test but may play a role in DC morphogenesis is the contribution of differential ECM composition surrounding the hair follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaplan and Holbrook, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pflieger et al., 2006</xref>). It is possible that Fgf20 induces migration of fibroblasts and simultaneously, differential ECM composition around the hair follicle holds the DC cells in place.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that Fgf signaling induces migration, both chemotactic and chemokinetic, in several different developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mammoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delfini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Attia et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, a general role for Fgf signaling in regulating dermal condensation via cell migration is an appealing idea. Our ex vivo manipulation experiments showed that inhibition of Fgfr signaling suppresses accumulation of new Sox2+ cells, but also compromises maintenance of nascent DC. The latter finding is suggestive for a role also in DC maintenance. In odontogenic mesenchyme, attractive Fgf8 and repellent Sema3f are thought to act in concert to induce migration-driven cell compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mammoto et al., 2011</xref>). Involvement of Fgf signaling in mammary mesenchyme condensation is an intriguing hypothesis, but has not been examined. <italic>Fgf20</italic> is expressed in the epithelium of the mammary buds during the period of mesenchymal condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elo et al., 2017</xref>) yet it seems to be dispensable for this process, but other epithelially expressed Fgfs may compensate for the loss of Fgf20. In contrast, Fgf20 is necessary for feather development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Houghton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wells et al., 2012</xref>).

Fgf20 is necessary for DC marker expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huh et al., 2013</xref>) and here we show that Fgf20 is also necessary for dermal cell condensation. However, our RNAseq profiling of genes induced in the dermis upon short Fgf20 treatment revealed only a few DC signature genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sennett et al., 2015</xref>), and for example Sox2, was not upregulated by Fgf20 ex vivo, nor in our in vivo over-expression model of ectopic Fgf20 signaling. These data suggest that Fgf20 alone is sufficient to induce only a subset of DC markers. It is possible that other cues, molecular or mechanical, together with Fgf20 determine DC fate, and studies in dental and cartilage mesenchyme show that cellular condensation contributes to fate acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mammoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mammoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ray and Chapman, 2015</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that Fgf20 functions mainly to regulate cell behaviors rather than fate.</p><p>In conclusion, we show here that cell shape change, cell cycle exit and directed migration define HF DC formation. While altered cell shape and directed mesenchymal cell movement may be a shared characteristic, cell cycle exit appears to be a hair follicle specific feature, as cells within the condensing mammary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2011</xref>) and tooth mesenchyme exhibit proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mammoto et al., 2011</xref>) at the same rate as the surrounding non-condensed mesenchyme. However, the function of DC cell cycle exit in hair follicle morphogenesis remains unknown. It appears not to be sufficient to induce DC fate, but it remains open whether it is necessary. To date, culturing methods for maintaining the hair-follicle inductive capacity of DC/DP remain elusive, and after a few passages, DP populations completely lose their inductive abilities. Although speculative, the obligate proliferation under in vitro culture may compromise DC fate maintenance. The challenge in future therapeutic efforts to generate hair inductive fibroblasts is to uncover culture conditions that induce DC cell fate de novo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

For fluorescent labeling, sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 min and blocked with 10% normal donkey serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The sections were stained with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C and washed with PBS at room temperature. Slides were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 hr, washed with PBS, and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For immunohistochemical labeling, slides were stained using BrightVision Poly-HRP-AntiRB-kit (DVPR110HRP, ImmunoLogic, Duiven, The Netherlands) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, slides were blocked using Pre-Antibody Blocking solution, 5 min, RT and washed with PBS. Then primary antibody was diluted in Pre-Antibody Blocking and the slides were stained overnight, 4°C, before washing with PBS. The slides were then stained with secondary goat, anti-rabbit-Poly-HRP antibody 30 min, RT and washed with PBS. The slides were then treated with DAB-solution (BS04-110, ImmunoLogic, Duiven, The Netherlands) according to maunfacturer’s instructions, 8 min, RT, washed in de-ionized water, and mounted with ImmuMount (ThermoScientific, Kalamazoo, MI). Images were acquired with Axio Imager M.2 microscope equipped with Plan-Neofluar 20x/0.5 objective and AxioCam HRc.</p><p>For whole-mount confocal microscopy, embryonic skin was spread onto 0.1 µm nucleopore filters and fixed for 2 hr at room temperature. Tissues were washed in large volumes of PBS and subsequently blocked in 10% normal donkey serum, 0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 hr, 4°C. Blocking solution was changed directly for primary antibody incubation in blocking solution 12–48 hr. The samples were washed in several changes of large volumes of PBS over 6–24 hr. Secondary antibody and Hoechst33342 (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR) were incubated for 6–24 hr, followed by washing. In the case of Fucci reporter samples and cell shape analysis of DC and IF cells, given the differential localization of Sox2 (nuclear) and Fgf20-β-Gal (cytosolic, epithelial) we used the same secondary Alexa fluor in order to reduce imaging time. Otherwise, different fluorophores were used. Optical sections of skin were obtained using Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope equipped with HCX APO 63x/1.30 glycerol-immersion objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at 0.5 µm intervals for bead-treated dermis and for confocal imaging of in vivo cell shape analysis using Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope equipped with 63x/1.40 Plan-Apochromat oil-immersion objective at 0.5 µm intervals. Otherwise, images were acquired using an upright laser scanning confocal microscope LSM700 Axio Imager.M2 (Zeiss) using LCI Plan-Neofluar 63x/1.30 glycerol-immersion objective at 0.4–0.5 µm intervals and using Plan-Apochromat 10X/0.45 air objective at 0.8 µm intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Z-stacks were analyzed in 3D using Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland), unless stated otherwise. To analyze the number of Sox2-positive cells, co-localization of Fucci and R26R-tomato reporters and their distances to each other and the placode, surfaces of Sox2 nuclei were generated based on Sox2 immunostaining using local intensity measures. The parameters were as follows: surface level detail 0.5 µm, local contrast background subtraction (seed point diameter 4.25 µm). In the analyses of interfollicular cells, sub-placodal cells of the <italic>Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup></italic> skin, and the quantification of cell shapes, Hoechst 33342 staining was exploited for surface rendering as above (surface level detail 0.6 µm, local background subtraction (seed point diameter 5 µm). To generate surfaces based on cytoplasmic GFP in Sox2-GFP cells, surface detail was 0.6 µm with local background substraction (seed point diameter 8 µm). All nuclear surfaces were manually corrected. In all analyses, center of nuclear surface was used as a marker for cell position. For reporter studies, average intensity of the reporter channel within Sox2 or Hoechst 33342 surfaces was used as a measure for a cell’s reporter activity. A cut-off value was manually determined, where a cell could be distinctly identified as reporter positive. To determine the distance from placode, a placodal surface was created as above, with surface level detail of 1.5 µm.</p><p>In description of DC morphogenesis and analysis of Fgfr inhibition on DC cells, number of Sox2+ cells and their distances from the placode were determined from <italic>Fgf20<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup></italic> skin samples immunostained for β-gal and Sox2. Cell density of the DC was determined from <italic>Sox2-EGFP;Fgf20<sup>+/-</sup></italic> as the number of Sox2+ surfaces inside the area distinguished by Sox2-EGFP reporter surface (created as above), the density of the interfollicular cells and sub-placodal cells of the <italic>Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup></italic> samples was determined as the number of Hoechst33342 surfaces within a corresponding volume of the interfollicular tissue. Density of sub-placodal dermal cells of the <italic>Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup></italic> skin was determined as the number of Hoechst33342 surfaces underneath a manually adjusted region of interest underlying the placode (β-gal). F-actin intensities in the DC and in the interfollicular dermis were determined from <italic>Fgf20<sup>+/-</sup></italic> skins mount skin samples stained with A568-phalloidin (LifeTechnologies, Eugene, OR) and antibodies against Sox2 and β-gal. A surface was drawn around the Sox2-positive cells beneath placode marked by β-gal and copied to a Sox2-negative interfollicular area of the dermis at approximately the same depth to measure the mean intensity of A568-phalloidin staining. F-actin intensity in DC Sox2-positive cells and non-DC Sox2-positive cells in relation to Sox2-negative dermal fibroblasts was determined from E13.75 <italic>Sox2-EGFP;Fgf20<sup>+/-</sup></italic> back skin samples stained with A568-phalloidin and β-gal antibody. Sox2-GFP surfaces demarcating individual cells were classified as DC or non-DC based on the proximity to the placode and mean F-actin intensities inside the surfaces measured. Dermal fibroblast surfaces were drawn based on phalloidin-staining at locations close to the non-DC Sox2-GFP cells. Distance of Sox2+ surfaces to placode, were measured as the shortest distance to β-gal surface. Distance to nearest neighbor was determined based on Sox2 surface center coordinated using R software and nabor package (version 0.4.7) and median distances of each cell group within each placode were analyzed using Mann-Whitney test. For lineage tracing analysis, <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT/+</sup>;R26R<sup>tdTomato/+</sup>;Fgf20<sup>+/-</sup></italic> skin immunostained for Sox2 and β-gal were used. DC cell number, tdTomato positivity and position were determined by Sox2 surfaces as described above. Distance to placode was determined as the distance to a manually designated point on the center of placode surface and the identity of the nearest neighbor was determined based on Sox2 surface coordinates using R software with nabor package (version 0.4.7). For cell cycle analysis, confocal stacks of <italic>Fgf20<sup>+/-</sup>;Fucci</italic> reporter skins immunostained for Sox2 and β-gal were used. Sox2 surfaces were used for DC cells and Hoechst33342 surfaces were used for interfollicular cells of <italic>Fgf20<sup>+/-</sup></italic> skin and sub-placodal cells of the <italic>Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup></italic> skin. Reporter positivity was determined as above.</p><p>DC and IF nuclear shapes were determined from Hoechst33342 staining using Imaris software sphericity measurement. Non-adjacent cells were selected for analysis in order to avoid bias introduction from manual surface editing. IF control cells were selected at ~70 µm distance from condensate center. Cell shape was also determined using <italic>Fgf20<sup>+/-</sup>;R26R<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> skins immunostained for Sox2 and β-gal. Cell shapes were analyzed with ImageJ software based on membrane-bound tdTomato signal with rolling ball background subtraction (5 µm diameter), 3D Gaussian filtering (0.4 µm diameter) and Gamma correction (0.6 value). The mT-negative region containing the cytoplasm was segmented using the Wand-tracing tool in the Segmentation Editor of Image J. The generated objects were automatically detected with the 3D Objects Counter, exported into the 3D ROI Manager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ollion et al., 2013</xref>) and visualized/animated with the 3D Viewer.</p><p>For studies with FGF-loaded beads, <italic>Fgf20</italic><sup>-/-</sup> dermises were used. A region within a 30 µm distance from the bead surface at its midsection was analyzed from confocal stacks for cell density and nuclear shape. Cell density was measured by manual counting from optical sections and nuclear shapes were derived from Hoechst33342 surfaces. Nuclear surfaces of cells surrounding the middle third of the bead height were used for analysis and cells at 0–15 µm and 15–30 µm distances from the bead surface were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Live confocal imaging and image analysis</title><p>E13.5 <italic>Sox2-EGFP;Fucci-mKO</italic> back skins were explanted into Trowell-type culture with DMEM/F12 (no phenol red), 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahtiainen et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, explants were allowed to recover a minimum of 2 hr after dissection and then imaged with Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope using HC PL APO 10x/0.4 objective and equipped with an incubation chamber (LifeImagingServices) to maintain 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere at 37°C. Confocal image stacks were acquired at 3.25 µm intervals with 10% laser power, 700 Hz scanning speed, and sub-optimal sampling every 20 min to minimize laser-induced damage.</p><p>Time-lapse videos were analyzed using Imaris software. Tissue drift was corrected by manually tracing a minimum of seven non-motile cells over time and using the software’s translational drift correction algorithm. Sox2-GFP+ cell movements were manually traced back in time based on Fucci-mKO signal for as long as cell tracking could be reliably done. DC center was determined as the center of the Sox2-GFP signal of the DC. Similar tracking was performed on interfollicular dermal fibroblasts around an arbitrary migration center.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript is very innovative and important report arising from the expert laboratory well-known by a number of excellent publications on mechanisms regulating the development of skin and its appendages. The manuscript contains a set of fundamental data shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the formation of mesenchymal component of the hair follicle – the follicular papilla. The authors demonstrate for the first time that mesenchymal cell condensate beneath the hair follicle placode is formed through directional migration of mesenchymal cells, which establish the follicular papilla fate via exiting the cell cycle and induction of a number of dermal condensate marker genes. The manuscript is excellently written and illustrated, data presented are solid and conclusions are well justified.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction and Discussion. p75 kD neurotrophin receptor needs to be included into the list of early markers of mesenchymal cell condensate, and the corresponding manuscript (PMID: 10588868) needs to be cited. Actually, p75NTR ablation result in upregulation of FGFR2 in the follicular papilla, thus providing a functional link between p75NTR and FGF signaling in mesenchymal cells.</p><p>2) Figure 2. To better substantiate the lack of potential contribution of Sox2<sup>+</sup> Schwann cells to mesenchymal condensate formation, the authors might wish to cite the data showing the lack of Schwann cells associated with nerve fibers in the E14.5 mouse dermis (PMID: 12012374).</p><p>3) Figures 4 and 6. The migration of epithelial cells is associated with increase of phalloidin immunostaining of endogenous actin filament network. Is there any chance to demonstrate such a network in fibroblasts participating in a formation of mesenchymal cell condensate?</p><p>4) The number of mice used for each experiment is not clearly reported (except for RNAseq analysis). Multiple placodes should be examined from multiple mice to account for variation between animals. Given the low number of total placodes examined, it seems likely that only a single animal was used for many experiments. Minor point. For most experiments, It was unclear as to the number of embryos data sets came from. In particular in Figure 4, the number of cells tracked seems low and it is unclear whether multiple follicles were tracked. Please provide n values for # cells in #placodes and #embryos.</p><p>5) Since the original Fucci color contrast is not as good as later versions of the mouse, an additional method should be used to validate cell cycle exit (such as phosphohistone H3 staining or a short chase after thymidine analogue administration).</p><p>6) Since SU5402 is a broad inhibitor (VEGFR2, FGFR1, PDGFRB), other controls are needed to demonstrate that the results from skin explant studies aren't a result of Pdgf or Vegf signaling or from other FGF molecules, especially because the% of Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells was decreased in response to SU5402 treatment.</p><p>7) An unresolved question is the timing and order of events in DC formation. From the data shown in Figures 2 and 3, it seems as though fibroblasts first move into the DC region via migration/aggregation, then turn on Sox2-expression and exit the cell cycle. Or do they exit the cell cycle, begin to migrate and then turn on Sox2 expression? Although the authors emphasize the advantage of using live imaging to document DC formation, it is only utilized in one experiment (Figure 4), but it would have allowed one to established the order of events in the process.</p><p>8) Figure 6 shows that addition of FGF to cultured fibroblasts is sufficient to increase the speed of migration, but whether this is true in vivo is unknown. The bead experiments are somewhat inconclusive – while beads coated with FGF are sufficient to induce expression of some target genes, the effect is too short-lived to monitor migration.</p><p>It appears that Fgf20 is sufficient to induce changes in cell density and cell shape in cells located adjacent to the bead. I'm concerned about the different bead sizes in control and experimental samples shown in Figure 6D and 6F – it seems bead circumference/surface area could affect local density and cell shape. Also, I believe the labels in Figure 6E are flipped. BSA has more cells/µm<sup>2</sup> than Fgf20according to the graph but the conclusion is that Fgf20increases the cell density.</p><p>9) Fgf20 in cell cycle exit. The data nicely show that Fgf20is required for p21 expression in vivo, but is it sufficient? If Fgf20-coated beads are embedded in Fucci dermis, is this sufficient to cause cell cycle exit?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36468.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction and Discussion. p75 kD neurotrophin receptor needs to be included into the list of early markers of mesenchymal cell condensate, and the corresponding manuscript (PMID: 10588868) needs to be cited.

We have mentioned p75NTR in the list of early markers of the dermal condensate in the Introduction, and cited the paper (second paragraph). It is interesting to note that p75NTR deletion results in Fgfr2 upregulation, and it certainly could be that ablation of Fgf20 results in p75NTR absence and Fgfr2 upregulation, however, we did not test either of these molecules and therefore do not wish to speculate on this connection in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2.

However, through the discovery of Fgf20 as an early marker of the hair follicle, and use of neurofilament marker 2H3 and Schwann cell precursor marker Sox2, we observe guard hair follicles already in E13.5 mouse skin with closely-associated nerve fibers decorated with faintly-stained Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells (see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, scale bar = 10 µm).

We have used Sox2-GFP to identify both DC cells and migrating DC cells and compared the actin network of those cells outside the DC to those non-DC fibroblasts. These data have been added as Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B. We observed an increase in the intensity of F-actin staining in the Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells outside the DC when compared to Sox2- non-DC fibroblasts, likely indicating their migratory status. Interestingly, we observed a yet higher intensity of F-actin staining in the Sox2<sup>+</sup> DC cells. We have further compared the intensity of phalloidin staining in the DC and compared it to the adjacent non-DC mesenchyme, and found that it was significantly increased in the DC at all stages examined in this study (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D). In our analysis of live tissue, these cells showed reduced mobility (Figure 4D, F) and it is a likely possibility that F-actin in these cells is involved in maintaining the 3D structure of the DC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The number of mice used for each experiment is not clearly reported (except for RNAseq analysis).

In addition, we have conducted 2h EdU pulses and quantified the percentage of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the Sox2<sup>+</sup> DC cell population. In placode stage I, on average 18% of Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells were EdU<sup>+</sup>, whereas at placode stages II-IV, very few EdU<sup>+</sup> cells were observed, in line with the Fucci data. The EdU data have been added to Figure 3 as panels F and G and in the Results (in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Since SU5402 is a broad inhibitor (VEGFR2, FGFR1, PDGFRB), other controls are needed to demonstrate that the results from skin explant studies aren't a result of Pdgf or Vegf signaling or from other FGF molecules, especially because the% of Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells was decreased in response to SU5402 treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this point. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values for SU5402 areas indicated in the table below. Based on our experience higher concentrations are needed for receptor inhibition in organ culture experiments. We used SU5402 at 20 µM to achieve the reported effect; at 10 µM we did not observe any effect on placode/DC formation (n= nine skins) (data not shown). The IC<sub>50</sub> values indicate that PDGFRβ inhibition is achieved with 17x greater concentration of SU5402 than FGFR inhibition. Further, conditional deletion of both PDGFRβ and PDGFRα in the developing dermis and specifically in the dermal condensate during hair follicle morphogenesis does not result in a phenotype (Rezza et al., 2015). Thus, we find it unlikely that the results would be caused by inhibition of Pdgf signaling.</p><p>We agree that the potential inhibition of Vegf signaling is a concern. Therefore, we utilized an inhibitor that is more specific to FGFR (BGJ398; see table below for IC<sub>50</sub> values) and found that similarly to SU5402, in E13.5 explants treated for 24h, no DCs developed and the placode pattern resembled the Fgf20-KO model. Furthermore, we used a VEGFR specific inhibitor (Cabozantinib, XL184). At a concentration equivalent to 20 µM SU5402 (based on IC<sub>50</sub> values), i.e., 50 nM, we found no effect on the DC formation or the epithelial pattern. Even the 5x higher concentration (250 nM) did not affect placode/DC formation. IC<sub>50</sub> values of the inhibitors and representative figures of these data are now available as Figure 7—figure supplements 2 and 3, respectively. Based on these data we conclude that the effect of SU5402 is due to inhibition of Fgfr signaling and provide confirmation of a role for FGF signaling in DC morphogenesis.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Reagent</td><td valign="top">FGFR1 IC<sub>50</sub></td><td valign="top">VEGFR2 IC<sub>50</sub></td><td valign="top">PDGFRβ IC<sub>50</sub></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">SU5402</td><td valign="top">30 nM</td><td valign="top">20 nM</td><td valign="top">510 nM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BGJ398</td><td valign="top">0.9 nM</td><td valign="top">180 nM</td><td valign="top">Not provided</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cabozantinib</td><td valign="top">5.294 µM</td><td valign="top">0.035 nM</td><td valign="top">Not provided</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) An unresolved question is the timing and order of events in DC formation. From the data shown in Figures2 and 3, it seems as though fibroblasts first move into the DC region via migration/aggregation, then turn on Sox2-expression and exit the cell cycle. Or do they exit the cell cycle, begin to migrate and then turn on Sox2 expression? Although the authors emphasize the advantage of using live imaging to document DC formation, it is only utilized in one experiment (Figure 4), but it would have allowed one to established the order of events in the process.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a very interesting question. Our initial pilot time-lapse experiments utilized Fucci G<sub>1</sub>, Fucci S/G<sub>2</sub>/M, and Sox2-GFP transgenes, however, we did not feel as though we could reliably distinguish the Sox2-GFP from the Azami Green in Fucci S/G<sub>2</sub>/M, in particular in cells expressing low levels of Sox2-GFP. Due to these technical challenges and given that these tissues are transgenic reporters, we are reluctant to make any strong conclusions regarding the order of events based on our time-lapse data.</p><p>To address this point, we have compared the percentage of Fucci-G<sub>1</sub> DC cells (i.e. Sox2-positive cells) in advancing placode stages (Figure 3B), and find that significantly fewer Sox2<sup>+</sup> DC cells are Fucci-G1 positive at placode stage I compared to later placode stages (p<sub>I vs II</sub> = 0.0211; p<sub>II vs III</sub> = 0.8303, p<sub>III vs IV</sub> = 0.1579). Further, our new EdU analysis in Sox2 expressing DC cells show similar results (new Figure 3F and G). Based on these data, we conclude that DC fate acquisition (assessed by Sox2 positivity) precedes cell cycle exit. We have added one sentence on this in Results, “Further, the percent non-proliferating cells in the stage I DC was significantly lower than the following stages (p<sub>IvsII</sub> = 0.0211), suggesting that DC fate acquisition occurs before cell cycle exit.” We hope to address this important question in future studies with more sophisticated tools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 6 shows that addition of FGF to cultured fibroblasts is sufficient to increase the speed of migration, but whether this is true in vivo is unknown.

Beads were randomly chosen for each experiment. We have retrospectively measured the diameter of all beads used in this experiment and we find no statistical difference between the FGF20- or FGF9-loaded beads and their controls. Bead diameters were (AVR ± S.D.): FGF20 = 87 ± 10µm, BSA (control for FGF20) = 85 ± 10µm, FGF9 = 87 ± 7µm and BSA (control for FGF9) = 86 ± 11µm. According to a paired two-tailed Student’s T-test, FGF20- and FGF9-loaded beads were not significantly different from their BSA controls (P<sup>FGF20-BSA</sup> = 0.736 and P<sup>FGF9-BSA</sup> = 0.923; n <sup>FGF20-BSA</sup> = 9 pairs, n <sup>FGF9-BSA</sup> = 7 pairs). We have changed the image in Figure 6D and F to better match the average size of the beads and to avoid any misunderstandings.</p><p>We apologize for the flip of the labels in Figure 6E. We have corrected the error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Fgf20 in cell cycle exit. The data nicely show that Fgf20 is required for p21 expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, but is it sufficient? If Fgf20-coated beads are embedded in Fucci dermis, is this sufficient to cause cell cycle exit?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we have performed additional 3h bead experiments on intact mesenchyme. Using p21 antibody, we did not observe any cells next to the bead that were positive. In addition to whole mount in situ hybridization, we also used a <sup>35</sup>S-labeled probe in sections and found no induction of p21 around FGF20 or FGF9-coated beads. No significant effect could be detected in percentage of Fucci-G1+ cells around FGF20 or FGF9 bead either. Thus, it appears that Fgf20 alone is insufficient to induce p21 and cell cycle exit and may require additional cues. Alternatively, the kinetics of p21 induction may be slower than that of the pathway feedback inhibitors such as Spry4 and Dusp6.</p></body></sub-article></article>
