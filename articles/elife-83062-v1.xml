cytokinetic ring (CR) to the plasma membrane (PM). Cdc15’s abilities to bind to the membrane and oligomerize via its F-BAR domain are inhibited by phosphorylation of its intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Multiple cell polarity kinases regulate Cdc15 IDR phosphostate, and of these the DYRK kinase Pom1 phosphorylation sites on Cdc15 have been shown in vivo to prevent CR formation at cell tips. Here, we compared the ability of Pom1 to control Cdc15 phosphostate and cortical localization to that of other Cdc15 kinases: Kin1, Pck1, and Shk1. We identified distinct but overlapping cohorts of Cdc15 phosphorylation sites targeted by each kinase, and the number of sites correlated with each kinases’ abilities to influence Cdc15 PM localization. Coarse-grained simulations predicted that cumulative IDR phosphorylation moves the IDRs of a dimer apart and toward the F-BAR tips. Further, simulations indicated that the overall negative charge of phosphorylation masks positively charged amino acids necessary for F-BAR oligomerization and membrane interaction. Finally, simulations suggested that dephosphorylated Cdc15 undergoes phase separation driven by IDR interactions. Indeed, dephosphorylated but not phosphorylated Cdc15 undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation to form droplets in vitro that recruit Cdc15 binding partners. In cells, Cdc15 phosphomutants also formed PM-bound condensates that recruit other CR components. Together, we propose that a threshold of Cdc15 phosphorylation by assorted kinases prevents Cdc15 condensation on the PM and antagonizes CR assembly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>F-BAR protein</kwd><kwd>fission yeast</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered region</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM136372</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vavylonis</surname><given-names>Dimitrios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM131799</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>Kathleen L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31GM119252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangione</surname><given-names>MariaSanta C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangione</surname><given-names>MariaSanta C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vavylonis</surname><given-names>Dimitrios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TG-MCB180021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vavylonis</surname><given-names>Dimitrios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical studies and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that dephosphroylation of F-BAR protein Cdc15 promotes cytokinesis ring assembly in yeast via conformation change of intrinsically disorder regions and condensate formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytokinesis is the final step in the cell division cycle that is achieved in many eukaryotes by employing an actin- and myosin-based cytokinetic ring (CR). CR assembly, constriction, and disassembly are each regulated and coordinated with other cell cycle events to protect genome integrity. Throughout cell division, the CR remains attached to the plasma membrane (PM) so that CR constriction results in PM apposition, fusion, and ultimately the physical separation of two daughter cells.</p><p>In the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</italic> the CR comprises approximately 40 proteins, including PM-bound scaffolds. One of these PM-binding proteins is the essential F-BAR protein Cdc15. Cdc15 is one of the first and most abundant components detected at the CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nurse et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fankhauser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu and Pollard, 2005</xref>). An N-terminal F-BAR domain oligomerizes, binds membranes, and binds the formin Cdc12 and the paxillin-related Pxl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carnahan and Gould, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDonald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willet et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Snider et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Snider et al., 2022</xref>). A C-terminal SH3 domain binds multiple CR components, including the C2 domain protein Fic1 and Pxl1 at a second binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cortés et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martín-García et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee et al., 2020</xref>). Between the F-BAR and SH3 domains is a long stretch of amino acids predicted to form an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) essential for Cdc15 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mangione et al., 2019</xref>). Reducing the amount of Cdc15, preventing Cdc15 membrane binding and/or oligomerization, or deleting the Cdc15 SH3 domain destabilizes the CR during anaphase and leads to cytokinesis failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDonald et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cdc15 functions are regulated by its phosphostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fankhauser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee et al., 2020</xref>). During interphase, Cdc15 is primarily cytosolic and hyperphosphorylated (≥35 phosphorylation sites). Dephosphorylation of Cdc15 at mitotic onset is accompanied by its re-localization to the medial cortex, oligomerization, and interaction with protein partners.</p><p>Three distinct polarity kinases (DYRK kinase Pom1, MARK/PAR-1 kinase Kin1, and p21-activated kinase Pak1/Shk1/Orb2) are implicated in regulating Cdc15 phosphostatus in vivo and are capable of phosphorylating Cdc15 directly in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kettenbach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>). The effect of Pom1 phosphorylation on Cdc15 is the best understood. Concentrated at the cortex of growing cell ends, Pom1 signals to antagonize CR formation and septation at cell tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Celton-Morizur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Padte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>) in part by phosphorylating Cdc15 and blocking Cdc15’s ability to bind membrane and Pxl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee et al., 2020</xref>). Considerably less is known about how Kin1 and Shk1 influence Cdc15, and it is not understood why three distinct polarity kinases would be used to modulate Cdc15 function. One possibility is that each kinase regulates different aspects of Cdc15 function since they are reported to phosphorylate largely nonoverlapping sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kettenbach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, the three kinases may modulate Cdc15’s properties similarly but each kinase is deployed with different spatial and temporal specificity. This idea is consistent with the distinct but overlapping localizations of Pom1, Kin1, and Shk1 at cell tips and the CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hachet and Simanis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To dissect the importance of deploying multiple kinases to regulate Cdc15, we determined the individual contributions of Pom1, Kin1, and Shk1. We established that the cohort of sites phosphorylated by each kinase overlaps and discovered that a fourth kinase, protein kinase C Pck1, modulates Cdc15 phosphostate in vivo and phosphorylates Cdc15 directly in vitro. All four kinases affected Cdc15 membrane localization in a manner that correlated with the number of targeted phosphorylation sites. Coarse grain molecular dynamics simulations indicated that phosphorylation impacts the organization of the IDRs relative to the F-BAR domain within a dimer, with increasing phosphorylation promoting separation of the two IDRs and their clustering around F-BAR domain tips. Simulations also suggested that dephosphorylation might promote IDR-mediated liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). Using in vitro biochemical assays, we confirmed that IDR phosphorylation state governed Cdc15’s ability to form droplets and recruit binding partners into them. In accord with in vitro studies, Cdc15 phosphomutants formed cortical condensates that recruited other CR components within cells. Overall, our data indicate that Cdc15 condenses on the membrane and scaffolds CR components, and this function is controlled by limiting Cdc15 phosphorylation with spatiotemporal precision.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multiple polarity kinases modulate Cdc15 phosphostatus</title><p>When examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, the phosphorylated forms of Cdc15 migrate slowly and heterogeneously to generate a broad band that can be collapsed to a single band by phosphatase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Despite the many sites Pom1 targets in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kettenbach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee et al., 2020</xref>), we observed only a modest change in Cdc15 SDS-PAGE mobility in <italic>pom1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee et al., 2020</xref>).

To do this, we used <italic>pom1</italic>(T778G) (<italic>pom1<sup>as1</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Padte et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>kin1</italic>(F220G) (<italic>kin1<sup>as1</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cadou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) to inhibit Pom1 and Kin1 kinase activity using the ATP analog 3MB-PP1. We observed small increases in Cdc15 SDS-PAGE mobility when either kinase was individually inhibited and an additive increase when both kinases were inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, this increase in mobility did not match the extent of dephosphorylation observed for the Pom1 site mutant, Cdc15-22A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To rule out that inhibitor treatment of the <italic>kin1<sup>as1</sup></italic> mutant was unable to abrogate Kin1 activity, we examined Cdc15 phosphorylation state in <italic>kin1∆</italic> compared to <italic>cdc15-22A</italic>. Again, we found modest change in Cdc15 mobility in <italic>kin1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also found that Kin1 loss did not significantly change the migration of Cdc15-22A, which, as we showed previously, is still phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee et al., 2020</xref>).

For the HPS model, dephosphorylated Cdc15 IDR is relatively collapsed and undergoes progressive expansion with increased phosphorylation, which is more pronounced for the Pom1 and fully phosphorylated cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). In simulations that show the coil to globule transition with increasing temperature, we found that the phosphorylation-induced relative change in R<sub>G</sub> is maximal near room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the KH D model, although the change in IDR size was smaller and the coil-to-globule transition happened at higher temperatures compared to HPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C and D</xref>). In order to determine the effect of the phosphorylation charge on these results, we simulated the fully phosphorylated case with –1.5e charge per phosphorylation, instead of –2e, for both models (the average value can vary between –1e and –2e at neutral pH based on the residues measured pKa values; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bienkiewicz and Lumb, 1999</xref>). The expansion is commensurate with net charge added by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>), in agreement with the diagram of states of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Das and Pappu, 2013</xref> that predicts an increase in negative charge due to phosphorylation would cause the Cdc15 IDR to transition from a collapsed globule or tadpole closer to a random coil, hairpin or chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cdc15 IDR undergoes phosphoregulated phase separation</title><p>The collapse of the dephosphorylated IDRs into a medial globule in our dimer simulations and the relatively compact size of the single dephosphorylated IDR simulations suggest the possibility that the dephosphorylated Cdc15 IDR regions undergo phase separation with other Cdc15 dimers and/or other CR proteins.

Cdc15 is phosphoregulated in a cell cycle-specific manner, but how individual kinases contribute to this regulation and precisely how phosphorylation affects Cdc15 properties have not been clear. We presented evidence that progressive phosphorylation drives separation of the Cdc15 IDR regions, which antagonizes Cdc15 phase separation, condensate formation on the PM, and recruitment of other CR proteins. Leveraging a suite of Cdc15 protein kinases during interphase appears to ensure sufficient Cdc15 phosphorylation that CR assembly begins only at the proper place and time. More broadly, our work suggests phase separation as a mechanism involved in CR assembly.</p><p>The first detailed study of Cdc15 phosphorylation focused on phosphorylation sites that could be targeted by the Cdc14 family phosphatase, Clp1, and those matching a 14-3-3 binding site; this study estimated that ~35 sites within Cdc15 could be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2010</xref>). Subsequently, several kinases have been identified to affect Cdc15 phosphostatus, and 74 sites of Cdc15 phosphorylation have been reported from MS-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kettenbach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Swaffer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris et al., 2022</xref>). Based on gel shifts, the mutant generated in this study, Cdc15-31A, appears to be minimally phosphorylated compared to wild type protein. We reason therefore that the total number of Cdc15 phosphorylation sites is closer to 35 than 74 and that there are probably a number of mis-identified sites arising from the technical ambiguity of site assignment in peptides containing multiple potential phosphorylation sites. Indeed, there were numerous differences in the sites we identified for the polarity kinases compared to MS only-based studies. However, that Cdc15-31A retains some in vivo phosphorylation points to the existence of still another protein kinase(s) involved in Cdc15 phosphoregulation that contributes a unique set of targeted residues.</p><p>Given these technical challenges, it has been unclear exactly which Cdc15 sites each kinase phosphorylates and whether they affect the protein similarly. Our results indicate that there is little if any cooperativity or antagonism among the kinases and point to the total charge added or removed from the IDR as the most significant regulatory factor. The only specificity we found is the number of sites that can be phosphorylated by each kinase, assigned using a combination of technical approaches that is more accurate than an MS only-based approach. Our simulation results suggest that a certain threshold of phosphorylation must be reached to elicit a major change in IDR organization and IDR-IDR interaction, and we reason that there is an inherent limitation to how any single kinase can affect Cdc15 structure and function. This may explain why so many protein kinases are involved in Cdc15 phosphoregulation, particularly given its high intracellular concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu and Pollard, 2005</xref>). Pom1, Kin1, and Shk1 share additional substrates involved in cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>), so they may control other CR components in concert with Cdc15 to maximally affect CR position and dynamics. Interestingly, while preventing Cdc15 phosphorylation with the Cdc15-31A mutant speeds up cytokinesis, consistent with more myosin II being recruited to the CR at an earlier time, our work demonstrates that re-phosphorylation of Cdc15 is not required for CR constriction or cell separation and that Cdc15 need not be removed from the membrane to allow cytokinesis to proceed. Rather, the phosphorylation of Cdc15 helps prevent incorrect division site placement.</p><p>We previously hypothesized that Cdc15’s conformation was regulated by its phosphostate based on the observations that a site-specific protease cleaved only phosphorylated Cdc15, the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms behaved very differently by analytical ultracentrifugation, and only dephosphorylated Cdc15 appeared filamentous by negative-stain EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2010</xref>). In this work, we studied Cdc15 conformation computationally using coarse-grained molecular dynamics. While such methods lack the detail needed to predict local features such as secondary structure, they are well suited to address phenomena driven by thermodynamic forces representing averages over disordered configurations, such as in LLPS, macromolecular crowding, and relationship between single-chain systems and aggregate behaviors. All-atom simulations provide the highest molecular resolution but suffer from limited sampling when investigating IDR properties even when making use of state-of-the-art methods and computational resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shea et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our simulations demonstrate how Cdc15 undergoes a large conformational change upon changing levels of phosphorylation. This behavior reflects the tunability of its IDR, the amino acid sequence of which places it at a transition point between a collapsed globule and an expanded coil. The large size of the IDR and number of phosphorylation sites together with our results using two different coarse-grained potentials (HPS and KH D) indicate that this large reorganization of the IDR is a robust phenomenon. The sharpness of the predicted transition as a function of degree of phosphorylation, however, may depend on uncertainties in coarse-grained interaction potentials: the models used here have not been tuned to reproduce IDR-globular interactions and considered IDRs less than 300 amino acids long, while the Cdc15 IDR is greater than 500 amino acids long. In the HPS model, the stronger pairwise interaction between the IDR and globular region assists in bringing the IDRs together, while the pairwise interactions weakened in the KH D model by SASA scaling leads to weaker IDR-globular interactions and a more abrupt transition (reflected in KH D simulations that are harder to equilibrate). While our simulations have refined our understanding of phospho-regulated Cdc15 conformational changes, other binding interactions of dephosphorylated Cdc15, such as with formin Cdc12, Pxl1, and calcineurin, or itself upon oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDonald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willet et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mangione et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Snider et al., 2020</xref>) may extend or reinforce the conformational changes predicted by simulations of the Cdc15 dimer alone.</p><p>Similar to Cdc15 condensation into droplets in vitro, Cdc15 alanine phosphomutants and Cdc15 in strains subjected to kinase inhibition form cortical condensates in vivo, the number and size of which are controlled by the extent of Cdc15 phosphorylation. These puncta also exhibit some liquid-like properties, apparently undergoing fusion and fission events. Further, we observed here and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2010</xref>) that Cdc15 cortical condensates recruit other CR components, and within the CR, Cdc15 has been observed in node-like structures by super-resolution imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laplante et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McDonald et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that CR assembly involves condensation of a key membrane-bound scaffold, analogous to what occurs at other actin-based structures such as sites of endocytosis in yeast and focal adhesions in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Day et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Case et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kozak and Kaksonen, 2022</xref>).</p><p>In wildtype cells, CRs form from cortical cytokinetic nodes that coalesce into the CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pollard and Wu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Willet et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rincon and Paoletti, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pollard and O’Shaughnessy, 2019</xref>). Cytokinetic node assembly begins with the anillin-related protein Mid1 arriving at the cortex and becoming stably anchored there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Clifford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Coffman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akamatsu et al., 2014</xref>). Then, other proteins including Cdc15 are recruited to Mid1 nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>). Like Cdc15, Mid1 contains a long IDR subject to multisite phosphorylation by a collection of kinases that control its localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bähler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paoletti and Chang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rincon and Paoletti, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Willet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almonacid et al., 2011</xref>) and the Mid1 N-terminus undergoes phase separation to form droplets in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chatterjee and Pollard, 2019</xref>).

However, Mid1 leaves the CR as it constricts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2003</xref>) and CRs can form in the absence of Mid1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sohrmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). FRAP analyses indicate that there are both dynamic and immobile populations of Cdc15 in the CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Clifford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDonald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kamnev et al., 2021</xref>). It is thus possible that initial Cdc15 condensates develop into more stable structures if assembled with Mid1 or other proteins.</p><p>Considering our results and the large number of proteins involved in cytokinetic nodes and the CR that involve IDRs with multiple phosphorylation sites, it is intriguing to speculate that phosphorylation pathways drive transitions in nanoscale organization of cytokinetic nodes and contractile ring anchoring by pushing the multicomponent cytokinesis system across condensation, de-mixing, or evaporation phase boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacobs and Frenkel, 2017</xref>), with Cdc15 playing a central role. Interactions with charged lipids, lipid domains on the PM, as well as membrane curvature could also feed into these processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast methods</title><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> lists <italic>S. pombe</italic> strains used in this study.

The first macro subtracted the background and sum projects the slices. A second macro utilized the '3D Object Counter' plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>) to measure 3D-object fluorescence intensity of mNG-Cdc15 assemblies along with mNG-Cdc15 total cell fluorescence. The settings for the 3D Object Counter plugin were as follows: the intensity threshold was set to 500, the minimum voxel size was 5, and the maximum size was set as 20,000. The cytoplasmic signal was calculated by subtracting the 3D object intensity from whole-cell intensity. The 3D object intensity was then divided by the cytoplasmic signal to generate the final ratio.</p><p>Quantifications of Cdc15 condensate size and number in cells were performed on deconvolved, max-projected grayscale images. Maximal and minimal threshold pixel intensities were fixed using <italic>cdc15-31A</italic> cells and those thresholds were made constant through the analyses of all strains.

Cells were loaded into Y04C plates for 5 s at 8 psi, and YES liquid medium flowed into the chamber at 5 psi throughout the time-lapse. Images were acquired every 2 min with 0.5 μm optical spacing. Time-lapse images were deconvolved with 10 iterations and visualized as maximum projections. Images used for fluorescence quantification were not deconvolved.

All quantifications were performed on non-deconvolved, sum projected images. For all intensity measurements, the background intensity was subtracted. The background intensity was determined by taking a measurement in an area of the image without cells. The raw intensity of the background was divided by its area, which was multiplied by the area of the intensity measurement of interest.

Phase separation was induced by treatment with λ-phosphatase (NEB; P0753L) and dilution to physiological salt concentration (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl final) in the presence or absence of a crowding agent (5% PEG, average molecular weight 3350; Sigma; P4338). For solution assays, the resultant Cdc15-IDR-SH3 concentration ranged from 5 to 50 μM and 5–10 μl was added to a glass coverslip that had been thoroughly cleaned with isopropanol and imaged on the DeltaVision microscope system described above. Droplets were considered to be phase separated if they showed liquid-like properties (visible rapid fusion events) and were dynamic (rapid recovery in a FRAP assay). Phase diagrams at different concentrations of salt and protein were determined within 5 min of phosphatase treatment.</p><p>For LLPS assays of Cdc15-IDR-SH3 with Fic1 and/or Pxl1 peptide in solution, 10 μM of each were mixed and the final salt concentration was diluted to 150 mM NaCl in the presence of 5% PEG before addition of λ-phosphatase. Full-length Cdc15-E30K,E152K, Fic1, Pxl1 peptide, and Cdc12 peptide were combined at 10 μM and diluted to a final concentration of 250 mM NaCl in the presence of 5% PEG before the addition of λ-phosphatase.

The resultant pellet was hydrated in lipid buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM TCEP) for 30 min, vortexed gently, and then frozen and thawed 10 times. The liposome sample was passed through a filter with an extruder 10 times to obtain small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). Prior to the experiment, coverslips and glass slides were thoroughly washed with 6 M NaOH and water followed by 70% ethanol. Clean glass slides and cover slips were then equilibrated in lipid buffer. A homemade chamber was constructed using the coverslips, double-sided tape, and glass slides. 10–15 μl of SUVs were added to the chamber and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow SUVs to settle onto the glass and fuse to form the bilayer. Bilayers were washed three times with lipid buffer and blocked with lipid buffer containing 0.1% BSA for 30 min. Then, fluorescently labeled His-Cdc15-IDR was added in the range of 5–50 µM to the bilayer and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr.

In each case, pairwise interactions are modeled by Lennard–Jones-type potentials with a 3σ cutoff. We used an electrostatic screening length of 10 Å, and uniform dielectric constant 80 for electrostatic interactions of charged residues. Pairwise interactions for phosphorylated resides for the HPS model are as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perdikari et al., 2021</xref>. For the KH model that has not been parameterized for phosphorylation, phosphorylated serine and threonine are treated as aspartic acid pair interactions, while charge and interaction radii are updated from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perdikari et al., 2021</xref> to match the HPS model.</p><p>We represent the known structure of the F-BAR dimer (PDB 6XJ1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Snider et al., 2020</xref>) and the Alphafold predicted structure of the Cdc15 SH3 (AF-Q09822-F1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) as rigid bodies using the fix rigid command in LAMMPS. All other residues of the Cdc15 sequence are represented as beads connected to their neighbors with harmonic bonds with a 3.81 Å equilibrium length and a 378 kcal/(mol Å<sup>2</sup>) spring constant. For all HPS model simulations and for the KH model single-chain IDR simulations, we implemented the non-bonded pairwise potential using continuous piecewise LAMMPS potentials as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2021</xref> (code available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/aah217/KH_LAMMPS">https://github.com/aah217/KH_LAMMPS</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/aah217/HPS_LAMMPS">https://github.com/aah217/HPS_LAMMPS</ext-link>). We performed these simulations with the following versions of LAMMPS: '18 Apr 2015,' '21 Jul 2020,' '29 Oct 2020,' and '10 Mar 2021.' As the KH model D scales non-bonded pairwise interactions based on the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of a residue relative to a free chain, we implemented this functionality in LAMMPS version '29 Sep 2021 - Update 1' as a custom potential utilizing code provided by Jeetain Mittal. We set the SASA-based value to 1.0 for all residues not in rigid bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dignon et al., 2018</xref>), and as calculated at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://curie.utmb.edu/getarea.html">http://curie.utmb.edu/getarea.html</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fraczkiewicz and Braun, 1998</xref>) for residues in the F-BAR or SH3 structures.

Simulations were carried out in the NVT ensemble through the use of the NVE integrator and a Langevin thermostat with a 1 ps<sup>–1</sup> frictional coefficient.</p><p>IDR simulations were initialized in one of two ways. For the dephosphorylated case using the HPS model, the system was started in a straight-line configuration in which the amino acids were spaced 3.81 Å apart on one axis. All other simulations were started using a semi-relaxed configuration of the IDR with an R<sub>G</sub> of 6.53 nm. Individual trajectories were run long enough for R<sub>G</sub> to fluctuate around an average value, with individual trajectory durations ranging from 500 ns to greater than 10 µs, with higher temperature simulations running for longer times due to computational efficiency, and between 6 and 8 trajectories for each case. For trajectories that started from a specified initial condition, as opposed to continuations, an autocorrelation function was fit to the R<sub>G</sub> versus time data to calculate the relaxation time. Data up to twice the relaxation time were excluded from calculating the measured R<sub>G</sub> values calculated and reported. All remaining R<sub>G</sub> versus time data for a particular case were split into five equal parts, the mean calculated for each part, and the standard deviation of the five means is reported as the error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>.</p><p>To initialize full dimer simulations, two straight-line IDRs were placed with the amino acid next in sequence from the F-BAR dimer placed 3.81 Å from its neighbor on the F-BAR dimer with IDRs extending away from one another. Each bead in the IDR was spaced 3.81 Å apart. An SH3 domain was connected at the end of each IDR. A first pass relaxation was performed in LAMMPS for 10 ns with the spring constant reduced to 0.378 kcal/(mol Å<sup>2</sup>) and using the fix deform command to shrink the box size, and the relative spacing of its contents (excluding those fixed rigid), by a factor of 10. Follow-up simulations of 10 ns were performed to progressively increase the spring constant back to that defined by the model, making use of the nve/limit command in LAMMPs, which imposes a maximum distance that beads can travel from one timestep to the next. This method of relaxation resulted in the configuration used in the IDRs started apart simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For the IDRs interacting initial condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), a short simulation was performed following from the previous steps in which a force of sufficient strength was applied continuously to each SH3 in the direction of the opposite side of the F-BAR, causing the SH3s to cross the F-BAR dimer midplane. Follow-up simulations were performed to relax the IDRs in the new configuration using steps similar to the IDRs-apart relaxation. For the reported IDR COM separation data, an autocorrelation function was fit to calculate the relaxation time away from the initial condition and data up to twice the relaxation time was not included.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Calculations of mean, standard error of the mean (SEM), and statistical significance were performed with Prism 6.0 or Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Mohan Balasubramanian) and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The 2 referees (referred to as referees 1 and 2) are very supportive but have raised a number of points for clarification and I would like you to consider and fix as many as possible since these are largely about data presentation and improving clarity.</p><p>The two key experiments that I see as essential are mentioned below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. As suggested above, phase separation of purified Cdc15-31A will provide strong evidence that the sites identified are physiologically involved in phase separation. Moreover, it would be useful to show if these mutants undergoing phase separation also recruit cytokinetic proteins.</p><p>2. In figure 4 the authors show that Cdc15-31A mutants prolong ring formation and decrease the time of ring constriction. They also claim that the time of ring maturation is decreased. However, it is well documented that altering the time of ring formation can inversely alter the time of ring maturation since ring maturation depends on the cells' ability to form a septum. A better way to describe the changes in the timing of cytokinetic events is to use the duplication of the spindle pole body marker as the starting event instead of using the completion of ring formation as a marker given that ring formation is itself impacted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Some of the immunoblotting shown in this manuscript is not clear in demonstrating the phosphorylation status of Cdc15. Due to the technical limitation, it is understandable. Comparing the IP samples and lysate sample (only shown in B), I assume the lysate blot seems better to demonstrate the mobility shift (presumably due to dephosphorylation or degradation during IP?). Could the authors show F and G using the lysate samples to improve the quality of the blot?</p><p>The mobility is less evident in the blots, so they should be enlarged in the figure panels to help readers. I recommend that this figure should only show the enlarged blot of analog-sensitive (AS) mutants, and the panels for temperature-sensitive or deletion mutants should be moved to supplemental figure 1.</p><p>Panel (A) is the same experiment as the left two lanes of the panel (C), so this could be excluded from the figure or moved to supplemental figure 1.</p><p>There are multiple bands in the blots. It is not clear which bands correspond to Cdc15/phosphor-Cdc15. Could the author indicate the target bands?</p><p>The bottom bands are not shown correctly in panel (B) α-tubulin blot. The author should show which bands correspond to α-tubulin used as the loading control of the experiment. If the bottom bands correspond to α-tubulin, this blot has to be replaced with the one showing all the bands clearly.</p><p>For the AS mutant experiments, it would be better to ensure that the kinase activity is inhibited.

I recommend that the authors indicate them using arrowheads.</p><p>(B) showed that the 19D mutant got less phosphorylation by Shk1/Pck1 than the 19A mutant. This suggests that Pom1-mediated phosphorylation inhibits Shk1/Pck1 to phosphorylate Cdc15. This supports the data shown in Figure 2, but the data is not discussed in the main text. The author should discuss the results if they include this result in this paper.</p><p>Figure 2</p><p>It may be helpful for readers to see schematics of the design of Cdc15C truncations.</p><p>Figure 4</p><p>I recommend that authors replace the bar graph with a swarm plot or violin plot, which gives readers variance in the data.</p><p>(A and B) The intensity of the Cdc15-mNG on the ring can be normalized by whole cell intensity.</p><p>In the right panel of A, the intensity can be plotted against the ring diameter.</p><p>(C) The same as A, the intensity of Rlc1-mCherry on the contractile ring can be normalized by whole cell intensity. For the right panel of C, the fluorescent intensity of the ring should be plotted against the ring diameter.</p><p>Figure 5</p><p>I recommend that authors replace the bar graph with a swarm plot or violin plot, which gives readers variance in the data.</p><p>Figure 7</p><p>(F) It is unclear how authors quantify the fluorescent intensity of the edge and center of condensate.

Although the BAR domain is not present in this construct, this must be clearly stated in the main text and figure legend to avoid confusion because Cdc15 is a well-known membrane-bound protein.</p><p>(G) should be His-Cdc15-IDR-SH3 rather than Cdc15-IDR-SH3.</p><p>Figure 8</p><p>(A) the bottom panel, the condensate shows the non-uniform distribution of the fluorescent, which is inconsistent with the author's conclusion from Figures 7 E and F.

Could they show the ratio in the main figure? This should be discussed carefully in the manuscript. In my understanding, the author reconstitutes the Cdc15 condensation using equimolar protein concentration. It would be interesting to conduct the same experiment under the physiological molar ratio of these proteins.</p><p>Figure 8 -supplemental 2</p><p>I cannot see the images.

If the measurement is conducted in inconsistent ways, the author cannot prove the equimolar concentration in their experiments. And I have a little concern about their protein preparation.

In such a case, the concentration measurement using Nanodrop (absorbance of 280 nm light) may not be reliable.</p><p>Quantification of mNG-Cdc15 PM to cytoplasmic ratio</p><p>Line 695 – 697</p><p>This section should have more description of the 2nd macro they used.

If they use Nanodrop, the protein sample should not have degradations and contaminants and the absorbance of 280 nm light on the fluorophore must be subtracted for the calculation.</p><p>Using amin-reactive dyes, labelling efficiency cannot be measured properly if there are multiple Lys in the protein. Exposed Lys residues would be labeling sites and it is difficult to control the labelling ratio in such cases.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very well-written paper that provides a deep mechanistic understanding of how phosphorylation of intrinsically disordered regions can prevent phase separation and consequent protein function.

Also, Figure 8—figure supplement 2 is very hard to follow. The figure is too dark and the signal contrast is barely visible but upon zooming in, I was able to see dots. Inverting the image would help with the lack of contrast. This figure also misses a scale bar.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83062.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1.

Moreover, it would be useful to show if these mutants undergoing phase separation also recruit cytokinetic proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern seems to be based on two misunderstandings. First, the method of producing and purifying phosphorylated Cdc15 was not well-described in the first version of the manuscript. This has been corrected. To elaborate, in order to purify Cdc15 from bacteria for LLPS assays, it must be co-produced with one of its kinases. Otherwise, it is not phosphorylated and it is not soluble. Thus, the proposed experiment of using recombinant Cdc15-31A is technically not possible. For the experiments presented in this paper, we co-produced Cdc15 with Pom1 to obtain the phosphorylated form of Cdc15. Pom1 phosphorylates 22 of the 31 sites mutated in the 31A mutant; these sites were identified in previous work and they are physiologically relevant in vivo (Bhattacharjee et al., 2020). Second, a major finding of this work is that no single site is by itself enough to govern Cdc15 conformation, but rather that Cdc15 conformation depends mainly on the net charge. We have shown here and previously (Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2010) that Cdc15 phosphomutants of variable number of sites and position within the protein form condensates of various number and size in vivo that recruit other cytokinetic proteins and the effect correlates strictly with phosphorylation site number rather than localization on the protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Duplication of the spindle pole body marker was used as the starting event to measure ring formation. We had initially measured this phase beginning with node formation as described, but these experiments were repeated using the SPB as marker, and we missed updating the text in line with the data. The data presented are correct, the text was not, and the text has been corrected.</p><p>Although there are instances in which the time of ring formation can inversely alter the time of ring maturation, this is not always the case. Please see Willet et al., 2015; Bhattacharjee et al., 2020 for two examples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Some of the immunoblotting shown in this manuscript is not clear in demonstrating the phosphorylation status of Cdc15.

This paper is very well suited for eLife. I have some suggestions mentioned below that will further strengthen the paper.</p><p>1. As suggested above, phase separation of purified Cdc15-31A will provide strong evidence that the sites identified are physiologically involved in phase separation. Moreover, it would be useful to show if these mutants undergoing phase separation also recruit cytokinetic proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern seems to be based on two misunderstandings. First, the method of producing and purifying phosphorylated Cdc15 was not well-described in the first version of the manuscript. This has been corrected. To elaborate, in order to purify Cdc15 from bacteria for LLPS assays, it must be co-produced with one of its kinases. Otherwise, it is not phosphorylated and it is not soluble. Thus, the proposed experiment of using recombinant Cdc15-31A is technically not possible. For the experiments presented in this paper, we co-produced Cdc15 with Pom1 to obtain the phosphorylated form of Cdc15. Pom1 phosphorylates 22 of the 31 sites mutated in the 31A mutant; these sites were identified in previous work and they are physiologically relevant in vivo (Bhattacharjee et al., 2020). Second, a major finding of this work is that no single site is by itself enough to govern Cdc15 conformation, but rather that Cdc15 conformation depends mainly on the net charge. We have shown here and previously (Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2010) that Cdc15 phosphomutants of variable number of sites and position within the protein form condensates of various number and size in vivo that recruit other cytokinetic proteins and the effect correlates strictly with phosphorylation site number rather than localization on the protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In figure 4 the authors show that Cdc15-31A mutants prolong ring formation and decrease the time of ring constriction. They also claim that the time of ring maturation is decreased. However, it is well documented that altering the time of ring formation can inversely alter the time of ring maturation since ring maturation depends on the cells' ability to form a septum. A better way to describe the changes in the timing of cytokinetic events is to use the duplication of the spindle pole body marker as the starting event instead of using the completion of ring formation as a marker given that ring formation is itself impacted.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see responses above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Also, Figure 8—figure supplement 2 is very hard to follow. The figure is too dark and the signal contrast is barely visible but upon zooming in, I was able to see dots. Inverting the image would help with the lack of contrast. This figure also misses a scale bar.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. Figure 8—figure supplement 2 contained all of the negative controls so they are indeed all blank. We have altered our figure presentation to include the negative controls alongside the positive results in new Figures 8 and 9.</p></body></sub-article></article>
