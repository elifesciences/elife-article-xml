BMAT acts as an endocrine organ and energy storage depot and has the potential to contribute to the regulation of metabolism, hematopoiesis, and bone homeostasis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scheller et al., 2016b</xref>). The development and subsequent regulation of bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds) varies between skeletal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scheller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Craft et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheller and Rosen, 2014a</xref>), and current work suggests that BMAds are functionally unique within the context of their niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Robles et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, the constitutive BMAT (cBMAT) begins to form in distal regions at or slightly before birth, followed by rapid expansion and maturation early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheller and Rosen, 2014a</xref>). By contrast, the regulated BMAT (rBMAT) develops later and expands with age, generally in areas of active hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheller and Rosen, 2014a</xref>). Recent studies in rodents and humans have also highlighted the heterogeneous metabolic properties of BMAds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scheller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attané et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that their capacity for functional support of surrounding cells may change, particularly with age and in states of systemic disease. BMAT expansion occurs in diverse conditions including anorexia, obesity, aging, osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, estrogen deficiency, and treatment with pharmacotherapies such as glucocorticoids and thiazolidinediones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scheller et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fazeli et al., 2013</xref>). Many of these conditions are associated with increased fracture risk. Thus, understanding the context-specific origins and functions of BMAds has important implications for the development of clinical and pharmacologic strategies to support skeletal and metabolic health.</p><p>Genetic causes of lipodystrophy have provided clues about the molecular differences between BMAT and white adipose tissues (WAT) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheller and Rosen, 2014a</xref>). Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a disorder characterized by complete loss of peripheral adipose tissues and is associated with secondary complications including hypertriglyceridemia, osteosclerosis, insulin resistance, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheller and Rosen, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiorenza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Teboul-Coré et al., 2016</xref>). Patients with CGL uniformly lack WAT; however, BMAT is selectively preserved in those with CGL resulting from mutations in <italic>CAV1</italic> (CGL3) or <italic>PTRF</italic> (CGL4), but not <italic>AGPAT2</italic> (CGL1) or <italic>BSCL2</italic> (CGL2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheller and Rosen, 2014a</xref>). Similarly, all BMAT is retained in <italic>Cav1</italic> knockout mice, and cBMAT is present in <italic>Ptrf</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheller et al., 2015</xref>). These results in humans and mice suggest that, unlike WAT, BMAT has unique compensatory mechanisms that promote its preservation. In this study, to define the cellular basis for this observation, we examined the formation and regulation of BMAT in the ‘fat-free’ (FF) <italic>Adipoq-Cre+</italic>, <italic>Rosa26-lsl-DTA+</italic> (Adipoq<sup>Cre+/DTA+</sup>) mouse, a novel genetic model of CGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the FF mouse, any cell that expresses adiponectin (<italic>Adipoq</italic>-Cre+) will express diphtheria toxin A (DTA), leading to DTA-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ivanova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Voehringer et al., 2008</xref>). Adiponectin is a secreted adipokine that is expressed by all brown, white, and BMAT adipocytes in healthy mice, independent of sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craft et al., 2019</xref>). Expression of adiponectin also defines the major BMAd progenitor, termed ‘Adipo-CAR’ cells (adipogenic CXCL12-abundant reticular) or ‘MALP’ (marrow adipogenic lineage precursor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsushita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>). In the FF mouse, we hypothesized that ablation of adiponectin-expressing cells would promote activation of alternate, adiponectin-negative skeletal progenitors to form adipocytes in vivo in times of systemic metabolic demand. To test this hypothesis, we performed adiponectin lineage tracing of bone marrow stromal cells and BMAds. We also analyzed age- and sex-associated changes in bone, BMAT, and peripheral adipose tissues in control and FF mice. In addition, we defined the impact of adrenergic stimulation and peripheral fat transplantation on the formation and regulation of BMAT in the FF model. Lastly, we created a triple mutant fat-free mouse with an integrated mTmG lineage reporter to explore the origins and molecular features of this unique BMAd population. This work refines our understanding of the origins and adaptations of BMAT with age and disease and defines compensatory pathways of adipocyte formation that are unique to the bone marrow and emerge in states of compromised progenitor function and altered lipid load.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adiponectin is expressed by BMAT adipocytes and a subset of stromal progenitor cells</title><p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craft et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> (Cre+)<italic>, Rosa26-lsl-mTmG</italic> (mTmG+) (Adipoq<sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup>) lineage tracing reporter mice were used to localize adiponectin-expressing cell lineages within the skeletal niche.

Cross-sections of the proximal tibia and tail vertebrae were imaged at 3 and 16 weeks of age in both males and females after immunostaining for green fluorescent protein (GFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP), and perilipin 1 (PLIN1). Adipoq<sup>Cre-/mTmG+</sup> littermates were used as a negative control. In Adipoq<sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup> male mice, this work confirmed that membrane-localized GFP expression was present in all PLIN1+, rBMAT adipocytes within the proximal tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Prevalent GFP labeling of reticular stromal cells and bone lining cells was also noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). GFP expression was absent in hematopoietic cells, chondrocytes, and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, the cells lining the endosteal bone surface were predominantly GFP/<italic>Adipoq</italic> negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In negative controls, all cells within the bone, including adipocytes and bone-lining cells, stained positive for RFP and negative for GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Comparable patterns of GFP expression were observed in the proximal tibia of Adipoq<sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup> female mice at both 3 and 16 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and data not shown). In the tail vertebrae, <italic>Adipoq</italic>-Cre traced all PLIN1+ cBMAT adipocytes independent of sex or age, as indicated by GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether adiponectin was expressed by the BMAT progenitor cell, we isolated primary bone marrow stromal cells from the femur and tibia of 16 week old male Adipoq<sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup> mice for colony-forming unit (CFU) assays. After 2 weeks of expansion ex vivo, an average of 79.8 ± 9.0% of CFUs were completely positive for adiponectin, as indicated by expression of membrane-bound GFP in 100% of the fibroblast-appearing progenitor cells within the colony, 16.5 ± 9.1% of CFUs were negative (RFP+ only) and 3.7 ± 0.3% were mixed, containing both GFP+ and RFP+ fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Within these transitional colonies, cells with RFP+ membranes, indicative of their lack of adiponectin expression, routinely contained GFP+ cytoplasmic granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This was often near to cells that had already become fully GFP+ (<italic>Adipoq</italic>-Cre+), suggesting that adiponectin expression is activated at later stages of stromal progenitor maturation. Small, RFP+, myeloid-lineage cells were commonly present, particularly around the edges of the plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These cells did not form colonies, did not have a fibroblastic morphology, and thus were not considered in our analyses. Spontaneous adipogenesis, as indicated by the presence of PLIN1+ lipid droplets, occurred on average in 18.5 ± 1.4% of CFUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). This included 30 of the 166 total colonies examined across three independent mice. Comparable to what was observed in Adipoq<sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup> mice in vivo, PLIN1+ lipid droplets were only present in GFP+ cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). In negative controls, RFP+ stromal cells and PLIN1+ adipocytes were observed without the presence of GFP+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that all BMAds and their progenitor cells express adiponectin in healthy conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Adiponectin is expressed by Adipoq<sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup> bone marrow stromal cells in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bone marrow stromal cells from 16 week old male Adipoq<sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup> mice were cultured at low density for 14 days to promote formation of colony-forming units (CFUs).

When quantified and expressed relative to total bone marrow volume, the percentage total tibial BMAT was comparable to controls in 4 month old FF male and female mice and in 8 month old males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In control mice, BMAT was localized in the well-established pattern of concentration within proximal and distal ends of the tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheller et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, the BMAT in the FF mice was found predominantly in the proximal tibia and mid-diaphyseal region with few adipocytes in the distal tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Consistent with the 3D reconstructions, regional sub-analyses revealed that retained BMAT adipocytes were primarily localized proximal to the tibia/fibula junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Within the proximal tibia, BMAT increased by 2.2-fold in control males and 5.6-fold in control females from 4 to 8 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In FF mice, though the absolute volume of BMAT was similar or less than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), proximal tibial BMAT increased by 6.9-fold and 23.2-fold with age in males and females, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This included expansion within the mid-diaphysis, a region in mice that generally has very low amounts of BMAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the distal tibia, control males and females had a large volume of BMAT at 4 months that also increased by 2.7- and 2.3-fold with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). By contrast, FF mice had very little BMAT in the distal tibia and, though minor increases with age were noted, these changes were not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

To assess the response of FF bone and BMAds to thermal stress, male control and FF mice were housed at thermoneutrality (30°C) or room temperature (22°C) for 3–4 months, beginning at 4 weeks of age. Under mild cold stress (22°C), trabecular BVF was decreased by 33–57% relative to housing at thermoneutrality (30°C) in the tibia and femur of control and FF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

At the endpoint, the total mass of the transplanted adipose tissue was significantly higher in the FF mice than in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

There was also a significant rescue of liver enlargement and peripheral hypertriglyceridemia by fat transplant in both male and female FF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). Fat transplant did not substantially modify the cortical and trabecular bone phenotypes in the tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, fat transplant was sufficient to prevent the ectopic BMAT expansion in FF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–H</xref>). An independent increase in tibial BMAT volume was also observed in male WT fat transplanted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and H</xref>). The reason for this is unclear as no differences were noted in BAT, iWAT, or gWAT mass after fat transplant in male or female control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A-C</xref>). Overall, these results reinforce the critical role of the peripheral adipose tissue as a lipid storage depot that reduces the systemic burden of hypertriglyceridemia on peripheral tissues such as liver and bone marrow.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Subcutaneous fat transplant prevents BMAT expansion in Adipoq<sup>Cre+/DTA+</sup> fat free (FF) mice.</title><p>Male and female Adipoq<sup>Cre+/DTA+</sup> FF and Adipoq<sup>Cre-/DTA+</sup> controls (Con) underwent sham surgery or were transplanted subcutaneously with WT inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) at 3–5 weeks of age.

However, recent lineage tracing and single-cell RNAseq studies, including the data presented here, challenge this paradigm and demonstrate that adiponectin is expressed by a subset of bone marrow stromal progenitor cells. These adiponectin-expressing progenitors overlap with CAR cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsushita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mukohira et al., 2019</xref>) and have been more recently termed MALPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>).

Ex vivo culture of primary bone marrow stromal cells from Adipoq<sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup> reporter mice in this study further demonstrated their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), supporting these previous findings. Adiponectin-expressing stromal progenitors appear after birth (P1+), matching the known development of BMAT which also occurs primarily postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheller and Rosen, 2014a</xref>). Consistent with this and likely also due to the high expression and secretion of adiponectin by healthy BMAds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cawthorn et al., 2014</xref>), classical depots of rBMAT and cBMAT failed to form in the Adipoq<sup>Cre+/DTA+</sup> FF mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheller et al., 2015</xref>). However, instead, an ectopic population of FF BMAds developed with age in regions of the skeleton such as the diaphysis that are generally devoid of BMAT.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ectopic FF BMAds originate from adiponectin<sup>-/low</sup> progenitors and express low levels of Cxcl12</title><p>In triple-mutant Adipoq<sup>Cre+/DTA+/mTmG+</sup> lineage tracing reporter mice, 41–56% of BMAds were RFP+, demonstrating that at least half of the FF BMAds originated from an adiponectin-negative progenitor population.

The reason for this is unclear, as expression of <italic>Dph1-7</italic> genes did not indicate a clear mechanism for DTA resistance. It may be that, with time, the adiponectin-negative BMAds gradually evolved to express a low level of adiponectin. If these cells are continually forming and subsequently being cleared by DTA, this may explain why we observed some GFP+ cells in our analyses. Regardless, as a population, this unique ectopic BMAd population did not rescue circulating adiponectin in the FF mice and had decreased expression of <italic>Adipoq</italic>.</p><p>The location of the adiponectin<sup>-/low</sup> FF BMAds aligns with known sites of arteriolar entry and distribution within the femur and tibia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grüneboom et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghar et al., 2020</xref>). These cells also expressed <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, though this was decreased relative to control BMAds. Arterioles have recently been defined as a site of Osteo-CAR cells, a subpopulation of <italic>Cxcl12</italic>-expressing cells that are enriched for osteogenic progenitors, while Adipo-CAR or MALP cells are primarily localized to the venous sinusoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>). Additional adiponectin-negative, <italic>Cxcl12</italic>-negative mesenchymal progenitor populations also exist within bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kusumbe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ramasamy, 2017</xref>). Peri-sinusoidal Adipo-CAR/MALP progenitor cells are generally primed to undergo adipocyte differentiation; however, they are also recruited to undergo differentiation into trabecular bone osteogenic cells with age (~35% at 6 months) and into cortical osteoblasts and osteocytes during injury-induced skeletal repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsushita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Our results mirror these findings and support an inverse model whereby the depletion of peri-sinusoidal, adiponectin-expressing MALP/Adipo-CAR progenitor cells drives the preferential differentiation of adiponectin<sup>-/lo</sup>, Cxcl12<sup>-/lo</sup> progenitors into adipocytes in states of local and systemic metabolic demand, as occurs in the Adipoq<sup>Cre+/DTA+</sup> fat-free mouse model of CGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Because peripheral adipose tissues do not have such an alternate progenitor population within their niche, this may explain why this secondary adipogenesis pathway in FF mice is unique to the bone marrow and is absent in other depots including WAT and BAT. Altogether, this finding contributes to our understanding of the relative preservation of BMAT in clinical states of CGL and reinforces the likely importance of BMAds to maintaining the local homeostasis of the skeletal and hematopoietic microenvironment.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Summary model.</title><p>Adiponectin is highly expressed by mature bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds) and by a subset of bone marrow stromal progenitor cells. Adiponectin-expressing progenitors overlap with Cxcl12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells and have been more recently termed Adipo-CAR cells or MALPs (marrow adipogenic lineage precursors). Adipoq+ skeletal progenitors are primed to undergo adipogenesis. Consistent with this and likely due also to the high expression and secretion of adiponectin by healthy BMAds, classic depots of bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) failed to form in the Adipoq<sup>Cre+/DTA+</sup> FF mouse. Instead, we observed age-dependent expansion of a BMAd population with reduced expression of adiponectin (Adipoq<sup>-/lo</sup>) and Cxcl12 (Cxcl12<sup>-/lo</sup>) in regions of the skeleton such as the diaphysis that are generally devoid of BMAT. FF BMAds were resistant to cold challenge and β3-adrenergic stimulation and had decreased expression of β3-adrenergic receptors and monoacylglycerol lipase (Mgll), suggesting that these cells have decreased capacity to serve as a local fuel source for surrounding hematopoietic and osteogenic cells. We hypothesize that these ectopic BMAds originate from progenitors including the peri-arteriolar Osteo-CAR population, similar to previous work showing that Adipo-CAR cells are capable of undergoing osteogenic differentiation with age and after acute injury. We propose that expansion of this BMAd population is a conserved adaptation with age and in states of metabolic stress and, furthermore, that this is a unique adaptation of the bone marrow that is not present in peripheral adipose depots.

This result provides insight into recent conflicting studies on lipolysis in rodent and human BMAds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scheller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attané et al., 2020</xref>).

However, purified adipocytes from older humans are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attané et al., 2020</xref>).

Similarly, fat transplant prevented the expansion of ectopic BMAds. This supports the existing paradigm whereby excess circulating lipids contribute to the development and expansion of BMAT, and, conversely, that the decrease of these factors in circulation may reduce the development of ectopic BMAds in bone. It is unclear if this could be accomplished in relatively healthy mice or humans to limit age-associated increases in BMAds in regions of hematopoietic bone marrow and, beyond this, if such a strategy would have benefits to bone or hematopoiesis. The alteration of other circulating factors such as estradiol, leptin, adiponectin, insulin, corticosterone, growth hormone, and catecholamines may also contribute to BMAT expansion in FF mice.

However, this was paired with a mild, but significant decrease in tibial length in FF mice, suggesting that the depletion of adiponectin-expressing cells limits bone elongation, potentially through the suppression of chondrocyte differentiation and/or proliferation within the growth plate. This process may also be mediated by reduced levels of growth hormone or growth factors in circulation or within the bone microenvironment. Consistent with this observation, short stature is consistently reported in patients with CGL3, whose BMAT is also preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, for the first time, µCT scans of the FF tibia in this study showed a sex- and age-dependent regulation of bone mass after depletion of adiponectin-expressing cells. Specifically, trabecular bone formation in FF mice was more pronounced in females with significant differences in age-related trabecular maintenance. It has previously been reported that these Adipoq<sup>Cre+/DTA+</sup> FF mice have low levels of estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenot et al., 2020</xref>), which may contribute to the sex-dependent changes in bone that were observed in these mice. The onset of this high bone mass phenotype was not altered by peripheral fat transplant or normalization of circulating glucose/lipid levels, supporting previous work by Zhong et al and suggesting that changes in bone are driven largely by local depletion of adiponectin-expressing cells in the skeleton, independent of peripheral fat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). Despite early increases in bone, depletion of adiponectin-expressing cells led to suppression of mineral accrual and a decrease in cortical thickness from 4 to 8 months of age in both male and female FF mice, suggesting that short-term gains may give way to longer-term cortical instability. This supports the previous findings of Matsushita et al. and suggests that adiponectin expressing progenitors, such as MALP/Adipo-CAR cells, may provide necessary contributions to aging or diseased bone through their recruitment to the osteolineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsushita et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Ectopic BMAT is inversely correlated with cortical, but not trabecular, bone mass</title><p>Historically, BMAT expansion has been linked to bone loss and osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fazeli et al., 2013</xref>). In recent years, this assumption has come into question as multiple models have shown that both high bone mass and high BMAT can occur simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheller and Rosen, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fazeli et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, a recent study using <italic>Prx1</italic>-cre mediated knockout of PPARγ demonstrated that BMAT expansion was not necessary for age-associated bone loss in female mice, though it was sufficient to intensify age-dependent cortical porosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2020</xref>). Though our study was not designed to isolate the direct relationship between bone and BMAT, some observations can be made in the FF model. First, the initial onset of the bone phenotype was independent of the formation of ectopic BMAds, as demonstrated in the fat transplant experiment, suggesting that these early phenotypes are independent. When considered across experiments, trabecular bone volume fraction in the tibia was inversely correlated with metaphyseal BMAT volume in control mice (slope –2.0, R<sup>2</sup> 0.137, p=0.037, n = 32). This is consistent with previous reports in aged mice and humans showing that with age, BMAT increases while bone decreases. However, this association was absent in FF mice (slope +0.7, R<sup>2</sup> 0.073, p=0.155, n = 29). By contrast, BMAT in the diaphysis was inversely correlated with cortical bone volume fraction in FF mice (slope –2.1, R<sup>2</sup> 0.306, p=0.002, n = 29), but not in controls (Slope +1.8, R<sup>2</sup> 0.044, p=0.252, n = 32). In healthy mice, the majority of BMAds are derived from Adipoq+ marrow adipocyte lineage progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). MALP cells form a peri-sinusoidal network throughout the bone marrow and were recently shown to secrete factors such as RANKL, leading to suppression of trabecular, but not cortical, bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Ablation of these cells in the FF mice may help to explain the absence of a correlation between FF BMAT and trabecular bone. Instead, the ectopic adiponectin<sup>-/low</sup>, Cxcl12<sup>-/low</sup> adipocyte population appears to be more closely linked to cortical bone. Though we cannot presume causation, we hypothesize that this relationship may be due to the origination of these BMAds from alternate osteoprogenitor populations such as Osteo-CAR cells that localize to the peripheral arterioles and endocortical surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Future clarification of this point will help to define the niche-specific regulation of bone, blood, and BMAT.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations</title><p>Altogether, these findings suggest that a unique population of BMAds that is specialized for lipid storage with limited lipid mobilization and endocrine functions has the potential to accumulate with age and metabolic disease. This adipogenesis pathway is exclusive to the bone marrow and does not exist in peripheral adipose tissues. However, these results are based on work in the FF model of CGL and have not yet been replicated in alternate rodent models or in humans. Future studies are needed to extend these findings and to explore the implications of this result for skeletal and metabolic health.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that the spatially defined progenitor cell, the systemic metabolic profile, and the local microenvironment are necessary regulators of BMAd expansion and adaptation in vivo. In addition, we present evidence for a novel secondary adipogenesis pathway that is unique to the bone marrow and is activated during times of metabolic stress. The resulting adiponectin<sup>-/low</sup>, Cxcl12<sup>-/low</sup> adipocytes express low levels of adipokines, have increased capacity for lipid storage, and are resistant to lipolytic stimulation, providing new insight into the cellular mechanisms of BMAd adaptation. This work refines our knowledge of the origins of BMAT and contributes to our understanding of the diversity of BMAd populations and their different physiological functions and adaptations within the skeletal system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

To assess bone marrow adiposity, bones were decalcified in 14% EDTA, pH 7.4 and incubated in a solution containing 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences 19170) and 2.5% potassium dichromate (Sigma-Aldrich 24–4520) for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scheller et al., 2014b</xref>). After washing for 2 hr in running water and storage in PBS at 4°C, osmium-stained bones were embedded in 2% agarose and scanned at 10 µm voxel resolution (Scanco μCT 40; 70 kVp, 114 µA, 300 ms integration time). Regions of interest were contoured for BMAT quantification as detailed in the figure legends. BMAT was segmented with a threshold of 400.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>BMAd cell size analysis</title><p>Tiled 10× images covering the femoral and tibial metaphyses were exported from the Nanozoomer scans of H&amp;E stained slides and processed in Fiji to estimate average adipocyte cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Based on previous recommendations for adipocyte cell size analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Parlee et al., 2014</xref>), a minimum of 100 adipocytes were analyzed for each mouse. Briefly, the scale in Fiji was set to be consistent with the original scan. The image was then converted to 8-bit and a threshold of 230–255 was applied to create a mask. Then the image was cleaned up using the wand tool and the deletion command to eliminate non-adipocyte structures. The cleaned mask was processed using the Fill Holes and the Watershed tools. The size of adipocytes was determined using the ‘Analyze Particles’ tool by setting the size to 200–4000 μm<sup>2</sup> and circularity to 0.40–1.00. Histograms were created in GraphPad Prism, and the average adipocyte cell size was calculated using Excel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>CL316,243 injection</title><p>CL316,243 (Sigma-Aldrich, C5976) was reconstituted in saline to a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml and stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks. Eight daily subcutaneous injections of 0.03 mg/kg CL316,243 were administered over the course of 10 days (weekdays only, M→F, M→W) prior to sacrifice on Day 11.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>BMAd purification, RNA extraction, and qPCR</title><p>BMAds were collected from groups of 8–12 mice at 4–6 months of age. Femurs and tibiae (16–24 bones/preparation) were rapidly dissected into pre-warmed 37°C HBSS buffer (Gibco 10425–076) containing 2% DNase and protease-free bovine serum albumin (Fisher BP9706), 5 mM EDTA, and 1 g/l glucose. After cutting the ends of the bones, whole bone marrow was flushed into a 50 ml conical tube with a 10 ml syringe +22 gauge needle and resuspended into 20 ml fresh buffer +1 mg/ml collagenase. Marrow-depleted bones were placed into a separate tube in 20 ml buffer +1 mg/ml collagenase and finely minced to liberate any residual BMAds. Bone and bone marrow preparations were centrifuged at room temperature, 400 g × 2 min, and BMAd-containing supernatant was decanted into a new tube prior to re-centrifugation at 400 g × 1 min. Infranatant and any residual pellet were removed using a pulled glass pipet until only 1–2 ml of liquid was remaining. The adipocyte-containing liquid was serially applied to a NucleoSpin Filter Column (NucleoSpin RNA XS Kit, Takara, 740902) for on-column BMAd lysis and RNA extraction. Briefly, the filter column was centrifuged slowly at 50 g × 10 s to retain the BMAd cells while removing any residual liquid into the collection tube. The bottom of the column was then sealed with parafilm, and kit-supplied RNA lysis buffer was added with gentle agitation. BMA-enriched (‘BMAe’) lysates were processed for RNA extraction using the kit-supplied protocol and reagents.</p><p>For qPCR, 100 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix with ezDNase Enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific 11766050) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. SyGreen 2 × Mix Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems PB20.11–51) was used to perform the qPCR assay on a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific A28136). Gene expression of individual targets was calculated based on amplification of a standard curve for each primer. Results were normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes <italic>Ppia</italic> and <italic>Tbp</italic>. Primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fat transplantation</title><p><italic>Adipoq</italic><sup>Cre-/DTA+</sup> and <italic>Adipoq</italic><sup>Cre+/DTA+</sup> mice received subcutaneous fat transplant or sham surgery at 3–5 weeks of age. Mice were maintained for an additional 12 weeks prior to sacrifice (end age 15–17 weeks). Donor preparation: wild-type donor mice on the same background (C57BL/6 J) ranged from 22 to 39 days of age. Immediately after decapitation under anesthesia, bilateral inguinal WAT depots were dissected free of surrounding tissues and placed into sterile PBS in a petri dish. The lymph node was removed, and a scalpel blade was used to mince the remaining iWAT into small pieces of ~0.5–1.0 mm<sup>3</sup>. The entire minced iWAT from one donor mouse was transplanted to one recipient mouse. Recipient surgery: the recipient mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane and the skin on the back was prepared (shaved and treated 2× each with 70% ethanol and betadine) prior to making two 1 cm incisions along the midline, one over the shoulder blades, and one just above the level of the pelvis. Blunt dissection was used to create four pockets just lateral to each incision, one on each side. The minced iWAT from the donor mouse was evenly distributed into the four pockets. The incisions were closed, and all mice received Buprenex SR at the time of surgery for post-operative analgesia. Post-surgical monitoring and management were performed per DCM guidelines, as approved in our animal protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Serum glycerol and triglyceride assay</title><p>Serum glycerol and true triglyceride (TG) levels were determined using a Serum Triglyceride Determination Kit (Sigma-Aldrich TR0100). In brief, free glycerol reagent and triglyceride reagent were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instruction. To measure serum glycerol, 10 µl serum/well was added to a 96-well microplate on ice prior to addition of 150 μl of free glycerol reagent and incubation at 37°C for 10 min. The absorbances of the standards and the samples at 540 nm versus blank (pure Free Glycerol Reagent) were measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek). To determine serum true TG level, 38 μl of triglyceride reagent was added to each well after the initial absorbance measurement for glycerol, followed by an additional 10 min incubation at 37°C. The absorbances of the standards and the samples at 540 nm versus blank were measured again using the microplate reader. A standard curve was utilized for the calculation of serum-free glycerol and total TG concentrations. The serum true TG level was calculated by subtracting the free glycerol level from the total TG level for each sample, as per manufacturer instructions. All samples were assayed in duplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism including unpaired t-test, one-way, two-way, and three-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons tests, applied as detailed in the figure legends. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Quantitative assessments of cell size and µCT-based analyses were performed by individuals that were blinded to the sample identity.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>None</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>none</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing, Investigation, Supervision, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing, Investigation, Supervision, Methodology, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Resources</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All work was performed as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Washington University (Saint Louis, MO, USA; Protocol IDs 20160183 and 20180282).

They also acknowledge that the manuscript comes from a prominent group with long-standing interest in bone marrow adipose tissue and its characteristics relatively to the white and brown adipose tissues. The identification of bone-specific adipogenic pathway, and characterization of ectopic bone marrow adipocytes in aging and under metabolic stress were considered major strengths of the study.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A bone-specific adipogenesis pathway defines key origins and adaptations of bone marrow adipocytes with age and disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The reviewers find that this study represents a continuation of the work of the Scheller group using a previously published mouse model with unique characteristics of bone marrow adipocytes. Moreover, the use of this artificial fat-free mouse model was seen as a limitation of the study, as the bone-specific adipogenesis pathway may in fact be relevant only to the context of adiponectin-free fat-free mice. In line of this, it is recommended that the authors establish more cearly the novelty of the study and the specific knowledge and impact it is contributing.</p><p>– The use of the fat-free mouse model is not fully justified. The authors do not experimentally show the efficacy of DTA-mediated cell ablation, which is notoriously ineffective. They should specifically address the possibility that bone marrow adipocytes in Adipoq-Cre/DTA mice are those that escaped from recombination.</p><p>– More specifically, the reviewers questioned if Figure 1 and much of Figure 2 are documenting novel information, as they appear very close to the previously published work of the same group (Robles et al., 2019). Also, Figures 3 and 4 provide evidence that fat free mice have a high bone mass phenotype, in support of well-established findings for lipodystrophy in humans, and high bone mass in fat-free mice, and therefore appear redundant. The authors would need to explain the novelty and utility of these data, and their relation to the state of the art in the field.</p><p>– Figure 6 was found to be of most interest, as it presents new and exciting data that the global deletion of adiponectin-expressing adipocytes did not affect the presence of bone marrow adipocytes and that this pool of adipocytes even expands with age. These observations are novel and warrant mechanistic analysis. However, the authors present only 5 genes that may be differentially regulated, and without clear interpretation of the experimental findings (Figure 6F). The authors explain how and why the bone marrow adipocytes differ from other adipocytes. Also, it would be important to clarify if the cell deletion occurred equally well in all populations of adipocytes.</p><p>– The secondary adipogenesis pathway may in fact be relevant only in extreme circumstances such as in congenital generalized lipodystrophy. Also, the &quot;bone-specific adipogenesis pathway&quot; has been documented only for adiponectin-free fat-free mice. The authors should therefore add &quot;in fat-free mice&quot; at the end of the title, and revise the abstract which appears to be oversimplified and overstated and the conclusions some of which are not supported by experimental evidence.</p><p>– Similarly, the stated hypothesis is not really a hypothesis, because this point has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies. The real novelty is that adiponectin-negative bone marrow adipocytes appear under special and rather extreme circumstances. It would be essential to demonstrate that these bone marrow adipocytes in FF mice are indeed adiponectin-negative (by immunostaining).</p><p>– The authors do not consider the possibility that DTA does not kill all adiponectin-expressing cells. The DTA allele is known to be ineffective and insensitive to Cre recombinations. This is important as leakiness could undermine the major conclusions of this study. The authors should therefore determine the efficiency of cell ablation, by combining DTA and mTmG alleles with Adipoq-Cre. Any adiponectin-expressing cell escaping DTA should turn GFP+.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66275.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The reviewers find that this study represents a continuation of the work of the Scheller group using a previously published mouse model with unique characteristics of bone marrow adipocytes.

To explore the origins of this unique BMAd population we created and analyzed triple mutant fat-free <italic>Adipoq</italic><sup>Cre+/DTA+/mTmG+</sup> lineage tracing reporter mice (FF<sup>mTmG</sup>). This work is now presented in a new section of the results entitled “Origins and adaptations of ectopic BMAT adipocytes” with a new main figure (appended below). We have also inserted the description of this triple mutant mouse model into the Introduction and Methods sections and added additional interpretation of these data to the Discussion section.</p><p>New Results, Figure, and Figure Legend:</p><p>“Origins and adaptations of ectopic BMAT adipocytes</p><p>To further determine the origin of ectopic BMAds in FF mice while testing the efficacy of the DTA, we generated triple mutant Adipoq<sup>Cre+/DTA+/mTmG+</sup> lineage tracing reporter mice (FF<sup>mTmG</sup>). Adipoq<sup>Cre-/DTA+/mTmG+</sup> mice were used as negative controls (Con<sup>mTmG</sup>). In the FF<sup>mTmG</sup> model, <italic>Adipoq</italic>-expressing cells will express GFP and should undergo DTA-mediated cell death. By contrast, cells that do not express <italic>Adipoq</italic> will express RFP. To begin, cross-sections of femur and tibia from male and female FF<sup>mTmG</sup> at 4-months of age were imaged after immunostaining for GFP, RFP, and PLIN1 to assess adiponectin expression in the ectopic BMAds. Unexpectedly, both adiponectin-negative (RFP+, 41-56%) and adiponectin-expressing (GFP+, 6-21%) BMAT adipocytes were present in FF<sup>mTmG</sup> mice (Figure 9A,B). In addition, approximately 38% of cells had indeterminate membranes, with evidence of both RFP and GFP expression in vivo (Figure 9A,B). Next, we plated primary BMSCs from Con<sup>mTmG</sup> and FF<sup>mTmG</sup> mice for quantitative CFU assays (Figure 9C). Consistent with the broad expression of <italic>Adipoq</italic> in the stromal compartment (Figure 2,S1), the number of CFUs was reduced by 91% in FF<sup>mTmG</sup> mice (Figure 9D). In addition, in line with our in vivo results, spontaneous adipogenesis in the residual FF<sup>mTmG</sup> BMSCs was observed in both adiponectin-negative (RFP+) and adiponectin-expressing (GFP+) stromal progenitor cells in vitro (Figure 9C)<italic>.</italic> This result suggests that the majority of FF BMAds originate from adiponectin-negative stromal cells, with a minor portion of BMAds being adiponectin-positive. This minor population of cells was not sufficient to restore circulating adiponectin, as adiponectin levels in FF mice were not increased when compared to adiponectin knockout animals (Figure 2A).</p><p>Next, we analyzed the gene expression of purified BMAds from control and FF mice. As expected, expression of <italic>Adipoq</italic> was decreased in BMAds from FF mice (Figure 9E). In addition, expression of cytokines including stromal cell-derived factor 1, also known as C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (<italic>Cxcl12</italic>), adipsin (<italic>Cfd</italic>), and resistin (<italic>Retn</italic>) were significantly decreased (Figure 9E). Expression of adipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (<italic>Ppary</italic>) was also decreased. By contrast, expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (<italic>Cebpa</italic>), fatty acid transporter <italic>Cd36</italic>, and alkaline phosphatase (<italic>Alpl</italic>) were comparable in control and FF BMAds. Lastly, we assessed the expression of diphthamide biosynthesis enzymes 1-7 (<italic>Dph1-7</italic>), as deficiency in even a single <italic>Dph</italic> enzyme can confer resistance to DTA-mediated cell death (1,2). We did not observe significant regulation of any <italic>Dph</italic> genes in FF BMAds relative to control BMAds (Figure 9F). Overall, our findings define the FF BMAd as an ectopically positioned, PLIN1+, CD68- adipocyte that is specialized for lipid storage with decreased capacity for lipid mobilization and expression of cytokines including adiponectin, resistin, adipsin, and <italic>Cxcl12</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– More specifically, the reviewers questioned if Figure 1 and much of Figure 2 are documenting novel information, as they appear very close to the previously published work of the same group (Robles et al., 2019).

Yes, partial in vivo data from the <italic>Adipoq</italic><sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup> reporter mice in Figure 1 was previously reported in another study from our group (Craft et al., 2019; PMID: 31758074). However, in the current study, we are providing new images and additional details regarding tracing to bone cells. We think that these data provide important context for the current in vivo adiponectin DTA model. These results also inform the ongoing controversy regarding the expression of adiponectin by skeletal lineage cells. Specifically, our results indicate that adiponectin-expressing progenitors do not give rise to embedding osteoblasts in relatively young, healthy mice, as we found that though the adiponectin lineage reporter traces to many bone lining cells, it is not expressed in the osteocytes. We believe that this is an important point that supports the work by Ono group (Matsushita et al., 2020) as they showed that adiponectin-expressing stromal cells are a committed pre-adipocyte population in healthy conditions but can form osteoblasts/osteocytes only with injury or advanced age. In response to the reviewers, we have now moved these data into the supplement (Figure 1—figure supplement 1; this style of figure nomenclature was requested by the <italic>eLife</italic> editorial team).</p><p>In Figure 2, the in vitro culture of the bone marrow stromal cells from the <italic>Adipoq</italic><sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup> reporter mice is a new, unpublished set of data that further supports the in vivo data and shows that adiponectin is expressed in a subset of bone marrow stromal cells. Through this new in vitro study, we confirm that these cells function as pre-adipocytes, with adiponectin being expressed during progenitor commitment but prior to lipid accumulation in healthy cells. This provides additional support for this emerging paradigm that has been recently established by the Qin group (Zhong et al., 2020) and the Ono group (Matsushita et al., 2020). We request to keep this Figure and new data in the main text (Figure 1 in the revised draft). In response to the reviewers, we have also added an additional statement in the 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph of the discussion to describe the novelty and utility of the in vitro lineage tracing data:</p><p>“Ex vivo culture of primary bone marrow stromal cells from <italic>Adipoq</italic><sup>Cre+/mTmG+</sup> reporter mice in this study further demonstrated their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes (Figure 1), supporting these previous findings.”</p><p>Regarding the novelty of the bone data in Figure 4 and Supplemental S1, in this study we analyzed both male and female mice at both 4- and 8-months of age. Previous reports have focused on male mice only and have not explored age-related effects. We identified sex-specific differences in cortical and trabecular bone phenotypes, which have never been reported before. We also found, for the first time, that there are key issues in the maintenance of cortical bone with age after depletion of adiponectin-expressing cells and that ectopic BMAd expansion is inversely correlated with cortical, but not trabecular, bone mass. Given the importance and novelty of these results, we would request to keep the figures as part of the manuscript (current Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). In response to the reviewers, we have updated the text of the bone-related Discussion sections to more clearly emphasize these results under the following two headings:</p><p>– Depletion of adiponectin-expressing cells leads to early gains in trabecular bone, but impairs maintenance of cortical bone with age</p><p>– Ectopic BMAT is inversely correlated with cortical, but not trabecular, bone mass</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6 was found to be of most interest, as it presents new and exciting data that the global deletion of adiponectin-expressing adipocytes did not affect the presence of bone marrow adipocytes and that this pool of adipocytes even expands with age. These observations are novel and warrant mechanistic analysis. However, the authors present only 5 genes that may be differentially regulated, and without clear interpretation of the experimental findings (Figure 6F). The authors explain how and why the bone marrow adipocytes differ from other adipocytes. Also, it would be important to clarify if the cell deletion occurred equally well in all populations of adipocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your interest. We have now tested the expression of 20 genes in total to examine the expression of adrenergic receptors, lipases, adipokines, adipogenic transcription factors, diphthamide biosynthesis enzymes, and other factors (these updated results are presented in Figures 7 and 9 of the main manuscript). Since BMAT volume is extremely small in mice, it takes about 8 to 10 mice to get one BMAT RNA sample for qPCR analysis, limiting the number of analyses that we can perform. Due to limitations and challenges associated with gene studies – we also performed in vivo functional analyses (fat transplant, temperature challenge, and β3-agonist stimulation). Altogether, this work identified resistance to adrenergic-mediated lipolysis, increased lipid storage, and decreased adipokine expression as the main differences between FF and control bone marrow adipocytes. Using the newly added lineage tracing model, we also show that most of these ectopic FF adipocytes are derived from adiponectin-negative progenitor cells. In our working model, we propose that these may be Osteo-CAR cells. Since peripheral adipose tissue does not have such a niche, this may explain why adipocytes are not preserved in any peripheral depots in FF mice. In response to the reviewers, we have also added an additional statement in the third paragraph of the discussion to comment on the specificity of this secondary adipogenesis pathway to BMAT:</p><p>“Because peripheral adipose tissues do not have such an alternate progenitor population within their niche, this may explain why this secondary adipogenesis pathway in FF mice is unique to the bone marrow and is absent in other depots including WAT and BAT.”</p><p>Regarding clarification of cell deletion in extramedullary populations of adipocytes, we present gross pictures (Figure 2), histological images (Figures 2, 5, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1), and tissue masses (Figure 8—figure supplement 3) confirming the absence of both white and brown adipocytes at diverse extramedullary depots in FF mice (inguinal, gonadal, perirenal, intrascapular, periarticular in the knee joint, and ‘mechanical’ subcutaneous fat normally found in the feet and around the tail). In addition, we were unable to detect circulating adiponectin, supporting the efficacy of the DTA-induced cell death.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The secondary adipogenesis pathway may in fact be relevant only in extreme circumstances such as in congenital generalized lipodystrophy.

However, to address this point, we have now included data from the triple mutant FF<sup>mTmG</sup> lineage tracing reporter mice (see response to point #2 above). In addition to this new lineage tracing data, we also found that gene expression of <italic>Adipoq</italic> was reduced in purified BMAds (Figure 9) and that, despite maintenance of BMAds, FF mice did not have circulating adiponectin (Figure 2).
