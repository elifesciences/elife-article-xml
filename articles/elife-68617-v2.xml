requires accurate and detailed representation of potential available rewards. Environmental reward-predictive stimuli can facilitate these representations, allowing one to infer which specific rewards might be available and choose accordingly. This process relies on encoded relationships between the cues and the sensory-specific details of the rewards they predict. Here, we interrogated the function of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and its interaction with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) in the ability to learn such stimulus-outcome associations and use these memories to guide decision making. Using optical recording and inhibition approaches, Pavlovian cue-reward conditioning, and the outcome-selective Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) test in male rats, we found that the BLA is robustly activated at the time of stimulus-outcome learning and that this activity is necessary for sensory-specific stimulus-outcome memories to be encoded, so they can subsequently influence reward choices. Direct input from the lOFC was found to support the BLA in this function. Based on prior work, activity in BLA projections back to the lOFC was known to support the use of stimulus-outcome memories to influence decision making. By multiplexing optogenetic and chemogenetic inhibition we performed a serial circuit disconnection and found that the lOFC→BLA and BLA→lOFC pathways form a functional circuit regulating the encoding (lOFC→BLA) and subsequent use (BLA→lOFC) of the stimulus-dependent, sensory-specific reward memories that are critical for adaptive, appetitive decision making.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer</kwd><kwd>basolateral amygdala</kwd><kwd>orbitofrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA035443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wassum</surname><given-names>Kate M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sias</surname><given-names>Ana C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The bidirectional orbitofrontal cortex-basolateral amygdala circuit helps us to learn the details of predicted rewarding events and then to use that information to make good reward pursuit decisions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To make good decisions we must accurately anticipate the potential outcomes (e.g. rewarding events) that might be available in our current situation, or state. When not readily observable, we can infer the availability of these outcomes from predictive environmental stimuli (e.g. restaurant logos on a food-delivery app). Pavlovian <italic>stimulus-outcome associative memories</italic> enable such cues to trigger representations of their associated outcomes, thus facilitating the state-dependent outcome expectations that influence decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Delamater, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fanselow and Wassum, 2015</xref>). Often our decisions require detailed information about the available outcomes (e.g. flavor, nutritional content, texture). For example, when deciding between items of similar valence (e.g. to have pizza or sushi for dinner). To enable such decisions, stimulus-outcome memories can be quite rich, including the sensory-specific, identifying details of the predicted reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Delamater and Oakeshott, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fanselow and Wassum, 2015</xref>). Failure to properly encode or use such memories can lead to poor reward-related choices, a hallmark feature of myriad psychiatric diseases. Yet much is unknown of the neural circuits that support stimulus-outcome memory.</p><p>One potential hub for stimulus-outcome memory is the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wassum and Izquierdo, 2015</xref>). Long known for its function in emotional learning, the BLA is thought to link predictive stimuli with valence and to relay that valence for adaptive behavior (e.g. approach/avoidance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baxter and Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pignatelli and Beyeler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Tye, 2018</xref>). But the BLA does more than valence. Mounting evidence, primarily collected with lesion and inactivation strategies, suggests the BLA mediates appetitive behaviors that require a rich sensory-specific representation of the expected reward. For example, the BLA is needed for reward-predictive cues to bias choice between two distinct rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blundell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corbit and Balleine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hatfield et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</xref>). Although the BLA’s function in the <italic>expression</italic> of such behaviors has been established, temporal limitations of BLA lesions preclude interpretations of BLA function in stimulus-outcome <italic>learning</italic>. The BLA is known to be essential for the learning of cued fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Muller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sengupta et al., 2018</xref>), but behavioral limitations of these studies preclude understanding of whether the BLA is involved in encoding the sensory-specific details of the outcome. Thus, it remains unknown whether the BLA is involved in encoding the sensory-specific stimulus-outcome memories that enable adaptive choices, or if the BLA primarily functions to assign general valence to a cue. Moreover, little is known of the endogenous activity or circuit function underlying any potential role for the BLA in the formation of appetitive stimulus-outcome memories.</p><p>To address these gaps in knowledge, here we used optical recording and inhibition approaches in male rats to examine the BLA’s function in the encoding of stimulus-outcome memories for two unique food rewards. To assess the extent of stimulus-outcome memory encoding, we used the outcome-selective Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) test to measure the ability of a reward-paired stimulus to trigger a sensory-specific representation of its predicted reward and thus bias reward-seeking choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colwill and Motzkin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corbit and Balleine, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gilroy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kruse et al., 1983</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BLA neurons respond to rewards and cues during appetitive Pavlovian stimulus-outcome learning</title><p>We first asked whether and when the BLA is active during the encoding of stimulus-outcome memories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To condition cues that set the ‘state’ for a the availability of a specific reward and engender a sensory-specific representation of that reward, we used a two food outcome Pavlovian conditioning task. Each of 2, 2 min auditory conditional stimuli (CSs; white noise and tone) were associated with intermittent delivery of 1 of 2 distinct food rewards (sucrose solution or food pellets; e.g. white noise-sucrose/tone-pellet). This conditioning has been shown to engender the encoding of detailed, sensory-specific stimulus-outcome memories as measured by the cue’s ability to subsequently promote instrumental choice for the specific predicted reward during a PIT test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lichtenberg and Wassum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Malvaez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</xref>), as well as the sensitivity of the conditional food-port approach response to sensory-specific devaluation of the predicted reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>) or degradation of the stimulus-outcome contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</xref>). Food-deprived, male rats (<italic>N</italic> = 11) received 8 Pavlovian conditioning sessions. During each session, each cue was presented four times (variable intertrial interval, average = 3 min) for 2 min, during which its associated reward was intermittently delivered on average every 30 s. Rats demonstrated simple Pavlovian conditioning by gradually increasing their goal approach responses (entries into the food-delivery port) during the cue probe periods (after cue onset, before reward delivery) across training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>; Training: <italic>F</italic><sub>(2.4,24.3)</sub> = 13.18, p&lt;0.0001; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BLA neurons are activated during stimulus-outcome learning.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>).

This could reflect a non-associative, novelty response to either or both the tone or white noise presentation. To examine this and, thus, evaluate whether the BLA cue responses later in training were due to stimulus-outcome learning, we repeated the experiment in a separate group of naive rats, but this time omitted the reward delivery during conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>; <italic>N</italic> = 6). Instead, the rewards were delivered unpaired with the cues several hours after each session in a distinct context. Like presentation of the reward-predictive cues, presentation of either the tone or white noise stimulus unpaired with reward (CS<sub>Ø</sub>) robustly activated BLA neurons during the first session, but, in contrast to the reward-predictive cues, this effect habituated over sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Both tone and noise elicited a similar elevation in the peak calcium response that was largest on session one and diminished with subsequent days of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>; Session x CS<sub>Ø</sub>: <italic>F</italic><sub>(4,20)</sub> = 3.25, p=0.03; CS<sub>Ø</sub> presence: <italic>F</italic><sub>(0.4,2.1)</sub> = 4.84, p=0.13; CS<sub>Ø</sub> type (white noise v. tone): <italic>F</italic><sub>(0.3,1.5)</sub> = 7.03, p=0.12; Session: <italic>F</italic><sub>(2.3,11.7)</sub> = 3.27, p=0.07; Session x CS<sub>Ø</sub> type: <italic>F</italic><sub>(4,20)</sub> = 1.42, p=0.26; CS<sub>Ø</sub> x CS<sub>Ø</sub> type: <italic>F</italic><sub>(0.5,2.3)</sub> = 9.69, p=0.07; Session x CS<sub>Ø</sub> x CS<sub>Ø</sub> type: <italic>F</italic><sub>(0.6,3.2)</sub> = 0.80, p=0.37).

To check whether the decline of the CS<sub>Ø</sub> response was due simply to signal degradation over time, following the last CS<sub>Ø</sub> session we recorded BLA calcium responses to unpredicted reward delivery. Rewards were capable of robustly activating the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g–i</xref>; Peak, t<sub>5</sub> = 2.93, p=0.03; AUC, t<sub>5</sub> = 4.07, p=0.01). This positive control indicates that the decline of the BLA CS<sub>Ø</sub> response was due to stimulus habituation, not signal degradation. Thus, the BLA response to cue presentation during early Pavlovian conditioning likely reflects a non-associative novelty effect that habituates with subsequent exposure, indicating that the BLA responses to the reward-predictive cues later in training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) largely result from the association with reward.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BLA neuron activity is necessary during outcome experience to encode appetitive Pavlovian stimulus-outcome memories</title><p>We found that BLA neurons are robustly activated at the time at which stimulus-reward memories can be formed: when the reward is experienced during a predictive cue. We next asked whether this activity is necessary for such learning and, if so, whether it is necessary for encoding sensory-specific stimulus-outcome memories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We expressed the inhibitory opsin archaerhodopsin T (ArchT; <italic>N</italic> = 9) or eYFP control (<italic>N</italic> = 10) in BLA, primarily, principal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref>) to allow green light (532 nm,~10 mW) to transiently hyperpolarize and inhibit the activity of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Rats were again given 8 Pavlovian conditioning sessions during which each of 2 distinct, 2 min auditory CSs was paired with intermittent delivery of one specific food reward (8 of each CS/session). During each Pavlovian conditioning session, we optically inhibited the activity of BLA neurons during each cue. We restricted inhibition to 5 s concurrent with the delivery and retrieval of each food reward because this is the time at which the stimulus-outcome pairing occurs and when we found the BLA to be endogenously active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Optical inhibition of BLA neurons at reward experience during Pavlovian conditioning did not impede the development of the Pavlovian conditional goal-approach response to the cue sampled prior to reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>; Training: <italic>F</italic><sub>(3.8,64.9)</sub> = 17.53, p&lt;0.0001; Virus (eYFP v.

This general conditional response at the shared food port, however, does not require that the subjects have learned the sensory-specific details of the predicted reward. To test for such stimulus-outcome memory encoding, we gave subjects instrumental conditioning followed by a PIT test. Both were conducted without any manipulation. During instrumental conditioning, rats were trained that two different actions (left or right lever press) each earned one of the unique food rewards (e.g. left press→sucrose/right press→pellets; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). At the PIT test both levers were present, but lever pressing was not rewarded. Each CS was presented four times (also without accompanying reward), with intervening CS-free baseline periods, to assess its influence on action performance and selection in the novel choice scenario. Because the cues are never associated with the instrumental actions, this test assesses the ability to, upon cue presentation, retrieve a memory of the specific predicted reward and use it to motivate choice of the action known to earn the same unique reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colwill and Motzkin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corbit and Balleine, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gilroy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kruse et al., 1983</xref>). If subjects had encoded detailed stimulus-outcome memories during Pavlovian conditioning, then the CS should cause them to increase presses selectively on the lever that, during training, earned the <italic>same</italic> outcome as predicted by that cue. Controls showed this outcome-specific PIT effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Conversely, the cues were not capable of influencing lever-press choice in the group for which the BLA was inhibited at the time of outcome experience during Pavlovian conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>; Virus x Lever: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,17)</sub> = 5.10, p=0.04; Virus: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,17)</sub> = 1.41, p=0.25; Lever (Same v.

Thus, BLA neuronal activity is not needed for the learning that supports general conditional approach responses, but is necessary, specifically at the time of outcome experience, to link the sensory-specific details of the outcome to a predictive cue. Such encoding is critical for that cue to subsequently guide decision making.</p><p>An alternative possibility is that the total amount of inhibition compromised BLA activity more broadly. That is, that BLA activity per se rather than specifically at the time of stimulus-outcome pairing mediates the encoding of stimulus-outcome memories. To rule this out, we repeated the experiment in a new cohort of naive rats in which we matched the frequency and duration of inhibition to the experimental group, but delivered it during baseline pre-CS periods during Pavlovian conditioning.

BLA inputs from the lateral (lOFC), rather than medial OFC subregion, have previously been shown to be involved in learning information about a reward (i.e. its incentive value) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Malvaez et al., 2019</xref>), but are not required for retrieving appetitive memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Malvaez et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, this pathway might play a critical role specifically in <italic>forming</italic> stimulus-outcome associative memories. To evaluate this, we used pathway-specific optical inhibition to ask whether activity in lOFC→BLA projections mediates the encoding of stimulus-outcome memories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We expressed ArchT (<italic>N</italic> = 8) or eYFP control (<italic>N</italic> = 8) in lOFC neurons and detected expression in lOFC axons and terminals in the BLA in the vicinity of implanted optical fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–d</xref>). Green light (532 nm, ~10 mW) was used to inhibit lOFC axons and terminals in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Subjects received Pavlovian conditioning, as above, and inhibition was again restricted to 5 s during the delivery and retrieval of each reward during each cue. Similar to inhibition of BLA neurons, optical inhibition of lOFC→BLA projection activity during stimulus-outcome pairing did not affect the development of the Pavlovian conditional goal-approach response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>; Training: <italic>F</italic><sub>(3.9,54.3)</sub> = 7.84, p&lt;0.0001; Virus: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,14)</sub> = 0.22, p=0.65; Virus x Training: <italic>F</italic><sub>(7,98)</sub> = 0.43, p=0.88; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>) or its expression during the PIT test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>; <italic>t</italic><sub>14</sub> = 0.49, p=0.63; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2d</xref>).

The lOFC-BLA circuit is bidirectional. The BLA sends dense excitatory projections back to the lOFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barreiros et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morecraft et al., 1992</xref>). Activity in these projections mediates the representation of expected outcomes in the lOFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rudebeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rudebeck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schoenbaum et al., 2003</xref>) and the use of stimulus-outcome memories to guide choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>). But it remains unknown whether BLA→lOFC projection activity enables the use of the associative information that is learned via activation of lOFC→BLA projections. That is, whether lOFC→BLA→lOFC is a functional stimulus-outcome memory encoding and retrieval circuit or whether lOFC→BLA and BLA→lOFC projections tap in to independent, parallel information streams. Indeed, stimulus-outcome memories are highly complex including multifaceted information about outcome attributes (e.g. value, taste, texture, nutritional content, category, probability, timing, etc.) and related consummatory and appetitive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Delamater and Oakeshott, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we next asked whether the lOFC→BLA and BLA→lOFC pathways form a functional stimulus-outcome memory encoding and retrieval circuit, that is, whether the sensory-specific associative information that requires lOFC→BLA projections to be encoded also requires activation of BLA→lOFC projections to be used to guide decision making, or whether these are independent, parallel pathways, tapping into essential but independent streams of information.</p><p>To arbitrate between these possibilities, we multiplexed optogenetic and chemogenetic inhibition to perform a serial circuit disconnection. We disconnected lOFC→BLA projection activity during stimulus-outcome learning from BLA→lOFC projection activity during the retrieval of these memories at the PIT test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). For the disconnection group (<italic>N</italic> = 10), we again expressed ArchT bilaterally in lOFC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–d</xref>) to allow expression in lOFC axons and terminals in the BLA. This time, we implanted the optical fiber only unilaterally in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–d</xref>), so that green light (532 nm, ~10 mW), delivered again during Pavlovian conditioning for 5 s during the delivery and retrieval of each reward during each cue, would inhibit both the ipsilateral and contralateral lOFC input to the BLA of only one hemisphere. In these subjects, we also expressed the inhibitory designer receptor human M4 muscarinic receptor (hM4Di) unilaterally in the BLA of the hemisphere opposite to the optical fiber and in that same hemisphere placed a guide cannula over the lOFC near hM4Di-expressing BLA axons and terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–d</xref>). This allowed us to infuse the hM4Di ligand clozapine-<italic>n</italic>-oxide (CNO; 1 mM in 0.25 µl) prior to the PIT test to unilaterally inhibit BLA terminals in the lOFC, which are largely ipsilateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>), in the hemisphere opposite to that for which we had inhibited lOFC→BLA projection activity during Pavlovian conditioning. Thus, we optically inhibited the lOFC→BLA stimulus-outcome learning pathway in one hemisphere at each stimulus-outcome pairing during Pavlovian conditioning, and chemogenetically inhibited the putative BLA→lOFC retrieval pathway in the opposite hemisphere during the PIT test in which stimulus-outcome memories must be used to guide choice. If BLA→lOFC projection activity mediates the retrieval of the sensory-specific associative memory that requires activation of lOFC→BLA projections to be encoded then we will have bilaterally disconnected the circuit, attenuating encoding in one hemisphere and retrieval in the other, thereby disrupting the ability to use the stimulus-outcome memories to guide choice behavior during the PIT test. If, however, these pathways mediate parallel information streams, that is, independent components of the stimulus-outcome memory, the expression of PIT should be intact because one of each pathway is undisrupted to mediate its individual component during each phase. The control group received identical procedures with the exception that viruses lacked ArchT and hM4Di (<italic>N</italic> = 8). To control for unilateral inhibition of each pathway without disconnecting the circuit, a second control group (<italic>N</italic> = 8) received the same procedures as the experimental contralateral ArchT/hM4Di disconnection group, except with BLA hM4Di and the lOFC guide cannula in the same hemisphere as the optical fiber used to inactivate lOFC axons and terminals in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, during the PIT test for this group the BLA→lOFC pathway was chemogenetically inactivated in the same hemisphere in which the lOFC→BLA pathway had been optically inactivated during Pavlovian conditioning, leaving the entire circuit undisrupted in the other hemisphere.

But disconnection of lOFC→BLA projection activity during stimulus-outcome learning from BLA→lOFC projection activity during the PIT test attenuated the ability to use such memories to guide choice behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>; Group x Lever: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,24)</sub> = 5.57, p=0.03; Group: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,24)</sub> = 0.47, p=0.50; Lever: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,24)</sub> = 1.39, p=0.21; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Whereas in the control group cue presentation significantly biased choice toward the action earning the same predicted reward, this outcome-specific PIT effect did not occur in the disconnection group. Rather, during the cues rats in the disconnection group showed a non-discriminate elevation in pressing on both levers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Thus, disconnection of lOFC→BLA projection activity during stimulus-outcome learning from BLA→lOFC projection activity during the retrieval of this information attenuated the ability to use stimulus-outcome memories to bias choice behavior, indicating that the lOFC and BLA form a bidirectional circuit for the encoding (lOFC→BLA) and use (BLA→lOFC) of appetitive stimulus-outcome memories.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using fiber photometry bulk calcium imaging, cell-type and pathway-specific optogenetic inhibition, multiplexed optogenetic and chemogenetic inhibition, Pavlovian conditioning, and the outcome selective PIT test, we explored the function of the BLA and its interaction with the lOFC in the ability to learn detailed cue-reward memories and use them to guide decision making. Such memories are critical to the ability to use environmental cues to infer which specific rewards are likely to be available in the current state and, thus, to choose adaptively. We found that the BLA is robustly activated at the time of stimulus-outcome pairing and that this activity is necessary for sensory-specific, appetitive associative memories to be encoded, so that they can later influence decision making. We also found that this BLA activity is not necessary for the appetitive learning that supports general conditional goal-approach behavior, which does not require a detailed stimulus-outcome memory. lOFC input to the BLA supports its function in encoding stimulus-outcome memories and BLA projections back to the lOFC mediate the use of these memories to guide decision making. Thus, the lOFC→BLA→lOFC circuit regulates the encoding and subsequent use of the state-dependent and sensory-specific reward memories that are critical for decision making between two appetitive choices.</p><p>BLA neurons were found to be robustly activated at the time of stimulus-reward pairing as well as at cue onset, consistent with prior evidence that the BLA is activated by both rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fontanini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Malvaez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roesch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2005</xref>) and their predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beyeler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Malvaez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Muramoto et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Paton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schoenbaum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tye and Janak, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tye et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, the cues triggered a transient elevation in BLA activity at their onset, rather than a sustained elevation throughout their 2 min duration, perhaps suggesting that such activity reflects the state change, rather than the state per se. Both the cue and reward responses were present from the first conditioning session and persisted throughout training. That we detected cue responses on the first day of training before associative learning had occurred is, perhaps, unexpected and likely due to the novelty of the auditory stimuli during early training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bordi and LeDoux, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bordi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cromwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Romanski et al., 1993</xref>). Indeed, we found that presentation of identical auditory stimuli unpaired with reward activated BLA neurons during the first session, much like the reward-predictive cues, but, in contrast to the reward-predictive cues, this response habituated over subsequent sessions. Thus, BLA cue responses later in training result from appetitive associative learning. Whereas we detected reward responses throughout training, prior data have demonstrated a shift in BLA responses from the reward to predictive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>) and little response to rewards in the absence of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Malvaez et al., 2015</xref>). The persistent reward response detected here likely results from the uncertainty of reward timing during the cues, which set the context for the intermittent availability of one specific reward. Another possibility is that it relates to the learning of two unique cue-reward contingencies, which was not the case in prior tasks. Nonetheless, the data show the BLA to be robustly activated at the time of stimulus-reward pairing in a task known to engender the encoding of detailed, sensory-specific stimulus-outcome memories.</p><p>We also found the BLA to be necessary, specifically at the time of stimulus-reward pairing, to encode the detailed stimulus-outcome memories. This is consistent with evidence that either pre- or post-training BLA lesion or pre-test inactivation disrupts appetitive conditional behaviors that rely on a sensory-specific, stimulus-outcome memory in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blundell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corbit and Balleine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Derman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hatfield et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lichtenberg and Wassum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Malvaez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</xref>) and in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Murray and Izquierdo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Málková et al., 1997</xref>). Leveraging the temporal resolution of optogenetics, we demonstrated that BLA principal neurons mediate the <italic>encoding</italic> of such memories, and specifically that activity at the time of reward experience during a cue is critical. Inhibiting the BLA during reward experience attenuated the animal’s ability to link that specific rewarding event to the associated cue, disrupting the encoding of the sensory-specific stimulus-outcome memories to the extent that animals were unable to later use those memories to guide choice behavior. Future work is needed to reveal the precise information content encoded by BLA neurons during reward experience that confers their necessary function in the formation of stimulus-outcome memories, although BLA neurons will respond selectively to unique food rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), which could support the generation of sensory-specific reward memories. Whether BLA cue responses are also important for encoding stimulus-outcome memories is another important question exposed by the current results.</p><p>BLA activity during stimulus-outcome pairing was critical for encoding a detailed, outcome-specific, appetitive cue-reward memory, but it was not necessary for the learning underlying the development a non-specific Pavlovian conditional goal-approach response, consistent with data collected with BLA lesions or inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corbit and Balleine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Everitt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hatfield et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Malvaez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Parkinson et al., 2000</xref>). Although influenced by positive outcome valence, such responses do not require a rich sensory-specific representation of the predicted reward. Thus, BLA neurons appear not to be required to reinforce an appetitive Pavlovian response policy. Rather, the BLA mediates the encoding of the association between a cue and the specific reward it predicts, which includes encoding of the sensory-specific features of the reward. Optical stimulation of BLA neurons will, however, augment conditional goal-approach responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Servonnet et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting BLA activation is capable of influencing such appetitive conditional behaviors.</p><p>Input from the lOFC was found to facilitate the BLA’s function in mediating the encoding of stimulus-outcome memories. This expands upon previous findings that pre-training lOFC lesions disrupt behaviors that require a sensory-specific stimulus-outcome memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Machado and Bachevalier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pickens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pickens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rhodes and Murray, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Scarlet et al., 2012</xref>), that the lOFC is active during cue-reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Constantinople et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Miller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Paton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wallis and Miller, 2003</xref>), and that encoding of expected outcomes in the BLA requires an intact lOFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lucantonio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Saddoris et al., 2005</xref>). Our data add to this literature by revealing the causal contribution of the direct lOFC→BLA pathway, specifically at the time of stimulus-outcome pairing, to the formation of detailed, outcome-specific, appetitive associative memories. Indeed, lOFC neurons respond to rewarding events during learning to signal reward expectations that may support learning in downstream structures, such as the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stalnaker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Stalnaker et al., 2018</xref>). Prior evidence also indicates that activity in lOFC→BLA projections drives the encoding of the incentive value of a specific rewarding event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Malvaez et al., 2019</xref>). Such incentive value is dependent upon one’s current physiological state (e.g. food has high value when hungry, but low when sated). Thus, lOFC→BLA projections may be responsible for linking states, defined by internal physiological and external predictive cues, to the specific rewarding events with which they are associated. The precise information content conveyed by lOFC→BLA projections and how it is used in the BLA is a critical question for follow-up investigation.</p><p>We also discovered that the lOFC and BLA form a bidirectional circuit for the encoding and use of appetitive stimulus-outcome memories. The BLA has been implicated in appetitive decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Costa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Costa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Izquierdo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Orsini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Stolyarova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wellman et al., 2005</xref>) and has been shown in non-human primates to interact with the lOFC in that regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fiuzat et al., 2017</xref>). We previously found that BLA activity correlates with and regulates the ability to use sensory-specific, appetitive, stimulus-outcome memories to guide choice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Malvaez et al., 2015</xref>). This function is mediated via direct BLA→lOFC projections, but does not require activation of lOFC→BLA projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Here, using a serial disconnection procedure, we found that during reward choice BLA→lOFC projection activity mediates the use of the sensory-specific associative information that is learned via activation of lOFC→BLA projections. Thus, lOFC→BLA→lOFC is a functional circuit for the encoding (lOFC→BLA) and subsequent use (BLA→lOFC) of sensory-specific reward memories to inform decision making. Interestingly, the serial disconnection disrupted the outcome-specificity of PIT but, unlike bilateral BLA or lOFC→BLA inhibition during learning, allowed the cues to non-discriminately excite instrumental activity. This could have resulted from incomplete disconnection. But it may indicate that lOFC→BLA projections facilitate the encoding of a broader set of information than that being transmitted back to the lOFC by BLA→lOFC projection activity during choice. BLA→lOFC projections mediate use of the sensory-specific components of the reward memory needed to allow animals to know during a cue which specific reward is predicted and thus which action to select, but lOFC→BLA projections may facilitate the encoding of additional features of the memory, including those capable of promoting food- or reward-seeking activity more broadly. The encoding of such information would have been disrupted by bilateral lOFC→BLA or BLA inactivation during learning, but in the disconnection experiment could have been learned in the hemisphere that did not receive lOFC→BLA inactivation and subsequently retrieved via an alternate BLA pathway. Indeed, BLA→lOFC are not the only amygdala projections involved in reward memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corbit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fisher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kochli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parkes and Balleine, 2013</xref>). lOFC activity in both humans and non-human animals can encode the features of an expected reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Howard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Howard and Kahnt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klein-Flügge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lopatina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McDannald et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pritchard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">van Duuren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>) and the lOFC has been proposed to be critical for using this information to guide decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bradfield and Hart, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Delamater, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Groman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Keiflin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rudebeck and Rich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rudebeck and Murray, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sharpe and Schoenbaum, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>). This might especially be the case in novel situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gardner and Schoenbaum, 2020</xref>). The PIT test is a novel choice scenario in which the subjects must use the cues to represent the sensory-specific features of the predicted reward, infer which reward is most likely to be available and, therefore, which action will be the most beneficial. lOFC→BLA projection activity, perhaps via relaying reward expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stalnaker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Stalnaker et al., 2018</xref>), regulates the associative learning that may allow subsequent activity in BLA→lOFC projections to promote the representation of a specific predicted reward in the lOFC to enable decision making. The precise information content conveyed by each component of the lOFC-BLA circuit and how it is used in the receiving structure is a critical follow-up question that will require a cellular resolution investigation of the activity of each pathway. Another critical question is whether this circuitry similarly mediates appetitive associative learning and its influence on decision making in females. The exclusion of female subjects is a clear limitation of this study, though females do show similar performance in the task used here and also require the BLA and lOFC for its performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</xref>). Whether this lOFC-BLA architecture also underlies sensory-specific aversive memory is also a question ripe for further exploration.</p><p>The BLA, via input from the lOFC, helps to link environmental cues to the specific rewards they predict and, via projections back to the lOFC, to allow the cues to access those representations to influence decision making. An inability to either properly encode reward memories or to use such memories to inform decision making can lead to ill-informed motivations and decisions. This is characteristic of the cognitive symptoms underlying many psychiatric diseases, including substance use disorder. The OFC-BLA circuit is known to be altered by addictive substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arguello et al., 2017</xref>) and to be dysfunctional in myriad psychiatric illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goldstein and Volkow, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Passamonti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ressler and Mayberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sladky et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, these data may also aid our understanding and treatment of substance use disorder and other mental illnesses marked by disruptions to decision making.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

A 22-gauge stainless-steel guide cannula was implanted unilaterally above the lOFC (AP:+3.0; ML:±3.2: DV: −4.0) of the BLA-hM4Di hemisphere to target the hM4D(Gi)-expressing axonal terminals, which are predominantly ipsilateral. This allowed subsequent optical inhibition of lOFC terminals in the BLA of one hemisphere and chemogenetic inhibition of BLA terminals in the lOFC of the other hemisphere, thus disconnecting the putative lOFC→BLA→lOFC circuit.

For optogenetic manipulations, the chambers were outfitted with an Intensity Division Fiberoptic Rotary Joint (Doric Lenses, Quebec, QC, Canada) connecting the output fiber optic patch cords to a laser (Dragon Lasers, ChangChun, JiLin, China) positioned outside of the chamber.</p><p>Each chamber contained two retractable levers that could be inserted to the left and right of a recessed food-delivery port (magazine) in the front wall. A photobeam entry detector was positioned at the entry to the food port. Each chamber was equipped with a syringe pump to deliver 20% sucrose solution in 0.1 ml increments through a stainless-steel tube into one well of the food port and a pellet dispenser to deliver 45 mg purified chocolate food pellets (Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ) into another well. Both a tone and white noise generator were attached to individual speakers on the wall opposite the levers and food-delivery port. A 3-watt, 24-volt house light mounted on the top of the back wall opposite the food-delivery port provided illumination and a fan mounted to the outer chamber provided ventilation and external noise reduction. Behavioral procedures were similar to that we have described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lichtenberg and Wassum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Malvaez et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Magazine conditioning</title><p>Rats first received one day of training to learn where to receive the sucrose and food pellet rewards.

CS-reward pairings were counterbalanced at the start of each experiment. For half the subjects, tone was paired with sucrose and noise with pellets, with the other half receiving the opposite arrangement. Each session consisted of eight tone and eight white noise presentations, with the exception of the fiber photometry experiments, in which rats received four of each CS/session to reduce session time and, thus, minimize the effects of photobleaching. During each 2 min CS, the associated reward was delivered on a 30 s random-time schedule, resulting in an average of 4 stimulus-reward pairings per trial. For the fiber photometry experiments, there was a minimum 15 s probe period after CS onset before the first reward delivery to allow us to dissociate signal fluctuations due to CS onset from those due to reward delivery/retrieval. CSs were delivered pseudo-randomly with a variable 2–4 min ITI (mean = 3 min).</p><p>Procedures were identical for the unpaired CS<sub>Ø</sub> control fiber photometry experiment, except no rewards were delivered during Pavlovian training.

On the day following the last CS<sub>Ø</sub> session, these subjects received one session with non-contingent, unpredicted deliveries of sucrose and food pellets, each delivered on a 30 s random-time schedule during 4, 2 min periods (variable 2–4 min ITI, mean = 3 min), resulting in an average of 16 deliveries of each outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Instrumental conditioning</title><p>Rats were then given 11 days, minimum, of instrumental conditioning. They received two separate training sessions per day, one with the left lever and one with the right lever, separated by at least 1 hr. Each action was reinforced with a different outcome (e.g. left press-chocolate pellets/right press-sucrose solution; counterbalanced with respect to the Pavlovian contingencies). Each session terminated after 30 outcomes had been earned or 45 min had elapsed. Actions were continuously reinforced on the first day and then escalated ultimately to a random-ratio 20 schedule of reinforcement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Outcome-selective Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer test</title><p>Following Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, rats received an outcome-selective Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) test. On the day prior to the PIT test, rats were given a single 30 min extinction session during which both levers were available but pressing was not reinforced to establish a low level of responding. During the PIT test, both levers were continuously present, but pressing was not reinforced. After 5 min of lever-pressing extinction, each 2 min CS was presented separately four times in pseudorandom order, separated by a fixed 4 min inter-trial interval. No rewards were delivered during CS presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Data collection</title><p>Lever presses and/or discrete entries into the food-delivery port were recorded continuously for each session.

We simultaneously imaged GCaMP6f and control fluorescence in the BLA using a commercial fiber photometry system (Neurophotometrics Ltd., San Diego, CA). Two light-emitting LEDs (470 nm: Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent GCaMP fluorescence; 415 nm: autofluorescence, motion artifact, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent GCaMP fluorescence) were reflected off dichroic mirrors and coupled via a patch cord (fiber core diameter, 200 µm; Doric Lenses) to the implanted optical fiber. The intensity of the light for excitation was adjusted to ∼80 µW at the tip of the patch cord. Fluorescence emission was passed through a 535 nm bandpass filter and focused onto the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera sensor through a tube lens. Samples were collected at 20 Hz, interleaved between the 415 and 470 excitation channels, using a custom Bonsai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>) workflow. Time stamps of task events were collected simultaneously through an additional synchronized camera aimed at the Med Associates interface, which sent light pulses coincident with task events. Signals were saved using Bonsai software and exported to MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) for analysis. Recordings were collected unilaterally from the hemisphere with the strongest fluorescence signal in the 470 channel at the start of the experiment, which was kept consistent throughout the remainder of the experiment. Animals were habituated to the optical tether during the magazine conditioning sessions, but no light was delivered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optogenetic inhibition of BLA neurons</title><p>Optogenetic inhibition was used to attenuate the activity of ArchT-expressing BLA neurons at the time of stimulus-outcome pairing during each CS during each Pavlovian conditioning session. Animals were habituated to the optical tether (200 µm, 0.22 NA, Doric) during the magazine conditioning sessions, but no light was delivered. During each Pavlovian conditioning session, green light (532 nm; 10 mW) was delivered to the BLA via a laser (Dragon Lasers, ChangChun) connected through a ceramic mating sleeve (Thorlabs) to the ferrule implanted on the rat. Light was delivered continuously for 5 s concurrent with each reward delivery. If the reward was retrieved (first food-port entry after reward delivery) while the light was still being delivered (i.e. within 5 s of reward delivery), then the light delivery was extended to 5 s from the time of the retrieval. If the reward was retrieved after the laser had gone off, then the retrieval entry triggered an additional 5 s continuous illumination. To control for the overall amount of inhibition, a separate control group received green light during the 2 min preCS baseline periods with the same number, duration, and pattern as the experimental group. Light effects were estimated to be restricted to the BLA based on predicted irradiance values (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/cgi-bin/graph/chart.php">https://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/cgi-bin/graph/chart.php</ext-link>). Following Pavlovian conditioning, rats proceeded through instrumental conditioning and the PIT test, as above. Light was not delivered during these subsequent phases of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetic inhibition of lOFC→BLA projections</title><p>Optogenetic inhibition was used to attenuate the activity of ArchT-expressing lOFC→BLA terminals at the time of stimulus-outcome pairing during each CS during each Pavlovian conditioning session.

That is, whether lOFC→BLA→lOFC is a functional circuit for the encoding (lOFC→BLA) and subsequent use for guiding decision making (BLA→lOFC) of appetitive, sensory-specific, stimulus-outcome memories. To achieve the serial circuit disconnection, in the experimental group, we optically inactivated ipsilateral and contralateral lOFC input to the BLA of only one hemisphere during stimulus-outcome pairing during Pavlovian conditioning, and then chemogenetically inactivated predominantly ipsilateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>) BLA axons and terminals in the lOFC of the other hemisphere during the PIT test. This leaves one of each pathway undisrupted to mediate the stimulus-outcome learning (lOFC→BLA) and retrieval (BLA→lOFC), but if lOFC→BLA→lOFC forms a functional stimulus-outcome memory circuit, then we will have disconnected the circuit in each hemisphere.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Optogenetic inhibition of lOFC→BLA projections during Pavlovian conditioning</title><p>Optogenetic inhibition was used to attenuate the activity of ArchT-expressing lOFC→BLA terminals of one hemisphere at the time of stimulus-outcome pairing (reward delivery and retrieval) during each CS during each Pavlovian conditioning session.

For the contralateral ArchT/hM4Di group, chemogenetic inhibition occurred in the hemisphere opposite to the one that received optical inhibition of lOFC→BLA projections during learning, thus achieving the disconnection. In a separate ipsilateral control group, the chemogenetic inhibition occurred on the same side as optical inhibition of lOFC→BLA projections during learning, leaving the entire circuit undisrupted in one hemisphere, while controlling for unilateral inhibition of each pathway. We selected chemogenetic inhibition so it could be multiplexed with optogenetic inhibition and to allow inhibition throughout the duration of the PIT test. CNO (Tocris Bioscience, Sterling Heights, MI) was dissolved in aCSF to 1 mM and 0.25 µL was intracranially infused over 1 min into the lOFC as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Injectors were left in place for at least one additional min to allow for drug diffusion. The PIT test commenced within 5–10 min following infusion. CNO dose was selected based on evidence of both its behavioral effectiveness and ability to attenuate the activity of hM4Di-expressing BLA terminals in the lOFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>). We have also demonstrated that this dose of CNO when infused into the lOFC has no effect on reward-related behavior in the absence of the hM4Di transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Ex vivo electrophysiology</title><p>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used to validate the efficacy of optical inhibition of BLA principal neuron activity and lOFC terminal activity in the BLA.

The signal for axonal expression of hM4D(Gi)-mCherry in terminals in the lOFC was immunohistochemically amplified following procedures described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, floating coronal sections were rinsed in PBS and blocked for 1–2 hr at room temperature in a solution of 10% normal goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 dissolved in PBS and then incubated in blocking solution containing rabbit anti-DsRed polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA) with gentle agitation at 4°C for 18–22 hr. Sections were next rinsed in blocking solution and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (1:500; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for 2 hr. Slices were mounted on slides and coverslipped with ProLong Gold mounting medium with DAPI. Images were acquired using a Keyence BZ-X710 microscope (Keyence, El Segundo, CA) with a 4x, 10x, and 20x objective (CFI Plan Apo), CCD camera, and BZ-X Analyze software or a Zeiss apotome confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and Zeiss Zen Blue software (Zeiss). Subjects with off-target viral, fiber, and/or cannula placements were removed from the dataset (Fiber photometry: <italic>N</italic> = 2; Fiber photometry CS<sub>Ø</sub> control <italic>N</italic> = 0; BLA ArchT: <italic>N</italic> = 2; BLA ArchT yoked control: <italic>N</italic> = 1; Contralateral disconnection, <italic>N</italic> = 6; Ipsilateral control <italic>N</italic> = 7).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>Behavioral data were processed with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Left and/or right lever presses and/or entries into the food-delivery port were collected continuously for each training and test session. Acquisition of the Pavlovian conditional food-port approach response was assessed by computing an elevation ratio of the rate of entries into the food-delivery port (entries/min) during the CS prior to reward delivery (CS-probe) relative to 2 min baseline periods immediately prior to CS onset [(CS probe entry rate)/(CS probe entry rate +preCS entry rate)]. Data were averaged across trials for each CS and then averaged across the two CSs. We also compared the rate of food-port entries between the CS probe and the preCS baseline periods (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2a</xref>). Press rates on the last day of instrumental training were averaged across levers and compared between groups to test for any differences in the acquisition of lever press responding during instrumental training. No significant group differences were detected in any of the experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2b</xref>). For the PIT test, lever pressing during the 2 min baseline periods immediately prior to the onset of each CS was compared with that during the 2 min CS periods. For both the baseline and CS periods, lever pressing was separated for presses on the lever that, during training, earned the same outcome as the presented cue (i.e. preCS-Same and CS-Same presses) versus those on the other available lever (i.e. preCS-Different and CS-Different presses). To evaluate the influence of CS presentation on lever pressing, we computed an elevation ratio for each lever [(CS-Same presses)/(CS-Same presses + preCS Same presses)] and [(CS-Different presses)/(CS-Different presses + preCS Different presses)]. In all cases, there were no significant differences in baseline presses between levers in the absence of the CSs (Lever: lowest p=0.33, F<sub>1,14</sub> = 1.02), and no effect of group on baseline lever pressing (Group: lowest p=0.54, F<sub>2,23</sub> = 0.63; Group x Lever lowest p=0.21, F<sub>1,14</sub> = 1.71). To evaluate the influence of CS presentation on food-port entries, that is, the conditional goal-approach responses, we also computed an elevation ratio [(CS entries)/(CS entries + preCS entries)]. Data were averaged across trials for each CS and then averaged across the two CSs. We also compared the rate of pressing on each lever and, separately, food-port entries between the CS and preCS baseline periods (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1c–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2c–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2c–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2c–d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Fiber photometry data analysis</title><p>Data were pre-processed using a custom-written pipeline in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Data from the 415 nm isosbestic control channel were used to correct for motion artifacts and photobleaching. Using least-squares linear regression, the 415 signal was fit to the 470 signal. Change in fluorescence (ΔF/F) at each time point was calculated by subtracting the fitted 415 signal from the 470 signal and normalizing to the fitted 415 data [(470-fitted 415)/(fitted 415)] (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The ΔF/F data were then Z-scored [(ΔF/F - mean ΔF/F)/std(ΔF/F)]. Using a custom MATLAB workflow, Z-scored traces were then aligned to CS onset, reward delivery, reward retrieval (first food-port entry after reward delivery), and food-port entries without reward present during the CS probe period (after CS before first reward delivery) during the CS for each trial. Peak magnitude and AUC were calculated on the Z-scored trace for each trial using 3 s pre-event baseline and 3 s post-event windows. Data were averaged across trials and then across CSs. Session data were excluded if no transient calcium fluctuations were detected on the 470 nm channel above the isosbestic channel or if poor linear fit was detected due to excessive motion artifact. To examine the progression in BLA activity across training, we compared data across conditioning sessions 1, 2, 3/4, 5/6, and 7/8. Thus, data from the mid and latter training sessions were averaged across bins of two training sessions. Subjects without reliable data from at least one session per bin were excluded (CS +<italic>N</italic> = 5; CS<sub>Ø</sub><italic>N</italic> = 1). We were able to obtain reliable imaging data from all of the eight training sessions from <italic>N</italic> = 8 of the 11 total final subjects that received CS-reward pairing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Ex vivo electrophysiology</title><p>The number of action potentials evoked by suprathreshold current injection was compared before and during exposure to green light to confirm the inhibitory effect of ArchT in BLA principal neurons.

Using a series of sophisticated experiments with optogenetics and pharmacogenetics, the authors show that interactions between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the lateral part of the orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) play a critical role in learning to predict the identity of outcome from a cue, but not in valuing valence of outcomes.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Naoshige Uchida as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study examined the neural mechanism underlying stimulus-outcome associations. Using a series of sophisticated experiments with otpogenetics and pharmacogenetics, the authors show that interactions between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the lateral part of the orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) play critical role in learning to predict the identity of outcome predicted by a cue, but not in learning to predict reward generally. These results extend our understanding of how BLA and lOFC regulate associative learning.</p><p>As you will see below, all the reviewers agreed that this study addresses an important question, the authors have performed sophisticated and sound experiments, and the manuscript is written clearly. However, they raised various points that need to be clarified or addressed. The reviewers do not think that additional experiments are required, and all of the concerns can be addressed by additional analysis or revising text. In particular, a little more careful discussions on interpretation of results (e.g. whether the same information is transmitted between lOFC and BLA requires neuronal activity measurements) will be useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Do the eYFP and ArchT control groups show equivalent baseline levels of outcome-specific lever pressing in the PIT procedure absent the Pavlovian cues? There seems to be a lot more variability in the ArchT or ArchT/hM4Di groups potentially reflecting an overall increase or decrease in the amount of instrumental conditioning leading up to the PIT procedure? Particularly in the last experiment the serial disconnections appear to cause a general enhancement of PIT.</p><p>Are their instances in which the animals attempt to retrieve rewards during the cue presentation when no reward has been delivered? How are these dealt with in the GCaMP analyses and was optogenetic inhibition delivered surrounding these events? If not, it seems like these &quot;false alarms&quot; might function to degrade sensory-specific reward memories on their own and the optogenetic inhibition might hasten the effect of these errors. This leads into a broader question of what precisely do the authors believe the inhibition surrounding reward retrieval events is doing to the sensory-specific memory? Is it being prevented from forming entirely because the inhibition is done in all eight sessions? Is it simply weakening it? Saying it affects encoding is accurate but a bit vague.</p><p>The authors tested for unilateral, ipsilateral effects of the optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulations in the same animals in which the full serial disconnection approach was tested. The unilateral manipulations did not have an effect on PIT performance, but I would like to see that data plotted separately for the unilateral groups broken out by unilateral manipulations of the BLA inputs to lOFC and vice versa, rather than collapsing across the ArchT and hM4Di manipulations. Also, a stronger test of their hypothesis would be to contrast the unilateral performance to the serial disconnection performance (especially when the unilateral is aggregated). However, in comparing Figure 5 and Figure 5-2 it would appear that the main effect of the serial disconnection is not to impede an enhancement of outcome-specific PIT (elevated lever pressing compared to baseline for the unilateral, ipsilateral and bilateral, contralateral manipulations when the CS and lever associations are the same appears intact), but rather to disrupt outcome-specific PIT when there is a mismatch between the CS and the lever reward associations. This appears very different from the pattern of effect from bilateral inhibition of lOFC inputs to BLA, which argues against the hypothesis that the same information is being coded within each part of the circuitry.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68617.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>[…] As you will see below, all the reviewers agreed that this study addresses an important question, the authors have performed sophisticated and sound experiments, and the manuscript is written clearly.

Indeed, the data do not show whether the same information is transmitted between lOFC→BLA and BLA→lOFC and that need not be the case for these projections to function in a circuit. To remedy this, we have removed the ‘same information’ language throughout the manuscript, including in the abstract (Pg. 2), results (Pg. 9-11), discussion (Pg. 13-14), and methods (Pg. 20-21).

Although the authors have run a control experiment in which they show that novelty contributes to the GCaMP responses measured in BLA at cue onset in early sessions, they do not clearly demonstrate learning related changes in GCaMP responses across sessions to either cue or reward retrieval. Thus, it isn't necessarily clear how quickly the sensory-specific reward memories are formed in BLA and if repeated stimulus-outcome pairings, particularly once general approach behavior reaches asymptote, actually serve to increasingly strengthen the memory.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this limitation that our report and are actively working to address these interesting questions in our ongoing work. Indeed, a learning related-change in the BLA response can only be inferred from the present data and is not directly demonstrated. In the present experiment the nature of the memory is tested after learning, precluding understanding of the precise time course of the development of the sensory-specific stimulus-outcome memory. Future work should incorporate an online neural and/or behavioral assessment of sensory-specific reward memory encoding during learning to well address this important question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No explanation is provided for how the transient BLA GCaMP responses at cue onset sustain stimulus-outcome memory encoding at the time of reward. A straightforward account would be a sustained response to the cue that overlaps with the GCaMP response to reward retrieval. In addition there is no attempt to transiently inactivate the entire BLA or specific pathways at cue onset to determine how simple cue encoding affects subsequent performance in the PIT paradigm.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We were somewhat surprised to see only a transient response to the CS onset. This suggests to us that perhaps there is a more sustained response elsewhere in the brain (or even in a different cell type in the BLA). Perhaps this sustained response follows the transient response detected here.</p><p>We also agree that it is an important question (and limitation of the current work) of whether the BLA response to the cue is important for S-O memories. This is also a question we are addressing on in our ongoing work.</p><p>We have acknowledged both this limitation/interesting question in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Discussion Pg. 13: “Future work is needed to reveal the precise information content encoded by BLA neurons during reward experience that confers their function in the formation of stimulus-outcome memories, though BLA neurons will respond selectively to unique food rewards (Liu et al., 2018), which could support the generation of sensory-specific reward memories. Whether BLA cue responses are also important for encoding stimulus-outcome memories is another important question exposed by the current results.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The multiplexed chemogenetic and optogenetic serial disconnection approach is too coarse a manipulation to support the claim that reciprocal connections between the BLA and lOFC support encoding and retrieval of the same information. To make this claim it is necessary to use detailed functional assays of the activity in each pathway to determine what information they code during the Pavlovian conditioning and PIT procedures.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with this excellent point. We appreciate the reviewer pointing out how our language led to an interpretation that is not supported by the current data. Indeed, the data do not show whether the same information is transmitted between lOFC→BLA and BLA→lOFC and that need not be the case for these projections to function in a circuit. To remedy this, we have removed the ‘same information’ language throughout the manuscript, including in the abstract (Pg. 2), results (Pg. 9-11), discussion (Pg. 13-14), and methods (Pg. 20-21). We have brought our framing and interpretation of the disconnection results much closer to the present data.

There seems to be a lot more variability in the ArchT or ArchT/hM4Di groups potentially reflecting an overall increase or decrease in the amount of instrumental conditioning leading up to the PIT procedure? Particularly in the last experiment the serial disconnections appear to cause a general enhancement of PIT.</p></disp-quote><p>Across all the experiments, there are no significant group differences in lever pressing in the absence of the cues. We had previously shown that there were no differences in instrumental conditioning leading up to PIT test between groups for each experiment (Figures 3-2b, 4-2b, 5-2b). In the revised manuscript, we now also include an analysis showing no group differences in same v. different lever pressing during the baseline periods of the PIT test:</p><p>Methods Pg. 24: “In all cases, there were no significant differences in baseline presses between levers in the absence of the CSs (Lever: lowest P = 0.33, F<sub>1,14</sub> = 1.02), and no effect of group on baseline lever pressing (Group: lowest P = 0.54, F<sub>2,23</sub> = 0.63; Group x Lever lowest P = 0.21, F<sub>1,14</sub> = 1.71).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are their instances in which the animals attempt to retrieve rewards during the cue presentation when no reward has been delivered? How are these dealt with in the GCaMP analyses and was optogenetic inhibition delivered surrounding these events? If not, it seems like these &quot;false alarms&quot; might function to degrade sensory-specific reward memories on their own and the optogenetic inhibition might hasten the effect of these errors.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, such instances are the majority of the entry responses during the cues and are how we quantified general approach behavior during the conditioning. All of the entry responses we show during the Pavlovian training (Figure 1h, 3e, 4e, 5e) were responses after the cue onset, prior to delivery of the first reward (‘CS probe period’) and, thus, by definition the reward was not present. We have tried to make this clearer in the manuscript:</p><p>Figure legends: “Elevation [(CS probe entry rate)/(CS probe entry rate + preCS entry rate)] in food-port entries during the CS probe period (after CS onset, before first reward delivery)…”</p><p>Results Pg. 5: “Rats demonstrated simple Pavlovian conditioning by gradually increasing their goal approach responses (entries into the food-delivery port) during the cues (after cue onset, before reward delivery) across training…”</p><p>Results Pg. 7: “Optical inhibition of BLA neurons at reward experience during Pavlovian conditioning did not impede the development of the Pavlovian conditional goal-approach response to the cue sampled prior to reward delivery…”</p><p>For the GCaMP analyses, to look for a BLA response to reward we focused only on the first food-port entry following a reward delivery, i.e., ‘reward retrieval’. Thus, the data shown in Figure 1g are not impacted by food-port entries in which a reward was absent. We have clarified this throughout the manuscript:</p><p>Legend for Figure 1: “(e) Representative examples of GCaMP6f fluorescence changes (Z-scored ∆F/F) in response to CS presentation (blue box), reward delivery (orange tick), and reward retrieval (orange triangle; first food-port entry following reward delivery) across days of training.”</p><p>Results Pg. 5: “BLA neurons were robustly activated by both cue onset and reward retrieval (first food-port entry after reward delivery) throughout Pavlovian conditioning.”</p><p>Methods Pg. 24: “Using a custom MATLAB workflow, Z-scored traces were then aligned to CS onset, reward delivery, reward retrieval (first food-port entry after reward delivery), and food-port entries without reward present during the CS probe period (after CS before first reward delivery) during the CS for each trial.”</p><p>Entries into the food-delivery port when a reward was not present were not accompanied by a BLA response. We now show these data in Figure 1—figure supplement 5 (Pg. 36). Thus, BLA responses to reward retrieval are due to the presence of reward, not the entry response itself. These data are reference in the main text:</p><p>Results Pg. 5: “There were no significant BLA activity changes detected in response to food-port entries absent reward (Figure 1-5), indicating that reward retrieval responses resulted from reward experience rather than the act of entering the food port.”</p><p>Optical inhibition was not given during entries without a reward present. See the following text from the methods on Pg. 21:</p><p>“Light was delivered continuously for 5 seconds concurrent with each reward delivery. If the reward was retrieved (first food-port entry post-delivery) while the light was still being delivered (i.e., within 5 s of reward delivery), then the light delivery was extended to 5 s post retrieval. If the reward was retrieved after the laser had gone off, then it triggered an additional 5 s continuous illumination.”</p><p>We don’t think ‘False alarms’ can well characterize entries in this task. During the cues the associated reward is delivered on a random time 30s schedule, so on average every 30s. Thus, the animals cannot predict when during the cue the reward will come and it is not possible for them to have a specific expectation of when during the cue the reward will be present. Therefore, it is not possible to have a false alarm in such a prediction. We think these entries are better characterized as anticipatory conditional responses. Because the animals are not able to precisely time when the reward will be delivered, they are encouraged to regularly check the magazine, and show quite a bit of these Pavlovian conditional goal-approach responses. Such responses may not always completely reflect an expectation of a specific reward or understanding of the cue-reward contingency (e.g., they are not always completely sensitive to outcome devaluation or degradation of the Pavlovian contingency). Given this, it is difficult to know whether the probe period entries actually degrade the sensory-specific reward memory and thus whether the optical stimulation paired with the reward hastens such an effect. Because there are so many of such entries (20+/min) and sensory-specific reward memories are well developed and intact in control subjects (in our experiments and in the many others from our and other labs using this same task), we think it somewhat unlikely that these entries have a major effect to degrade the sensory-specific reward memory. We think a more straightforward explanation of the optogenetic manipulation results is that inhibiting the BLA or lOFC→BLA projections at the time of stimulus-outcome pairing (reward experience during the cue) attenuated the animal’s ability to link the specific reward event to the associated cue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This leads into a broader question of what precisely do the authors believe the inhibition surrounding reward retrieval events is doing to the sensory-specific memory? Is it being prevented from forming entirely because the inhibition is done in all eight sessions? Is it simply weakening it? Saying it affects encoding is accurate but a bit vague.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this thoughtful comment. It prompted us to revaluate our interpretation. First, we think that it is a bit too strong to say that the inhibition in any of the experiments entirely prevented the encoding of stimulus-outcome memories, thus we have changed to the term ‘prevent’ to ‘attenuated’ throughout. We think that inhibiting the BLA or lOFC→BLA projections at the time of stimulus-outcome pairing (reward experience during the cue) attenuated the animal’s ability to link the specific reward event to the associated cue. Whether the memory is absent, weakened, or changed is an interesting question that based on the current data alone we are unable to speculate on. We can say that the encoding of the sensory-specific stimulus-outcome memory is disrupted to the extent that animals are unable to later use those memories to guide choice behavior. We’ve tried to clarify this throughout the text, for example:</p><p>Discussion Pg. 13: “Leveraging the temporal resolution of optogenetics, we demonstrated that BLA principal neurons mediate the encoding of such memories, and specifically that activity at the time of reward experience during a cue is critical. […] Whether BLA cue responses are also important for encoding stimulus-outcome memories is another important question exposed by the current results.”</p><p>Discussion Pg. 14: “Thus, lOFC→BLA projections may be responsible for linking states, defined by internal physiological and external predictive cues, to the specific rewarding events with which they are associated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors tested for unilateral, ipsilateral effects of the optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulations in the same animals in which the full serial disconnection approach was tested. The unilateral manipulations did not have an effect on PIT performance, but I would like to see that data plotted separately for the unilateral groups broken out by unilateral manipulations of the BLA inputs to lOFC and vice versa, rather than collapsing across the ArchT and hM4Di manipulations. Also, a stronger test of their hypothesis would be to contrast the unilateral performance to the serial disconnection performance (especially when the unilateral is aggregated).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. The ipsilateral control was conducted in a separate group of subjects, not the same animals in which the full serial disconnection approach was tested. This group received unilateral ipsilateral inhibition of lOFC→BLA projections during learning <italic>and</italic> BLA→lOFC projections during retrieval. We have now clarified this:</p><p>Results: Pg 10: “To control for unilateral inhibition of each pathway without disconnecting the circuit, a second control group (N = 8) received the same procedures as the experimental contralateral ArchT/hM4Di disconnection group, except with BLA hM4Di and the lOFC guide cannula in the same hemisphere as the optical fiber used to inactivate lOFC axons and terminals in the BLA (Figure 5-1). Thus, during the PIT test for this group the BLA→lOFC pathway was chemogenetically inactivated in the same hemisphere in which the lOFC→BLA pathway had been optically inactivated during Pavlovian conditioning, leaving the entire circuit undisrupted in the other hemisphere.”</p><p>As was also requested by Reviewer #1, we have now incorporated the ipsilateral control group data into the main Figure 5 (Pg. 11). As you can see below, because there were no differences between the two control groups, we combined them into a single control group for comparison to the disconnection group. The individual data points in Figure 5 are coded by control group (eYFP/mCherry solid lines and circles, ipsilateral ArchT/hM4Di dashed lines and triangles). We also provide the disaggregated data showing a comparison between all three groups (contralateral eYFP/mCherry, Ipsilateral inhibition, Contralateral disconnection) in Figure 5-2 (Pg. 43).</p><p>Results on Pg. 10: “The control group received identical procedures with the exception that viruses lacked ArchT and hM4Di (N = 8). […] These control groups did not differ on any measure and so were collapsed into a single control group [(Pavlovian training, Training: F<sub>(2.2,31.3)</sub> = 12.96, P &lt; 0.0001; Control group type: F<sub>(1,14)</sub> = 0.02, P = 0.89; Group x Training: F<sub>(7.98)</sub> = 0.76, P = 0.62) (PIT Lever presses, Lever: F<sub>(1,14)</sub> = 14.68, P = 0.002; Control group type: F<sub>(1,14)</sub> = 0.38, P = 0.55; Group x Lever: F<sub>(1,14)</sub> = 0.43, P = 0.52) (PIT Food-port entries, t<sub>14</sub> = 0.72, P = 0.48)]. See also Figure 5-2 for disaggregated control data.”</p><p>The new analyses are now reported in the results Pg. 11: “As with the bilateral inhibition experiments, the control and disconnection groups developed a Pavlovian conditional goal-approach response with training (Figure 5e; Training: F<sub>(2.8,68.1)</sub> = 28.13, P &lt; 0.0001; Group (Combined control group v. Contralateral ArchT/hM4Di- disconnection): F<sub>(1,24)</sub> = 0.46, P = 0.51; Group x Training: F<sub>(7,168)</sub> = 0.44, P = 0.88; see also Figure 5-2a), which was similarly expressed during the PIT test (Figure 5g; t<sub>24</sub> = 0.11, P = 0.91; see also Figure 5-2d).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, in comparing Figure 5 and Figure 5-2 it would appear that the main effect of the serial disconnection is not to impede an enhancement of outcome-specific PIT (elevated lever pressing compared to baseline for the unilateral, ipsilateral and bilateral, contralateral manipulations when the CS and lever associations are the same appears intact), but rather to disrupt outcome-specific PIT when there is a mismatch between the CS and the lever reward associations. This appears very different from the pattern of effect from bilateral inhibition of lOFC inputs to BLA, which argues against the hypothesis that the same information is being coded within each part of the circuitry.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we appreciate the suggestion to discuss it. Indeed, following serial disconnection of lOFC→BLA projections during learning from BLA→lOFC projections during retrieval we find that the outcome-specificity of the PIT effect is disrupted, but, unlike inhibition of the BLA itself or lOFC→BLA projections, there is a non-discriminate excitation of instrumental behavior. That is, during the cue the rats increase pressing on both levers. We now make this clear in the results.</p><p>Results Pg. 11: “Whereas in the control group cue presentation significantly biased choice towards the action earning the same predicted reward, this outcome-specific PIT effect did not occur in the disconnection group. Rather, during the cues rats in the disconnection group showed a non-discriminate elevation in pressing on both levers (Figure 5-2c).”</p><p>We also now discuss this interesting finding in the discussion. We completely agree that this suggests that the same information is <italic>not</italic> being coded in the lOFC→BLA and BLA→lOFC pathways, and regret that our prior language gave that impression. For lOFC→BLA→lOFC to be a functional stimulus-outcome memory circuit it need not be the case that the same information is coded in each part of the pathway. Generally, we think this result suggests that the BLA itself and lOFC→BLA projections mediates the learning of a broader set of information than that being transmitted back to the lOFC by BLA→lOFC projections. Some of that information, which would have been capable of being encoded in the hemisphere without lOFC→BLA projection inactivation in the disconnection group, could be capable of promoting reward-seeking activity more broadly. Thus, whereas lOFC→BLA projections facilitate the encoding of many aspects of the reward memory, BLA→lOFC projections are only needed to access the subset of sensory-specific features needed to allow animals to know during the cue which specific reward is predicted and thus which action to select. See our revised discussion.</p><p>Discussion, Pg. 14: “Here, using a serial disconnection procedure, we found that during reward choice BLA→lOFC projection activity mediates the use of the sensory-specific associative information that is learned via activation of lOFC→BLA projections. […] Indeed, BLA→lOFC are not the only amygdala projections involved in reward memory (Beyeler et al., 2016; Corbit et al., 2013; Fisher et al., 2020; Kochli et al., 2020; Morse et al., 2020; Parkes and Balleine, 2013).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
