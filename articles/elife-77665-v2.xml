transduction to modulation of the membrane properties. However, the mechanism or molecular players regulating the subsets of DAG species remain unknown. Here, we uncover the role of a conserved eukaryotic protein family, DISCO-interacting protein 2 (DIP2) as a homeostatic regulator of a chemically distinct subset of DAGs using yeast, fly, and mouse models. Genetic and chemical screens along with lipidomics analysis in yeast reveal that DIP2 prevents the toxic accumulation of specific DAGs in the logarithmic growth phase, which otherwise leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress. We also show that the fatty acyl-AMP ligase-like domains of DIP2 are essential for the redirection of the flux of DAG subspecies to storage lipid, triacylglycerols. DIP2 is associated with vacuoles through mitochondria–vacuole contact sites and such modulation of selective DAG abundance by DIP2 is found to be crucial for optimal vacuole membrane fusion and consequently osmoadaptation in yeast. Thus, the study illuminates an unprecedented DAG metabolism route and provides new insights on how cell fine-tunes DAG subspecies for cellular homeostasis and environmental adaptation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Lipids, such as fats and hormones, constitute one of the main building blocks of cells. There are thousands of different lipids each with distinctive chemical properties that allow them to carry out specific roles. For example, a group of lipids called diacylglycerols help cells perform a myriad of tasks, like sensing external signals, making membranes, and storing energy. The production and breakdown of diacylglycerols is therefore tightly regulated. However, very little is known about the molecules involved in this metabolic process.</p><p>One possible candidate is the enzyme DIP2 which is comprised of a protein module known as FAAL (short for fatty acyl-AMP ligase). FAAL belongs to a family of enzymes that synthesize lipid-like molecules in bacteria. In 2021, a group of researchers tracked the evolutionary trajectory of these bacterial proteins and found that most of them were lost in eukaryotes, such as animals and fungi. FAAL-like proteins, however, had been retained through evolution and incorporated in to DIP2.</p><p>Here, Mondal, Kinatukara et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2021 study – have used a combination of genetic and biochemical experiments to investigate whether and how DIP2 contributes to lipid metabolism in eukaryotes. They found that yeast cells without the gene for DIP2 had higher levels of diacylglycerols which hampered the shape and function of certain cellular compartments. The mutant cells were also unable to convert diacylglycerols in to another group of lipids which are involved in energy storage. This effect was observed in fruit flies and mice lacking DIP2, suggesting that this role for DIP2 is conserved across most eukaryotes.</p><p>Further experiments in yeast cells revealed that unlike other enzymes that metabolize diacylglycerols, DIP2 only acted on a sub-population of diacylglycerols at specific locations and times. Furthermore, yeast cells lacking DIP2 could still grow under ideal conditions, but could not cope with high or low salt concentrations in their surroundings, suggesting that the enzyme helps cells deal with environmental stresses.</p><p>Since DIP2 is found in most eukaryotes, understanding how it works could be useful for multiple branches of biology. For example, some pathogenic fungi that cause diseases in crop plants and humans also rely on DIP2. Further studies are needed to better understand the role that DIP2 plays in other eukaryotic species which may shed light on other processes the enzyme is involved in<bold>.</bold></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DIP2</kwd><kwd>diacylglycerol</kwd><kwd>fatty acyl-AMP ligase</kwd><kwd>membrane contact site</kwd><kwd>Opisthokonta</kwd><kwd>triacylglycerol</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mondal</surname><given-names>Sudipta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kinatukara</surname><given-names>Priyadarshan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001501</institution-id><institution>University Grants Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shambhavi</surname><given-names>Sakshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/I/15/2/502058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamat</surname><given-names>Siddhesh S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SR/FST/LSII-043/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamat</surname><given-names>Siddhesh S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>J.C.

The physicochemical properties of different lipids are attributed to the bilayer formation, regulation of membrane protein activity, membrane curvature, and fusion–fission processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harayama and Riezman, 2018</xref>). Diacylglycerol (DAG) is one such crucial bioactive lipid functioning at the crossroads of cell signalling and core metabolic pathways including membrane biogenesis and fat storage. Intriguingly, a growing body of evidence suggests that chemically defined subsets of DAGs, with specific fatty acid (FA) tails, determine the fate of fundamental cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Marignani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schuhmacher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Ware et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, precise regulation of DAG subspecies through selective formation and degradation is crucial while the identity of molecular players and their mechanisms remain unexplored.</p><p>A key step of lipid metabolism is the incorporation of FA of different chain lengths and unsaturation in lipids during biosynthesis or remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grevengoed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Watkins, 1997</xref>). In either case, FA is activated via adenylation reaction using ATP molecules by fatty acyl-CoA ligases (FACLs), a member of the ANL superfamily of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gulick, 2009</xref>). However, a recently identified homologue of FACLs, named fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) also activate FA but redirect them to 4′-phosphopantetheine coupled to acyl-carrier protein (ACP) in bacteria. The complex lipids of Mycobacteria, lipopeptides in several bacteria are the classical examples of such metabolic diversions created by FAALs, where they crosstalk with polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arora et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goyal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Trivedi et al., 2004</xref>). We have recently identified a distant orthologue of FAALs as a part of a conserved three-domain protein called DIP2 across the eukaryotic supergroup Opisthokonta (fungi and animals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Patil et al., 2021</xref>). However, paradoxically, most of the opisthokonts have lost PKS/NRPS gene cluster, suggesting the emergence of possible alternate functions of these FAAL orthologues. Recently, a loss of virulence has been reported when FAAL-like domain (FLD)-containing protein, CPS1, a DIP2 orthologue, is mutated in either plant pathogenic fungi, which causes rice blast and wheat head scab, or human pathogenic fungus, that cause valley fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Narra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, DIP2 has been shown to be crucial for axonal branching, neurite sprouting, and dendritic spine morphogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ma et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ma et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ma et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nitta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Noblett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Xing et al., 2020</xref>). Three paralogues of DIP2 in humans have been implicated as a potential risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Egger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jiao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Poelmans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rudin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Larsson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Despite these striking physiological consequences, our understanding of how the loss of DIP2 contributes to pathogenesis is limited by the lack of information on its cellular function.</p><p>Here, we report the previously unrecognized function for the unique FLD-containing protein, DIP2, which ensures a metabolic redirection of a defined subset of DAGs towards triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids in yeast. We provide evidence that the DIP2-mediated DAG metabolism route is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice. The mutational study suggests that the canonical enzymatic function of FLD, that is, FA activation via adenylation, is crucial for the function of DIP2 in DAG to TAG conversion. Aberrations in this metabolic flux in the absence of DIP2 trigger a homeostatic signal called unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway leading to ER stress. Interestingly, we find that DIP2 primarily localizes to mitochondria as patches while it is associated with vacuolar surface through mitochondria–vacuole contacts. Using loss and gain of function experiments, we reveal the role of DIP2-mediated DAG regulation in osmoadaptation by facilitating vacuole fusion–fission homeostasis in yeast. Overall, the work presents the discovery of a key regulator of DAG subspecies in yeast and assigns the physiological role of overlooked DAG subspecies in fundamental cellular processes, that will strengthen the emerging paradigm of lipid-mediated functional diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DIP2 is a conserved and non-canonical player in DAG metabolism across Opisthokonta</title><p>Using a phylogenetic approach, we identified that FLDs underwent two independent events of duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The prokaryotic FAALs were recruited early in eukaryotes along with PKS/NRPS systems in several Protozoa, Bikonta (mainly plants and algae), and Fungi. Subsequently, a highly diverged FLD went through the first duplication to produce a tandemly fused FLD didomain in all opisthokonts (except Basidiomycota fungi). The second duplication event occurred in the vertebrates resulting in multiple paralogues of DIP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Though FLDs cluster with prokaryotic and plant FAALs, they segregate as subclusters that are specific to FLD1 and FLD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Further analyses revealed that both the FLDs retain the ancestral motifs of the ANL superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gulick, 2009</xref>) while gaining exclusive variations in several motifs, unique to each FLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The divergence of Opisthokonta FLDs from prokaryotic FAALs can also be explained on the account of the low sequence identity (~17–21%) they share. For instance, Cmr2 (YOR093c), the yeast orthologue of DIP2 (hereafter referred to as ScDIP2), shares an average sequence identity of ~19% (~16–27%) with other DIP2 proteins. The tandem FLDs, FLD1 and FLD2, share an average sequence identity of ~19% and ~22% with respective FLDs from other DIP2 and ~16% for both the FLDs with the representative bacterial FAALs. Taken together, the data suggest that the duplication and divergence of FLDs have resulted in the emergence of DIP2 as a distinct gene family with possible new functions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tandem fatty acyl-AMP ligase (FAAL)-like domains (FLDs) containing protein DIP2 is a new player in the diacylglycerol (DAG) metabolism of Opisthokonta.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The distribution of FLDs in Eukaryota: three events in FLD evolution are indicated on a representative phylogenetic tree, (1) recruitment of bacteria-like standalone FLDs in eukaryotes (yellow circle), (2) domain duplication resulting in tandem FLDs in opisthokonts (red circle), and (3) whole gene duplications resulting in paralogues in vertebrates (green circle).

So, there is a possibility of C36:0 or C36:1 subset enrichment in other lipid classes of the ΔScDIP2 strain. However, the lipidomics profile of major phospholipids showed no alteration either in a chain-length-dependent or -independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–I</xref>). Interestingly, metabolic radiolabelling showed a moderate but significant depletion (~29%) of TAG level in ΔScDIP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), which is a storage lipid and a major reservoir for cellular DAG pools. Lipidomics revealed a depletion of ~30–40% TAGs related to a defined subset of DAGs (C36:0 and C36:1), with the highest depletion of ~93% in the case of C18:0/36:1 TAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The depletion could result either from an inefficient acylation of DAGs to TAGs or increased lipolysis of those TAGs to DAGs. Under stimulated lipolysis conditions, cells are expected to attain a 3:1 ratio of free fatty acids (FFAs) to glycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schweiger et al., 2014</xref>). The levels of FFAs, monoacylglycerols (MAGs) and glycerol were found to be unaltered in the ΔScDIP2cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>) when compared to the wild-type cells. It clearly suggests that increased lipolysis is unlikely to have been the cause for DAG–TAG imbalance. Taken together, the results suggest that ScDIP2 is involved in selective DAG to TAG flux, possibly by direct or indirect facilitation of an acylation reaction of DAG subspecies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). The depletion of TAG levels in ΔMmDIP2A mouse ES cell lines is in consensus with this argument (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, it should be noted that the TAG levels of ΔDmDIP2 <italic>Drosophila</italic> remained comparable to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>), which perhaps could be attributed to a masking effect from the huge amount of TAG sourced from the fat body of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heier and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We asked whether DIP2 has a direct effect on TAG synthesis from selective DAG subspecies. To test this, we overexpressed ScDIP2 (under GAL1 promoter), hereafter referred to as ScDIP2-OE, and checked the level of DAGs and TAGs. We found that the TAGs related to selective DAGs, C18:1/36:0 TAG increased the most (~122%), while C18:0/36:1 and C18:0/36:2 TAG increased by ~58% and ~80%, respectively in ScDIP2-OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Concomitantly, selective DAG species, C36:1 DAG showed the highest fold change (~10-fold) in depletion, further below the basal level in ScDIP2-OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). It should be noted here that a few other DAG subspecies were also depleted significantly but less drastically than the selective DAG. Such promiscuity could be a result of non-physiological levels of ScDIP2 due to overexpression. Therefore, the data suggest that the DIP2 expression is crucial to maintain the basal level of DAG subspecies and directly facilitates a DAG to TAG conversion process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>DIP2-mediated selective DAG regulation protects yeast from ER stress</title><p>We then sought to decipher the physiological relevance of DAG subspecies regulation by DIP2 in yeast. As ∆ScDIP2 cells showed normal growth and no distinct morphological defects under standard nutrient conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), we assessed its adaptability to different stress conditions such as nutrient deficiency, osmotic stress, temperature changes, redox stress to name a few (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). ∆ScDIP2 cells showed significant growth impairment in the presence of tunicamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which was earlier observed in a genome-wide screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), induces misfolded protein accumulation in ER lumen leading to proteostasis defect, commonly referred to as ‘ER stress’. Genetic complementation using native promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or GAL1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>) was sufficient to rescue tunicamycin-induced ER stress.

Therefore, we hypothesized that by metabolically fluxing these DAGs into other lipids, we may simply be able to alleviate the ER stress in ΔScDIP2 cells. It is known that specific lipid precursors such as choline, ethanolamine, and FAs can facilitate the utilization of cellular DAG pool to produce phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and TAGs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boumann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henneberry et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Montell et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we performed a ‘chemical complementation’ screening to rescue the ER stress in ∆ScDIP2 cells by supplementing with lipid precursors. We found that except for oleic acid (OL; C18:1 FFA), none of the other precursors rescued the ER stress phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The supplementation of ∆ScDIP2 mutants with a different unsaturated FA (e.g. palmitoleic acid; C16:1 FFA) or saturated FA (e.g.: palmitic acid; C16:0 FFA, stearic acid; C18:0 FFA) did not relieve ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Furthermore, OL supplementation was enough to reduce the constitutive UPR upregulation in ∆ScDIP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In agreement with those observations, the LC–MS analysis revealed the restoration of the accumulated subset of DAGs back to basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). A concomitant normalization in related TAG subspecies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>) was also observed upon OL supplementation along with an overall ~three- to sevenfold increase in bulk TAG production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>). All the other precursors showed little or no effect on the levels of an accumulated subset of DAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>), which also correlated with their inability to suppress tunicamycin sensitivity. It is interesting to note that bulk DAG accumulation is possibly less toxic to ER as the null mutants of canonical DAG-utilizing enzymes such as Dga1 and Lro1 or Dgk1 are not sensitive to ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates the atypical role of selective DAG subspecies as their accumulation results in ER stress, while ScDIP2 alleviates the ER stress by facilitating the buffering of such DAGs from the membrane pool to the storage pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Since OL supplementation was found to restore DAG level, we wondered if any physiological condition(s) can mimic this process. Under nutrient limitation conditions such as stationary phase, yeast is known to massively upregulate endogenous OL production and subsequent TAG synthesis, facilitated by majorly Dga1 and Lro1, as a metabolic strategy to store energy in the form of neutral lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Casanovas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jacquier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Joshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Markgraf et al., 2014</xref>). To test this, the DAG levels in the early-log, mid-log, and late stationary phases of wild type were compared with the levels in ∆ScDIP2 cells. The bulk DAG levels across the various stages of growth phases remain constant in the wild type, which was also observed in earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Casanovas et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, the ∆ScDIP2 cells showed the accumulation of a selective subset of DAGs only during the early- and mid-log phase and these levels are restored during the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, the toxic accumulation of selective DAGs is diluted by the bulk conversion of DAGs to TAGs during the stationary phase, which also suppress the activated UPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). It is, therefore, evident that the role of ScDIP2 in regulating a defined subset of DAGs to TAG flux must be a growth phase-dependent phenomenon. So, we tracked the expression of ScDIP2 along the growth phase using a ScDIP2-GFP knock-in line (C-terminal GFP). The expression of ScDIP2-GFP appeared as an intracellular tubular and punctate-like structure only during the early- to mid-log phase and rapidly diminished in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Taken together, these observations reveal an interesting parallel between canonical and ScDIP2-dependent regulation of DAG subspecies required to protect ER function in the logarithmic growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Growth phase-dependent regulation of selective diacylglycerols (DAGs) by DIP2 ensures ER homeostasis in yeast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tracking the level of selective DAGs in ΔScDIP2 cells across the growth phases: early-log, mid-log, and stationary phase.

Subsequently, a three-colour colocalization study of ScDIP2-GFP (green), mitochondria (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); blue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dellinger and Gèze, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Higuchi-Sanabria et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zarin et al., 2021</xref>), and vacuoles (FM4-64; red) showed that a fraction of ScDIP2-GFP puncta (~30%) was associated with both the vacuolar and mitochondrial marker signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 11H, 1I</xref>).

Since DAGs are known to affect vacuole function, we hypothesized that loss of ScDIP2 would affect vacuole function. Therefore, we examined the vacuole morphology in the log phase as it serves as an index of vacuole health. We found that about 60% of ΔScDIP2 cells contain a greater number of single, rounded, and enlarged vacuoles, which is roughly twice that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). A comparative analysis of the size distribution of vacuoles in the log phase of growth showed that larger sized vacuoles are more frequently observed in ΔScDIP2 mutant than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, the increase of single and large vacuoles in ΔScDIP2 cells is presumably due to aberrant vacuole membrane fusion driven by accumulated DAGs, a known membrane fusogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Starr and Fratti, 2019</xref>). The optimum vacuole fusion is critical for cells’ adaptation to osmotic stress, a common environmental stress experience by fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Veses et al., 2008</xref>), To check the functional consequence of such compromised vacuolar homeostasis, ΔScDIP2 cells were subjected to hyper-osmotic stress using high-salt growth media. An incubation in hyper-osmotic conditions resulted in two- to threefold higher cell death in ΔScDIP2, while the cell viability was identical for both the strains in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). A similar observation was also made during the screening of ΔScDIP2 using serial dilution assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated if DAG depletion upon ScDIP2 overexpression can show converse effects on vacuole morphology. The vacuoles in the ScDIP2-OE strain were found to be highly fragmented; single vacuole containing cells are about three times lower while the multivacuolar (&gt;4) cells were three times more than that in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). To confirm whether this fragmented vacuolar morphology is due to the impairment of vacuole fusion, we employed a vacuole fusion–fission assay utilizing the osmotic response of yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The growth in hypertonic media induces vacuole fission in yeast, resulting in highly fragmented vacuoles in both wild-type and ScDIP2-OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E</xref>). Exposure of such cells with fragmented vacuoles to hypotonic conditions induces rapid vacuole fusion. Vacuoles in ScDIP2-OE cells are found to be highly fragmented and multilobar even after the fusion induction using hypotonic media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting a significantly reduced vacuolar fusion process (~30% reduced fusion compared to wild type) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Since rapid vacuole fusion is required during hypo-osmotic stress adaptation by yeast cells, we hypothesized that ScDIP2-OE cells will show reduced fitness in hypotonic conditions. Indeed, we found that acute hypotonic stress caused severe cell death in ScDIP2-OE while ∆ScDIP2 cells showed significant tolerance to the stress compared to the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Together, the data suggest that the selective DAG pool is essential for the vacuole fusion process and ScDIP2-mediated regulation optimizes the process to ensure osmoadaptation in yeast.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Depletion of diacylglycerol (DAG) upon DIP2 overexpression destabilizes vacuolar fusion–fission homeostasis in yeast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of vacuole morphology in indicated strains grown till log phase in YP-galactose media.

Bioinformatics analysis on the emergence of the unique three-domain architecture of DIP2 in opisthokonts revealed that the N-terminal DMAP1-binding domain (DBD1) is absent in several ancient members of this group (viz. Nucleariids, Ichthyosporea, Choanoflagellates, and some fungi species).

Such a regulation of minor DAG subspecies is essential for optimal vacuole (shown as green circle) fusion–fission dynamics leading to efficient osmotic adaptation and maintenance of ER homeostasis. In ΔScDIP2, the accumulation of these minor DAG subspecies results in ER stress, increased vacuole fusion and reduced osmotic adaptation capability.

A typical ANL superfamily member, including FLDs, should activate their respective substrates by the formation of an acyl-adenylate intermediate. All these homologues show highly conserved residues responsible for the acyl-adenylate formation, referred to as A5 and A7 motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gulick, 2009</xref>). Structure-based sequence alignments, using models from AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>), suggested that the A5 and A7 motifs are conserved in the FLD1 domains of all opisthokonts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and strikingly, FLD2 showed degeneration of both the motifs. This is also supported by the greater divergence of FLD2 domains from the prokaryotic/plant FAALs than FLD1 domains, as inferred from the branch lengths of FLD clades in phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Mutations in catalytic residues of adenylation motifs of FLD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>) led to the loss of function of ScDIP2.

Overexpression of these mutants neither resulted in fragmented vacuole morphology nor an increased cell death in hypotonic stress condition as seen with wild-type ScDIP2 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2F, G</xref>).

Taken together, the adenylation activity of FLD1 of DIP2 is required for facilitating the conversion of selective DAGs to TAGs.

Diversity amongst various classes of lipids arising from the variability in FA compositions such as chain length, degree of unsaturation, is turning out to be crucial for biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atilla-Gokcumen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Khandelwal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Raghu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shin et al., 2020</xref>). Earlier <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have pointed to the exclusive role of selective DAG subspecies in determining the fate of different physiological processes including signal transduction, cell polarity, membrane trafficking, ligand binding to membrane receptors, and modulation of membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lee et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Marignani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schuhmacher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Ware et al., 2020</xref>). However, the molecular players and pathways in selective regulation are largely unknown. Interestingly, studies in mammals have revealed the presence of a unique isoform of diacylglycerol kinase, namely DGKε, that channelizes specific DAG species, suggesting the evolution of selective metabolism routes in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Milne et al., 2008</xref>). However, the known DAG metabolizing enzymes of yeast, DAG acyltransferase (Dga1, Lro1, Are1, and Are2) and DAG kinases (Dgk1), are non-specific in nature and thus facilitate a generic regulation through bulk conversion of DAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rockenfeller et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, a thorough investigation is needed to identify how ~2 billion years of eukaryotic evolution has shaped the lipid repertoire through selective regulation mechanisms. In this context, our study demonstrates the cellular function of a conserved protein family, DIP2 in regulating a subset of DAG pool (C36:0 and C36:1 DAGs) of yeast in a growth phase-dependent manner. In yeast, the loss of DIP2 leads to the accumulation of these DAG subspecies and a concomitant depletion of chain-length-related TAG species. These DAG subspecies are found to be toxic to yeast cells as their accumulation interfere with cellular processes like ER homeostasis and osmoadaptation. The unaltered levels of other lipid metabolites that induce ER stress for example, saturated FAs, sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Volmer and Ron, 2015</xref>), DAG precursors, that is, PA and lyso-PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Henry et al., 2014</xref>), further validates that DAG–TAG imbalance is the cause of ER stress in the absence of DIP2. Overexpression of DIP2 in yeast increases the flux from DAG to TAG, resulting in massive depletion of DAG subspecies below the basal level. As we find that these DAG subspecies are required for vacuole membrane fusion, diminishing their cellular abundance upon DIP2 overexpression leads to decreased vacuole fusion and increased cell death upon osmotic stress in yeast. Thus, the study essentially identifies an unconventional and selective DAG metabolism route in yeast with important physiological consequences. Similar to the yeast results, the lipidomics analysis indicates that the DIP2-mediated DAG regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice is also biased towards a subset of DAG species. Given the tissue-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nitta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and the presence of multiple paralogues of DIP2 in higher organisms, the specificity and the functional significance of DAG regulation by DIP2 need to be probed in further studies.</p><p>The study characterizes DIP2 as a non-canonical member of DAG metabolism pathways as it shares no homology with known DAG metabolizing enzymes of eukaryotes. Interestingly, DIP2 harbours a tandem FLD didomain which itself is a novel domain organization with respect to the evolutionary history of FLD. Although the canonical function of standalone FLD is to activate FAs, we find that the didomain architecture of FLD is essential for the DAG to TAG conversion by DIP2. We also provide evidence for the role of adenylation activity of FLDs of ScDIP2 in facilitating the conversion of DAG to TAG using mutations in the conserved adenylation motifs. This leads us to propose a putative biochemical scheme where DIP2 is involved in the fatty acylation of DAGs to produce TAGs, utilizing an activated acyl-adenylates intermediate. Despite significant efforts, we were unable to show the DAG to TAG conversion reaction <italic>in vitro</italic> using individual components along with purified protein. Although this marks the limitation of the current study, it highlights the involvement of other cellular factors or specific membrane environment necessary for the reaction. The involvement of known DAG acyltransferases (Dga1, Lro1, Are1, and Are2) in the DIP2-mediated DAG regulation pathway cannot be ruled out. However, the accumulation of the subset of DAGs in a DIP2 mutant despite the presence of those acyltransferases does suggest that DIP2-mediated pathway is independent of known TAG forming enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p><p>We find that DIP2 uniquely localizes to mitochondria–vacuole membrane contact sites in yeast. Typically, a membrane contact site is a close apposition between membrane of two different organelles populated with structural proteins for tethering membranes and functional proteins for exchanging metabolites or ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Scorrano et al., 2019</xref>). It is widely speculated that specific proteins are enriched at the contact sites to regulate the unique membrane compositions at contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jain and Holthuis, 2017</xref>). Although, recent studies have identified several tethering proteins at mitochondria–vacuole contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elbaz-Alon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">González Montoro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">John Peter et al., 2017</xref>), functional proteins at the sites remain largely unknown. Given the localization of DIP2 to a contact site and its specialized role in regulating DAG subspecies, the study uncovers DIP2 as a new family of functional protein at the mitochondria–vacuole contact site. Since DAG to TAG conversion via canonical pathways takes place at ER and lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sorger and Daum, 2003</xref>), a thorough investigation is needed to explore the role of unconventional DIP2-mediated DAG metabolism at mitochondria–vacuole contact sites.</p><p>Total DAG pool constitutes only a relatively small population (3–5%) within the lipidome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Casanovas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ejsing et al., 2009</xref>) and is maintained via the rapid turnover to either storage lipids or membrane lipids. Indeed, the deletion of DAG metabolizing enzymes of yeast such as Dgk1, which facilitates the formation of phospholipids, or Dga1 and Lro1, that facilitate TAG synthesis results in the accumulation of bulk DAG species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fakas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Oelkers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oelkers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rockenfeller et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, unlike the DIP2 mutant which accumulates a subset of the DAG pool (&lt;0.005%), the accumulation of bulk DAGs in Dga1 or Lro1 or Dgk1 mutants does not lead to ER stress induction. Similarly, specific TAGs related to these DAGs are only altered in the mutant leaving the bulk TAG pool almost unaffected. Since the levels of bulk TAG pools and sterol esters in ΔScDIP2 cells show minimal or no change, ScDIP2 is likely to have a limited effect on lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis process. These observations point towards functionally independent DAG populations, viz., a benign bulk DAG pool, utilized mainly for bilayer production and energy storage, and a minor context-dependent DAG pool. The present study identifies the minor DAG pool as being resistant to any kind of redirection that retains them in the membrane. These DAGs can only be titrated as a storage lipid, TAG, by DIP2 in the logarithmic growth phase and via oleic acid-mediated ‘metabolic reset’ in the stationary phase. Thus, the accumulation of these DAG subspecies is likely to impact the physical properties of the membrane, which subsequently results in UPR triggering and vacuole fusion dysregulation.</p><p>Overall, the current work shows that DIP2-mediated fine-tuning of a fraction of the DAG pool is required for adapting to different types of stress such as ER proteostasis and osmolarity. Unlike the laboratory conditions, these adaptation helps in the survival of yeast in the diverse environmental niches in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). As pathogenic fungi adapt to the changing microenvironments during disease progression, similar stress adaptation processes linked to DAG regulation becomes crucial for their survival inside the host. Studies on plant and animal pathogenic fungi have indeed suggested that DIP2 is involved in infection-related morphogenesis like conidia, appressoria, hyphae, and spherule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Narra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), where vacuole fusion–fission dynamics plays a vital role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Veses et al., 2008</xref>). Consequently, DIP2 has been identified as a potential candidate for designing fungicides and developing a vaccine against valley fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shubitz et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, DAG regulation in neurons is found as a critical factor for neuron branching, dendritic spine formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tu-Sekine et al., 2015</xref>), etc., which are the major cellular processes affected in autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilbert and Man, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Phillips and Pozzo-Miller, 2015</xref>). Since DIP2 has been recognized as a potential risk factor for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), aberrant accumulation of chemically distinct DAG subspecies is likely to be the potential molecular driver of these disorders. Interestingly, the previous reports suggesting the requirement FLD didomain of DIP2 for proper neuron branching in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nitta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Noblett et al., 2019</xref>) correlates with our observation on the need of FLD didomain in selective DAG to TAG conversion. This also suggests the possible involvement of DIP2 in driving these crucial developmental processes via DAG subspecies regulation. Therefore, the identification of DIP2 as a regulator of DAG subspecies abundance provides a solid platform to bridge the gap between its cellular function and phenotypes linked to disease pathogenesis. Further explorations will be focussed on (1) the elucidation of the biochemical and structural mechanism of DAG to TAG conversion by DIP2, (2) the relation between subcellular localization of DIP2 and its regulatory role in defining the distribution of DAG subspecies at subcellular sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baron and Malhotra, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cowell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ganesan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Starr and Fratti, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yang and Kazanietz, 2003</xref>), and (3) how misregulation of a fraction of DAG pool translates into a pathological manifestation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>All strains used in this study are derivatives of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> S288C and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Felix Campelo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted the following summary to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further characterize the actual role of DIP2 in lipid metabolism:</p><p>– It is not clear from the data whether the changes observed (more DAG, less TAG in the KOs; and opposite in the o/expression) are due to changes in lipolysis or in synthesis. The authors should measure changes in DAG precursors (e.g. PA, lyso-PA) (see Rev. #3, point #2).</p><p>– Although the authors already state in their paper that <italic>in vitro</italic> tests were not successful, it would be important that the authors can provide some more insight into whether the role of DIP2 in DAG to TAG conversion is direct or indirect (see Rev. #1, point #3; Rev. #2)</p><p>2) The authors should provide stronger evidence for the role of DIP2 in vacuoles.</p><p>– Provide better images for the localization of DIP2 (see Rev. #1, point #1; Rev. #2; Rev. #3, point #4).</p><p>– Further test the role of DIP2 in vacuoles (is it direct or indirect?) (see Rev. #1, point #2and2b).</p><p>As an optional possibility, it would also be interesting to test the impact of DIP2 loss in LD biogenesis and shape. Moreover, going further into the mechanism by which DIP2 has a specific role only in a subset of DAGs can be very interesting, but I feel that perhaps falls a bit beyond the scope of this paper. The authors can of course discuss it a bit further.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I see two weak points in this manuscript:</p><p>1) The fluorescence microscopy data showing localization of the DIP2 protein to vacuole/mitochondria could be very much improved.</p><p>2) The vacuole fusion defect in the absence of DIP2 is quite interesting and promising. However, I feel like further data would be required to fully support such a claim. For instance, could the authors acutely remove DIP2 (anchor-away, degron system, etc.) to then perform time-lapse imaging to show, as predicted by the authors, vacuole fusion?</p><p>(2b) Related to 1 and 2, would the authors have a way to monitor the lipid changes in specific organelles, such as vacuole or mitochondria?</p><p>3) Is DIP2 indeed a lipid metabolizing enzyme or is it a regulator/modifier of other metabolizing enzymes? I appreciate that the authors claim and write in their manuscript that they have not been able to show <italic>in vitro</italic> the capacity of DIP2 to convert some DAG species into TAG. How would the authors interpret such negative results? Because of experimental/technical limitations or because indeed DIP2 is not able to convert DAG <italic>in vitro</italic>?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should provide <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence of DIP2 activity (using recombinant proteins encompassing or not the FLDs and their mutants) and address the issue of its specificity at the molecular detail. The localization of ScDIP2 is reported to be vacuolar + mitochondrial. The images shown by the authors would point towards a primarily mitochondrial localization. This aspect needs to be investigated further (and possibly expanded to mammalian and DmDIP2) in light of the proposed DIP2 biology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) As mentioned above, some DAG lipids go up in ScDIP2-ko. What is the effect on precursor lipids that make DAG, such as PA and lyso PA? Changes in these lipids can also influence ER homeostasis and ER stress.</p><p>2) the decrease in TAG in the ScDIP2 knockout could be due to an increase in lipolysis or a decrease in TAG synthesis. Here, increased lipolysis is ruled out because there is no significant increase in MAG or FFAs in this KO (Figure 2, figure supplement 2B,c). This conclusion would be more strongly supported if the rate of glycerol release could be monitored in control and ScDIP2 KO. MAG and FFAs can often be rapidly re-incorporated into other lipid species, or simply oxidized. Thus, the lack of their accumulation alone does not seem sufficient to rule out elevated lipolysis in the KO.</p><p>3) Loss of ScDIP2 induces ER UPR stress, which can be rescued by treatment with oleic acid (Figure 3C). Oleic acid treatment drives lipid droplet biogenesis in yeast, which is commonly associated with releasing various ER stresses. Does this rescue require LD biogenesis? Relatedly, how does loss of ScDIP2 impact LD biogenesis and morphology?</p><p>4) Through primarily co-imaging with ScDIP2-GFP and vacuole strain FM4-64, it is proposed that a pool of SCDIP2-GFP localizes to the vacuole surface. As presented in Figure 5A, this ScDIP2-GFP does not look vacuolar, but possibly localized to mitochondria adjacent to the vacuole. Some additional evidence supporting vacuole localization would strengthen this observation. Potentially blotting for ScDIP2 on isolated vacuoles.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;DIP2 is a unique regulator of diacylglycerol lipid homeostasis in eukaryotes&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>We all agree that this study is generally well done and that it constitutes a potentially exciting piece of work. However, upon consultation amongst reviewers, we still think that the interpretation of the new microscopy data as a proof for vacuolar localization of ScDIP2 is not conclusive. An alternative explanation of the data could be that all ScDIP2 localizes to mitochondria, and that the vacuole association (as observed by fluorescence microscopy) represents mitochondrial-vacuole contacts.</p><p>In order to clarify better this point, we request that you perform 3-color imaging of DIP2 together with mitochondrial and vacuolar markers, which will help reveal whether the association between DIP2 and vacuoles as observed in the present version of the manuscript corresponds to mitochondrial-vacuolar contacts or not. These data could even provide an exciting new observation if it confirms mitochondria-vacuole contacts, since there are not that many proteins known to localize to these contacts. The authors should adjust the text according to the outcome of these experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the authors, for different reasons, have not been able to perform some of the requested experiments, they have clarified the paper and tempered the claims, so now I think this is a solid paper that deserves being published at eLife.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors sufficiently addressed my concerns. I, therefore, support publication in eLife</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study investigates the role of DIP2 enzymes primarily in yeast, and their roles in neutral lipid metabolism. In general the study is well conducted and provides significant preliminary data on the role of these enzymes in DAG:TAG lipid metabolism. The only major remaining concern is the conclusion of the vacuole localization of ScDIP2. Genetic manipulation of ScDIP2 clearly affects vacuole morphology and fusion, etc, but the fluorescent imaging data, as presented, does not conclusively show vacuole localization of ScDIP2-GFP. An alternative model is that all ScDIP2 simply localizes to mitochondria, and that the vacuole association simply represents mito-vacuole contacts. The new imaging data presented in this revised manuscript are compelling, but cannot rule out this alternative model. Since this vacuole localization appears to be a major tenet of the study's conclusions, additional evidence such as biochemical analysis, or even imaging with dual mito and vacuole markers, is necessary prior to making such conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77665.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further characterize the actual role of DIP2 in lipid metabolism:</p><p>– It is not clear from the data whether the changes observed (more DAG, less TAG in the KOs; and opposite in the o/expression) are due to changes in lipolysis or in synthesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for presenting an alternate hypothesis for explaining why diacylglycerols (DAGs) have accumulated while triacylglycerols (TAGs) have reduced in the DIP2KO mutant. It allows us to further clarify based on our results that show that DIP2 knockout does not drive DAG-TAG imbalance through lipolysis.</p><p>As per the alternative hypothesis, enhanced lipolysis of TAGs could have resulted in the formation of DAGs and depletion of TAGs with a concomitant release of free fatty acids (FFA). If further lipolysis takes place, monoacylglycerols (MAGs) will be formed that will eventually be converted to FFA along with glycerol (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>A schematic showing lipolysis of TAGs to form DAGs, MAGs, FFA and Glycerol.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77665-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Since ScDIP2 KO accumulates only DAGs without any change in MAG and FFA levels (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and 2C), the lipolysis will have to be limited to conversion of TAGs to DAGs and not extend forward. In such a scenario, we will not see any change in glycerol levels. However, if for some reason the lipolysis further continues, there will be three-fold molar excess of FFA than glycerol as shown in the schematic. We do agree that reutilization of MAGs and FFA is greater than glycerol. However, it has been noted earlier that a 1:1 ratio of FFA to glycerol is maintained under homeostatic conditions, which increases to 3:1 under lipolytic-stimulated conditions (Schweiger et al., 2014).</p><p>Therefore, while measuring glycerol levels to see if a lipolytic defect may be possible, measuring FFA will be an equally sensitive readout. Also, early studies for characterization of lipases from yeast have also relied on measuring MAGs and FFAs (Heier et al., 2010; Kurat et al., 2006; Selvaraju et al., 2016) without invoking glycerol measurement. Therefore, based on the above discussion, we suggest that a change in MAG and FFA levels should suffice to draw a conclusion.</p><p>To further strengthen our conclusions, we were planning to carry out quantification of glycerol levels, as suggested by the reviewer. Unfortunately, the widely used glycerol assay kit ( MAK117-1KT) has stock unavailability due to COVID crisis and presently we are unable to perform the assay. We will perform the same in future, as and when the kit will be available.

Therefore, it further strengthens our argument that the observed ER-stress is not a result of imbalance in precursors of DAGs and solely coming from the accumulation of specific DAG species.</p><p>This data is now added to the manuscript as Figure 2—figure supplement 1I. A summary of these experimental observation in also included in the main text at line# 367-370 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Although the authors already state in their paper that <italic>in vitro</italic> tests were not successful, it would be important that the authors can provide some more insight into whether the role of DIP2 in DAG to TAG conversion is direct or indirect (see Rev. #1, point #3; Rev. #2)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to help us explain an important aspect of the paper which concerns the role of DIP2 as a direct or indirect DAG to TAG converter. We agree that in the absence of any direct evidence, as pointed out by the reviewers, DIP2 may not be an actual enzyme and instead be simply a regulator or acts in coordination with other metabolizing enzymes. However, we summarize here all the evidence that clearly point towards a catalytic role for DIP2 in DAG to TAG conversion.</p><p>1. We find that lipidome is unaltered except for specific DAGs and TAGs in DIP2 deletion mutant. The domain truncation mutations of DIP2 show that the didomain of FAAL-like domains (FLD) is the minimal functional unit for facilitating DAG to TAG conversion. Further, we also demonstrate that within this minimal functional unit, a couple of important residues, which are known to be essential for catalysis in the superfamily to which the FLD belongs, are the key players. A schematic is shown in <bold>Author response image 3</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> to summarize the above-mentioned points.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77665-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>2. Numerous crystal structures of such mutant proteins of various members this superfamily shows that mutations at these sites does not alter protein structure. This has been shown in multiple systems that theses mutations render the enzyme inactive by blocking a specific process of the catalytic mechanism and not because of structural collapse. Moreover, the site resides deep within the protein structure and is not surface exposed at any stage during the different steps of catalysis. We used a protein model generated by AlphaFold (Jumper et al., 2021) to illustrate how buried the residue is within the structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>A sausage representation of the homology model of the FAAL-like domain-1 shows the overall residue depth (Chakravarty and Varadarajan, 1999; Tan et al., 2013).</title><p>The core regions appear thicker than the surface regions, which are also coloured accordingly. Residues deep within the core are coloured red, while those at the surface are coloured blue. This representation shows that the mutated residues, D523 and L687 (spheres), are part of the core and deeply buried. A scatter plot showing the depth (Y-axis) of each residue (X-axis) in the region of interest, also shows that the residues are deeply buried in the core (3<sup>rd</sup> quartile or &gt; 75% percentile).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77665-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Therefore, the possibility that the mutations resulted in a structural collapse that further disturbed the interaction of DIP2 with other proteins can be ruled out. Thus, it can be concluded that ensuring homeostasis in the levels of specific DAG and TAG species is directly connected to a few conserved residues in its active site suggesting the direct role of DIP2 catalysis in DAG to TAG conversion.</p><p>3. Based on the available knowledge of lipid biosynthetic pathways, analyses of lipid species upstream and downstream to these nodes (DAG and TAG) argues for a defective or downregulated acyltransferase reaction in a DIP2 deletion mutant as well as the above-mentioned point mutant of DIP2.</p><p>4. Incidentally, the altered lipid species are highly under-represented in the lipidome (&lt; 0.005 %), which is in line with earlier observations made from large-scale lipidomic studies in yeast (Casanovas et al., 2015; Ejsing et al., 2009). Complementation experiments show that DIP2 or the didomain of FAAL-like domains have remarkable chain-length restriction and limit their effect to some of the very rare DAG species in the lipidome. Even upon overexpression using a galactose-inducible promoter, only C36:0, C36:1 DAGs and related TAG show changes while the other species show minimal to no changes. The non-physiological levels of DIP2 resulting from galactose-induced overexpression shows minimal nonspecific targeting of DAGs and TAGs, while in the case of native promoter-induced expression only the cognate DAGs and TAGs are affected. It is further supported by the fact that under native conditions, DIP2 maintains the DAG and TAGs to basal level, while galactose-induced over-expression decreases DAGs and TAGs below the basal level. It should also be noted that such specificity is rarely encountered in lipid biosynthetic enzymes of any organism, particularly any TAG-forming acyltransferase.</p><p>These observations are indicative of a specific role for DIP2 in the DAG to TAG reaction. Having said this, we are yet to demonstrate the DAG to TAG conversion <italic>in vitro</italic>, as mentioned in the manuscript. We have tried to assess the formation of adenylation using radio-TLC as previously described (Patil et al., 2021) and to measure the formation of triacylglycerol using the DGAT assay (Oelkers et al., 2002). The positive controls for these experiments, viz., FACLs producing acyl-adenylates and Dga11 catalysing the formation of TAGs from DAGs, suggest that conditions are suitable for catalysis. However, the purified DIP2 could not generate any of these products. Based on these observations, possible biochemical function of DIP2 can only be speculative. As an alternative, DIP2 could be a sensor that directly or indirectly facilitates the conversion of specific DAGs to TAGs. It may also be possible that DIP2 is an accessory enzyme necessary for an acyltransferase that selectively converts specific DAGs to TAGs. Both these alternative hypotheses require DIP2 to rely on an existing acyltransferase that can drive the conversion of specific DAGs to TAGs. There are only four known acyltransferases in yeast, namely Dga1, Lro1, Are1 and Are2, and each of these enzymes show substrate promiscuity. Indeed, the deletion mutants of these acyltransferases show accumulation of DAGs across chain-lengths (Rockenfeller et al., 2018). So, there may be a mechanism by which these acyltransferases can achieve specificity or an unknown hitherto acyltransferase in yeast that has high substrate specificity. Considering the extent of dissection of lipid metabolic pathways in yeast and based on the available evidence on promiscuity of known acyltransferases, a high-fidelity conversion of C36:0 and C36:1 DAG to TAG is highly unlikely through any such means.</p><p>This leaves us with a possibility that DIP2 is an enzyme that drives specific DAG to TAG conversion. We have not been able to demonstrate it <italic>in vitro</italic> (formation of acyl-adenylate intermediate or TAG formation) using the purified protein. We believe that multiple parameters could have affected the ability of the protein. Lack of a partner (macromolecules or small organic molecules) or the presence of a bound inhibitor or the absence of a key modification or requiring the presentation of the substrate in a specific environment can be some of the reasons. The <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction will thus require a thorough investigation to optimize multiple variables, and therefore, will be the part of a future study. Nevertheless, the evidence presented here clearly points to the requirement of a unique acyltransferase as the existing acyltransferase are incapable of driving such high-fidelity DAG to TAG formation. Moreover, the lipidomics data using DIP2 carrying mutation of residue in the proposed active site, which is deeply buried in the protein, enables us to favour the proposal that DIP2 is a specific DAG to TAG converting enzyme.</p><p>A short summary of the points discussed is included in the discussion to the effect that ‘our studies do not rule out the possibility of an indirect role of DIP2 in DAG to TAG conversion’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should provide stronger evidence for the role of DIP2 in vacuoles.</p><p>– Provide better images for the localization of DIP2 (see Rev. #1, point #1; Rev. #2; Rev. #3, point #4).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion to improve the quality of images to unambiguously ascertain the localization. We concur with all the reviewers that the protein primarily localizes to mitochondria. In fact, previous studies have highlighted the localization to mitochondria in mouse brain tissue and NLT cell line and showed that DIP2A enables superoxide dismutase-mediated antioxidative response (Bai et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2019). Given that such an observation was already made which also included a thorough investigation, we focussed our attention on the secondary site of localization in yeast, i.e., vacuoles, which was not previously noted.</p><p>As per the suggestion by Reviewer 1, we have now performed the localization studies to generate better quality images. In addition, we have included a quantification of the fluorescence puncta colocalized with vacuolar and mitochondrial markers, FM4-64 and MitoTracker, respectively.</p><p>We find that ScDIP2, under normal growth conditions, shows 70-80% localization to mitochondria and 30-40 % to vacuoles. This observation not only supports the finding that DIP2 is localized to vacuoles but also highlights the fact that the localization of DIP2 to vacuole in yeast may have functional significance. It also shows that the localization of DIP2 may be a dynamic phenomenon that changes with stress and growth conditions. Indeed, while a recent study showed its localization to mitochondria in brain tissue, few other studies have reported its localisation to cell periphery and nucleus in mammalian cells (Hayashi et al., 2017; Ouchi et al., 2010). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, DIP2 was found to be associated with a plasma membrane marker (Nitta et al., 2017).</p><p>The microscopy images now replace Figure 5A and 5B; Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-D in revised manuscript. The colocalization quantification data presented is included as Figure 5—figure supplement 1F and 1G in the revised manuscript. A summary of the observations made is now added to the Results section and also in the Discussion section at line# 251-267.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Further test the role of DIP2 in vacuoles (is it direct or indirect?) (see Rev. #1, point #2and2b).</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for suggesting experiments to further validate the importance of DIP2 localization to vacuole.</p><p>We used the point mutants of ScDIP2, where a conserved residue responsible for catalysis has been mutated and overexpressed in wildtype cells. We performed the quantification of vacuolar morphology to see if the vacuolar defect phenotype persists. As explained in the earlier question, the mutation will not impact any kind of protein interactions and therefore its effects will be restricted to the imbalances in DAG-TAG levels. Similar to deletion mutant, we find that this point mutation that prevents ScDIP2s ability to prevent specific DAG to TAG conversion, also has defective vacuolar fusion. It is to be noted that this observation supports the proposition that DIP2 is a specific enzyme driving selective DAG to TAG conversion.</p><p>The additional data are included as Figure 7—figure supplement 2F and 2G and a short summary of the points discussed is included in the manuscript (line# 335-337)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As an optional possibility, it would also be interesting to test the impact of DIP2 loss in LD biogenesis and shape.</p></disp-quote><p>Deletion of both the major TAG synthesising enzymes in yeast, Dga1 and Lro1 leads to more than 80% depletion of total TAG amount during logarithmic growth phase (Sorger and Daum, 2002). The effect of such TAG depletion is also reflected in LD biogenesis as the LD count per cell decreases from ~4 to almost null (Iwasa et al., 2016). However, as described in the manuscript, ScDIP2 works on minor subspecies of DAGs and facilitate their conversion to TAG subspecies. Therefore, we observed slight depletion (~17%) of total TAG pool (as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2D) upon ScDIP2 deletion in yeast at logarithmic phase and no significant change at stationary phase. Also, sterol is stored as sterol ester in LD and makes up 30-40% of LD mass. In the absence of ScDIP2, we did not observe any change in sterol ester and its precursor level (as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2D). Therefore, based on this evidence, we propose that ScDIP2 deletion might have minimal effect on LD biogenesis quantitatively.</p><p>However, we cannot rule out the possibility on the regulation aspect of LD biogenesis where excess accumulation of DAG subspecies might play some role. Though the experimentations towards this fall beyond the scope of the current manuscript, it certainly can be explored in future studies. A short summary of the results has been added to the results and Discussion sections (line# 409-412) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, going further into the mechanism by which DIP2 has a specific role only in a subset of DAGs can be very interesting, but I feel that perhaps falls a bit beyond the scope of this paper. The authors can of course discuss it a bit further.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the above suggestion. As mentioned in the answer to essential revision question#1, we need to first demonstrate the <italic>in vitro</italic> ability of the enzyme to convert DAG to TAG. Following these experiments, a thorough structural and biochemical investigation is required to further characterise the specificity of these enzymes which will be a focus of our future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I see two weak points in this manuscript:</p><p>1) The fluorescence microscopy data showing localization of the DIP2 protein to vacuole/mitochondria could be very much improved.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, and it has been answered as a part of the answers to essential revision#2.

However, I feel like further data would be required to fully support such a claim. For instance, could the authors acutely remove DIP2 (anchor-away, degron system, etc.) to then perform time-lapse imaging to show, as predicted by the authors, vacuole fusion?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and this question is partly answered as a part of the answers to essential revision#2. Briefly, we overexpressed ScDIP2 carrying a point mutation that renders it non-functional as supporting evidence for the role of DIP2-mediated DAG regulation in vacuole fusion process. The overexpression of this ScDIP2 point mutant neither result in cell death under hypotonic conditions nor adversely impact vacuole fusion. This is now presented as Figure 7—figure supplement 2F and 2G and discussed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2b) Related to 1 and 2, would the authors have a way to monitor the lipid changes in specific organelles, such as vacuole or mitochondria?</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer suggestion to measure lipid changes after isolating organelles. As revealed from the lipidomics experiments, the DAGs regulated by DIP2 only represent a tiny pool of the total lipidome (&lt; 0.005%). Their abundance in the organelles and the quality of the signal from such rare pools is expected to be weak. Therefore, we will need to optimize conditions such as osmolarity or ER-stress to enhance the abundance of these rare species in the isolated organelles, which will be a focus of our future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is DIP2 indeed a lipid metabolizing enzyme or is it a regulator/modifier of other metabolizing enzymes? I appreciate that the authors claim and write in their manuscript that they have not been able to show <italic>in vitro</italic> the capacity of DIP2 to convert some DAG species into TAG.

Because of experimental/technical limitations or because indeed DIP2 is not able to convert DAG <italic>in vitro</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for allowing us to expand on the alternative possibilities and interpret our failure to show <italic>in vitro</italic> DAG to TAG conversion.

We have addressed these queries as a part of the essential revision#1.

What is the effect on precursor lipids that make DAG, such as PA and lyso PA? Changes in these lipids can also influence ER homeostasis and ER stress.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer suggestion to rule out the possibility that difference in specific precursors have not caused the ER stress. We have addressed this as a part of the essential revision#1. This is now presented as Figure 2—figure supplement 1G and 1I and discussed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The decrease in TAG in the ScDIP2 knockout could be due to an increase in lipolysis or a decrease in TAG synthesis. Here, increased lipolysis is ruled out because there is no significant increase in MAG or FFAs in this KO (Figure 2, figure supplement 2B,c). This conclusion would be more strongly supported if the rate of glycerol release could be monitored in control and ScDIP2 KO. MAG and FFAs can often be rapidly re-incorporated into other lipid species, or simply oxidized. Thus, the lack of their accumulation alone does not seem sufficient to rule out elevated lipolysis in the KO.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s concern that without measuring glycerol levels alongside FFA and MAGs, one cannot completely rule out lipolysis dependent DAG-TAG imbalance. We have addressed this issue as a part of the essential revision<bold>#1</bold> and modified the manuscript text as “to rule out completely the role of lipolysis, glycerol level also needs to be measured.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Loss of ScDIP2 induces ER UPR stress, which can be rescued by treatment with oleic acid (Figure 3C). Oleic acid treatment drives lipid droplet biogenesis in yeast, which is commonly associated with releasing various ER stresses. Does this rescue require LD biogenesis? Relatedly, how does loss of ScDIP2 impact LD biogenesis and morphology?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to point us to the potential link between oleic acid (OL) driven LD biogenesis and ER stress modulation. OL treatment, in general, is known to increase TAG synthesis which subsequently leads to LD biogenesis. Previous studies revealed that the OL treatment promotes TAG production and thereby relieves the ER stress by quenching the toxic saturated lipids in form of TAGs (Volmer and Ron, 2015). We also observe a surge in TAG synthesis (~ 3-7-fold) in both wildtype and ScDIP2 null yeast upon addition of OL, suggesting a subsequent increase in LD biogenesis.</p><p>It should be emphasized here that this DAG to TAG conversion upon addition of OL is indiscriminate. Therefore, the accumulated toxic DAG subspecies are quenched alongside other DAGs relieving the cell from ER stress. It is evident from the lipidomic data where an upregulation of TAG synthesis along with buffering of all DAG species including C36:0 and C36:1 DAG. This is observed in two cases; in stationary phase (Figure 4A) when TAG production is naturally triggered or when mutant is treated with OL (Figure 3 E and 3F). We also have shown that ER stress is reduced in ScDIP2 null yeast during stationary phase as well as upon treatment with OL.</p><p>We have added this additional data as Figure 3—figure supplement 2G in the manuscript (line# 215-217).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Through primarily co-imaging with ScDIP2-GFP and vacuole strain FM4-64, it is proposed that a pool of SCDIP2-GFP localizes to the vacuole surface. As presented in Figure 5A, this ScDIP2-GFP does not look vacuolar, but possibly localized to mitochondria adjacent to the vacuole. Some additional evidence supporting vacuole localization would strengthen this observation. Potentially blotting for ScDIP2 on isolated vacuoles.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ remark that localization is primarily to mitochondria. We have elaborately detailed this aspect as a part of the essential revision #2. We have now provided a quantification of the colocalization signal between ScDIP2-GFP puncta and organellar markers (mitochondria and vacuole) signal.</p><p>In the earlier version of the manuscript, we have shown the association of ScDIP2 with total membrane fraction and not in cytosolic fraction via western blotting experiment (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). Although the signal was weak, it was indicating its presence in membrane fraction. The weak signal can be attributed to the low endogenous expression levels of DIP2 in yeast (~ 41 molecules per cell in log phase) (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003). Indeed, when we attempted to probe ScDIP2 in isolated vacuoles from yeast, its low abundance hindered the detection of signal in western blot. It may require certain conditions or optimisation to enrich ScDIP2 on vacuolar surface to get detectable signal from western blot experiments.</p><p>References:</p><p>Bai, L. L., Zhang, L.

However, upon consultation amongst reviewers, we still think that the interpretation of the new microscopy data as a proof for vacuolar localization of ScDIP2 is not conclusive. An alternative explanation of the data could be that all ScDIP2 localizes to mitochondria, and that the vacuole association (as observed by fluorescence microscopy) represents mitochondrial-vacuole contacts.</p><p>In order to clarify better this point, we request that you perform 3-color imaging of DIP2 together with mitochondrial and vacuolar markers, which will help reveal whether the association between DIP2 and vacuoles as observed in the present version of the manuscript corresponds to mitochondrial-vacuolar contacts or not. These data could even provide an exciting new observation if it confirms mitochondria-vacuole contacts, since there are not that many proteins known to localize to these contacts. The authors should adjust the text according to the outcome of these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer and editor for the excellent suggestion to probe if the observation of ScDIP2-vacuolar association corresponds to a mitochondria-vacuole contact sites. As suggested, a three colour colocalization experiment was performed using labelled ScDIP2 (GFP tagging, Green fluorescent protein), Mitochondria (DNA staining; DAPI) and Vacuole (Membrane; FM4-64). As indicated by both the reviewer and the editor, it indeed represents the site of contact between mitochondria-vacuoles. This observation has added a new dimension to the findings and allows us to say that DIP2 is a new family of protein that localizes to mitochondria-vacuole contact site. We once again sincerely thank the reviewer for pointing us to probe in this direction, which has significantly improved the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>These findings are now shown as Figure 5A, 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 1H and 1I in the revised manuscript. It is also now mentioned in the main text (line number 21-22; line number 73-75; line number 261-274 and 276-277). These new findings and its implications are also discussed briefly in the discussion (line number 408-421). Key references for these experiments have also been included (References- 21, 33, 42, 46, 49, 98 and 119). The details of this microscopy experiment is included in the materials and method section (line number 654-659).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study investigates the role of DIP2 enzymes primarily in yeast, and their roles in neutral lipid metabolism. In general the study is well conducted and provides significant preliminary data on the role of these enzymes in DAG:TAG lipid metabolism. The only major remaining concern is the conclusion of the vacuole localization of ScDIP2. Genetic manipulation of ScDIP2 clearly affects vacuole morphology and fusion, etc, but the fluorescent imaging data, as presented, does not conclusively show vacuole localization of ScDIP2-GFP. An alternative model is that all ScDIP2 simply localizes to mitochondria, and that the vacuole association simply represents mito-vacuole contacts. The new imaging data presented in this revised manuscript are compelling, but cannot rule out this alternative model. Since this vacuole localization appears to be a major tenet of the study's conclusions, additional evidence such as biochemical analysis, or even imaging with dual mito and vacuole markers, is necessary prior to making such conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank reviewer-3 for the suggestion to carry out imaging with dual mitochondria and vacuole markers. ScDIP2 indeed localizes to mitochondria-vacuole contact sites. The suggestion has definitively added a new flavour to the story. The query is addressed in detail in the essential revision query of the editor. Accordingly, changes have been made to Figure-5 and related supplementary files, main text and Discussion sections.</p></body></sub-article></article>
