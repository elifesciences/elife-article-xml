centromeric localization, and double-strand break repair in eukaryotes. Although sumoylation of histone H4 was specifically associated with gene repression, this could not be proven due to the challenge of site-specifically sumoylating H4 in cells. Biochemical crosstalk between SUMO and other histone modifications, such as H4 acetylation and H3 methylation, that are associated with active genes also remains unclear. We addressed these challenges in mechanistic studies using an H4 chemically modified at Lys12 by SUMO-3 (H4K12su) and incorporated into mononucleosomes and chromatinized plasmids for functional studies. Mononucleosome-based assays revealed that H4K12su inhibits transcription-activating H4 tail acetylation by the histone acetyltransferase p300, as well as transcription-associated H3K4 methylation by the extended catalytic module of the Set1/COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1) histone methyltransferase complex. Activator- and p300-dependent in vitro transcription assays with chromatinized plasmids revealed that H4K12su inhibits both H4 tail acetylation and RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Finally, cell-based assays with a SUMO-H4 fusion that mimics H4 tail sumoylation confirmed the negative crosstalk between histone sumoylation and acetylation/methylation. Thus, our studies establish the key role for histone sumoylation in gene silencing and its negative biochemical crosstalk with active transcription-associated marks in human cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>SUMO</kwd><kwd>acetylation</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>sumoylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA234561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roeder</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK071900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roeder</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM110430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chatterjee</surname><given-names>Champak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leonen</surname><given-names>Calvin Jon A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGH-1256082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weller</surname><given-names>Caroline E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD097408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK103667</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hawkins</surname><given-names>R David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR065952</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hawkins</surname><given-names>R David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chemically sumoylated histone H4 shows negative biochemical crosstalk with gene-activating histone acetylation and methylation marks, and directly inhibits RNA polymerase II-mediated gene transcription.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromatin is Nature’s elegant architectural solution to the challenge of packing approximately 3 billion base-pairs of human genomic DNA in an average nuclear volume of only about 500 µm<sup>3</sup>. Histones constitute the main protein component of chromatin and their reversible post-translational modifications (PTMs), or <italic>marks</italic>, regulate chromatin structure and function by a range of direct and indirect mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). Based upon their association with either transcriptionally active or silenced regions of chromatin, histone marks were proposed to constitute an epigenetic <italic>code</italic> for gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strahl and Allis, 2000</xref>). As a consequence of their early discovery and the development of modification-specific chemical and molecular biological tools, marks such as methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greer and Shi, 2012</xref>), acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007</xref>), and ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weake and Workman, 2008</xref>) have been extensively investigated in vitro and in cell culture. In contrast, histone modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein is a poorly understood mark due both to its very low abundance in cells, which prevents the isolation of sumoylated histones in quantities required for biochemical analysis, and to a lack of sumoylated histone-specific antibodies for cellular studies. First reported in human HEK293T and P493-6 B cells by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shiio and Eisenman, 2003</xref>, histone sumoylation also occurs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>), parasitic protozoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Issar et al., 2008</xref>), and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to histone ubiquitylation, sumoylation occurs on all core histones, the linker histone H1, the histone variants H2A.Z and H2A.X, and the centromeric histone variant Cse4 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hendriks and Vertegaal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ohkuni et al., 2016</xref>). Myriad roles have been proposed for histone sumoylation in different organisms, including transcriptional regulation, kinetochore assembly, the regulation of chromatin structure, and double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryu and Hochstrasser, 2021</xref>). Pioneering efforts to identify specific lysine sites of sumoylation identified K12 in histone H4 as a major recurring site of sumoylation by SUMO-2/3 (H4K12su) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galisson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hendriks et al., 2014</xref>), although multiple proximal lysines in the H4 N-terminal tail may also be enzymatically sumoylated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hendriks and Vertegaal, 2016</xref>). Genetic studies in yeast and human cells have typically associated H4 sumoylation with the repression of gene transcription, although mechanistic studies of the direct roles for histone sumoylation in human cells have remained intractable due to the dynamic nature and low abundance of sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shiio and Eisenman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nathan et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to understand the direct effects of H4K12su in chromatin, we previously applied a disulfide-directed chemical sumoylation strategy to generate uniformly and site-specifically sumoylated nucleosome arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhall et al., 2014</xref>). Biophysical studies of chromatin-array compaction remarkably showed that H4K12su is incompatible with the compact chromatin structures seen in transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Subsequent biochemical studies revealed that H4K12su stimulates intranucleosomal activity of the H3K4me2-specific histone demethylase LSD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhall et al., 2017</xref>). These studies suggested that sumoylated H4 does not directly enable heterochromatin formation and may instead act by recruiting LSD1 to genes. However, a potentially direct effect of histone H4 sumoylation on promoter-driven transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and associated initiation factors that are key for efficient eukaryotic gene transcription has remained unknown.</p><p>Pioneering studies of the reconstitution of class II promoter-driven accurate eukaryotic transcription in both nuclear extracts and purified systems have led to insights into roles for histone modifications in gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dignam et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roeder, 2019</xref>). The ability to reconstitute chromatinized plasmid templates using chemically modified histones enables studies of the roles of specific histone modifications in transcription and investigations of their crosstalk with key enzymes associated with transcription initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Multiple proteins involved in gene transcription bind to and modify histone tails, which enables the remodeling of chromatin prior to and during transcription. One such modification, acetylation of lysine side-chains on H3 and H4 by the acetyltransferase p300, is necessary for efficient activator-driven transcription of both 11 nm chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2002</xref>) and 30 nm linker histone H1-containing heterochromatin, likely through mechanisms that include direct decompaction of chromatin upon H4K16 acetylation and octamer eviction by the chromatin remodeler NAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shimada et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Due to their proposed opposing roles in gene transcription, we investigated the precise nature of biochemical crosstalk between histone sumoylation and histone acetylation by p300. Histone H4 site-specifically sumoylated at Lys12 (H4K12su) was synthesized with the aid of a traceless ligation auxiliary, 2-aminooxyethanethiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weller et al., 2014</xref>), and then incorporated into histone octamers for subsequent reconstitution of cognate mononucleosomes and chromatinized plasmids. Each sumoylated substrate was subjected to acetyltransferase assays with the full-length p300 enzyme, which revealed the inhibition of acetylation in the H4K12su tail. Consistent with this observation and requirements for both H3 and H4 acetylation for efficient in vitro transcription of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2002</xref>), replacing wild-type (wt) H4 with H4K12su in chromatinized plasmid templates dramatically inhibited p300-dependent, RNAPII-mediated transcription in vitro. Bottom-up mass spectrometry on chromatinized histones, following a novel in-gel desumoylation protocol, revealed decreased acetylation in H4K12su by p300 when compared to wt H4 acetylation. Consistent with a role in gene repression, H4K12su also inhibited H3K4 methylation by the extended catalytic module (eCM) of the Set1/COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1) methyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>). To confirm the negative crosstalk with SUMO in human cells, linear non-hydrolyzable genetic fusions of SUMO-H4 were generated in HEK293T cells and analyzed by western blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing of the associated DNA (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP]-seq).</p><p>Collectively, our observations provide the first unambiguous biochemical demonstration that sumoylated histone H4 directly inhibits RNAPII-mediated transcription from chromatin templates, and reveal its direct negative crosstalk with histone acetylation by p300 and methylation by Set1/COMPASS that are strongly associated with active gene transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution of site-specifically sumoylated octamers and nucleosomes</title><p>Site-specifically sumoylated human histone H4 at Lys12, H4K12su, was obtained by a semisynthetic strategy using the ligation auxiliary 2-aminooxyethanethiol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhall et al., 2017</xref>).

The stimulation of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity of the Set3c complex in yeast was also recently proposed for sumoylated histone H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryu et al., 2020</xref>). Although the erasure of specific methyl and acetyl marks in the H3 and H4 tails may facilitate the transcriptionally repressed state of chromatin, there remains no information regarding the re-installation of these marks by the corresponding writer enzymes in the presence of H4K12su. Key among the histone acetyltransferases (HAT) is the enzyme p300 that is recruited to chromatin by transcriptional activators and undertakes histone tail acetylation prior to transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kraus and Kadonaga, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kundu et al., 2000</xref>). Given its essential role in transcription, we investigated the effect of H4K12su on histone acetylation by p300 prior to and during transcription by RNAPII.</p><p>To investigate the direct biochemical crosstalk between H4K12su and acetylation, a western blot-based HAT assay was developed using a sequence-independent pan-acetyllysine antibody to detect lysine acetylation in all four histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). In order to effectively compare acetylation of wt H4 with H4K12su and to strictly exclude any acetylation of the surface-exposed lysines in SUMO-3 attached to H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), it was proteolyzed from H4K12su prior to western blot analysis. To this end, after acetylation by p300, the assay product was heat-inactivated at 65°C for 10 min, followed by addition of the purified catalytic domain of human SENP2 containing residues 365–590 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mikolajczyk et al., 2007</xref>). Heat inactivation precluded p300 activity during desumoylation, and enabled the direct comparison of acetylation status in H4 and H4K12su.</p><p>Histone octamers containing wt H4 were first acetylated with full-length p300 immuno-affinity purified from HEK293T cells with an N-terminal FLAG epitope-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Western blot analysis showed the robust acetylation of all four histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> top panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This is consistent with previous in vitro assays that revealed acetylation of all four histones by p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ogryzko et al., 1996</xref>). Strikingly, H4 from octamers containing H4K12su was devoid of acetylation, including H4K16ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> bottom panel), which is strongly associated with chromatin decompaction and active gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Becker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, the inhibition of H4 tail acetylation does not arise from allosteric inactivation of p300, deduced from our observation that H2A/H2B/H3 in H4K12su octamers were acetylated to the same extent as in wt H4 octamers. Additionally, western blots confirmed that SUMO-3 did not inhibit p300 autoacetylation, which is associated with robust acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Hence the inhibition of H4 acetylation in H4K12su is likely due to lysine acetylation site occlusion by proximal SUMO-3 in the H4 tail.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mononucleosome acetylation by p300</title><p>The histone acetylation assay was next undertaken with mononucleosomes containing either wt H4 or H4K12su. We failed to see significant nucleosome acetylation with pan-acetyllysine antibodies with or without pre-incubation of p300 with acetyl-CoA prior to the addition of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Due to the significantly decreased activity of p300 with nucleosomal substrates, a [<sup>3</sup>H]-acetyl-CoA co-factor was employed and the transfer of acetyl groups to histones observed by fluorography. H4 acetylation was also suppressed in mononucleosomes containing H4K12su, but not in unmodified H4 mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Our results unequivocally suggested that SUMO-3 in the H4 tail is inhibitory toward p300-mediated acetylation of chromatin, a process that is necessary for active gene transcription.</p><p>Based on the lower acetyltransferase activity observed with mononucleosomes than with octamers, we wondered if dsDNA may inhibit p300 activity. To test this, an equimolar amount of free 147 bp Widom 601 dsDNA was included in the octamer acetylation assay. The presence of DNA was sufficient to inhibit p300 activity to a similar extent as observed with mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This unexpected inhibition of p300 activity by free DNA suggests that additional factors, such as transcription factor and RNAPII binding, enable robust p300 activity on histones during transcription initiation and elongation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The effect of H4K12su on cell-free transcription from chromatinized templates</title><p>Based on our observation that H4K12su inhibits the acetylation of key H4 tail residues that are associated with p300-dependent active transcription, including H4K16 that is acetylated in euchromatin, we sought to investigate the direct effect of H4K12su on transcription in our reconstituted cell-free system. These assays employed a p300/Gal4-VP16-dependent transcription system using chromatinized plasmids assembled with reconstituted octamers containing either wt H4 or H4K12su (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The plasmid DNA template consisted of five <italic>gal4</italic> binding sites and an ~400 bp G-less cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kundu et al., 2000</xref>). Due to the absence of any engineered strong nucleosome positioning sequences in the template, chromatinization was undertaken with the histone chaperone NAP1 and the chromatin remodelers Acf1 and ISWI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). Limited micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion of the transcription templates revealed the periodic spacing of nucleosomes in chromatin assembled with either wt H4 or H4K12su octamers, and clearly indicated that H4K12su does not inhibit the formation of recombinant chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). In this background, addition of the transcription activator Gal4-VP16, p300, acetyl-CoA, [α-<sup>32</sup>P]-CTP, rNTPs, and transcriptional machinery from a HeLa nuclear extract resulted in the transcription of a 365 base RNA from the chromatin template assembled with wt H4 histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Surprisingly, and in contrast to the direct structural decompaction of chromatin by H4K12su, transcription from templates assembled with H4K12su was drastically inhibited when compared with templates assembled with wt H4. The addition of trichostatin A, a nanomolar inhibitor of class I and II HDACs, did not lead to significant changes in transcription, indicating that the repressive effect of H4K12su is not significantly mediated through HDAC1 in chromatinized templates assembled with non-acetylated histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schultz et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, our results unambiguously demonstrated transcriptional repression when site-specifically sumoylated H4 was present in chromatin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Histone H4 sumoylation inhibits in vitro transcription from chromatinized plasmid templates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme outlining steps during the in vitro transcription assay with chromatinized plasmids, nuclear extracts, activator Gal4-VP16 and p300.

Previous in vitro transcription studies with chromatinized plasmids containing either K-to-R mutations in the H4 tail or truncated H4 missing tail residues 1–19 revealed an ~80% reduced transcriptional output relative to transcription from chromatin containing wt H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2002</xref>). Chromatinized plasmids containing either wt H4 or H4K12su were incubated with Gal4-VP16, p300, and acetyl-CoA for 30 min to enable steps preceding transcription; and the histones were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) after chemical propionylation, trypsination, and separation by capillary-liquid chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sidoli and Garcia, 2017</xref>). A critical innovation in our bottom-up analysis workflow was the use of a SENP2 catalytic domain to desumoylate H4K12su within the polyacrylamide gel matrix after SDS-PAGE. This procedural step was required to generate the same H4(4–17) tryptic peptide from wt H4 and H4K12su after p300-mediated acetylation. The H4(4–17) peptide contains K5,8,12, and 16 that are known to be acetylated by p300 in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ogryzko et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the H4(4–17) tryptic peptides arising from wt H4 revealed a remarkable degree of hyperacetylation within 30 min. The most abundant peptide corresponded to the K5,8,12,16 tetra-acetylated form with some tri-acetylated species also present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that p300 acetylates histones to facilitate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shimada et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kundu et al., 2000</xref>). No significant degree of monoacetylation was observed, and a low abundance of diacetylated peptide was detected after manually searching the MS-MS spectra over the expected elution time-range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). In comparison, chromatin assembled with H4K12su generated significantly fewer hyperacetylated peptides, with approximately equal amounts of tri- and di-acetylated H4(4–17) peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>). Small amounts of unmodified H4(4–17) peptides were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). This clearly indicates that H4K12su directly inhibits p300-mediated H4 tail acetylation in the steps prior to transcription. Given the importance of H4 tail acetylation for efficient transcription, H4K12su may inhibit transcription, in part, by directly inhibiting p300 activity on H4.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>H4(4–17) tail peptides acetylated by p300 in chromatinized plasmid templates with activator Gal4-VP16<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn1">*</xref>,<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2">†</xref><sub>.</sub></sup></title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">H4(4–17) peptide</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">[M]</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">[M + 2 H]<sup>2+</sup></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">PSMH4</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">PSMH4K12su</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">prGKprGGKprGLGKprGGAKprR</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1549.89</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">775.95</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">n.d.</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">prGKprGGKacGLGKprGGAKprR</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1535.88</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">768.95</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">n.d.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">n.d.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">prGKacGGKacGLGKprGGAKprR</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1521.86</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">761.94</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">prGKacGGKacGLGKacGGAKprR</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1507.85</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">754.93</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">n.d.<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3"><sup>‡</sup></xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">prGKacGGKacGLGKprGGAKacR</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1507.85</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">754.93</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">n.d.</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn4">§</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">prGKacGGKacGLGKacGGAKacR</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1493.83</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">747.92</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">n.d.<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3"><sup>‡</sup></xref></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table1fn1"><label>*</label><p>Peptides were chemically propionylated before and after trypsinization to cap unmodified lysine side-chains and newly generated N-termini.</p></fn><fn id="table1fn2"><label>†</label><p>Tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) spectra observed contained major fragments for the shown modification pattern over other potential patterns, however, no singly acetylated peptides were observed for wild-type (wt) H4.</p></fn><fn id="table1fn3"><label>‡</label><p>Acetylation at K12 is not possible for H4K12su.</p></fn><fn id="table1fn4"><label>§</label><p>The triply acetylated peptide from H4K12su is blocked from acetylation at K12, but is propionylated after in-gel desumoylation.

This fusion positioned SUMO-3 at the N-terminus of H4 proximal to K12 in the tail while also maintaining intact epitopes for antibodies targeting H4K12ac or H4K16ac. To preclude desumoylation by intracellular SENPs, the two C-terminal Gly residues in SUMO-3 were omitted to generate the fusion protein HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4. After 48 hr of transfection, nuclear chromatin was isolated and treated with MNase to produce mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Only nucleosomes containing either one or two copies of HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4 were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA agarose beads, and the acetylation state of H4K12 and H4K16 was investigated in western blots using site-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). This analysis revealed that the attachment of SUMO-3 to the N-terminus of H4 significantly inhibits H4K16ac and has a smaller inhibitory effect on H4K12ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). If the K12 side-chain were sumoylated, then K12 would also be completely blocked from acetylation. The presence of all core histones in the pulldown also demonstrated that the ectopically expressed HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4 fusion was incorporated into chromatin within human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the biochemical relationship observed in HEK293T cells is consistent with our observation that H4K12su inhibits H4K16ac in vitro, and further indicates a degree of plasticity in the precise site of sumoylation that may exhibit negative biochemical crosstalk with H4K16ac.

In humans, H3K4me3 is installed by the SETD1A/B and MLL-1/2 enzyme complexes, while the corresponding yeast enzyme complex is COMPASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shilatifard, 2012</xref>). Importantly, the catalytic module (CM) that imparts enzymatic activity and product specificity is evolutionarily conserved in animals and yeast, and consists of Set1 and the subunits Swd1, Bre2, Swd3, and Sdc1 in COMPASS. In an effort to understand the mechanism of auto-regulation in SET1/MLL enzymatic complexes, we recently reported the reconstitution and structural characterization of an extended catalytic module (eCM) of COMPASS that contains both the nSET domain of Set1 and the Spp1 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>). Although ubiquitylation at H2BK120 stimulates the methyltransferase activity of the eCM, it is not absolutely critical for nucleosome methylation by SET1/COMPASS complexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Based on our previous observation that H4K12su biochemically opposes the presence of H3K4me2 in nucleosomes by stimulating the activity of the H3K4me1/2 demethylase LSD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhall et al., 2017</xref>), we asked if H4K12su also directly opposes the installation of H3K4me3 in nucleosomes. Recent cryo-EM structures of the COMPASS eCM bound to the nucleosome core particle show significant spatial separation between the disordered H4 tail and the eCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), thereby making it hard to predict any biochemical crosstalk between sumoylation and methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Worden et al., 2020</xref>). In order to shed light on this problem, methylation assays were undertaken with mononucleosome substrates containing either wt H4 or H4K12su and the six-subunit eCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The degree of H3K4me1/2/3 was measured by western blot with antibodies specific for the different H3 methylation states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). These experiments clearly showed that H4K12su inhibits the installation of H3K4me1/2/3 on nucleosomes. Moreover, the negative biochemical crosstalk arises from the presence of the Spp1 subunit in the eCM, because the core five-protein CM (Set1, Swd1, Bre2, Swd3, Sdc1) remained active on nucleosomes with or without the presence of H4K12su (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that H4K12su in nucleosomes engages in negative biochemical crosstalk with p300-mediated acetylation within the same H4 tail, in cis, and may engage in negative biochemical crosstalk with the COMPASS-mediated methylation in the H3 tail, in trans.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>H3K4 methylation by the extended catalytic module (eCM) of the complex of proteins associated with Set1 (COMPASS) methyltransferase complex is inhibited by H4 sumoylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the COMPASS eCM bound to a mononucleosome (PDB code 6UGM).

Interestingly, we observed no significant effect on the level of H3K4 trimethylation associated with nucleosomes containing HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4 relative to total chromatin in the HEK293 chromatin input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). This result clearly indicated that sumoylated H4 does not inhibit all H3K4 methyltransferases in humans. Although Set1/COMPASS is the only H3K4 methyltransferase in yeast, humans have the SETD1A/B and MLL1-4 family of enzymes. The MLL family methyltransferases do not contain analogs of the COMPASS Spp1 subunit that may enforce negative crosstalk with H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xue et al., 2019</xref>). However, the human SETD1A/B complex has an analog of the Spp1 subunit, namely CXXC-type zinc finger protein 1 (CFP1), which targets SET1 to actively transcribe gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we wondered if the biochemical crosstalk between H4 sumoylation and H3 methylation may be seen in the chromatin occupancy of sumoylated H4 at transcription start sites (TSSs). To address this specific crosstalk, we employed the Flp-In T-REx 293 cell line (Invitrogen) and Flp recombinase-mediated recombination between FRT sites to generate a stable HEK293T cell line containing a single copy of the FLAG-HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4(Δ1–11) gene under a doxycycline-inducible CMV promoter. In this system, fusion to the N-terminus of H4(Δ1–11) places SUMO-3 at the α-amine of H4K12 and closely mimics enzymatic sumoylation at the ε-amine of H4K12. The addition of doxycycline led to the expression and incorporation of epitope-tagged FLAG-HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4(Δ1–11) in chromatin as early as 4 hr post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Cells were harvested after 24 hr of doxycycline treatment and regions of genomic DNA associated with FLAG-HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4(Δ1–11), or with H3K4me3, were identified by ChIP with anti-HA or anti-H3K4me3 antibodies, respectively, followed by high-throughput sequencing of the associated DNA. Our analysis of chromatinized DNA associated with FLAG-HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4(Δ1–11) and H3K4me3 revealed a striking inverse correlation in their genomic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Although H3K4me3 was strongly accumulated at TSSs, FLAG-HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4(Δ1–11) was diminished at TSSs and enriched at transcription end sites. Thus, ChIP-seq analysis of gene occupancy reiterated the biochemical crosstalk between H4 sumoylation and H3K4me3.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Biochemical crosstalk between H4 sumoylation and H3 methylation in HEK293 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoprecipitation (IP) from HEK293 cells transfected with HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4 (HSH4).

Marks may directly alter chromatin structure either through their steric bulk or by changing the charge of amino acid side chains. Additionally, marks may recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes that change the modification state of other histones within a nucleosome. The biochemical crosstalk between marks is considered positive when one mark directs installation of another, and negative when one mark opposes the installation of another. The specific sumoylation of histones in chromatin was associated with the repression of gene transcription through early studies in yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shiio and Eisenman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nathan et al., 2006</xref>). We previously discovered the negative biochemical crosstalk between H4 sumoylation and H3K4me2 in nucleosomes mediated by the CoREST-LSD1 sub-complex, which suggested that sumoylation of actively transcribed regions enriched in H3K4me2 may lead to histone demethylation and silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhall et al., 2017</xref>). However, the direct effect of H4K12su in chromatin on p300-mediated gene transcription by RNAPII remained entirely unknown. Our semisynthesis of H4K12su using the ligation auxiliary, 2-aminooxyethanethiol, enabled the first interrogation of biochemical crosstalk between histone sumoylation and p300-catalyzed histone acetylation in reconstituted octamers, nucleosomes, and chromatinized plasmids. We found that although H4K12su has no significant impact on the acetylation of H2A/H2B/H3, in either histone octamer or nucleosomal contexts, it significantly impedes acetylation in the unstructured H4 N-terminal tail. While the simplest explanation is that steric bulk of the 93-amino acid SUMO-3 at K12 prevents acetylation at proximal lysines, this should not be taken for granted as ubiquitin-family modifications at lysines do not always occlude enzymatic activity at proximal sites. For example, the ubiquitylation at K119 in the H2A C-terminus by the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) E3 ligases Ring1B/Bmi1 does not inhibit ubiquitylation at K124/K127/K129 in the H2A tail by the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimeric E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uckelmann et al., 2018</xref>). Reduced acetylation may equally arise from a specific spatial orientation of the H4 tail upon its sumoylation that limits access to the p300 active site.</p><p>Given the essential role of acetylated lysines in the H4 tail on chromatin structure and gene transcription in vitro and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2002</xref>), we surmised that diminished H4 acetylation may adversely influence gene transcription. Surprisingly, replacing wt H4 with H4K12su had no significant effect on the efficiency of plasmid chromatinization by the histone chaperone Nap1 and remodelers ACF1 and ISWI, resulting in regularly positioned nucleosomes for both wt H4 and H4K12su. Notably, however, an analysis of these chromatinized plasmid substrates in activator- and p300-dependent transcription assays with nuclear extracts revealed a strong repression of transcription by H4K12su. Toward a further understanding of the H4 acetylation events whose loss may lead to this repression, bottom-up mass spectral analysis with data-independent acquisition of tryptic H4 peptides after SDS-PAGE resolution of the transcription assay components demonstrated reduced acetylation in the H4(4–17) peptide when chromatin was reconstituted with H4K12su. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mass spectral analysis of acetylation in the tail of chromatin-associated H4 following in vitro transcription, and also the first demonstration that the catalytic domain of the SUMO-specific protease SENP2 can desumoylate histones in SDS-PAGE gels. Given the inherent challenges of detecting SUMO target sites in substrates, due to the lack of a convenient trypsin cleavage site at the C-terminus of SUMO, the ability to selectively remove SUMO using SENP2 may be particularly useful for analyzing sumoylated proteins in complex mixtures that require some degree of separation by SDS-PAGE. As chromatinized plasmids containing H2B ubiquitylated at K120 show similar levels of transcription to unmodified chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2009</xref>), the inhibition of transcription we observed may not strictly be due to the steric bulk of SUMO in chromatin. Consistent with this notion, SUMO-3 fused to the N-terminus of H4 in the HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4 fusion protein also prevented acetylation at K16 in HEK293T cells from as many as 15 residues away. Importantly, the HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4 fusion protein was readily incorporated into chromatin within 24 hr, as evidenced by the co-immunoprecipitation of all four endogenous histones and ~150 bp DNA after MNase digestion. The presence of endogenous wt H4 in HA-tagged mononucleosomes indicates that HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4 forms both symmetric and asymmetric nucleosomes in cells. The observation of significantly inhibited acetylation at H4K16 within the HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4 fusion protein in cells was consistent with our in vitro biochemical observations. Interestingly, endogenous wt H4 in HA-tagged asymmetric mononucleosomes was also deficient in H4K16ac, when compared with H4K16ac in bulk chromatin. This may indicate an additional trans-nucleosome mechanism of acetyltransferase inhibition by SUMO, in addition to its cis-inhibitory effect in the H4 tail.</p><p>In addition to histone acetylation, another key histone mark associated with active transcription and enriched at promoter regions is H3K4me3. Installed by the Set1 containing COMPASS complex in yeast and the SET1/MLL1-2 family of methyltransferases in humans, H3K4me3 activates p53- and p300-dependent transcription from chromatinized plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). And although H2BK120ub stimulates the methylation of H3K4 on these templates, it is not absolutely critical for SET1 complex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Structures of the five-protein core CM of COMPASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>) and the six-protein eCM were recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>). While the CM complex does not change methyltransferase activity in the presence of H2BK120ub, the eCM demonstrates some activity on nucleosomes that is further enhanced by the presence of H2BK120ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this observation, the human SET1 complex also retains some in vitro activity on chromatinized templates lacking H2BK120ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). From the cryo-EM structure of the eCM complex bound to nucleosomes, and the relative position of the unstructured H4 tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we wondered if H4K12su would have an effect on H3K4me3 methylation by COMPASS. We discovered that although the CM is not hindered by the presence of H4K12su in nucleosomes, the eCM is significantly hindered by H4K12su. From the differences in composition of the two sub-complexes, we propose that SUMO may sterically interact with the Spp1 subunit in the eCM and may reduce nucleosome binding and/or productive catalysis by the Set1 protein. Our results from methyltransferase assays, in conjunction with previous observations that H4 tail sumoylation inhibits chromatin compaction, appear to indicate that SUMO attached to the H4 tail does not extend away from the nucleosome, but instead may reside on a specific surface of the nucleosome that prevents the close apposition of adjacent nucleosomes and the binding of histone-modifying enzymes . Future structural studies will aim to identify the precise placement of SUMO in sumoylated nucleosomes. As histone acetylation by p300 also stimulates SETD1 activity on chromatin, the direct effect of H4K12su on p300-stimulated SETD1 methylation at H3K4 also remains an interesting question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our cellular studies further revealed the complexity of crosstalk between H4K12su and H3K4me3 in humans. Although immunoprecipitated mononucleosomes containing HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4 did not show a strong negative correlation between SUMO and H3K4me3 across all regions of chromatin, this is consistent with our hypothesis that negative crosstalk is mediated by the Spp1 component of COMPASS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). The mammalian ortholog of Spp1, namely the CFP1, is entirely absent in the MLL family of H3K4 methyltransferases and is only present in the SETD1A/B family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Skalnik, 2005</xref>). Therefore, given the strong association of SETD1A/B with active gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2017</xref>), we undertook ChIP-seq experiments to probe the occupancy of genes in HEK293 cells by H3K4me3 and FLAG-HA-Su3(ΔGG)-H4(Δ1–11). Gratifyingly, we observed a stark negative correlation between gene occupancy by SUMO and H3K4me3 between the transcriptional start site (TSS) and transcription end sites of genes in HEK293 cells. Thus, our extensive investigations of biochemical crosstalk revealed that H4K12su does not inhibit H3K4 methylation genome-wide, but, instead may specifically inhibit the methylation of transcriptionally active genes by the SETD1A/B complexes.</p><p>Collectively, the disruption of H4 tail acetylation and H3 tail methylation by the presence of H4K12su along with the inhibition of p300-mediated transcription from chromatinized templates have revealed multiple, albeit not exhaustive, biochemical pathways by which histone sumoylation may inhibit gene transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These results have shed light on important aspects of chromatin regulation by histone H4 sumoylation and provide a strong mechanistic basis for the proposed roles for SUMO from studies in yeast and cultured human cells.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms of chromatin regulation by H4K12su.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transcription from chromatinized templates containing wild-type (wt) H4 is accompanied by acetylation of all four histones by p300, and with the methylation of the H3 tail by the complex of proteins associated with Set1 (COMPASS)/SET1 complexes. (<bold>B</bold>) The inhibition of PolII-mediated transcription from chromatinized templates containing H4K12su is accompanied by reduced p300-mediated H4 tail acetylation. H4K12su also inhibits H3 tail methylation by the extended catalytic module of the COMPASS complex. For clarity, only one of two histone tails, each, is shown for H3 and H4.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67952-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4"

The authors of this manuscript aims to use in vitro biochemical reconstitution to provide insights into this. They chemically synthesized histone H4 with K12 sumoylation and then reconsitituted nucleosomes or chromatinized plasmid with either unmodified H4 or sumoylated H4 and use that to examine the effect on H4 K12 sumoylation on p300 catalyzed acetylation, Set1-containing complex (eCM) -catalyzed H3 K4 methylation, as well as in vitro transcription. The author's data suggest that H4 K12 sumoylation suppresses H4 acetylation (but not other histone proteins' acetylation), H3 K4 methylation, and the in vitro transcription of chromatinized plasmid. Through these results, the authors have largely achieved their goal of providing mechanistic understandings for the transcription repression role of histone sumoylation.</p><p>The work has a number of strengths. The use of H4 with precisely controlled modification coupled with in vitro transcription assay is a very powerful approach. This work is technically challenging and the collaborative efforts of the two labs (Drs. Chatterjee and Roeder) are critical. The biochemical assays are nicely designed and carried out. For example, the in vitro transcription assay combined with the detection of histone acetylation in the reaction system is a really nice design. The results clearly showed that H4 K12 sumoylation suppresses transcription in the in vitro transcription assay and also inhibits H3 K4 methylation, which is consistent with the known effects of histone sumoylation.</p><p>The limitation of the work mainly lies in the significance of the acetylation result. The H4 K12 sumoylation's effect an acetylation (Figure 3) initially looked very impressive as it showed that K12 sumoylation dramatically suppressed H4 acetylation on K4, K8, K12, and K16. However, realizing that K12 sumoylation naturally blocks one of the acetylated K residue, this result becomes less impressive. In fact, I worry that if we remove K12 acetylation from the equation, the effect of sumoylation on H4 acetylation may be minor. Thus, whether the role of H4 sumoylation in transcription suppression is coming from suppressing acetylation is not very clear now.</p><p>As I mentioned above, my major concern is on the role of H4 K12 sumoylation on p300-catalyzed acetylation. The first time I read the manuscript, I was very excited about the result shown in Figure 2 and 3, but when I read it the second time, I realized that K12 is blocked by sumoylation and thus the maximal number of acetylation sites available at the N-terminal is three instead of four. Considering this, the acetylation result in Figure 3 becomes less exciting. This also raised the question whether the obvious transcription suppression effect shown in Figure 2 is really due to lack of acetylation on H4 K12 and K16. Unfortunately, to answer this question, more experiments need to be done. For example, the authors may need to prepare H4 with K12 and K14 to R mutation to block acetylation and see whether that's enough to suppress transcription in the in vitro transcription system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this work, this manuscript describes the effects of histone H4 sumoylation on the other histone modifications, H3K4 methylation and H4 acetylation.

Thus, their results suggest a new model for histone crosstalk of H4 sumoylation with other histone modifications. Although the analysis is solid, their research is almost only focused on in vitro study and doesn't offer any mechanism study for how histone sumoylation affects other histone modifications in vivo.

Indeed, we had written that sumoylation may repress transcription, in-part, by negative crosstalk with histone acetylation. Other mechanisms are indeed possible, such as the inhibition of histone methylation that we also showed, and cannot be excluded as contributing to transcriptional repression by SUMO without extensive investigation. Ultimately, we do not believe that these mechanisms need be mutually exclusive and they may serve to reinforce each other.</p><p>While the negative crosstalk with acetylation at 2 sites, K12 and K16, may appear somewhat unimpressive in the context of 4 total sites in the H4 tail, it is worth noting that H4K16 acetylation has the most dramatic effect on chromatin structural transitions (Shogren-Knaak, M.A. et al. <italic>Science</italic> 2006, <italic>311,</italic> 844) and is a privileged site in transcription (Dion, M.F. et al. PNAS 2005, <italic>102,</italic> 5501). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where males exhibit a two-fold increased transcription of their single X-chromosome (dosage compensation), a single H4K16R mutation is absolutely lethal (Copur, O. et al. PNAS 2018, <italic>115,</italic> 13336). This is due to the key role of H4K16ac in the activation of X-linked genes by the H4K16 acetyltransferase MOF (Akhtar, A. et al. Mol. Cell 2000, <italic>5,</italic> 367).</p><p>Because testing the mutants suggested by Reviewer 1 requires challenging radioactivity-based assays, we have further toned down the emphasis on acetylation in the Discussion section and made it clear that additional mechanisms of repression cannot be ruled out at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this work, this manuscript describes the effects of histone H4 sumoylation on the other histone modifications, H3K4 methylation and H4 acetylation.

We note that H4K12 is also a site for acetylation and methylation, hence mutation of this site would not reveal the role of sumoylation by itself, particularly when the specific SUMO ligase is unknown and cannot be knocked down/overexpressed. In fact, the steep challenge of drawing specific conclusions regarding the roles for H4K12 sumoylation in cells from any site-directed mutants is what compelled us to test the direct effect of H4K12 sumoylation in a well-defined in vitro system with nuclear extracts and semisynthetic histones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific points of concern or questions:</p><p>1. What it the effect of histone sumoylation on H3K4 methylation and H4 acetylation in vivo? To authors need to do in vivo study to determine the correlation between these histone modifications.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show by ChIP immunoblot that the negative biochemical crosstalk between H4 sumoylation and H4K16 acetylation is retained when averaged across the entire Micrococcal nuclease-accessible chromatin from HEK293T cells. This is not surprising as the negative crosstalk occurs <italic>in cis</italic> within the same H4 tail. However, H3K4me3 immunoblots with the same ChIP samples did not reveal significant negative biochemical crosstalk <italic>in trans</italic> between H4 sumoylation and H3K4me3. This is likely due to the fact that MLL-family methyltransferases do not contain analogs of the Spp1 subunit of COMPASS that enforces negative crosstalk with H4 sumoylation as we showed in the manuscript. Moreove, H3K4me3 not only marks actively transcribed genes but also occurs in broad domains on either side of the transcription start sites (Benayoun, B.A. et al. Cell 2014, <italic>158,</italic> 673 and Liu, X. et al. Nature 2016, <italic>537,</italic> 558) where different enzyme complexes may install it. It is noteworthy that COMPASS is the only H3K4 methyltransferase in yeast, while humans have the SET1 and MLL family of enzymes. The human SET1 complex does have an analog of the Spp1 subunit (CFP1). Therefore, based on the localization of CFP1, and thereby SET1, to actively transcribed gene promoters (Brown, D.A. et al. Cell Reports 2017, <italic>20,</italic> 2313) we used ChIP-seq to interrogate the co-occupancy of H3K4me3 and H4 sumoylation between transcription start and end-site in HEK293T cells in which SUMO-H4 was stochastically incorporated at detectable levels. This analysis revealed the unambiguous negative correlation between H3K4me3 and SUMO-H4 occupancy between the transcription start and end sites of genes. We have added these new data in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What is the function of this crosstalk including H4K12 sumoylation in the cell? Trnascriptoin repression? They have not provided any experimental results for this question.</p></disp-quote><p>Correlative evidence from the expression of SUMO-H4 fusions, which mimic H4 tail sumoylation, leading to gene repression in cells was shown by Shelley Berger’s labs in Genes Dev. 2006, <italic>20,</italic> 966. Histone H4 sumoylation was generally associated with gene repression by localizing the SUMO ligase Ubc9 near gene promoters (Shiio and Eisenman, PNAS 2003, <italic>100,</italic> 13225), but there was absolutely nothing known about the specific and direct effect of H4K12 sumoylation on transcription until our study. This is because H4K12 sumoylation is not easily accessible in cells due to the lack of knowledge regarding (1) its specific ligase, (2) the timing of this modification, and (3) the lack of antibodies that specifically recognize H4K12su.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Chatterjee's group previously reported H4K12su stimulates LSD1-mediated H3K4 demethylation (Dhall, et al., 2017. ACS Chem Biol), while H4K12su inhibits the installation of H3K4 methylation by COMPASS in this manuscript. Author should reveal what is true in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Both effects, the stimulation of LSD1 activity at methylated H3K4 (our previous work) and the inhibition of COMPASS-mediated methylation at H3K4 (this work) may be expected to lead to the same outcome – repression of gene transcription. However, we note that only a subset of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells are targeted for repression by the REST1 co-repressor CoREST1, and that a further subset of these neuronal genes are actually regulated by SUMO (Ouyang, J. et al. Mol Cell 2009<bold>,</bold> <italic>34,</italic> 145). Therefore, LSD1 stimulation by SUMO would be observed at very specific genes as shown by Ouyang et al. in 2009. Both the timing and genomic location of histone sumoylation, and the co-occurrence of specific methyltransferases/demethylases would dictate whether SUMO acts by preventing H3K4 methylation, or acts to recruit CoREST1 and therefore LSD1 to methylated regions of chromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure1A-D explaining how they synthesize H4K12su in octamer and mononucleosome is not novel, because Chatterjee's group already reported and showed clearly these steps in the paper (Dhall, et al., 2017.

Therefore, Figure1A-D is not required for this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We prefer to retain Figure 1A as it introduces a complex multi-step semisynthesis to a broad range of readers in a highly abbreviated single-line form while showing the key ligation auxiliary. The semisynthesis of H4K12su is a linchpin of the entire manuscript and it is critical to show Figure 1B, which indicates excellent purity of the H4K12su species that enabled tandem-MS analysis of acetylation sites. These are entirely unpublished spectra specific to reagents used in this manuscript. Figures 1C and 1D relate to octamers that were not used in the previous publication the reviewer is referring to. Those octamers were methylated, whereas these are not, and hence the nucleosomes too are different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
