Here, we use time series approaches to separate the direct contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mortality from the indirect consequences of the pandemic in the United States. We estimate excess deaths occurring above a seasonal baseline from March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022, stratified by week, state, age, and underlying mortality condition (including COVID-19 and respiratory diseases; Alzheimer’s disease; cancer; cerebrovascular diseases; diabetes; heart diseases; and external causes, which include suicides, opioid overdoses, and accidents). Over the study period, we estimate an excess of 1,065,200 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 909,800–1,218,000) all-cause deaths, of which 80% are reflected in official COVID-19 statistics. State-specific excess death estimates are highly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 serology, lending support to our approach. Mortality from 7 of the 8 studied conditions rose during the pandemic, with the exception of cancer. To separate the direct mortality consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the indirect effects of the pandemic, we fit generalized additive models (GAM) to age- state- and cause-specific weekly excess mortality, using covariates representing direct (COVID-19 intensity) and indirect pandemic effects (hospital intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy and measures of interventions stringency). We find that 84% (95% CI 65–94%) of all-cause excess mortality can be statistically attributed to the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also estimate a large direct contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection (≥67%) on mortality from diabetes, Alzheimer’s, heart diseases, and in all-cause mortality among individuals over 65 years. In contrast, indirect effects predominate in mortality from external causes and all-cause mortality among individuals under 44 years, with periods of stricter interventions associated with greater rises in mortality. Overall, on a national scale, the largest consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are attributable to the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections; yet, the secondary impacts dominate among younger age groups and in mortality from external causes. Further research on the drivers of indirect mortality is warranted as more detailed mortality data from this pandemic becomes available.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>age-specific excess mortality</kwd><kwd>COVID-19 pandemic</kwd><kwd>direct and indirect pandemic impacts</kwd><kwd>time series models</kwd><kwd>respiratory mortality</kwd><kwd>mortality from opioids, accidents, and homicides</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI137093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weinberger</surname><given-names>Daniel M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simonsen</surname><given-names>Lone</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The overall mortality consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States are predominantly attributable to the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection but there are substantial indirect effects among children and young adults, and in mortality from accidents, homicides, and overdoses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As the official death toll of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to grow, the full impacts of the pandemic on a range of conditions remain debated. By the end of January 2023, official statistics reported 1,056,000 deaths in the United States alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johns Hopkins University, 2022</xref>), although burden estimates that do not rely on official tallies suggest a higher death toll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weinberger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karlinsky and Kobak, 2021</xref>). A pandemic of the magnitude of COVID-19 would be expected to have secondary effects on unrelated health conditions; for instance, non-COVID-19 deaths increased in Spring of 2020 at the height of the first wave in part due to avoidance of the healthcare system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bollmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kansagra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mafham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Woolf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woolf et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Excess mortality approaches have been used for over a century to capture the full scope of large-scale infectious disease events, heatwaves, and earthquakes, by measuring the rise in mortality over a historical baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serfling, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weinberger et al., 2020</xref>). In the early phase of the pandemic, these approaches highlighted substantial underestimation in official statistics of COVID-19 deaths due to limited viral testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weinberger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobak, 2021</xref>). More recent analyses have examined excess mortality patterns for specific causes of death by age and socio-demographic groups and have compared the COVID-19 death toll between countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Islam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karlinsky and Kobak, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mena et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woolf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">COVID-19 Excess Mortality Collaborators, 2022</xref>). Yet, separating the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mortality from the other consequences of the pandemic remains challenging.</p><p>To measure the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to enumerate the mechanisms that could generate these effects and understand how they would manifest in mortality statistics. We first consider the direct effects of COVID-19 as those deaths that resulted from SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications. When there is evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the days or weeks before death, either virologically or clinically, it is likely that these deaths will receive a COVID-19 code during certification and these deaths will appear in official statistics. We would, however, expect variation between states in the death certification process for COVID-19. Additionally, a number of deaths triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection could result from a complicated and protracted pathologic process, especially in patients with multiple underlying chronic conditions, who may lack a history of SARS-CoV-2 testing, and whose death may not be ascribed to COVID-19. For instance, a death in a diabetic patient could have been triggered by an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in a primary code of diabetes, with a SARS-CoV-2 code either lacking or listed as contributing condition. We would then expect a rise in diabetes mortality to coincide with a rise in COVID-19 cases. A similar phenomenon has been reported for influenza, with mortality from chronic conditions rising concomitantly with influenza-associated respiratory mortality in epidemic and pandemic seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reichert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Quandelacy et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the direct impacts of COVID-19, there will be positive and negative changes in mortality during the pandemic period that are not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications. We refer to these changes as indirect impacts. Reasons for these changes include avoidance of the healthcare system for treatment of acute conditions and for management of underlying chronic conditions, stressed healthcare systems in a period of high COVID-19 incidence, mental health issues in families of patients severely affected by COVID-19, societal disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>), decreased social interaction that depresses circulation of endemic pathogens, and decreased air pollution. The indirect impacts of the pandemic on mental health, violence, and addiction remain particularly debated, with potentially large impacts on mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faust et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faust et al., 2021c</xref>). These indirect mortality changes may or may not coincide temporally with COVID-19 waves.</p><p>In the United States, there was substantial geographic and temporal heterogeneity in the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with differences in the strength and types of interventions implemented to mitigate COVID-19. In a large country with standardized death ascertainment like the United States, these heterogeneities provide an opportunity to separate the contributions of viral infection from other drivers of mortality. Here, we apply time series approaches to four large waves of COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022, to separate the direct consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on age- state- and cause-specific mortality from the indirect consequences associated with hospital strain and interventions. Our analyses indicate that the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic vary substantially by chronic condition and age group. A better understanding of these effects is particularly important for the mitigation of future large-scale pandemics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall mortality patterns</title><p>We compiled weekly US mortality data by age and state, from August 1, 2014 to January 1, 2022 for eight underlying conditions (all causes, respiratory conditions, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, external causes; see supplement for disease codes and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022b</xref>). External causes include suicides, accidents, homicides, and poisoning from opioids and other substances, among other conditions. Respiratory mortality includes deaths ascribed to COVID-19 (ICD code U07), influenza, pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases. This is our most specific indicator of excess deaths directly attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used the data until March 1, 2020 to calibrate seasonal regression models and project expected mortality baselines in the absence of a pandemic (See methods for details). Models were adjusted for influenza circulation. Pandemic excess mortality was the difference between observed and expected baseline mortality from March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022 (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/viboudc/DirectIndirectCOVID19MortalityEstimation">https://github.com/viboudc/DirectIndirectCOVID19MortalityEstimation</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viboud, 2023</xref> for data and code).</p><p>Across the United States from March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022, there were 848,866 cumulative deaths officially attributed to COVID-19, namely, with COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death. During the same period, we estimate 757,600 (95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 725,200–788,100) excess respiratory deaths and 1,065,200 (95% CI 909,800–1,218,000) excess deaths due to all-cause (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). National mortality patterns comprise four waves from March 1 to June 20, 2020 (wild-type variant); June 21 to September 19, 2020 (wild-type variant); September 20, 2020 to June 19, 2021 (wild-type and Alpha variants); June 20 to November 11, 2021 (Delta variant). A recrudescence of mortality in the last weeks of 2021 was attributable to the co-circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants. The timing and intensity of mortality varied greatly by state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">8</xref>). The first wave was concentrated in Northeastern states, while Southern and Western states experienced mortality increases during later waves. A sensitivity analysis based on the length of the historic data used for calibration of the model baseline is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>. All-cause and respiratory disease estimates, as well as national estimates, were particularly robust to the choice of the calibration period.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Weekly mortality rates (per 100,000) for select US jurisdictions and validation of COVID-19 excess mortality estimates against serology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Weekly all-cause mortality rate per 100,000 in the United States and top five most populated states, August 2, 2014 to January 1, 2022.

Excess respiratory mortality showed a significant, positive correlation with CDC seroprevalence surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022g</xref>) conducted in late December 2021 in each state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Seroprevalence estimates ranged between 11.1 and 47.7% across states, with a population-weighted national seroprevalence of 34.6%. New York and Alabama experienced higher than predicted excess mortality with respect to their reported serologic infection rates, while Illinois and Michigan had the reverse pattern. The nationwide infection fatality rate (IFR) was estimated at 0.67% (95% CI 0.60–0.73%) based on excess respiratory mortality and 0.89% (95% CI 0.77–1.02%) based on all-cause excess mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref>). Sensitivity analyses based on the maximum reported seroprevalence at any time point of the study period indicate that New York remained an outlier, with Illinois and Texas showing the reverse pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref>). Use of official COVID-19 deaths determined an IFR of 0.72% (95%CI 0.62–0.81%); interestingly, serology was more highly correlated with excess respiratory deaths than with official COVID-19 deaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref>). The IFR was significantly higher in individuals over 65 years, estimated at 5.5% (95% CI 4.5–6.6%) based on all-cause excess respiratory mortality.</p><p>Next, we compared the mortality burden of COVID-19 and influenza. We estimated excess mortality for the severe November 2017 to March 2018 influenza A/H3N2 season and for the large wave of COVID-19 in November 2020 to March 2021 (see Appendix for details). We find that nationally, over this 5 month period, the mortality burden of COVID-19 was 5.7-fold higher than that of influenza based on all-cause excess mortality. A similar pattern was seen in all states median ratio of COVID-19 to influenza excess mortality rates across states, 5.8 (IQR, 5.0–7.8), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Direct and indirect pandemic impacts by cause of death</title><p>To probe the direct and indirect mortality impacts of the pandemic, we assessed whether the trajectories of various mortality categories were synchronous with that of respiratory mortality. Synchronicity would signal a direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on these mortality categories. Overall, during the March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022 pandemic period, excess mortality increased for 6 of the 7 non-respiratory conditions studied, although the timing and intensity of the rise varied by disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Cancer was the only mortality condition that did not increase during the pandemic. Cancer deaths have remained below historic levels since March 2020, although cumulative departures from baseline were not significantly different from zero (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, mortality from chronic conditions such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and heart disease rose during the pandemic, with the trajectory of excess mortality matching the pattern of respiratory mortality in the 4 pandemic waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for national patterns, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">8</xref> for state-specific data). Across these causes of death, the first excess mortality peaks occurred within one week of the first respiratory mortality peak on April 18, 2020, with the most pronounced synchronicity patterns observed in the first wave in New York and New Jersey. Across chronic conditions, the peak of excess mortality was highest during the winter of 2020 to 21, or the third wave of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Estimation of the direct impacts of COVID-19 on non-respiratory conditions.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Cause of Death</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">No. estimated excess deaths (95% prediction interval)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">% of excess deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 (95% prediction interval)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn1">*</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>All-cause</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1,065,200 (909,800–121,8000)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">84% (65, 94)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Alzheimer’s</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">25,300 (12,600–37,600)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">70% (45, 89)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Diabetes</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">24,700 (15,900–33,300)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">70% (45, 93)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Heart diseases</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">51,300 (7,400–94,300)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">73% (32, 94)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cerebrovascular diseases</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">16,600 (5,300–27,800)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">26% (−17, 62)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>External causes</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">102,800 (81,400–123,700)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">−48% (−64, −23)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn2">†</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cancer</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4,300 (−18,100–26,500)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn3">‡</xref></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table2fn1"><label>*</label><p> Regression estimates of the direct impact of COVID-19 on cause-specific excess mortality, where weekly cause-specific excess mortality is regressed against COVID-19 intensity, strength of interventions, and ICU occupancy, using gam models.

States that experienced high cumulative excess respiratory deaths had concomitantly high excess mortality from all-causes (Spearman rho=0.81, 95% CI: 0.48–0.94), attesting to the large impact of COVID-19 on total mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig15">Appendix 1—figure 15</xref>). Synchrony between excess deaths from underlying respiratory diseases and excess deaths from underlying chronic conditions increased during the pandemic in a subset of states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>), particularly for diabetes (n=8 states), Alzheimer’s (n=5), heart diseases (n=4), and cerebrovascular diseases (n=4). In contrast, excess deaths recorded as due to cancer or external causes showed either no change (in most states) or declining synchrony (in one or two states) with respiratory mortality during the pandemic.</p><p>Next, to quantify the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on different causes of death, we used GAM to regress weekly cause-specific excess mortality on official COVID-19 deaths, the strength of non-pharmaceutical interventions, and hospital ICU occupancy (see methods for statistical approach, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig16">Appendix 1—figure 16</xref> for results). We used official COVID-19 deaths as a proxy for the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mortality. The variables measuring the strength of interventions (Oxford contingency index, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oxford University, 2021</xref>) and ICU occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Health and Human Services, 2022</xref>) allowed for the estimation of the indirect consequences of the pandemic on mortality. We found a major direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mortality from all-cause, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, and Alzheimer’s; namely, the strongest predictor of excess mortality from these causes was COVID-19 deaths. The relationship between these mortality conditions and COVID-19 deaths, while non-linear, was typically monotonically increasing. Non-pharmaceutical interventions and ICU occupancy variables were also statistically associated with excess mortality, although the form of the relationship was more complex. Non-pharmaceutical intervention variables had a curvilinear relationship with excess deaths, consistent with different mechanisms affecting different periods of the pandemic. At lower levels of interventions (measured by the Oxford contingency index between 0 and 50), representing the early stages of the lockdown in March 2020, excess mortality rose with interventions. Later in the pandemic, increased interventions were estimated to have a beneficial effect on excess mortality, driven by comparison between late 2020 when interventions were strengthened in response to increasing COVID-19 activity (Oxford index above 60), and Spring 2021 when interventions were relaxed (Oxford index between 50 and 60). The relationship with the ICU occupancy variable was more difficult to interpret, varied between causes of death, and had the lowest statistical significance of the three variables tested. Furthermore, all mortality conditions were not equally well captured by our models: the best model fit was for all-cause mortality (R2=96%) and the worst was for cerebrovascular diseases (R2=47%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Observed and predicted excess death rates by condition, United States, March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022, using generalized additive models (GAM) with weekly COVID-19 deaths, intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy, and a proxy for the strength of interventions as covariates.</title><p>Observed values are in black and predicted values are in red (mean=dark red, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) in lighter red).

Stricter interventions were associated with a nearly linear increase in external cause mortality and a decline in cancer mortality. COVID-19 deaths had a negative effect on excess mortality from external causes (i.e. high COVID-19 activity coincided with fewer excess deaths from external causes, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

State-level analyses confirmed the direct impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and heart diseases, although the effect size was generally attenuated compared to national analyses.

The ratio of official COVID-19 statistics to all-cause excess deaths increased gradually with age, with official COVID-19 deaths representing only 13% (95% CI 10–19%) of excess mortality in individuals under 25 years and over 100% in the two oldest age groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The reported age gradient is consistent with a larger direct effect of the pandemic in older age groups; further, official statistics identified more deaths in seniors than estimated by excess mortality models.</p><p>To further investigate age differences in the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic, we applied our GAM approach to age-specific data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig18">Appendix 1—figures 18</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig19">19</xref>). The COVID-19 term measuring the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mortality was statistically significant in all age groups above 45 years but not in younger age groups. In contrast, the relative contribution of indirect effects, via the intervention variable, was highest in the youngest age groups and decreased with age. Overall, the direct contribution of COVID-19 to excess mortality was estimated to increase with age, from negative and non-statistically significant in individuals under 25 years to over 100% in those over 85 years, echoing the gradient seen in official statistics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). It is also worth noting that our excess mortality estimates may be too conservative (too high) as we did not account for missed circulation of endemic pathogens (see methods and Appendix). This could explain why our estimates of direct COVID-19 contribution exceed 100% in the oldest age groups. Furthermore, periods of stricter interventions were statistically associated with increased mortality in younger individuals, independently from the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>Finally, to better understand the interplay between indirect mortality in younger age groups and deaths from external causes, we visualized age-specific monthly statistics on external deaths. These data were available for a subset of the study period (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig20">Appendix 1—figure 20</xref>). The rise in mortality from external causes was concentrated in ages 15–44 years, with a notable elevation in May to July 2020 compared to 2019 levels. By mid-2021, mortality had substantially decreased, although some of the decreases could be attributable to reporting delays.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this US study, we aimed to disentangle the direct and indirect mortality impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic from March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022 using regression models and synchronicity analyses. We find that 84% (65–94%) of the rise in all-cause mortality during this period can be statistically linked to SARS-CoV-2 activity, lending support to the predominance of the direct mortality consequences of the pandemic on a national scale. We also find a direct contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection to mortality from several chronic conditions such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and heart diseases. This contribution is not captured in official statistics that consider COVID-19 as the primary cause of death. In contrast, analysis of mortality in children and young adults, and mortality from accidents and injuries, drug overdoses, assaults, and homicides, paints a different picture. Modeling of these death strata indicates a marked relationship with proxies for the strength of interventions, supporting a dominant contribution of indirect pandemic effects unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast to other causes of death studied, cancer and suicides remained within baseline levels during the pandemic period.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking finding of our study is the large mortality burden of the pandemic in individuals 25–44 years, with an estimated 112,200 (100,200–123,100) excess deaths by January 1, 2022. Only 30% of these excess deaths are ascribed to COVID-19 in official statistics. Accordingly, our regression analysis does not support a predominant contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this age group. The trajectory of mortality in this age group is disjoint from periods of intense COVID-19 circulation and statistically tied to a variable monitoring the strength of interventions. This finding supports a possible detrimental effect of COVID-19 control measures beyond the initial lockdown period in Spring 2020, although this is an ecological study that cannot prove causality nor elucidate the mechanisms at play. And while individuals under 25 years had a low overall excess death rate during the pandemic, we find that the contribution of indirect pandemic effects is even greater in this age group. In contrast, individuals over 65 years predominantly suffered from the direct consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a study of excess mortality in over 100 countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karlinsky and Kobak, 2021</xref> note a predominance of the direct mortality consequences of the pandemic; however, they did not study age patterns. Our analysis shows that the contributions of direct and indirect effects vary with age and can skew towards indirect effects in the young, even in countries that experienced relatively high infections rates like the United States.</p><p>Prior studies have shown that a decrease in emergency visits for diabetes, stroke, and myocardial infarctions in all age groups coincided with a rise in mortality for these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lange et al., 2020</xref>). Faust et al., estimated that 38% of deaths between 25 and 44 years were due to COVID-19 during March to July 2020, compared to 26% (23–30%) in our study that considers a much longer time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faust et al., 2021a</xref>). Public health interventions, limited medical care, and behavioral changes (e.g. delays in seeking timely medical help due to fear of infection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bollmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kansagra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mafham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woolf et al., 2021</xref>) could have contributed to the surge in excess deaths unrelated to COVID-19 in young adults, resulting in a notable peak of mortality in summer 2020. In addition, we find that mortality from external causes remained elevated during May to August 2020 among young adults, likely driven by an elevation in deaths from opioid poisonings, accidents, and assaults.</p><p>Mortality from external causes increased by 102,800 (81,400–123,700) from March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022. There was a moderate correlation with pre-pandemic baseline mortality rates in state-level data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref>), indicating that states with historically high death rates from external causes experienced more prominent increases during the pandemic. The rise in external cause mortality was most pronounced in the subcategory of assaults and homicide, followed by overdoses and accidents. In contrast, mortality from suicides remained stable or below expectations. Prior work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faust et al., 2021b</xref>, reported a decrease in suicide in several countries during March to July 2020, including in the United States (10%); here, we show that suicide mortality remained stable throughout the rest of 2020–2021. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faust et al., 2021a</xref> reported that deaths from overdoses and injuries increased during March-July 2020. In our data, the increase persisted until the end of 2021. Overall, of the eight causes of death studied here, the indirect pandemic effects were statistically largest in external mortality causes.</p><p>There was strong synchronicity between respiratory mortality and mortality from other conditions during spring 2020, possibly due to poor SARS-CoV-2 test availability and guidelines to restrict testing to just hospitalized cases in the early pandemic stages. Many deaths in nursing homes or at home during March to April 2020 were never tested, and they were recorded as known unlying conditions (i.e. heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes) by default. In addition, Alzheimer patients typically live in long-term care facilities and may have been at increased risk of (untested) COVID-19 infection early in the pandemic. Interestingly, the correlation between excess mortality from respiratory diseases and Alzheimer increased in the winter 2020–2021 wave, signaling a persistent direct impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s in a period where COVID-19 incidence and testing propensity were high.</p><p>We validated our excess mortality estimates against serology and assessed the IFR, a parameter notoriously difficult to measure. Our all-age estimate of 0.67% (95% CI 0.60–0.73%) is consistent with a 2020 meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meyerowitz-Katz and Merone, 2020</xref>) and an early study from China (0.66%; 95% CI: 0.39—1.33%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Verity et al., 2020</xref>). A study of all-cause excess mortality in the Netherlands reports a substantially higher IFR (1%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Asten et al., 2021</xref>); however, all-cause mortality is not specific to COVID-19 (accordingly, our estimate based on all-cause mortality is higher at 0.89% (95% CI 0.77–1.02%)). IFR estimates based on official COVID-19 statistics were 15% higher than those based on excess respiratory mortality, yet the official statistics did not correlate with serology data as well as with our excess mortality estimates. Between-state differences in COVID-19 death coding practices could explain these findings. Overall, our analyses support the robustness and specificity of excess respiratory mortality (with the addition of the COVID-19 specific code) as an indicator of the COVID-19 mortality burden.</p><p>A few states were outliers in the regression of excess mortality against serology; for instance, New York had a higher than predicted IFR, while Michigan had a lower than predicted IFR. Several non-mutually exclusive factors could drive these findings, including a higher proportion of deaths among older individuals (aligned with the demography of New York state), large outbreaks in long-term care facilities, lack of knowledge on the management of severe patients early in the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnett et al., 2020</xref>), and waning immunity. Serosurveys conducted in December 2021 could underestimate cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in states that have experienced most of their infections in early 2020. All states contributing to CDC serology surveillance used the Roche assay to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which is less prone to waning than other assays but has some decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prete et al., 2022</xref>). We ran a sensitivity analysis using the maximum seroprevalence recorded over the study period rather than the seroprevalence at the end of the study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref>); New York remained an outlier in this analysis.</p><p>The roll-out of a large SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign starting in December 2020 in the United States has had a major impact on rates of hospitalizations and deaths for COVID-19. Yet, excess mortality from all causes and respiratory diseases has remained elevated all throughout 2021, fueled by new SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly Delta and Omicron. COVID-19 mortality is now concentrated among unvaccinated groups, with the highest vaccination rates reported in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022h</xref>). Coincidentally, in our data, excess respiratory mortality started to decouple from chronic condition excess mortality (e.g. diabetes, Alzheimer, heart diseases) around the time of the Delta wave in the summer of 2021. Similarly, among the oldest and most highly vaccinated age groups, the Delta wave had a proportionally milder impact than the wave dominated by the ancestral strain in winter 2020–21, while the pattern was reversed in younger age groups. Decoupling between COVID-19 mortality and mortality from chronic conditions is likely due to vaccination rather than a specific variant. Yet decoupling remains insufficient to obfuscate synchronicity in these conditions observed during the full study period from March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022. Further analyses of the Omicron period could reveal different synchronicity patterns.</p><p>It is interesting that during April-June 2021, and before the rise of the Delta variant, mortality from cancer, Alzheimer and heart diseases was below baseline (negative excess mortality), with a similar phenomenon observed for all-cause mortality among individuals 75–84 and over 85 years. These negative excesses could signal a displacement of the mortality baseline, whereby frail individuals are harvested by a large-scale infectious disease event, resulting in a decline in baseline mortality in the aftermath -- similar patterns have been associated with heatwaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saha et al., 2014</xref>). Harvesting is also consistent with our regression analysis, where estimates of the direct impacts of COVID-19 exceeded 100% in the two oldest age groups (albeit with broad confidence intervals, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). This would be expected if the baseline mortality was overestimated due to harvesting. Furthermore, the age profile of COVID-19 severity risk dictates that older individuals would bear the strongest effects of harvesting, which is consistent with the US data. A competing hypothesis for an inflated baseline is the role of non-COVID-19 pathogens that were repressed during the pandemic due to social distancing. These pathogens are implicitly included in our baseline model calibrated to pre-pandemic years. Although the timing of negative excesses (Spring 2021) is not fully supportive of the contribution of missed pathogens which tend to predominate in winter, harvesting and depressed pathogen circulation are two mechanisms inherently difficult to separate. A third competing mechanism is that official COVID-19 deaths capture deaths with COVID-19, rather than deaths from COVID-19. Although this is likely true to some extent, our estimates of direct effects exceed 100% in regression models that ignore official statistics, suggesting that other mechanisms are at play.</p><p>Our study is subject to several limitations. First, mortality counts below the minimum cut-off value of 10 were suppressed due to privacy regulations. As a result, our age-specific analyses were restricted to larger states, and we could not assess the role of race and ethnicity. Prior work has shown important disparities in COVID-19 impact by race/ethnicity and economic status in the United States and abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mena et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossen et al., 2021</xref>). Second, official coding practices may have changed between states and through time-based on SARS-CoV-2 testing availability, location of death, demographic factors, and comorbidities. Third, we assumed full coverage of death reporting, which may not be valid throughout the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murray et al., 2010</xref>), and we did not study changes in deaths ascribed to ill-defined codes (R codes). Ill-defined deaths would be captured in all-cause mortality but not in cause-specific analyses. Fourth, we find periods of negative excesses in cancer (throughout the pandemic), cardiovascular, and heart diseases, possibly due to changes in the ascertainment of the underlying cause of death (e.g. death in a cancer patient with COVID-19 is ascribed to COVID-19), harvesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saha et al., 2014</xref>), or depressed circulation of endemic pathogens other than influenza. Fifth, we choose to fit the model baseline to data for 2014–2020, which is arbitrary. We studied the sensitivity of our excess mortality estimates to this assumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1 - Figure 9</xref>). While national analyses were robust to this choice, as well as state-level analyses of most conditions, state-specific estimates for Alzheimer’s disease were more sensitive. Furthermore, the model baseline did not account for possible point-in-time disasters that may have occurred during the pandemic but are independent of COVID-19 (e.g. a hurricane) or changes in air pollution. Sixth, GAM indicate that the Oxford stringency index, used as a proxy for the strength of interventions, is a dominant predictor of excess mortality from external causes and all-cause mortality in individuals under 45 years. Yet, the relationships are non-linear, and the resulting models do not fully capture mortality changes during the pandemic. Along the same lines, the Oxford stringency index does not consider the actual implementation nor the effect of interventions; it is solely based on mandates in place in different locations and time periods. We also assume that, for a given level of stringency, the impact of interventions does not change over time. Because time and intervention stringency are highly conflated, it would be difficult to study potential temporal variation in this relationship. Furthermore, analyses are aggregated at the state or national level, while implementation of interventions may operate more locally. We also do not account for underlying differences in vulnerability between states, where more vulnerable states may have implemented stricter interventions (although this potential bias would not affect temporal analyses). Finally, our study ends on January 1, 2022 and does not capture a recrudescence of COVID-19-related deaths due to the Omicron variant. As a result, our excess mortality estimates should be deemed conservative.</p><p>Pandemic excess mortality patterns have been heterogeneous globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Islam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karlinsky and Kobak, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kontis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nørgaard et al., 2021</xref>). In a comprehensive analysis of mortality in 21 countries in Europe, New Zealand, and Australia, official COVID-19 deaths accounted for an average of 77% (62–93%) of all-cause excess deaths during the first wave of the pandemic from March to May 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kontis et al., 2020</xref>). However, there was a greater disconnect between estimates in hard-hit countries such as the UK, Spain, Italy, and Belgium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kontis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kontopantelis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Odone et al., 2021</xref>). In a study of over 100 countries, the ratio between excess mortality and official deaths was 1.6 on average, but went as high as 50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karlinsky and Kobak, 2021</xref>). The disconnect was primarily attributed to the under-detection of COVID-19 rather than indirect effects, although indirect effects were not explicitly modeled. In Italy, the case fatality rate for acute myocardial infarction increased threefold during the first wave, while hospitalizations for these conditions decreased by 48% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Odone et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that at least some of the excess deaths were indirect deaths. In the UK, cancer deaths increased about 10% at the height of the April 2020 lockdown; however, more recent fluctuations in cancer mortality remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, in New Zealand, where control of COVID-19 has been remarkable, mortality was slightly but not significantly below baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kontis et al., 2020</xref>). A similar finding was described in Russian provinces where a lockdown was implemented before the onset of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobak, 2021</xref>). This suggests that a lockdown without COVID-19 is neither preventing nor causing an appreciable number of deaths, although effects could be country-dependent. In the United States, the direct impacts of the pandemic greatly outweigh the indirect consequences in all age data, but the reverse is true in children and young adults. Further work should concentrate on comparing the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 in different countries over the same time period and using the same methodology.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here, we examined trends in cause-specific mortality across states and age groups to address the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 in the United States. We find that 84% (95% CI 65–94%) of the total mortality elevation during the March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2021 pandemic period is attributable to the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is, however, a large indirect impact of the pandemic on children and young adults, and on mortality from external causes, particularly from accidents, assaults, and overdoses and these indirect impacts are statistically linked to indicators of the strength of interventions. We also find an undetected contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mortality from chronic conditions, such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and heart diseases, which has not fully disappeared after 2 years of SARS-CoV-2 circulation and a large vaccination program. Our conclusions are based on ecologic analyses that are useful for generating hypotheses but do not prove causality. As more detailed information becomes available with the release of individual death certificates, it will be important to dissect the drivers of mortality among younger adults and certain ethnic groups, and understand how chronic conditions, violence, opioids, and suicides intersect with large-scale infectious disease events and behavioral changes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mortality data</title><p>We obtained weekly mortality counts from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for the period August 1, 2014 to January 1, 2022 (the last week of 2021 ended on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2022); we included 2014–2019 data to construct robust historical model baselines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022b</xref>). Data were stratified by state, six age groups (all ages, under 25 years, 25–44, 45–64, 65–74, 75–84, and over 85), and eight underlying mortality causes (all causes, respiratory conditions, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, heart disease, external causes; see supplement for disease codes). External causes include suicides, accidents, homicides, and poisoning from opioids and other substances, among other conditions. We used aggregated mortality counts ascribed to COVID-19 (ICD code U07), influenza, pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases as an indicator of ‘respiratory mortality,’ which was our most specific indicator of excess deaths directly attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we compiled weekly deaths with any mention of COVID-19 anywhere in the death certificate and considered those to be the official COVID-19 statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022c</xref>).</p><p>Weekly mortality is available with a typical lag of 7 weeks. We undertook this work more than 7 months after the last observation, ensuring that there was little reporting delay for the data presented in this study. As a result, we did not apply any backfilling algorithms, unlike prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weinberger et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To further explore patterns in external mortality causes, which include a range of conditions, we obtained additional monthly data by subcategories of deaths, including suicides, assaults and homicides, drug overdoses, accidents and unintentional injuries, and motor vehicle accidents (a subset of accidents) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022d</xref>). We also downloaded monthly deaths from external causes combined by age and region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022e</xref>). External causes of death are typically released several months later than other conditions; detailed data are unavailable at a weekly resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Other datasets</title><p>Age- and state-specific population estimates were obtained from CDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022f</xref>) and used to calculate mortality rates. To validate our mortality approach, we compared our excess mortality estimates with serology, using the CDC’s state-specific observations from the 28<sup>th</sup> round of SARS-CoV-2 serology surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022g</xref>). These surveys provide estimates of the proportion of the population with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to the nucleocapsid by late December 2021, which is a measure of cumulative infections. As the nucleocapsid antigen is not a component of the vaccines used in the United States, the serologic assay only captures natural infections. We compared these serologic estimates with our estimates of cumulative excess death rates on January 1, 2022, assuming a similar delay between infection and death, and between infection and antibody rise. This comparison was also used to estimate the IFR. We ran a sensitivity analysis on the maximum seroprevalence reported during the study period, rather than seroprevalence at the end of the study period, to account for the potential waning of natural immunity.</p><p>To adjust excess mortality models for the contribution of influenza, we used weekly data on influenza circulation based on CDC surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rudis et al., 2021</xref>). To evaluate the putative impacts of public health interventions on cause-specific mortality, we compiled the health containment index from the COVID-19 government response tracker, which measures the strength of interventions by week and state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oxford University, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, to evaluate how hospital strain may have contributed to excess mortality, we used the HHS COVID-19 dataset on hospital use, which has hospital-level indicators of ICU bed utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Health and Human Services, 2022</xref>). Data were aggregated by week and state.</p><p>All data used in the analysis were publicly available and exempt from human subject review; the data and code have been posted in a GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/viboudc/DirectIndirectCOVID19MortalityEstimation">https://github.com/viboudc/DirectIndirectCOVID19MortalityEstimation</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Analytic approach</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Excess mortality models</title><p>To estimate seasonal mortality baselines, we applied linear regression models to weekly mortality rates in the pre-pandemic period, August 1, 2014 to March 1, 2020; excess mortality was the difference between observed mortality and baseline mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weinberger et al., 2020</xref>; see Appendix for more details). Baselines were estimated separately for each mortality cause, age group, and state. The models included harmonic terms for seasonality, time trends, and a proxy for weekly influenza incidence. In this approach, we single out influenza by explicitly modeling the contribution of this virus on mortality and taking influenza mortality out of the mortality baseline. Hence, our estimates of excess deaths due to COVID-19 are deaths above the baseline from prior years, after the impact of influenza has been removed. Our choice is motivated by the fact that influenza can cause large mortality variations between years due to differences in circulating strains; hence, it is not straightforward to define an average influenza season as part of the baseline. In contrast, we do not explicitly model the mortality contribution of other pathogens, for which we do not have surveillance data, and which we assume to be less variable between years. The mortality contribution of these pathogens implicitly becomes part of the baseline. Since, the circulation of endemic pathogens has been greatly reduced during the pandemic, our baseline is likely inflated, leading to conservative estimates of excess mortality. We return to this question in the discussion.</p><p>We fitted the model to data until March 1, 2020 and projected the baseline forward until January 1, 2022. We estimated weekly excess mortality by subtracting the predicted baseline from the observed mortality that week; total excess mortality was the sum of weekly excesses (positive or negative) from March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022. We used block bootstraps to generate 95% uncertainty intervals on excess mortality estimates.</p><p>We ran cause-specific excess mortality analyses nationally and for states that had sufficient mortality counts, as weekly death counts below 10 were suppressed due to privacy concerns. States missing more than 2 weeks of data between March 1, 2020 and January 1, 2022 were excluded from the corresponding analyses. We ran respiratory excess mortality analyses for 16 states and non-respiratory analyses for 33 states (see Appendix for full list).</p><p>For reference, we compared the mortality impact of COVID-19 with that of a severe influenza season. This comparison is not straightforward as an influenza epidemic typically lasts 3–4 months while COVID-19 mortality has persisted for over 2 years. Yet, to provide context, we compared excess mortality during November to March of 2017–2018, corresponding to a recent severe influenza season dominated by the A/H3N2 virus, with the same months in 2020–2021, which correspond to the largest national wave of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Estimation of direct and indirect pandemic impacts</title><p>To assess the direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic on mortality, we performed several correlation and regression analyses evaluating the trajectory of different causes of deaths by age and geography, building on earlier work on the 1968 influenza pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reichert et al., 2004</xref>) and COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>) (see Appendix for details). First, we tested whether weekly respiratory excess mortality became increasingly correlated with other causes of death during the pandemic period March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022, compared to pre-pandemic periods of similar duration. An increase in correlation would signal a direct but undetected effect of COVID-19 on non-respiratory mortality.</p><p>Second, we assessed whether states that experienced high cumulative COVID-19 mortality experienced high cumulative mortality from other causes during the pandemic. We used our estimates of excess respiratory mortality and official COVID-19 death tallies, as complementary measures of COVID-19 mortality.</p><p>Third, we estimated the fraction of excess mortality attributable to the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection, vs the indirect impacts that are driven by non-pharmaceutical interventions and hospital strain. We regressed weekly excess mortality against COVID-19 deaths, the health containment index, and ICU use, after exploring different lags between predictors and outcomes. We used GAM to allow for non-linear effects between mortality and all covariates. Models were run separately for each cause of death, nationally and by state, and for each age group. Uncertainty in weekly excess mortality estimates was propagated into the regression models. Attributable fractions were obtained by resampling from the models after setting covariates to their minimum values reported for the pandemic period; for instance, the attributable fraction for COVID-19 was based on the relative difference in cumulative predicted mortality when the COVID-19 variable was at its observed values vs. zero, with the other covariates remaining unchanged (Appendix).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Validation of excess deaths based on serology and estimation of <bold>IFR</bold></title><p>Since COVID-19 deaths are ultimately the result of SARS-CoV-2 infections, serology can validate the accuracy of excess mortality estimates. To test the validity of the excess mortality approach for our most proximal mortality indicator of COVID-19, we regressed cumulative excess respiratory mortality rates against SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates at the state level. We used a model without intercept since we assumed a direct correspondence between rates of infection and death. We repeated this analysis with all-cause excess mortality, official COVID-19 deaths, and excess mortality in individuals over 65 years as the outcome variable. We used this analysis to estimate the IFR, based on the slope of the above regressions. We propagated the errors obtained in excess mortality and seroprevalence estimates into IFR estimates (Appendix).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-77562-transrepform1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Our study presents an analysis of publicly available surveillance and mortality data, so no new data have been generated for this manuscript.

The goal of the study is to estimate the direct mortality impact of COVID-19, which results from SARS-CoV-2 infection, from the indirect impacts of the pandemic which can be linked to societal or health-related changes brought about by the pandemic.</p><p>We define direct COVID-19 mortality as the sum of deaths confirmed and coded as COVID-19 as the underlying cause, deaths coded as another underlying primary cause but with COVID-19 as one of the contributing multiple causes, and deaths that were directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection but for which a COVID-19 code is not included in the death certificate due to misdiagnosis or lack of testing. The first two categories are included in official death tallies of COVID-19 (since a COVID-19 code appears in the death certificate), while the third category can only be estimated using excess mortality approaches.</p><p>We define the indirect mortality impact of the pandemic as the sum of deaths due to healthcare avoidance or inaccessibility, deaths due to conditions or events that are exacerbated by non-pharmaceutical interventions and other pandemic behavior, and would not have occurred otherwise (i.e. suicide, drug overdose, homicide, or a stressed healthcare system that is unable to treat conditions unrelated to SARS-CoV-2).</p><p>It is worth noting that circulation of multiple pathogens has plummeted due to social distancing interventions in 2020–2021, and therefore the pandemic could have prevented a number of infectious disease deaths relative to historical expectations. Excess mortality approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weinberger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldstein et al., 2012</xref>) will capture the net sum of these indirect impacts. These direct and indirect mortality pathways are not mutually exclusive and plausible over a wide range of conditions. For example, SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger death in a patient with diabetes, which may be missed by testing, with no COVID-19 code listed on the death certificate. Concomitantly, a diabetic patient without a recent history of SARS-CoV-2 infection may turn away from the healthcare system at the height of the pandemic and die from lack of treatment. Our analysis attempts to separate these effects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Mortality data</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-1"><title>Mortality conditions studied and states selected for further analysis</title><p>We used the international classification of disease version-10 to retrieve deaths for the period from August 1, 2014 to January 1, 2022 for the following 8 mortality outcomes: All-cause (deaths from any causes), Alzheimer’s (G30), Cancer (C00-C97), Cerebrovascular diseases (I60-I69), Diabetes (E10 – E14), Heart disease (I00-I09, I11,I13,I20-I51), Respiratory Conditions (J09-J18, J40-J47, U071[the code for COVID-19]), External Cause (V01-Y89, U01-U03).

Weekly deaths count below 10 are blanked by NCHS for privacy reasons; states that had more than 2 weeks of blanked observations during the pandemic period were excluded. For states that were retained for respiratory mortality analyses, we interpolated missing data (≤2 weeks of interpolated data over 388 study weeks). Respiratory mortality was our most restrictive mortality outcome; it is based on aggregation of deaths from pneumonia and influenza with deaths from other respiratory conditions. Pneumonia and influenza can be uncommon on a weekly basis in less populous states, especially in summer, and hence blanked observations are not uncommon in the state-level dataset.</p><p>We applied a similar reasoning to the 7 other causes of deaths that are unrelated to respiratory conditions. Death counts were more numerous for these conditions than for respiratory mortality. If a state had more than 2 blanked weeks for one of the conditions, it was excluded for analysis of the other conditions. The following 33 states were included for analysis of non-respiratory mortality: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Analytical approach</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-1"><title>Weekly excess mortality model</title><p>We applied negative binomial seasonal regression models to weekly cause- and age-specific mortality, using an identity link, inspired by prior work on COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weinberger et al., 2020</xref>).

Weekly influenza incidences after March 1, 2020 were set to zero, in line with the minimal circulation of influenza reported in this time period . Before fitting the model, we smooth the mortality data by running a 5 week moving average (this choice does not affect respiratory or all-cause mortality, but can be particularly useful to stabilize some of the state-specific time series for chronic conditions).

State-specific estimates for certain causes, particularly Alzheimer’s, were more sensitive to the amount of data included in the baseline; however, the ranking of excess mortality across states was robust to the length of data used for model fitting even for Alzheimer’s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref> shows the impact of using shorter historical time series on cumulative excess mortality estimates for the pandemic period, by state and cause of death.</p><p>Of note, the impact of seasonal influenza was estimated by having an explicit flu coefficient in the excess mortality model, while the COVID-19 impact was estimated by taking the difference between the observed mortality and baseline mortality during the pandemic period. Generally, this would be expected to inflate the impact of COVID-19, relative to influenza. It can also be difficult to compare the impact of influenza, which circulates over a relatively short winter season (typically 3 months), while COVID-19 has caused persistent excess mortality over 2 years. To address this issue, we considered a standard period, November through March, to compare the impact of the two pathogens. We estimated excess mortality during the severe influenza season of November 2017 to March 2018, compared to excess mortality during November 2020 to March 2021, a period when COVID-19 mortality was the most widespread in the US. This comparison should be caveated by the fact that our excess mortality estimates of COVID-19 captures direct and indirect pandemic effects, while by construction our influenza estimates represent direct viral effects. Yet, the scale of the difference of excess mortality between the two pathogens (five to sixfold mortality rate ratio across most US states, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>) highlights the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 disease burden.</p><fig id="app1fig11" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 11.</label><caption><title>Comparison of excess mortality from a severe influenza season (2017–2018) and the most severe of the COVID-19 waves (2020–2021 winter wave) across United States.</title><p>For the sake of comparability, we estimated all-cause excess mortality for the November tto March period for each pathogen.

In a second step, we regress weekly cause- and age-specific excess mortality against a weekly proxy for the strength of non-pharmaceutical interventions Oxford Health containment index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oxford University, 2021</xref>), weekly hospital strain (from HHS hospital occupancy mandatory reporting of ICU use during COVID-19 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Health and Human Services, 2022</xref>), and weekly COVID-19 activity (proxied by the official tallies of COVID-19 deaths in NCHS data). To allow for non-linear effects between covariates and excess mortality, we used GAM, with each covariate modeled as a smoothing spline (mgcv package in R). All models have intercepts to account for the impact of factors not captured by our three covariates.</p><p>To derive the direct contribution of COVID-19 to excess mortality, we set the COVID term to zero and calculate the ratio of (predicted_deaths_full_model – predicted_deaths_0_COVID)/predicted_deaths_full_model. This can be understood as the attributable fraction of COVID-19 on excess deaths, for any cause. We explored potential delays between excess mortality and covariates (intervention measures, hospital strain, and COVID-19 activity) using cross-correlation analysis (ccf function in R). We identified a lag of 4 weeks for interventions, 5 weeks for hospital strains, and no lag for COVID-19, consistent across mortality outcomes and age groups.</p><p>To propagate the uncertainty in excess mortality estimates (response variable) between the first and second regression steps, we resampled the weekly excess mortality estimates based on their mean estimated values and standard deviation provided by the step 1 seasonal regression model, assuming a normal distribution. We sampled excess mortality 1000 times at each week (generating 1000 time series of excess mortality) and performed GAM regression using COVID-19 activity, hospital strain and interventions as covariates. Then, for each of the 1000 regressions, we approximated the estimated direct contribution of COVID-19 as in the analysis of main data. We estimated the CI for the effect of COVID-19 on mortality based on the quantiles of the simulated estimates. This method accounts for uncertainty in the response variable as well as uncertainty in each GAM model fit. The same approach was used for national cause- and age-specific data, and for state-level data.</p><p>An alternative approach to our two-step process (Step 1: estimate weekly excess mortality and Step 2: regress weekly excess mortality against weekly COVID-19 activity, hospital use, and weekly interventions) would be to run a single regression model, where observed weekly mortality rates are regressed against seasonal terms, time trends, flu activity, COVID-19 activity, hospital use, and interventions. However, because there were only 96 pandemic weeks in our dataset, compared to 292 pre-pandemic weeks where the COVID-19 and intervention coefficients were zero, and hospital ICU use data was unavailable before the pandemic, this alternative approach would be inappropriate to get a robust estimate of the direct and indirect pandemic impacts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-4"><title>Estimation of the IFR</title><p>Without accounting for delays between infection and death, the IFR can be estimated by dividing the total number of deaths by the total number of infections.

Next, we drew 100 random samples for each of the 10,000 slope distributions.

The paper is roughly divided into two main sections. In the first section, the authors estimate age and cause-specific excess mortality. In the second section, using their excess mortality estimates, the authors attempt to disentangle the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection (direct impact) vs. the impact of NPIs on this excess mortality (indirect impact). While all reviewers agree that this is a relevant contribution, the paper needs some revisions/clarifications, particularly in the second section.</p><p>1. We would encourage authors to discuss the two different concepts of excess mortality:</p><p>(#1) what deaths were caused, directly or indirectly, by the pandemic. This is what authors seem to have aimed to assess (#2) how many additional deaths occurred during the pandemic, compared to what would have been expected in the absence of a pandemic. For such an analysis I think expected annual influenza deaths should be added back to the baseline (or subtracted from the excess)? Some of the discussion seems to relate more to an impression of #2 rather than #1 so it would be good to be explicit about what is being estimated.</p><p>2. Choosing the baseline/counterfactual is a key part of excess mortality analyses. I've seen other papers exploring different potential periods (shorter periods; either by using older or newer years, e,g 2017-2020 or 2014-2017) to test sensitivity to the choice of these periods. Moreover, I would think that an absence of other point-in-time disasters would also be a needed assumption (as these would not represent a baseline). It may be beneficial for the reader to outline explicitly the assumptions of their model. Some of these assumptions are outlined on page 5, but I am not sure whether this is an extensive list of the assumptions of this approach.</p><p>3. There are no mentions in the description of mortality data of two common issues with vital registration data. First, the presence of ill-defined deaths (R chapter, and when subdividing injuries, Y10-Y34). If these increase or decrease during the pandemic because of differentials in coding, it may over or underestimate the presence of excess mortality. Second, the lack of coverage of all deaths. Helleringer talks a bit about that here https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/51/1/85/6460626?login=true in the context of estimating excess mortality. While this issue may seem trivial in the US, Murray shows here that there is a lack of complete coverage that is differential by county in the US https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000262. While this may or may not affect the authors' analysis, I think the implicit assumption of no changes in the coverage of deaths should be made explicit.</p><p>4. We are concerned about the analysis estimating the impact of NPIs. The authors are using explicit causal language throughout this section, but there's very little discussion about the methods used and the assumptions and limitations of these methods. Specifically:</p><p>a. Please provide a bit more information on the model used for direct vs. indirect effects. We'd like to see explicit discussion of the assumptions and limitations of the approach but also of the stringency index used. Was the association between stringency index and excess deaths assumed to be linear? Or were different functional forms considered? It is also not clear how well the model fit the data.</p><p>b. Related to the above, please provide more details on how the results of the regressions were translated into the results presented. The main text reports percentages, but the methods only briefly explain how numbers of direct deaths were calculated, and the supplementary tables report coefficients. It is not clear if these estimates of direct and indirect deaths were somehow constrained to add up to the total number of excess deaths, but it doesn't seem like it since point estimates cross 100% in some cases.</p><p>c. Please be more explicit about causal assumptions (see comment 6 of reviewer 2).</p><p>d. Please discuss the potential limitations of using the stringency index to quantify NPIs particularly since it doesn't take into account the actual implementation of the measures (and how this may have varied over time).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on excess mortality in the US up to April 30, 2021. The authors separate direct impacts (caused by COVID-19, coded as such or not) of the pandemic from indirect impacts (disruptions), finding that most excess deaths (90%) are due to direct impacts. Importantly, the authors find that the official COVID-19 death tally is an undercount of these deaths. Moreover, the authors also find that excess deaths due to other causes are the main driver of excess mortality among younger populations. This is a very important research question that the authors have addressed using robust methods. I have a few suggestions that I hope can help clarify the reporting of results and outlining of assumptions.</p><p>1. Abstract: since the study presents several axes of comparison (old vs young, direct vs indirect, specific causes vs one another) the abstract is quite complicated, and there are a few sections that may benefit from clarification. Specifically: (a) the authors mention the indirect effects</p><p>2. The framing of the study in the introduction may benefit from a more comprehensive outlining of potential directions that mortality may change with the pandemic. For example, declines in mortality have been observed in many settings (e.g. Chile and Guatemala; or in Figure 3 of this paper) following lockdowns in areas with low COVID-19 spread. This is mostly due to declines in external causes (mostly traffic crashes) and air pollution-related deaths (e.g. CVD or infant deaths). The authors just mention one potential directionality (COVID-19 increasing some deaths directly, and NPIs causing other deaths) without any mention to a lowering of mortality that may obscure these increases.</p><p>3. Choosing the baseline/counterfactual is a key part of excess mortality analyses. I've seen other papers exploring different potential periods (shorter periods; either by using older or newer years, e,g 2017-2020 or 2014-2017) to test sensitivity to the choice of these periods. Moreover, I would think that an absence of other point-in-time disasters would also be a needed assumption (as these would not represent a baseline). It may be beneficial for the reader to outline explicitly the assumptions of their model. Some of these assumptions are outlined on page 5, but I am not sure whether this is an extensive list of the assumptions of this approach.</p><p>4. I see no mentions in the description of mortality data of two common issues with vital registration data. First, the presence of ill-defined deaths (R chapter, and when subdividing injuries, Y10-Y34). If these increase or decrease during the pandemic because of differentials in coding, it may over or underestimate the presence of excess mortality. Second, the lack of coverage of all deaths. Helleringer talks a bit about that here https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/51/1/85/6460626?login=true in the context of estimating excess mortality. While this issue may seem trivial in the US, Murray shows here that there is a lack of complete coverage that is differential by county in the US https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000262. While this may or may not affect the authors' analysis, I think the implicit assumption of no changes in the coverage of deaths should be made explicit.</p><p>5. Direct deaths: the authors use COVID-19, influenza, pneumonia, and COPD deaths as an indicator of respiratory mortality. Is this the list of ICD codes in P28 (2.a) of the appendix? The authors also use &quot;mention of COVID-19&quot; as an indicator of directly caused deaths. How is this operationalized? Is it ICD10 code U07? Or does this not rely on ICD coding? The list of respiratory codes in the supplement makes it seem like this is ICD based, but it is unclear from the text itself.</p><p>6. I am concerned about the analysis estimating the impact of NPIs. The authors are using explicit causal language throughout this section, but there's very little discussion about the causal assumptions underpinning this analysis. Specifically: (a) I see no approach to addressing lack of exchangeability (for example, areas that implemented more NPIs may have a more vulnerable population, hence the political will to implement them); (b) no discussion of issues with levels of analysis from a jurisdictional point of view, since the level of devolvement of power from states to local jurisdictions varies widely by state, making state-level analysis potentially tricky (and county-level ones too for that matter); and (c) issues with measurement error, specifically differential measurement error of the outcome, influenced by the exposure (improved vital registration coding in areas with more or less NPIs due to better established public health systems). Last, the authors are framing this analysis as a way to &quot;quantify the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on different causes of death&quot;. I am failing to grasp the intuition of how this analysis helps with this objective, so it may need to be explicitly set in the methods section.</p><p>7. I want to commend the authors for their presentation of results. Specifically, the rounding of mortality estimates to avoid false notions of precision and very clear figures. A few notes on figures: (a) figure 1 is lacking a title in my PDF, and the black line is not included in the legend I am guessing it corresponds to the state in the facet title; (b) figure 2 is missing confidence intervals for respiratory illnesses; (c) I suggest the authors map the results of table 1, as a spatial pattern will most likely emerge (top by excess mortality are all Deep South or Northeast states).</p><p>8. The results comparing COVID-19 to the 2017/2018 flu season are very interesting, as they help contextualize the impact. However, I am a bit concerned about &quot;denominators&quot; here, specifically time. The authors compared 13 months of excess mortality to an undetermined number of months (4? 6? 12?). I am not sure how influenza seasons are conceptualized, and I think it'd be good to be explicit with its duration. I understand that the authors may be wanting to compare a &quot;full season&quot; of influenza vs one of COVID-19, but is this direct comparison even possible, considering the different (or lack of?) seasonality of COVID-19?</p><p>9. There's another result I am having trouble (a) interpreting it and (b) understanding where it comes from: % of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. The authors seem to be interpreting this as direct effects of COVID-19 infection, as opposed to indirect effects due to disruptions, at least according to the appendix. My comment 2 above already covers the idea that only thinking about increases in mortality due to NPIs is an incomplete framing, as there are reasons why we expect deaths to actually decline during lockdowns (traffic or air pollution-related ones). There's a cursory mention of this in the appendix, but it is restricted to other respiratory deaths. To follow the authors' example in the appendix, a person with diabetes may also not have died because the air pollution levels in their city plummeted and the MI they were about to have did not happen. Or because their car didn't crash (or another car didn't crash on them) because traffic levels plummeted too. On (b), understanding where it comes from, the appendix provides extra clues (the main text doesn't explain this part that much). If I am understanding things right, the authors are regressing age and cause-specific mortality on NPI strength and on weekly deaths. They are then multiplying the COVID-19 deaths coefficient by the number of deaths to get the # of deaths directly caused by COVID-19. The authors do test potential lags, as both NPIs and deaths may have lagged effects or may be the result of lags between infections and deaths. However, I don't fully follow: (a) why the NPI adjustment is needed at all, (b) why are deaths an adequate COVID-19 activity indicator, especially since authors find a 0-week lag (pretty self-fulfilling, given that they are regressing deaths on a subset of deaths), which doesn't speak much about healthcare disruptions (which occur weeks before that point). One last concern I have is of competing risks, and whether areas with more strict NPIs would have lower direct excess mortality, increasing the % of deaths that are indirectly attributable to the pandemic, not because these deaths were caused by the pandemic, but because they could not have been caused by a well-controlled epidemic (given NPIs).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77562.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a very interesting paper quantifying excess deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA.

For such an analysis I think expected annual influenza deaths should be added back to the baseline (or subtracted from the excess)? Some of the discussion seems to relate more to an impression of #2 rather than #1 so it would be good to be explicit about what is being estimated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We have clarified our assumptions and justification for the construction of the baseline. Overall, our excess mortality approach estimates deaths above mortality from past years; here we single out influenza by adding a covariate for flu in the regression and take it out of the baseline. Excess deaths due to COVID19 are deaths above the baseline estimated from prior years, after the impact of influenza has been removed. Our choice is motivated by the large variation in influenza mortality burden between years due to differences in circulating strains – it is not straightforward to define an average flu season. On the other hand, we do not single out deaths from many other viral infections that are presumably less variable between years (for which we do not have viral activity proxies) – these viruses have been greatly reduced during the pandemic and hence this means our baseline is likely inflated.</p><p>We have now clarified our assumptions about the baseline in the methods section (a slightly condensed version of the above response is provided in the first paragraph of analytic approach, p 5). Also, we return to the meaning of the baseline in discussion (limitations section, bottom of p12). Further, we now provide a comparison of influenza and COVID-19 excess mortality for a comparable period of virus circulation (bottom of p7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Choosing the baseline/counterfactual is a key part of excess mortality analyses. I've seen other papers exploring different potential periods (shorter periods; either by using older or newer years, e,g 2017-2020 or 2014-2017) to test sensitivity to the choice of these periods. Moreover, I would think that an absence of other point-in-time disasters would also be a needed assumption (as these would not represent a baseline). It may be beneficial for the reader to outline explicitly the assumptions of their model. Some of these assumptions are outlined on page 5, but I am not sure whether this is an extensive list of the assumptions of this approach.</p></disp-quote><p>These are fair points. We do not know of any other point-in-time disasters that would have occurred in our study period but cannot entirely rule out such contribution. We have added a caveat to the list of limitations at the top of p13.</p><p>To address the issue of sensitivity to the number of years included in the baseline, we have explored a shorter historical window of 4 years (2016-2020) instead of 6 years in the original analysis (2014-2020). The results are shown in Figure S9 and commented in the Results section (top of p 7) and discussion (limitations, top of p 13). Estimates of all-cause and respiratory excess mortality were extremely robust to the length of the calibration data for the model baseline, and so were all national cause-specific estimates. State- and cause-specific estimates were more sensitive to this choice, especially for Alzheimer’s and heart diseases, due to short-term trends and small counts in some of the time series. We note that our main conclusions are based on national estimates, which were less sensitive to the choice of calibration data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There are no mentions in the description of mortality data of two common issues with vital registration data. First, the presence of ill-defined deaths (R chapter, and when subdividing injuries, Y10-Y34). If these increase or decrease during the pandemic because of differentials in coding, it may over or underestimate the presence of excess mortality. Second, the lack of coverage of all deaths. Helleringer talks a bit about that here https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/51/1/85/6460626?login=true in the context of estimating excess mortality. While this issue may seem trivial in the US, Murray shows here that there is a lack of complete coverage that is differential by county in the US https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000262. While this may or may not affect the authors' analysis, I think the implicit assumption of no changes in the coverage of deaths should be made explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a mention of coverage issues and changes in reporting of ill-defined deaths to the limitation section (top of p13) and refer to the Murray paper. We note that ill-defined deaths would be captured in all-cause mortality but not in cause-specific mortality.

We are concerned about the analysis estimating the impact of NPIs.

Specifically:</p><p>a. Please provide a bit more information on the model used for direct vs. indirect effects. We'd like to see explicit discussion of the assumptions and limitations of the approach but also of the stringency index used. Was the association between stringency index and excess deaths assumed to be linear? Or were different functional forms considered? It is also not clear how well the model fit the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have entirely revamped our analysis of direct and indirect effects and provided more information in the main text and supplement. A list of these changes is provided here:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>We now use generalized additive models (gam) which allow for non-linear relationships between covariates and excess mortality.

Related to the above, please provide more details on how the results of the regressions were translated into the results presented. The main text reports percentages, but the methods only briefly explain how numbers of direct deaths were calculated, and the supplementary tables report coefficients. It is not clear if these estimates of direct and indirect deaths were somehow constrained to add up to the total number of excess deaths, but it doesn't seem like it since point estimates cross 100% in some cases.</p></disp-quote><p>That’s correct; estimates are not constrained to 100%. We have provided more details about the estimation of the percentages (=attributable fraction) in the main text (middle of p6) and in the supplement (p 4-5). Briefly, to estimate the direct impact of COVID19, we calculate expected excess deaths with the full gam model, where all predictors are set to their observed values, and with a zero-COVID19 model, where the COVID19 predictor is set to zero. The estimated fraction attributable to COVID19 (direct impact of the pandemic) is the difference between the predicted values by the full model and the zero-COVID19 model, divided by the predictions of the full model. The full equation is provided in supplement p4-5. Confidence intervals on these percentages are based on resampling excess mortality estimates, refitting the gam models, and repeating the above procedure 1000 times for each mortality stratum.</p><p>We think important to not restrict estimates to remain below 100% since we find consistent percentages above 100% in both gam approach and the “empirical” comparison with official statistics (Table 4, estimates for seniors). These results point at the possible effects of harvesting and/or inflated baseline due to depressed pathogen circulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Please be more explicit about causal assumptions (see comment 6 of reviewer 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the attribution model in methods and supplement and removed causal language.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Please discuss the potential limitations of using the stringency index to quantify NPIs particularly since it doesn't take into account the actual implementation of the measures (and how this may have varied over time).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added several sentences to this effect in the caveats section p 13. “Generalized additive models indicate that a proxy for the strength of interventions is a dominant predictor of excess mortality from external causes and all-cause mortality in individuals under 45 yrs. Yet, the relationships are non-linear, and the resulting models do not fully capture mortality changes during the pandemic. Along the same lines, the Oxford stringency index used as a proxy for interventions does not consider the actual implementation nor the effect of interventions; it is solely based on mandates in place in different locations and time periods. We also assume that, for a given level of stringency, the impact of interventions does not change over time. Because time and intervention stringency are highly conflated, it would be difficult to study temporal variation in this relationship.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this paper, the authors examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on excess mortality in the US up to April 30, 2021. The authors separate direct impacts (caused by COVID-19, coded as such or not) of the pandemic from indirect impacts (disruptions), finding that most excess deaths (90%) are due to direct impacts. Importantly, the authors find that the official COVID-19 death tally is an undercount of these deaths. Moreover, the authors also find that excess deaths due to other causes are the main driver of excess mortality among younger populations. This is a very important research question that the authors have addressed using robust methods. I have a few suggestions that I hope can help clarify the reporting of results and outlining of assumptions.</p><p>1. Abstract: since the study presents several axes of comparison (old vs young, direct vs indirect, specific causes vs one another) the abstract is quite complicated, and there are a few sections that may benefit from clarification. Specifically: (a) the authors mention the indirect effects</p></disp-quote><p>It looks like the end of this comment may have been cut; but the point about the abstract being complicated is well taken. We have hopefully simplified the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The framing of the study in the introduction may benefit from a more comprehensive outlining of potential directions that mortality may change with the pandemic. For example, declines in mortality have been observed in many settings (e.g. Chile and Guatemala; or in Figure 3 of this paper) following lockdowns in areas with low COVID-19 spread. This is mostly due to declines in external causes (mostly traffic crashes) and air pollution-related deaths (e.g. CVD or infant deaths). The authors just mention one potential directionality (COVID-19 increasing some deaths directly, and NPIs causing other deaths) without any mention to a lowering of mortality that may obscure these increases.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We do mention the potential mortality declines brought about by lockdown in discussion (end of p13). In the revised introduction (p3), we have provided a fuller list of mechanisms that may increase or decrease mortality during the pandemic and explained how we would expect to see these mechanisms manifest in data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Direct deaths: the authors use COVID-19, influenza, pneumonia, and COPD deaths as an indicator of respiratory mortality. Is this the list of ICD codes in P28 (2.a) of the appendix? The authors also use &quot;mention of COVID-19&quot; as an indicator of directly caused deaths. How is this operationalized? Is it ICD10 code U07? Or does this not rely on ICD coding? The list of respiratory codes in the supplement makes it seem like this is ICD based, but it is unclear from the text itself.</p></disp-quote><p>The list of ICD codes is provided in supplement p1. Our entire analysis is based on ICD codes, and we use U07 for COVID-19. We have clarified this in methods of the main text (p4). Note that throughout the paper, we use the aggregated time series made available in near real time throughout the pandemic by CDC/NCHS, so the data have already been tabulated by select categories of codes and we cannot create different categories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. I am concerned about the analysis estimating the impact of NPIs. The authors are using explicit causal language throughout this section, but there's very little discussion about the causal assumptions underpinning this analysis. Specifically: (a) I see no approach to addressing lack of exchangeability (for example, areas that implemented more NPIs may have a more vulnerable population, hence the political will to implement them); (b) no discussion of issues with levels of analysis from a jurisdictional point of view, since the level of devolvement of power from states to local jurisdictions varies widely by state, making state-level analysis potentially tricky (and county-level ones too for that matter); and (c) issues with measurement error, specifically differential measurement error of the outcome, influenced by the exposure (improved vital registration coding in areas with more or less NPIs due to better established public health systems). Last, the authors are framing this analysis as a way to &quot;quantify the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on different causes of death&quot;. I am failing to grasp the intuition of how this analysis helps with this objective, so it may need to be explicitly set in the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our list of caveats for this analysis based on the comments by this and other reviewers (p 13, the full section is also appended below). In particular, we have added comments regarding differential vulnerability of the populations, changes in coding and coverage of vital statistics during COVID-19, and lack of consideration of NPI implementation at the local level.</p><p>Limitation section p 13: “Our study is subject to several limitations. First, mortality counts below the minimum cut-off value of 10 were suppressed due to privacy regulations. As a result, our age-specific analyses were restricted to larger states, and we could not assess the role of race/ethnicity. Prior work has shown important disparities in COVID-19 impact by race/ethnicity and economic status (Mena et al., 2021; Rossen, 2021) in the US and abroad. Second, official coding practices may have changed between states and through time based on SARS-CoV-2 testing availability, location of death, demographic factors, and comorbidities. Third, we assumed full coverage of deaths reporting, which may not be valid throughout the US (Murray et al., 2010), and we did not study changes in deaths ascribed to ill-defined codes (R codes). Ill-defined deaths would be captured in all-cause mortality but not in cause-specific analyses. Fourth, we find periods of negative excesses in cancer (throughout the pandemic), cardiovascular, and heart diseases, possibly due to changes in ascertainment of underlying cause of death (e.g. a death in a cancer patient with COVID-19 is ascribed to COVID-19), harvesting (Saha et al., 2013), or depressed circulation of endemic pathogens other than influenza. Fifth, we choose to fit the model baseline to data for 2014-2020, which is arbitrary. We studied the sensitivity of our excess mortality estimates to this assumption (Supplement). While national analyses were robust to this choice, as well as state-level analyses of most conditions, state-specific estimates for Alzheimer’s disease were more sensitive. Further, the model baseline does not account for possible point-in-time disasters that may have occurred during the pandemic but are independent of COVID19 (eg, a hurricane) or changes in air pollution. Sixth, generalized additive models indicate that the Oxford stringency index, a proxy for the strength of interventions, is a dominant predictor of excess mortality from external causes and all-cause mortality in individuals under 45 yrs. Yet, the relationships are non-linear, and the resulting models do not fully capture mortality changes during the pandemic. Along the same lines, the Oxford stringency index does not consider the actual implementation nor the effect of interventions; it is solely based on mandates in place in different locations and time periods. We also assume that, for a given level of stringency, the impact of interventions does not change over time. Because time and intervention stringency are highly conflated, it would be difficult to study potential temporal variation in this relationship. Further, analyses are aggregated at the state or national level, while implementation of interventions may operate more locally. We also do not account for underlying differences in vulnerability between states, where more vulnerable states may have implemented stricter interventions (although this potential bias would not affect temporal analyses). Finally, our study ends on January 1, 2022 and does not capture a recrudescence of COVID-19-related deaths due to the Omicron variant. As a result, our excess mortality estimates should be deemed conservative.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I want to commend the authors for their presentation of results. Specifically, the rounding of mortality estimates to avoid false notions of precision and very clear figures. A few notes on figures: (a) figure 1 is lacking a title in my PDF, and the black line is not included in the legend (I am guessing it corresponds to the state in the facet title); (b) figure 2 is missing confidence intervals for respiratory illnesses; (c) I suggest the authors map the results of table 1, as a spatial pattern will most likely emerge (top by excess mortality are all Deep South or Northeast states).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have added a title to figure 1 and a legend for the back line. As regards mapping all-cause excess mortality, now that every state has experienced multiple waves of COVID19, and each state was hit hard at a different time, the geography of excess mortality for the combined study period of March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022 is not as meaningful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The results comparing COVID-19 to the 2017/2018 flu season are very interesting, as they help contextualize the impact. However, I am a bit concerned about &quot;denominators&quot; here, specifically time. The authors compared 13 months of excess mortality to an undetermined number of months (4? 6? 12?). I am not sure how influenza seasons are conceptualized, and I think it'd be good to be explicit with its duration. I understand that the authors may be wanting to compare a &quot;full season&quot; of influenza vs one of COVID-19, but is this direct comparison even possible, considering the different (or lack of?) seasonality of COVID-19?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that these comparisons were for different epidemic durations. We have revamped this section. It is tricky to find a particular time period that is relevant for comparison since COVID19 mortality has been quite heterogeneous across the US. Yet we elected to use the November to March period for both pathogens, comparing the severe A/H3N2 flu season in Nov 2017-Mar 2018, with the first winter wave of COVID19 from Nov 2020-Mar 2021 (where excess mortality was experienced by all states). This comparison highlights the magnitude of COVID-19, where excess mortality is 5-6 fold higher than excess mortality from flu, just for these 5 months. The relevant sections of results (middle of p 7) and Appendix have been updated and a new figure was added to supplement (Figure S11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. There's another result I am having trouble (a) interpreting it and (b) understanding where it comes from: % of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. The authors seem to be interpreting this as direct effects of COVID-19 infection, as opposed to indirect effects due to disruptions, at least according to the appendix. My comment 2 above already covers the idea that only thinking about increases in mortality due to NPIs is an incomplete framing, as there are reasons why we expect deaths to actually decline during lockdowns (traffic or air pollution-related ones). There's a cursory mention of this in the appendix, but it is restricted to other respiratory deaths. To follow the authors' example in the appendix, a person with diabetes may also not have died because the air pollution levels in their city plummeted and the MI they were about to have did not happen. Or because their car didn't crash (or another car didn't crash on them) because traffic levels plummeted too. On (b), understanding where it comes from, the appendix provides extra clues (the main text doesn't explain this part that much). If I am understanding things right, the authors are regressing age and cause-specific mortality on NPI strength and on weekly deaths. They are then multiplying the COVID-19 deaths coefficient by the number of deaths to get the # of deaths directly caused by COVID-19. The authors do test potential lags, as both NPIs and deaths may have lagged effects or may be the result of lags between infections and deaths. However, I don't fully follow: (a) why the NPI adjustment is needed at all, (b) why are deaths an adequate COVID-19 activity indicator, especially since authors find a 0-week lag (pretty self-fulfilling, given that they are regressing deaths on a subset of deaths), which doesn't speak much about healthcare disruptions (which occur weeks before that point).</p></disp-quote><p>We do not consider NPI as an adjustment, merely as a potential covariate representing a broad set of interventions that may affect mortality. As the reviewer points out, an effect of interventions on mortality could be either positive or negative, for instance lockdown reducing pollution in turn reducing cardiac deaths, or lockdown increasing mental health issues in turn increasing suicide or opioids deaths. We have now included a fuller list of mechanisms involving interventions in the introduction (including air pollution) to clarify our thinking and justify the choice of the model with COVID indicator and NPI (p3 of introduction). As regards healthcare disruptions, we have expanded the attribution model to include ICU occupancy.</p><p>Our approach for estimating the % of deaths directly due to COVID19 has changed as well. We use a gam model to identify the relationship between excess deaths and covariates (COVID19, NPI and ICU), and compare the excess mortality predictions of the full gam model with COVID19, NPI and ICU covariates to their observed values, vs those of the same model but where COVID19 is set to zero. This is now detailed in methods and supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One last concern I have is of competing risks, and whether areas with more strict NPIs would have lower direct excess mortality, increasing the % of deaths that are indirectly attributable to the pandemic, not because these deaths were caused by the pandemic, but because they could not have been caused by a well-controlled epidemic (given NPIs).</p></disp-quote><p>We try to address this point by discussing countries which have experienced lockdowns without a COVID19 epidemic (eg Australia before Omicron, Russia before the wild-type variant arrived, end p 13). In essence, if NPIs work to control SARS circulation, then mortality should either be at baseline levels (hence excess mortality is zero), or below baseline levels (negative excess mortality). Australia and Russia seem to have experienced the former (zero excess mortality).</p></body></sub-article></article>
