essential for everyday interactions. This cognitive function fails occasionally during socially challenging situations, and systematically in social psychopathologies. We delivered dual-site phase-coupled brain stimulation to facilitate theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling between frontal regions known to implement that form of control, while neuropsychologically healthy human male participants were challenged to control their automatic action tendencies in a social–emotional approach/avoidance-task. Participants had increased control over their emotional action tendencies, depending on the relative phase and dose of the intervention. Concurrently measured fMRI effects of task and stimulation indicated that the intervention improved control by increasing the efficacy of anterior prefrontal inhibition over the sensorimotor cortex. This enhancement of emotional action control provides causal evidence for phase-amplitude coupling mechanisms guiding action selection during emotional-action control. Generally, the finding illustrates the potential of physiologically-grounded interventions aimed at reducing neural noise in cerebral circuits where communication relies on phase-amplitude coupling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social-emotional control</kwd><kwd>transcranial alternating current stimulation</kwd><kwd>tACS</kwd><kwd>theta-gamma coupling</kwd><kwd>phase-amplitude coupling</kwd><kwd>prefrontal control</kwd><kwd>tACS-fMRI</kwd><kwd>emotional control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(#453-12-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roelofs</surname><given-names>Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC_CoG-2017_772337</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roelofs</surname><given-names>Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Non-invasive manipulation of endogenously coupled neural rhythms enhances human control of social-emotional actions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to control emotional actions is paramount for successful engagement in human social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hare, 2017</xref>). Long-standing theorizing and accumulating empirical evidence indicate that affective cues automatically activate approach-avoidance action tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ridderinkhof, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Phaf et al., 2014</xref>). Effective emotion control requires the cognitive capacity to suppress those automatic action tendencies and to select an alternative course of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Etkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koch et al., 2018</xref>). The importance of emotional-action control becomes apparent when it is disrupted: In social psychopathologies such as social anxiety, the inability to override social avoidance tendencies constitutes the core maintaining factor of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Craske and Stein, 2016</xref>). There is great interest in potentiating this cognitive capacity to enhance treatment efficacy, as well as to help professionals exposed to socially challenging situations. However, improving human emotional-action control has proven difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">den Uyl et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we use a brain stimulation intervention designed to enhance synchrony within a cerebral circuit known to support emotional-action control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bramson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volman et al., 2011a</xref>). By modeling how effective and structural connectivity of that cerebral circuit mediates the behavioral effects of the intervention, we provide an account of its neural effects, paving the way for physiologically-grounded therapeutic interventions in social-emotional disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Voytek and Knight, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous non-invasive brain stimulation interventions have been successful in <italic>reducing</italic> emotional-action control. This was achieved by disrupting neural activity – putatively by injecting neural noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwarzkopf et al., 2011</xref>) – in a region known to coordinate emotional-action control: the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volman et al., 2011a</xref>). Here we explore whether it is possible to <italic>enhance</italic> emotional-action control by using brain stimulation aimed at reducing neural noise, targeting a cortical circuit known to regulate those action-tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">den Uyl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bramson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volman et al., 2011a</xref>). This gain-of-function intervention is grounded on recent insights showing that emotional-action control requires neural synchronization between aPFC theta-band rhythm and sensorimotor broadband gamma activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bramson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Canolty and Knight, 2010</xref>). We reasoned that endogenous neural synchronization might be enhanced by applying separate time-varying electric fields (transcranial alternating current stimulation; tACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fröhlich and McCormick, 2010</xref>]) to aPFC and sensorimotor cortex (SMC). tACS influences spike timing of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fröhlich and McCormick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krause et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>), and entrains neural rhythms to its frequency and phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reinhart and Nguyen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>). We applied dual-site phase-coupled tACS to enhance the endogenous synchronization of SMC gamma-band power (75 Hz) with the peaks of aPFC theta-band rhythm (6 Hz) evoked during emotional-action control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bramson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nowak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akkad et al., 2020</xref>). Enhanced phase-amplitude coupling would reduce neural noise in aPFC-SMC communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Voytek and Knight, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Canolty and Knight, 2010</xref>), allowing for improved control over emotional-action tendencies. Crucially, we apply this aPFC-SMC stimulation while 41 human male participants with no history of mental illness perform an emotional-action control task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We compare the online behavioral and neural effects of in-phase, anti-phase, and sham couplings between the power envelope of SMC gamma stimulation and the peaks of aPFC theta stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>,B). Importantly, concurrent whole-brain BOLD-fMRI quantified local and remote dose-dependent cerebral effects of the electrical stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evans et al., 2020</xref>). tACS effects on each participants’ cerebral connectivity were further qualified using dynamic causal modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston et al., 2003</xref>), informed by MR-tractography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral and cerebral effects of the approach-avoidance task used to manipulate control over emotional action tendencies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conceptual visualization of the approach-avoidance task.

(<bold>B</bold>) During the experiment, stimulation conditions were alternated between in-phase, anti-phase, and sham conditions in pseudo-random fashion. The 75 Hz stimulation over SMC was amplitude-modulated according to the 6 Hz stimulation over aPFC, either in-phase or anti-phase with the peaks of the 6 Hz aPFC stimulation. Sham consisted of an initial stimulation of 10 s, after which stimulation was terminated. (<bold>C</bold>) Concurrent tACS-fMRI quantified changes in BOLD signal evoked by the tACS intervention, across in-phase and anti-phase conditions, and independently from task performance.

(<bold>D</bold>) Participants with stronger inhibitory responses to theta-band stimulation over aPFC (manifested as decreased BOLD signal; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>) improved their control over emotional actions (decreased congruency effect) during aPFC-SMC in-phase tACS (in green) but not during aPFC-SMC anti-phase tACS (in red), reflected in the interaction between emotional control (congruent, incongruent), stimulations phase (in-phase, anti-phase) and tACS-dose (BOLD signal in aPFC during stimulation versus sham [panel C]); F(1,39) = 9.3, p=0.004, partial eta<sup>2</sup> = 0.19. Inset bar graphs illustrate group average parameter estimates of the congruency effects corrected for tACS-dose. The direction of the effect in the anti-phase condition tentatively suggests that stronger entrainment to the theta-band stimulation (decreased BOLD) increases congruency effects, as would be expected when aPFC-SMC communication is disrupted.

Overriding these <italic>affect-congruent</italic> action-tendencies and instead generating <italic>affect-incongruent</italic> actions (approach-angry and avoid-happy) requires control, which is implemented through the aPFC, parietal/SMC, and amygdala/hippocampal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bramson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volman et al., 2011a</xref>). Accordingly, in the sham condition of this study, participants’ error rates and aPFC BOLD activity increased when incongruent approach-avoidance responses are compared to affect-congruent responses, reproducing previous effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bramson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volman et al., 2011a</xref>) – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>.</p><p>We quantified the magnitude of the physiological effects of tACS on the underlying neural tissue through concurrent tACS-fMRI. We used BOLD effects of theta-band tACS stimulation over aPFC (in-phase + anti-phase stimulation epochs versus sham; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), as a dose-dependent metric of tACS effects (tACS-dose; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evans et al., 2020</xref>), independent of task performance. In line with our expectations, higher tACS-dose on aPFC increased the emotion-control enhancement induced by in-phase stimulation (in-phase aPFC-theta/SMC-gamma tACS) [emotional control*phase condition*tACS-dose interaction: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>]. Interestingly, across participants, the local cortical (BOLD) effects of the inhibitory theta-band aPFC stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>) correlated positively with improved emotion-control (indexed by decreases in behavioral congruency-effects during the in-phase condition but not in the anti-phase condition –<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These dose- and phase-dependent results, predicted on the knowledge that emotional-action control requires synchronization between specific endogenous rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bramson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helfrich and Knight, 2016</xref>), indicate that in-phase aPFC-theta/SMC-gamma tACS increases participants’ control over their emotional action-tendencies.</p><p>The observed cognitive benefits of the tACS intervention could arise from direct modulation of aPFC-SMC connectivity, or be mediated by other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We arbitrated between those possibilities using two complementary approaches. First, we tested whether the amygdala mediates these effects. This region is a prime candidate as it is connected to both aPFC and SMC, and is strongly involved in emotional-action control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volman et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Etkin et al., 2015</xref>). We distinguished between a number of anatomically plausible circuit-level effects of the tACS intervention using dynamic causal modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston et al., 2003</xref>) on regional BOLD timeseries in the amygdala, aPFC and SMC, measured during performance of the approach-avoidance task. Model comparison supports a circuit where tACS modulates aPFC→SMC, aPFC→amygdala, and amygdala→SMC connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Crucially, the effect of stimulation on emotional-action control was driven by tACS modulation of a specific component of that circuit, the task-related aPFC→SMC connectivity (emotional-control*phase-condition*aPFC→SMC effective connectivity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> visualizes this behavioral- and connectivity-related difference in tACS effects, contrasting the behavioral effects evoked in participants with strong or weak in-phase tACS modulation of aPFC→SMC connectivity. Emotional control was enhanced in those participants with strong in-phase tACS modulation of aPFC-SMC connectivity: the congruency effect observed in the anti-phase and sham conditions disappeared during the in-phase condition. By contrast, emotional control remained unaffected in those participants without in-phase tACS modulation of aPFC→SMC connectivity: there were similar congruency effects across in-phase, anti-phase, and sham conditions. Second, we assessed whether inter-participant variance in the circuit-level effect of the tACS intervention can be understood in terms of inter-participant variance in structural connectivity between aPFC and SMC. In support of this notion, participants with higher fractional anisotropy (FA; a measure of white matter integrity) in the white matter beneath BA6 had stronger inhibitory coupling between aPFC and SMC during in-phase tACS (as compared to anti-phase tACS) (supplementary results).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Modulatory effects of dual-site phase-coupled tACS on emotional-action control depend on effective connectivity between aPFC and SMC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model selection compared models with and without a direct connection between aPFC→SMC (dashed arrow), and tACS modulations on different connections (gray dashed oval arrows). (<bold>B</bold>) Model selection indicates that tACS affects multiple connections in the network (top panels; supplementary materials), but only tACS-related changes in connectivity between aPFC→SMC predict behavioral effects of the stimulation (interaction between emotional control [congruent, incongruent], stimulations phase [in-phase, anti-phase] and p=0.019, np<sup>2</sup> = 0.13; lower panels). Those participants with stronger inhibitory influence of aPFC over SMC in the in-phase condition (lower left panel, n = 22) showed decreases in congruency effects in the in-phase condition but not in the anti-phase and sham condition.

Namely, the in-phase and anti-phase conditions used identical stimulation parameters apart from their phase difference, thereby creating the same peripheral effects.</p><p>We did not observe the anticipated anti-phase tACS induced increase of congruency effects caused by a desynchronization of aPFC and SMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>). However, there was increased activity in contralateral aPFC and PPC for anti-phase trials as compared to in-phase trials. Speculatively, this increased BOLD signal could reflect the engagement of the control network contralateral to the stimulated circuit, compensating disruptive effects of anti-phase stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sack et al., 2005</xref>). Future studies could focus on characterizing these potential compensatory effects. This study grounds a human gain-of-function intervention on the known hierarchical organization of the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>) and on phase-amplitude coupling as a mechanism for directional inter-regional neuronal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Canolty and Knight, 2010</xref>). These findings provide the first stepping stone toward the development of interventions aimed to help patients suffering from social-emotional disorders. For instance, individuals with social anxiety are often unable to overcome avoidance tendencies, hampering interventions aimed to extinguish fear through exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Craske and Stein, 2016</xref>). Synchronizing aPFC-SMC theta-gamma coupling might temporally alleviate this lack of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Voytek and Knight, 2015</xref>), allowing patients to benefit from exposure treatment. However, thus far it is unclear whether the findings reported here translate beyond healthy and highly educated male samples to more heterogeneous (healthy and patient) populations. Although the cognitive challenge provided by the AA task is rather mild, as is evidenced by the relatively low error rate (max. 20%), congruency effects elicited by the AA task do predict real-life emotional action control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaldewaij et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies could explore whether effects of in-phase stimulation hold for more challenging emotional control situations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sack et al., 2005</xref>), extend to more heterogeneous populations, and can generate long-lasting effects through exposure treatment. Generally, the findings of this study pave the way for implementing physiologically-grounded non-invasive interventions aimed at reducing neural noise in cerebral circuits where communication relies on long-range phase-amplitude coupling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-four male students of the Radboud University Nijmegen participated in this experiment after giving informed consent for participation and publication of anonymized data.

Stimulation was applied on-line during task performance in blocks of approximately 60 s (i.e. the length of a stimulus block; 12 trials), and consisted of electrical fields that changed polarity between the inner- and outer rings in theta-band (6 Hz) frequency over the aPFC and gamma-band (75 Hz), tapered with a 6 Hz sine wave over SMC. Gamma-band power was phase locked to peaks (in-phase) or troughs (anti-phase) of the theta-band signal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.

Whereas previous studies have shown long lasting aftereffects of tACS, ranging up to 70 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kasten et al., 2016</xref>), we considered it unlikely that these would systematically bias the current results based on two arguments. First, reports showing strong aftereffects often implemented relatively long periods of continuous stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseichuk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kasten et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruhnau et al., 2016</xref>) necessary for the quantification of neural/behavioral stimulation effects. Short stimulation protocols comparable to the current study do not report aftereffects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strüber et al., 2015</xref>). tACS aftereffects would, by definition, influence neural activity in the sham epochs systematically succeeding each stimulation epoch. Yet, we observe strong differences in BOLD signal when comparing stimulation and sham epochs under the prefrontal electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Second, tACS aftereffects are thought to depend on synaptic plasticity rather than entrainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vossen et al., 2015</xref>). Possible offline plasticity aftereffects would build up across several minutes, that is, across stimulation periods with different phase relations, thus orthogonally to our experimental phase-based manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vossen et al., 2015</xref>). Aftereffects of entrainment are unlikely because entrainment is thought to fade out after several cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strüber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vossen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Halbleib et al., 2012</xref>).

The first-level model consisted of 12 task regressors: Approach angry, approach happy, avoid angry, and avoid happy trials were modelled separately for each stimulation condition (in-phase, anti-phase and sham). In each regressor, each event covered the time interval from presentation of a face until the corresponding onset of the joystick movement. Estimated head translations/rotations during scanning (six regressors), temporal derivatives of those translations/rotations (six regressors), and MR-signals in white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (two regressors) were included to the GLM as nuisance covariates. We considered the following comparisons. Emotional control effects were estimated by comparing incongruent trials (approach angry and avoid happy) to congruent trials across the three stimulation conditions (total congruency effect), as well as separately for each stimulation condition (in-phase, out-of-phase, and sham congruency effects). Overall stimulation effects were estimated by comparing in-phase and anti-phase stimulation conditions to the sham condition, aggregated across congruent and incongruent conditions. We reasoned that this contrast would combine potential entrainment and compensatory mechanisms and thereby result in an unbiased estimate reflecting the extent to which the underlying neural tissue was perturbed by the stimulation; yielding a ‘tACS-dose’ measure. Phase-dependent stimulation effects were estimated by comparing in-phase stimulation to anti-phase stimulation, across congruent and incongruent conditions.

We differentiated these possibilities by separating all models into model families for each dimension, allowing inferences per dimension while averaging over all other parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Penny et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>After model comparison, we extracted connectivity estimates that were altered by tACS from the winning model and used those parameters to predict tACS effects on behaviour. The estimated changes in connectivity due to tACS are estimated independently of the behavioral effects of tACS, and were used to test for an interaction between emotional control (congruent, incongruent), stimulations phase (in-phase, anti-phase) and effective connectivity (DCM.B matrix) using RM-ANOVA and Bayesian mixed effects models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>DWI analyses</title><p>All analyses of diffusion data were performed in FSL’s FDT 3.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk">https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk</ext-link>). We used TOPUP to estimate susceptibility artifacts using additional b = 0 volumes with reverse-phase coding direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2003</xref>). Next, EDDY correction was used (using the fieldmap estimated by TOPUP) to correct distortions caused by eddy currents and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016</xref>). We used BedpostX to fit a crossing fiber model with three fiber directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>). Connections between aPFC and BA6 were reconstructed using <italic>probtrackx2</italic>. Seed mask was the lateral frontal pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neubert et al., 2014</xref>), which is a mask that contains voxels bordering white matter. Target mask was area BA6 contained within the Juelich atlas in FSL. This probabilistic mask was thresholded to contain only voxels that were at least 50% likely to be in BA6. Tractography was run twice with the standard settings recommended in probtrackX and an exclusion mask in the midline. Estimated connection strengths were normalized to unit length within participants. We averaged all connections over participants and thresholded this volume at 5 to create a mask of likely pathways linking FPl (within aPFC) and BA6. In the second step, we constrained the tractography to either only include connections via the thalamus, or only via medial and lateral pathways through the prefrontal cortex.</p><p>Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith et al., 2006</xref>) was used to assess whether the white matter integrity in the voxels in this connection mask explained part of the variance in response to tACS. <italic>TBSS</italic> was run using the default settings provided by FSL. In short, FA images were eroded and nonlinearly registered to the standard space. Afterward, we derived a mean skeleton based on all participants and thresholded the skeletonized FA values at 2. We then used <italic>randomize</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Winkler et al., 2014</xref>) with threshold-free cluster enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith and Nichols, 2009</xref>) to make inferences on the correlation between FA integrity and DCM effective connectivity estimates (in-phase versus anti-phase). To reduce the search space, the comparison was constrained to voxels that were part of the mask linking FPl to BA6 with and without the constrained connectivity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Freek Nieuwhof and Uriel Plones for their help in setting up the tACS-fMRI setup and Amy Abelmann for her assistance in data collection.

Results</title><boxed-text><p>Participants performed a social-emotional approach-avoidance task in which they approached or avoided happy and angry faces using a joystick. Approaching angry- and avoiding happy faces is incongruent with automatic action tendencies to approach appetitive and avoid threatening stimuli, and requires control over these prepotent habitual action tendencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volman et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bramson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roelofs et al., 2009</xref>). fMRI was acquired during task performance whilst participants received on-line dual-site theta-gamma tACS over aPFC and SMC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A;B</xref>. Control over social-emotional action tendencies involves phase-amplitude coupling between prefrontal theta- and SMC gamma-band rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bramson et al., 2018</xref>), the phase organisation of which is best reflected by the in-phase condition. In-phase, anti-phase and sham conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), were alternated throughout the task, allowing comparison of on-line, within-subject effects of stimulation conditions.</p><sec id="s9"><title>Signal quality below the electrodes</title><p>There was a reduction in absolute signal in right aPFC below the frontal electrode as compared to the contralateral aPFC, t(40) = 5.5, p&lt;0.001. This consisted of an average reduction in signal intensity of 11% (SD 10%). However, there was no difference in temporal SNR in right aPFC as compared to left; t(40) = 0.2, p=0.7. These results are in line with earlier reports on noise induced by the presence of electrodes and stimulation equipment in the scanner bore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antal et al., 2014</xref>). Although the absolute MR signal is reduced due to the presence of the tACS electrode, there is no effect on the SNR of the underlying brain region, suggesting that condition differences can be estimated reliably. This is supported by the consistency between the results obtained in the congruency contrast across stimulation conditions, and the results obtained in earlier reports using the same paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volman et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bramson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roelofs et al., 2009</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Behavioral and neural costs of controlling social-emotional action tendencies</title><p>Across all conditions (stimulation and sham combined), reaction times were longer in the incongruent (M = 687 ms, SD = 141) than in the congruent condition (M = 637 ms, SD = 111), <italic>brms</italic> estimate <italic>B</italic> = 23.1 ms, credible interval (<italic>CI</italic>) [15 31]; paired t-test congruent versus incongruent <italic>t</italic>(40) = 5.9, p&lt;0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d (M1-M2/SD<sub>pooled</sub>)</italic> = 0.39 [.22 1].

These effects illustrate the behavioral cost of controlling automatic action tendencies.</p><p>Whole-brain cluster-corrected fMRI analyses show that controlling social-emotional action tendencies elicited stronger BOLD activity in bilateral prefrontal cortex: MNI [−18 54–16] and [40 42 32], extending into lateral frontal pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bramson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neubert et al., 2014</xref>); bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC) MNI: [38 -58 38] and [−56–44 46]; precuneus [6 -62 72], temporal cortex [−66–48 0]; and inferior frontal gyrus [60 20 4], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Activity in the parahippocampal gyrus [−24–40 −14], extending into hippocampus and amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex [0 66 2], and lateral occipital cortex [52 -74 -10] was stronger for congruent than for incongruent trials.

Whole-brain cluster-corrected analyses contrasting both stimulation conditions versus sham showed increased activity in several brain regions, most of which overlapped with task relevant regions: right prefrontal cortex [42 16 48], extending into FPl [22 60 0]; bilateral posterior parietal cortex [50 -58 50] and [−56–44 46], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>;D.

Dose dependent responses were calculated by extracting the differential BOLD signal under the prefrontal stimulated region (right aPFC, [22 60 0]) when comparing stimulation versus sham epochs. This BOLD effect provides a participant-by-participant index of aPFC response to the tACS intervention that is orthogonal to the in-phase versus anti-phase comparison.</p><p>Following the expectation preregistered at the Open Science Framework: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/m9bv7/?view_only=18ccdf99a8e84afaaebee393debbabe3">https://osf.io/m9bv7/?view_only=18ccdf99a8e84afaaebee393debbabe3</ext-link>), there was a three way interaction between emotional control, phase condition, and tACS-dose, both on the trial level; <italic>B = 0.1 CI [.007. 2]</italic>, and in aggregated error rates; RM-ANOVA, <italic>F(1,39)</italic> = 9.3, p=0.004, partial eta<sup>2</sup> = 0.19, indicating that participants performed differently in the two stimulation conditions as a function of the strength of the tACS influence. Post-hoc correlation analyses between BOLD change due to tACS and congruency effects showed that these effects are mainly driven by the in-phase condition: Spearman’s Rho = 0.32, p=0.04, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. This finding indicates that, in the in-phase condition, larger BOLD responses to the inhibitory theta-band rhythm corresponded to smaller behavioral congruency effects. In the anti-phase condition, the correlation between tACS-dose and behavioral congruency effects was not significant (Spearman’s Rho = −0.23, p=0.14). However, the sign of the correlation matches the preregistered expectations: increased entrainment during anti-phase stimulation (reflected in lower BOLD response during theta-band stimulation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>) would lead to larger congruency effects due to desynchronization between aPFC and SMC. Differences in BOLD signal between anti-phase and in-phase conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>) could reflect the engagement of the control network contralateral to the stimulated circuit. This engagement might reflect compensatory mechanisms counteracting disruptive effects of anti-phase stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Graaf and Sack, 2018</xref>), thereby obscuring the relationship between tACS-dose and increases in behavioral congruency. However, the BOLD signal difference between anti-phase and in-phase conditions extracted from aPFC and PPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>) did not correlate with anti-phase behavioral congruency effects (both r(39) &lt;.14, p&gt;0.3).

These results suggest that theta-gamma phase-coupled tACS increases control over social-emotional behaviour in participants that respond to stimulation.

In prior work (Bramson et al., 2018), the authors hypothesized that theta-gamma coupling between the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) and sensorimotor cortex (SMC) subserves emotion-action control. Here, they set out to manipulate this mechanism to show its causal involvement. The authors use the approach-avoidance task separating emotionally-congruent and incongruent action tendencies while applying dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and monitoring neural activity using fMRI. Importantly, stimulation is set to either facilitate aPFC-SMC theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (in-phase) or disrupt it (anti-phase). Results reveal a dose-dependent effect of in-phase tACS on action control, suggesting that aPFC-SMC coupling does indeed play a critical role in action selection.</p><p>The reviewers and I were enthusiastic about the report.…</p><p>• The study is compelling and innovative.

The three stimulation conditions – in-phase, anti-phase, and sham tACS – are applied within the same session, in a block-design manner. Typically, within-subjects studies separate stimulation sessions by 48 hours or more to avoid carryover effects (Heise et al., 2019; Mansouri et al., 2019; Amador de Lara et al., 2018; Alekseichuk et al., 2016).</p><p>• It has been shown that tACS can induce aftereffects (for review, Vosskuhl et al., 2018).</p><p>• If here the authors made a design decision to mix together different stimulation conditions within a session, this decision needs to be justified.

The absence of the effect of anti-phase tACS that was expected to be in the opposite direction to the effect of in-phase stimulation raises questions about the causal involvement of aPFC-SMC coupling in emotional-action control.</p><p>• It is clear from the results that strengthening aPFC-SMC coupling enhances control.</p><p>• However, if the disruption of such in-phase coupling by the anti-phase stimulation doesn't lead to the reduction in control it suggests that some other mechanisms might play a compensatory role. I recommend addressing this issue in the discussion of the results.</p><p>6) Discussion/Abstract. The authors emphasize the clinical implications, but this discussion should be qualified and softened.</p><p>• In this experiment, a substantial change in brain activity (as measured by BOLD) leads to a reliable, but relatively subtle behavioral change in a task that asks participants to override a mild response tendency. Indeed, according to Figure 1B, even subjects performing relatively poorly in the incongruent condition are still getting it right more than 80% of the time, suggesting that this condition presents no more than a mild challenge.</p><p>• Emotional control will inevitably be harder in a real world scenario in which individuals will certainly perceive there to be far more at stake – this will be doubly true for any clinical population.</p><p>• Thus, claims like &quot;Similar interventions could help patients suffering from emotional-social disorders&quot; and others should be softened. The authors present fascinating research that should be characterized more as a first step in developing gain-of-function therapeutics, instead of a treatment ready for, or even on the cusp of, application in the clinic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59600.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Despite their enthusiasm, we do have a few questions about the interpretation, and some suggestions for further strengthening the report.</p><p>1) Approach.

To reiterate the context, the study is focused on measuring behavioral and fMRI effects <italic>during</italic> the delivery of tACS. Since tACS can induce aftereffects 1-70 minutes post stimulation (e.g. Strüber et al., 2015; Vossen et al., 2015; Kasten et al., 2016; Vosskuhl et al., 2018), it is relevant to discuss whether those aftereffects contribute to the reported findings.</p><p>tACS aftereffects are thought to depend mostly on synaptic plasticity (Vossen et al., 2015), and they are not observed for very short periods of stimulation as used in the current study (Strüber et al., 2015). The current study combines short periods of stimulation (1 min) with washout periods of at least 30 seconds between successive stimulation blocks. Studies that report aftereffects of tACS (e.g. Neuling et al., 2013; Alekseichuk et al., 2016; Kasten et al., 2016) use relatively long periods of continuous stimulation (at least &gt; 10 minutes, reviewed in Strüber et al., 2015). The empirical evidence collected during this experiment confirms that plasticity induced aftereffects, if present, are marginal. Namely, tACS aftereffects would influence neural activity in the sham epochs systematically succeeding each stimulation epoch. Yet, we observe strong differences in BOLD signal when comparing stimulation and sham epochs under the prefrontal electrodes (Figure 1C).</p><p>Importantly, the experiment was designed to avoid systematic aftereffect biases in the main finding of this study. The different conditions (in-phase, anti-phase, and sham) were rapidly alternated. Plasticity aftereffects would require several minutes to build up (Vossen et al., 2015), and that implies that potential aftereffects would stretch over both in-phase and anti-phase conditions. New analyses show that behavioral congruency effects in the sham condition do not differ for trials preceded by in-phase as compared to anti-phase stimulation; t(40) = 0.4, p = 0.7, arguing against systematic offline influence of tACS on behavioral congruency. Aftereffects due to rhythmic entrainment are also unlikely. Entrainment is thought to fade out after a few cycles following the entraining stimulation (Halbleib et al., 2012; Strüber et al., 2015; Vossen et al., 2015), i.e. over a time-frame much shorter than the wash-out epochs interposed between the different stimulation conditions.</p><p>We have incorporated these considerations in the manuscript:</p><p>“tACS conditions (in-phase; anti-phase; sham) were applied within the same session with stimulation condition alternating between stimulus blocks (each lasting approximately 60 seconds; 12 trials), interleaved with periods of no stimulation (instructions between blocks; at least 30 seconds). Whereas previous studies have shown long lasting aftereffects of tACS, ranging up to 70 minutes (Kasten et al., 2016), we considered it unlikely that these would systematically bias the current results based on two arguments. […] Post-hoc analysis indeed revealed that behavioral congruency effects in the sham condition do not differ for trials preceded by in-phase as compared to anti-phase stimulation; t(40) = 0.4, p = 0.7, arguing against systematic offline influence of tACS on behavioral congruency. ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Approach/Results. Authors should provide evidence that the key results are not contaminated by potential carry-over effects from preceding blocks</p></disp-quote><p>We consider it unlikely that the results we report are contaminated by carry-over effects for several reasons (see response to comment #1), most notably that we do not find any significant differences in sham periods following either in phase or anti phase stimulation. Additionally, stimulation conditions were varied pseudo-randomly between stimulus blocks, further averaging out any potential systematic carry-over effects.</p><p>We have added a control analysis, testing whether behavioral congruency effects for the sham session depend on the condition of the preceding stimulus block, and further clarified the pseudo-randomised structure of the stimulation protocol.</p><p>“Post-hoc analysis indeed revealed that behavioral congruency effects in the sham condition do not differ for trials preceded by in-phase as compared to anti-phase stimulation; t(40) = 0.4, p = 0.7, arguing against systematic offline influence of tACS on behavioral congruency.”</p><p>“Stimulation conditions were alternated between blocks in pseudo-random fashion with the constraint that stimulation condition could never be repeated for two consecutive blocks.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results. Figure 2D raises the possibility that the anti-phase condition produces a correlation between aPFC BOLD and the congruency effect that is roughly equal and opposite of what is observed in the in-phase condition (as opposed to producing no correlation, for instance). If this is a reasonable interpretation, then this potentially intriguing effect should be noted in the Results and noted in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This interpretation matches our a-priori formulated hypothesis on the effect of anti-phase stimulation (see also main point 5). That hypothesis is grounded on the observation that stronger power in the theta-band leads to stronger neuronal inhibition and stronger negative correlation with BOLD (Scheeringa et al., 2011). Accordingly, in the anti-phase condition, stronger theta-entrainment in aPFC (indexed by reduced tACS-related BOLD) would lead to stronger desynchronization between aPFC and SMC, and thus larger congruency effects. As indicated by the reviewers, the data in Figure 2D are consistent with this hypothesis. However, the correlation between tACS-dose in aPFC and behavioural congruency effects was significant in the in-phase condition (Spearman’s Rho = 0.32, p = 0.04) but not in the anti-phase condition (Spearman’s Rho = –0.23, p = 0.14). Figure 2—figure supplement 1E suggests that the weaker effects of anti-phase tACS on behavior might be due to enhanced activity in localized regions contralateral to the prefrontal stimulation. Namely, anti-phase stimulation (as compared to in-phase) enhanced BOLD responses in anatomically connected nodes of the emotional control circuit (aPFC, PPC (Mars et al., 2011; Koch et al., 2018)). Speculatively, this enhanced BOLD response might be interpreted as the emotional control circuit partially compensating for the aPFC-SMC desynchronization caused by the anti-phase stimulation. This compensation might lead to a weaker tACS-behavior relation in the anti-phase condition. However, post-hoc exploration did not reveal a straightforward relationship between local effects (in left aPFC, PPC) and behavioral congruency in the anti-phase condition. A dedicated study might test whether network-level effects explain the behavioral consequences of those enhanced responses in the emotional control circuit following anti-phase stimulation. We have added these considerations and added post-hoc analyses to the manuscript:</p><p>“We did not observe the anticipated anti-phase tACS induced increase of congruency effects caused by a desynchronization of aPFC and SMC (Polanía et al., 2015). […] Future studies could focus on characterizing these potential compensatory effects.”</p><p>“In the anti-phase condition, the correlation between tACS-dose and behavioural congruency effects was not significant (Spearman’s Rho = –0.23, <italic>p</italic> = 0.14). […] However, the BOLD signal difference between anti-phase and in-phase conditions extracted from aPFC and PPC (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E) did not correlate with anti-phase behavioural congruency effects (both r(39) &lt; 0.14 , p &gt; 0.3)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Results.

We have clarified this:</p><p>“Stimulation was applied on-line during task performance in blocks of approximately 60 seconds (i.e. the length of a stimulus block; 12 trials), and consisted of electrical fields that changed polarity between the inner- and outer rings in theta-band (6 Hz) frequency over the aPFC and gamma-band (75 Hz), tapered with a 6 Hz sine wave over SMC”</p><p>Valence of tACS stimulation: It is not clear to us what the reviewers mean by “valence” of the tACS stimulation. Assuming the issue is about the phase relation between the two stimulation sites, then this information is provided in Figure 2A, B and in the subsection “tACS stimulation parameters”.</p><p>BOLD effects: We considered two independent BOLD effects. First, we analysed BOLD signals to verify that emotional congruency demands evoked activity in brain locations (notably aPFC) and with effect sizes matching previous reports (Figure 1). Second, we used BOLD signal analyses to quantify the effect of tACS on aPFC. To provide an unbiased estimate of how strongly aPFC is perturbed by stimulation, we computed a tACS-dose estimate, i.e. the degree to which aPFC BOLD response differs between stimulation (both in-phase and anti-phase conditions combined) and sham. This tACS-dose estimate is a combination of potential entrainment and compensatory effects acting on the right aPFC under the electrodes. We have tried to clarify this reasoning,</p><p>“Overall stimulation effects were estimated by comparing in-phase and anti-phase stimulation conditions to the sham condition, aggregated across congruent and incongruent conditions. We reasoned that this contrast would combine potential entrainment and compensatory mechanisms and thereby result in an unbiased estimate reflecting the extent to which the underlying neural tissue was perturbed by the stimulation; yielding a “tACS-dose” measure.”</p><p>Changes in congruency effect: The tACS-related changes in behavioural congruency effects are reported in Figures 2 and 3. The behavioral congruency effect was illustrated in Figure 1, as the difference in percentage correct between the incongruent and congruent conditions. Following the reviewers’ comments, we now introduce the congruency effect (Figure 1B) as error rate, i.e. in a manner consistent with its use in Figures 2, 3.</p><p>The scatter plot and regression line in Figure 2D do not clearly communicate the difference between in-phase and anti-phase tACS with complementary tACS dose: The interpretation of the relationship between behavioral congruency in each condition, and the BOLD response depends on the negative relationship between theta-band activity and BOLD effects (Scheeringa et al., 2011). Accordingly, reduced BOLD during theta-band stimulation is taken as an indication of stronger entrainment of the endogenous theta-band activity. This interpretational framework yields contrasting predictions for the two in-phase and anti-phase conditions. In the in-phase condition, increased aPFC theta-band entrainment would lead to reduced congruency effects, due to increased phase-amplitude coupling between aPFC and SMC. This situation would result in a positive correlation between tACS dose and behavioral congruency effects. In the anti-phase condition, increased entrainment would bias aPFC theta phase away from SMC dynamics. This situation would lead to larger congruency effects, i.e. a negative correlation between tACS dose and behavior. This is the pattern we observe (although not significantly for the anti-phase condition).</p><p>We could not find a better way to graphically present individual datapoints as well as summary statistics than Figure 2D. However, we have clarified the figure legend describing panel 2D as follows:</p><p>“D) Participants with stronger inhibitory responses to theta-band stimulation over aPFC (manifested as decreased BOLD signal; Scheeringa et al., 2011) improved their control over emotional actions (decreased congruency effect) during aPFC-SMC in-phase tACS (in green), but not during aPFC-SMC anti-phase tACS (in red), reflected in the interaction between Emotional Control (congruent, incongruent), Stimulations Phase (in-phase, anti-phase) and tACS-Dose (BOLD signal in aPFC during stimulation vs. sham (panel C)); F(1,39) = 9.3, p = 0.004, partial eta<sup>2</sup> = 0.19. […] The direction of the effect in the anti-phase condition tentatively suggests that stronger entrainment to the theta-band stimulation (decreased BOLD) increases congruency effects, as would be expected when aPFC-SMC communication is disrupted.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discussion.

Authors need to provide some discussion of their unsupported predictions.</p><p>• In their preregistered hypothesis (Open Science Framework), the authors predict an increase of congruency effect in the anti-phase stimulation condition (subsection “Behavioural analyses”, last paragraph), however, this expectation was not confirmed by the results (subsection “Dose dependent effects of tACS on social-emotional control”, second paragraph). The absence of the effect of anti-phase tACS that was expected to be in the opposite direction to the effect of in-phase stimulation raises questions about the causal involvement of aPFC-SMC coupling in emotional-action control.</p><p>• It is clear from the results that strengthening aPFC-SMC coupling enhances control.</p><p>• However, if the disruption of such in-phase coupling by the anti-phase stimulation doesn't lead to the reduction in control it suggests that some other mechanisms might play a compensatory role. I recommend addressing this issue in the discussion of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue largely overlaps with point #3, and we refer the reviewers to the arguments put forward there to interpret the unsupported prediction of the effect of anti-phase tACS.</p><p>We have amended the Discussion section to more clearly emphasize these points (see also point #3):</p><p>“We did not observe the anticipated anti-phase tACS induced increase of congruency effects caused by a desynchronization of aPFC and SMC (Polanía et al., 2015). […] Future studies could focus on characterizing these potential compensatory effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discussion/Abstract. The authors emphasize the clinical implications, but this discussion should be qualified and softened.</p><p>• In this experiment, a substantial change in brain activity (as measured by BOLD) leads to a reliable, but relatively subtle behavioral change in a task that asks participants to override a mild response tendency. Indeed, according to Figure 1B, even subjects performing relatively poorly in the incongruent condition are still getting it right more than 80% of the time, suggesting that this condition presents no more than a mild challenge.</p><p>• Emotional control will inevitably be harder in a real world scenario in which individuals will certainly perceive there to be far more at stake – this will be doubly true for any clinical population.</p><p>• Thus, claims like &quot;Similar interventions could help patients suffering from emotional-social disorders&quot; and others should be softened. The authors present fascinating research that should be characterized more as a first step in developing gain-of-function therapeutics, instead of a treatment ready for, or even on the cusp of, application in the clinic.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our claims were a bit strong and the manipulation needs further study before clinical applications are possible. We have amended the Discussion section accordingly:</p><p>“These findings provide a first stepping stone towards the development of interventions aimed to help patients suffering from social-emotional disorders. […] Future studies could explore whether effects of in-phase stimulation hold for more challenging emotional control situations (e.g. Kaldewaij et al., 2019) and generate long-lasting effects through exposure treatment.”</p><p>References:</p><p>Mars RB, Jbabdi S, Sallet J, O’Reilly JX, Croxson PL, Olivier E, Noonan MP, Bergmann C, Mitchell AS, Baxter MG (2011) Diffusion-weighted imaging tractography-based parcellation of the human parietal cortex and comparison with human and macaque resting-state functional connectivity.
