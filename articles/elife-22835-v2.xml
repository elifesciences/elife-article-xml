microbial interactions. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of metabolic co-regulation in which an intermediate in one pathway is converted into signals that activate a second pathway. Our study focused on the co-regulation of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and pyoluteorin, two antimicrobial metabolites produced by the soil bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic>. We show that an intermediate in DAPG biosynthesis, phloroglucinol, is transformed by a halogenase encoded in the pyoluteorin gene cluster into mono- and di-chlorinated phloroglucinols. The chlorinated phloroglucinols function as intra- and inter-cellular signals that induce the expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes, pyoluteorin production, and pyoluteorin-mediated inhibition of the plant-pathogenic bacterium <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>. This metabolic co-regulation provides a strategy for <italic>P. protegens</italic> to optimize the deployment of secondary metabolites with distinct roles in cooperative and competitive microbial interactions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22835.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22835.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22835.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria live almost everywhere on Earth and often compete with one another for limited resources, like space or nutrients. Certain bacteria produce molecules that are toxic to other microorganisms to give themselves a competitive advantage. These toxic molecules are more commonly referred as antibiotics, and are perhaps best known for their importance in medicine. Yet, antibiotics benefit the bacteria that produce them in other ways too. Some bacteria, for example, use antibiotics as chemical signals to communicate with one another and coordinate their activities.</p><p>Some bacteria produce many antibiotics with different toxic and signaling activities. These bacteria often coordinate the production of different antibiotics such that the production of one antibiotic shuts down the production of another. This kind of coordination would allow the bacterium to focus its energy on producing only the antibiotic that gives it a competitive advantage at that time. Yet, in most cases, it was not known how the bacterial cell coordinates the production of two different antibiotics.</p><p><italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> is a species of bacteria that lives in soil, and produces many antibiotics that are toxic to other bacteria or fungi. The antibiotics are made via distinct pathways of chemical reactions that are catalyzed by different enzymes. However, the production of two antibiotics, called 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol and pyoluteorin, is tightly coordinated in some strains of <italic>P. protegens</italic>. Now, Yan et al. have discovered how <italic>P. protegens</italic> coordinates the production of these two antibiotics. It turns out that the bacterium produces an enzyme that adds chlorine atoms onto one of the intermediate building blocks used to make 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. These “chlorinated derivatives” then activate the genes required to make the second antibiotic, pyoluteorin. The derivatives also signal to other <italic>P. protegens</italic> cells and trigger them to produce pyoluteorin too. Lastly, Yan et al. confirmed that pyoluteorin could inhibit the growth of another species of bacteria called <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>.</p><p>These new findings highlight an important role played by chemicals that might have previously been considered as merely stepping stones in other biochemical reactions. An important challenge for the future will be to evaluate if other microbes use chemical intermediates in similar ways. Understanding the natural role of more antibiotics and their intermediates should help us to more wisely use existing antibiotics, and might eventually lead to new treatments for infections in humans and other animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22835.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22835.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic></kwd><kwd>secondary metabolite</kwd><kwd>metabolic co-regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRI 2011-67019-30192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Jeff H</given-names></name><name><surname>Loper</surname><given-names>Joyce E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009612</institution-id><institution>Oregon State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research startup funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philmus</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The production of two secondary metabolites is co-regulated in a bacterium via an intermediate in one pathway that is converted into signals to activate the second pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many microorganisms produce multiple secondary metabolites with diverse chemical properties and ecological functions that contribute to the fitness of the producing organism in natural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haas and Keel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Brien and Wright 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Traxler and Kolter, 2015</xref>). The biosynthesis of different secondary metabolites by a microorganism is often coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosello et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsunematsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hidalgo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vingadassalon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cano-Prieto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2016</xref>). Co-regulation of different secondary metabolites is thought to be selected during microbial evolution because it confers competitive advantages to the producing organism in microbial interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Challis and Hopwood, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Among the secondary metabolites, antibiotics are particularly intriguing because of their roles in both cooperative and competitive interactions among microorganisms in natural habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raaijmakers and Mazzola, 2012</xref>). This study focuses on 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and pyoluteorin, two broad-spectrum antibiotics with toxicity against fungi, bacteria, oomycetes and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohmori et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keel et al., 1992</xref>). Certain strains of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. produce DAPG but not pyoluteorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loper et al., 2012</xref>) and some strains of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> produce pyoluteorin but not DAPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohmori et al., 1978</xref>). To date, only a subset of strains of the species <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> are known to produce both compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loper et al., 2012</xref>). Among these DAPG- and pyoluteorin-producing strains is the soil bacterium <italic>P. protegens</italic> Pf-5. In the genome of Pf-5, genes for DAPG and pyoluteorin biosynthesis are present in two different gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>) separated by 3.7-megabases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paulsen et al., 2005</xref>). The biosynthetic substrates and intermediates of the two pathways are distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). DAPG biosynthesis begins with synthesis of phloroglucinol (PG) from three molecules of malonyl-CoA by the type III polyketide synthase PhlD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achkar et al., 2005</xref>). PG is then acetylated through the action of PhlABC to form DAPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bangera and Thomashow, 1999</xref>). Pyoluteorin biosynthesis begins with activation of L-proline by the L-prolyl-AMP ligase PltF, and attachment to the peptidyl-carrier protein PltL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>). The Pro-<italic>S</italic>-PltL intermediate is oxidized by PltE and chlorinated by PltA to yield 4,5-dichloropyrrolyl-<italic>S</italic>-PltL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorrestein et al., 2005</xref>). The dichloropyrrole is extended by the type I polyketide synthase PltBC followed by release and formation of the resorcinol, presumably catalyzed by PltG to yield pyoluteorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nowak-Thompson et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">1999</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22835.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biosynthetic gene clusters for 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) (<bold>A</bold>), and pyoluteorin (<bold>C</bold>), the proposed biosynthetic pathways of DAPG (<bold>B</bold>) and pyoluteorin (<bold>D</bold>) of <italic>P. protegens</italic> Pf-5, and the GFP reporter constructs (<bold>E, F, G</bold>) used in this work.</title><p>Arrows represent gene location and orientation in the biosynthetic gene clusters, and are colored according to their functions.

Mutations in pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes result in loss of pyoluteorin production along with overproduction of DAPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodhagen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quecine et al., 2016</xref>), and addition of pyoluteorin to bacterial cultures represses the expression of certain DAPG biosynthetic genes and the production of DAPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schnider-Keel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baehler et al., 2005</xref>). Conversely, PG, an intermediate in DAPG biosynthesis, has a concentration-dependent influence on expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes and production of pyoluteorin: nanomolar concentrations of PG are required for pyoluteorin production but micromolar concentrations of PG repress pyoluteorin production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kidarsa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clifford et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The essential role of PG in pyoluteorin production became evident when we discovered that a <italic>phlD</italic> mutant, which lacks the type III polyketide synthase PhlD responsible for PG biosynthesis, produces neither pyoluteorin nor DAPG. The <italic>phlD</italic> mutant can be complemented for pyoluteorin production by addition of nanomolar concentrations of PG to the culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kidarsa et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, addition of nanomolar concentrations of PG induces expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clifford et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that the influence of PG on pyoluteorin production is mediated through gene regulation. Pyoluteorin itself also induces expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodhagen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>). The pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes are expressed under the positive control of PltR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodhagen et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), a transcriptional regulator belonging to the LysR family. Both PG and pyoluteorin are known to induce PltR-mediated transcription of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes, but the relative importance of the two small molecules in inducing gene expression has not been evaluated.</p><p>The metabolic co-regulation between DAPG and PLT biosynthetic pathways differs from known examples of metabolic co-regulation between secondary metabolic pathways, which can be classified into four types based on the underlying mechanisms. The first type of co-regulation involves one or more intermediates that are shared by different biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vingadassalon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cano-Prieto et al., 2015</xref>). The second type results when a single enzyme is shared by different pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lazos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsunematsu et al., 2013</xref>). The third type of co-regulation is mediated through functionally redundant enzymes present in different pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lautru et al., 2007</xref>). The fourth type occurs when the biosynthetic genes for two pathways are controlled by the same ‘pathway-specific’ regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pérez-Llarena et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann et al., 2010</xref>). Overall these mechanisms of metabolic co-regulation involve a shared biosynthetic intermediate, enzymatic activity, or regulator, but none of these features is shared by the DAPG and pyoluteorin pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe a mechanism of metabolic co-regulation that is distinct from all described previously. Our results show that PG, an intermediate in DAPG biosynthesis, is transformed by a halogenase encoded in the pyoluteorin gene cluster into chlorinated derivatives that function as cell-cell communication signals inducing expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes. Our work reveals a new mechanism of co-regulation between two secondary metabolic pathways, which is mediated by an intermediate in one pathway that is converted into signals that activate the second pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PG is required for PltR-mediated activation of <italic>pltL</italic> expression</title><p>To determine the differences between the regulatory roles of PG and pyoluteorin in the production of pyoluteorin, we evaluated the effects of both metabolites on expression of the pyoluteorin biosynthetic gene <italic>pltL</italic> using pL-gfp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), a reporter construct containing a transcriptional fusion of the promoter of <italic>pltL</italic> to a promoterless <italic>gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). GFP expressed from pL-gfp was monitored in a Δ<italic>pltA</italic>Δ<italic>phlD</italic> double mutant grown in a medium amended with each of the two metabolites alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the non-amended medium, and relative to wild-type Pf-5, GFP expression was significantly lower in the Δ<italic>pltA</italic>Δ<italic>phlD</italic> mutant (<italic>p</italic>=2.76E-4), indicating only background expression of <italic>pltL</italic>. This result was expected because of the deletion of <italic>pltA</italic> and <italic>phlD</italic>, which encode enzymes for biosynthesis of pyoluteorin and PG, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); both pyoluteorin and PG are known to induce expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodhagen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clifford et al., 2016</xref>). In the medium amended with 10 nM PG, GFP expression of the Δ<italic>pltA</italic>Δ<italic>phlD</italic> mutant increased nearly tenfold relative to expression levels in non-amended medium, indicating induction of <italic>pltL</italic>. In contrast, addition of 100 nM pyoluteorin failed to alter GFP expression by the Δ<italic>pltA</italic>Δ<italic>phlD</italic> mutant. However, when both pyoluteorin and PG were added, the GFP expression was significantly higher than under treatment with PG alone (<italic>p</italic>=1.44E-4). Therefore, pyoluteorin was not required for <italic>pltL</italic> expression but further induced <italic>pltL</italic> expression in the presence of PG. As expected based on the necessity of PltR for expression of the pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodhagen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>pltR</italic> was required for expression of <italic>pltL</italic> and the presence of PG could not restore <italic>pltL</italic> expression in a Δ<italic>pltA</italic>Δ<italic>phlD</italic>Δ<italic>pltR</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Although PG was sufficient to induce <italic>pltL</italic> expression in Pf-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), PG failed to induce GFP expression from pRL-gfp in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and is therefore not likely to function as a signal directly. One possible explanation for these results is that Pf-5 processes PG to another compound, which then directly induces pyoluteorin gene expression. To test this possibility, we amended SBW25 carrying pRL-gfp with culture supernatants from Pf-5 or the Δ<italic>phlD</italic> mutant and measured <italic>pltL</italic> expression.

Instead, PG is an intermediate in DAPG biosynthesis and a precursor for formation of signaling molecules that activate expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22835.032</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of metabolic co-regulation between DAPG and pyoluteorin biosynthetic pathways in <italic>P. protegens</italic>.</title><p>Phloroglucinol (PG) is synthesized by the type III polyketide synthase PhlD in the DAPG biosynthetic pathway, and processed into PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> by the halogenase PltM encoded in the pyoluteorin gene cluster.

DAPG and pyoluteorin are known to function as intra- and inter-cellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodhagen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maurhofer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Powers et al., 2015</xref>). Here we found that the chlorinated phloroglucinols PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> function as intra- and inter-cellular signaling compounds. When added to the culture medium, these compounds can induce expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes in <italic>P. protegens</italic> Pf-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). By co-culturing mutants of Pf-5 with deficiencies in <italic>phlD</italic> and <italic>pltM</italic>, we also showed that PG, PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> could be released from the producing cells and used by neighboring cells to induce the production of pyoluteorin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These results support and extend those from a previous report showing that PG can serve as an intra- and inter-cellular chemical messenger, influencing the expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes as well as hundreds of other genes with diverse functions in <italic>P. protegens</italic> Pf-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clifford et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it appears that the final products DAPG and pyoluteorin, the biosynthetic intermediate PG, and its derivatives PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> all serve as signals influencing gene expression, the production of antibiotics, and the antimicrobial activity of <italic>P. protegens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The signaling roles of small molecules released as intermediates, derivatives, or end products of antibiotic biosynthesis pathways are likely to be more consequential than previously recognized.</p><p>Activation of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes requires PltR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodhagen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the pyoluteorin pathway-specific positive regulator belonging to the LysR family. LysR regulators typically require a signal for activity, and the signal is commonly an intermediate or product of the regulated gene cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maddocks and Oyston, 2008</xref>). Pyoluteorin has been proposed to be the signal of PltR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>). However, our data indicate that the signaling effect of pyoluteorin relies on the presence of PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which is converted to PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite our exhaustive attempts, we were not able to purify the PltR protein to evaluate whether or not PG-Cl or PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> binds to PltR in vitro (data not shown). Nevertheless, based on our data that PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> are required for induction of the pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and <italic>pltR</italic> is required for the signaling action of PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> in both <italic>P. protegens</italic> Pf-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), we speculate that that PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub>, rather than pyoluteorin, are signals required for the activity of PltR.</p><p>An interesting question is why DAPG and pyoluteorin production are so intricately enmeshed? <italic>P. protegens</italic> can occupy different environments, including the soil, plant surfaces, and insects, and interact with different organisms including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodhagen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jousset et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kidarsa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henkels et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loper et al., 2016</xref>). Both DAPG and pyoluteorin contribute to the antagonism of <italic>P. protegens</italic> against a range of bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohmori et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keel et al., 1992</xref>) and both facilitate the bacterium’s establishment in fungal tissues, such as basidiocarps of the button mushroom <italic>Agaricus</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henkels et al., 2014</xref>). However, the sensitivity of a specific organism to these two antibiotics can be different. For example, pyoluteorin is twenty times more toxic than DAPG to the growth of <italic>E. amylovora</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, these two compounds also have distinct ecological roles. For example, DAPG but not pyoluteorin exhibits toxicity to the amoeba <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jousset and Bonkowski, 2010</xref>). Therefore, natural situations may exist in which it could be more advantageous to produce one compound versus the other. Additionally, antibiotic biosynthesis is associated with metabolic costs. The coordinated production of pyoluteorin and DAPG may be a mechanism for the bacterium to balance metabolic cost against the benefits conferred by production of the two antibiotics. In short, metabolic co-regulation may enable bacteria to activate the production of one antibiotic to combat certain competitors or predators or to occupy specific habitats, while reducing the metabolic burden on the cell by repressing the production of a second compound.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated that PG, an intermediate in the DAPG biosynthetic pathway, is converted into PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub>, which serve as signals activating expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes. We also showed that PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> can be released from and sensed by bacteria to regulate antibiosis against a bacterial pathogen, indicating that these metabolites function as cell-cell communication signals. Many questions remain related to the co-regulation of the DAPG and pyoluteorin biosynthesis pathways. Membrane receptors recognizing the various signaling compounds (DAPG, pyoluteorin, PG, PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub>) have not been identified, but are likely needed to facilitate uptake of these molecules across the bacterial membrane. PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> are now known to be responsible for the previously described activation of the pyoluteorin biosynthesis by nanomolar concentrations of PG, but these compounds do not appear to mediate the repression of pyoluteorin production by higher (micromolar) concentrations of PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kidarsa et al., 2011</xref>). The mechanism(s) involved in inhibition of pyoluteorin production by PG remain unknown. Here, we report a novel mechanism of co-regulation that is responsible for only one aspect of the complex and intricate co-regulation of two secondary metabolites in <italic>P. protegens</italic>. Our results highlight the diversity of mechanisms involved in metabolic co-regulation in bacteria and provide an unprecedented example of co-regulation between separate biosynthetic pathways in which the intermediate of one pathway functions as a precursor of the signal(s) activating the biosynthesis of a second pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, plasmids, primers, culture conditions and chemical compounds</title><p>The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.

Purified PltM and SsuE were dialyzed in Tris-NaCl-Glycerol buffer [20 mM Tris pH 7.4/200 mM NaCl/10% (vol/vol) glycerol]. The protein concentrations were determined using a <italic>DC</italic> Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and proteins were stored at −80°C.</p><p>To test the catalytic activity of PltM, 20 μl of 56 µM PltM, 50 μl of 21 µM SsuE, 4 μl of 10 mM FAD, 10 μl of 100 mM NADPH, and 10 μl of 10 mM PG were added to 106 μl of Tris-NaCl buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4/200 mM NaCl). Five additional reactions were also set up, with one of the five components replaced by an equivalent volume of the Tris-NaCl buffer in each reaction. The mixtures were incubated for 3 hr at 25°C and extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extracts were dried under vacuum at room temperature and dissolved in 200 μl methanol. A volume of 5 μl from each methanol solution was added to <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 containing the reporter plasmid pRL-gfp to determine the signaling activity of each reaction product. For LCMS analysis, the reactions were concentrated to dryness and dissolved in 100 μl methanol and 10 μl were analyzed as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of MAPG, DAPG, and pyoluteorin</title><p>Pf-5 and derivative strains were inoculated at a starting OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.01 in 5 ml NBGly and cultured for 24 hr. Four milliliters of the culture supernatant were extracted twice with ethyl acetate, then subsequently dried under vacuum, and suspended in methanol. The culture extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify production of MAPG, DAPG, and pyoluteorin as described below.</p><p>To quantify the production of MAPG, DAPG and pyoluteorin by Pf-5 and derivatives, HPLC analyses were accomplished using an Agilent 1100 HPLC instrument, which consisted of a quaternary pump, vacuum degasser, autosampler, column thermostat (set to 30°C), and diode array detector. Separation was achieved using a Luna C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min where line A was water + 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, and line B was acetonitrile + 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid with the following program. The column was pre-equilibrated in 90% A/10% B, and upon injection this composition was held for 2 min. The composition of the mobile phase was then changed to 0% A/100% B over 28 min using a linear gradient. This composition was held for 6 min then changed to 90% A/10% B over 2 min. The column was equilibrated in 90% A/10% B for 6 min prior to the next injection. Under these chromatographic conditions, MAPG eluted at 12.1 min, pyoluteorin eluted at 15.1 min, and DAPG eluted at 18.1 min. The HPLC was operated with and data viewed withChemStation (version B.04.03, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Quantification was performed by integrating the area under the curve at 300 nm and comparing with a standard curve prepared by injection of purified pyoluteorin, MAPG, and DAPG. Data were processed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Identification of chlorinated phloroglucinols</title><p>For LCMS analysis of crude culture extracts of the wild-type Pf-5 and the Δ<italic>pltM</italic> mutant, these two strains were grown for 20 hr in 500 ml NBGly at 27°C with shaking. The supernatants of the cultures were extracted twice with ethyl acetate (250 ml). The extracts were concentrated in vacuo to dryness. The dried extracts were dissolved in 50 µl methanol and then diluted to 400 µl with water. The large amount of precipitate formed was removed by centrifugation (15,000 <italic>x g</italic>, 60 min, 10°C), and 10 µl of the clear supernatant were analyzed by LCMS as described below.</p><p>LCMS analysis was performed using a Agilent 1260 HPLC (consisting of degasser, quaternary pump, autosampler, and diode array detector) upstream of a 6230 ESI-TOF operated in negative ionization mode with the following parameters: Mass range, 100–3200 m/z in profile mode; Gas temperature, 350°C; Drying gas, 10 L/min; Nebulizer, 40 psig; Capillary voltage, 3500 V; Fragmentor, 100 V; Skimmer, 65 V; OCT 1 RF Vpp, 750 V; Acquisition rate, five spectra/sec; Time, 200 ms/spectrum; Transients/spectrum, 1902). The synthesized authentic compounds PG-Cl, PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> and PG-Cl<sub>3</sub> were used as standards for comparisons in the analysis. Separation was achieved with an Extend C18 column (2 × 100 mm, 3 µm, Agilent) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column was pre-equilibrated in 98% A/2% B, where A was water + 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid and B was acetonitrile + 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid. This composition was held for 1 min and then changed to 100% B over 30 min using a linear gradient. After that, the composition was held for an additional 12 min and the composition was returned to 98% A/2% B over 2 min. The column was equilibrated at 98% A/2% B for 12 min prior to injection of the next sample. The LCMS was operated with and data were viewed using MassHunter (version B.04.03, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).</p><p>Culture extracts from the wild-type Pf-5 were also fractioned by semi-preparatory HPLC and signal activity of the fractions was tested by the reporter strain <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 containing pRL-gfp. The wild-type Pf-5 was cultured for 20 hr in 500 ml NBGly at 27°C with shaking before being extracted twice with ethyl acetate (250 ml). The dried extracts were dissolved in 1 ml methanol and mixed with 1 ml water. The concentrated extracts were separated by semi-preparatory HPLC using a PuriFlash Pf450 (Interchim Inc., Los Angeles, CA). Separation was achieved using a Purisphere C18 column (10 × 150 mm, 10 µm, Interchim Inc.) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was pre-equilibrated in 90% A/10% B, where A was water and B was methanol. This composition was held for 2 min and then increased to 100% B over 40 min using a linear gradient and pure methanol was flown over the column for an additional 9 min. The effluent from the pump was collected directly into a 96-deep well plate in 1 min time slices after discarding the first 3 min to waste. Five microliters from each well were tested using SBW25 (pRL-gfp) and fluorescence was observed as described above.</p><p>To obtain sufficient levels of signaling molecules for LCMS analysis, the Δ<italic>gacA</italic> mutant of Pf-5 containing pME6010-pltM was cultured in three flasks, each containing 1000 ml NBGly amended with 12.5 µg/ml PG. The cultures were incubated for 20 hr at 27°C with shaking before being extracted twice with ethyl acetate (300 ml). Extracts were concentrated in vacuo to dryness. The dried extracts from the three replicate cultures were combined and dissolved in 1.5 ml methanol. A portion (200 µl) was diluted with 1.8 ml of water. The concentrated extracts were fractioned by semi-preparatory HPLC and the signal activity of the fractions were tested using SBW25 (pRL-gfp) as described above. The fractions with the highest signal activity were concentrated to dryness separately and analyzed by LCMS along with synthesized standards including PG-Cl, PG-Cl<sub>2</sub> and PG-Cl<sub>3</sub> as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Antibiosis assay</title><p>Antibiosis of Pf-5 and derivatives against the plant pathogen <italic>E. amylovora</italic> was determined on NAGly. <italic>E. amylovora</italic> was cultured overnight in 5 ml NBGly at 27°C with shaking, and 80 μl of the cultures were inoculated into 8 ml melted NAGly (45°C), and poured over solidified NAGly in a Petri plate. This two-layer plate was air-dried with the lid open for 1 hr to solidify the agar and remove extra moisture. The Δ<italic>phlA</italic>Δ<italic>pltM</italic> mutant and the Δ<italic>phlA</italic>Δ<italic>phlD</italic>Δ<italic>pltA</italic> mutant were cultured overnight in 5 ml NBGly at 27°C with shaking. The cells were washed once with fresh NBGly and used to make a bacterial suspension with an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05. For co-culture, cells of the two mutants were combined in a 1:1 ratio for a total OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05. Two microliters of the bacterial suspensions were used to inoculate three two-layer plates and incubated for 3 d at 27°C. The agar medium with the Pf-5 strains in the center was cut from the plate and concentrations of DAPG and pyoluteorin in the agar were quantified as follows. Bacterial cells were carefully removed from the agar using Kimwipe. The agar was weighed, sliced into small pieces and immersed for 30 min in sterilized water before extracting twice with ethyl acetate. The extracts were dried and the residue was dissolved in 20 μl methanol and analyzed by HPLC as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison using SPSS statistics 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jon Clardy (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Pierre Stallforth (Reviewer #2) and Sarah O'Connor (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports an interesting case in which two antibiotic biosynthesis pathways in <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> are linked through having an intermediate for one be modified by an enzyme in the second to produce a third molecule that up-regulates the biosynthesis of the second antibiotic. The two antibiotics – diacylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and pyoluteorin (PLT) – are well known and have distinct if overlapping activities. This study reports that phloroglucinol (PG), a precursor of DAPG, is modified by a chlorinase in the PLT biosynthetic pathway to produce chlorinated versions of PG, PG-Cl and PG-Cl<sub>2</sub>. The chlorinated PGs function as positive regulators of PLT biosynthesis, and are themselves antibiotics. The latter finding is not surprising, as they resemble carbolic acid – an antibiotic going back to Joseph Lister. The study is well done, and the results are unexpected.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were uniformly enthusiastic about publishing your article after some revision. Major issues that need to be addressed are summarized below, along with the individual review of reviewer #3.</p><p>1) Enhanced mechanistic analysis of the co-regulation including the difference/similarity of phlD and pltD, apparently redundant enzymes for PG production. A mechanistic analysis would be facilitated by using &quot;co-regulation&quot;, which is the much more informative description used in the impact statement, rather than &quot;crosstalk&quot;, which following its more common definition of &quot;components of different signal transduction pathways affecting one another&quot;, is inappropriate.</p><p>2) The structural analysis of PG-Cl and PG-CL<sub>2</sub> are not up to the usually accepted standards for establishing the structures of new molecules. It should be relatively easy to provide the additional data.</p><p>3) Suggest that the title be modified to: Metabolic co-regulation coordinates the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> protegens.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript demonstrates how a <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species uses crosstalk between the two natural product pathways, DAPG and pyoluteorin, to control the regulation of these natural product biosynthesis pathways. While metabolic crosstalk has been previously observed on many other occasions, the authors convincingly demonstrate how this is an unusual and unprecedented mechanism. The authors use an assay based on the transcription of a reporter protein to identify the two signaling molecules responsible for the crosstalk, in this case two chlorinated derivatives of a biosynthetic intermediate of the DAPG biosynthetic pathway. Overall, this is an elegant study that shows an unusual mechanism of crosstalk. I believe that it is appropriate for the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I have the following comments below:</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> only the mass of the products is shown, which is not sufficient for structural characterization. The authors should show that these two isolated products co-elute with authentic standards, and should also show that these isolated products have the same mass and retention time of the products of the in vitro reaction with PG (which is only demonstrated by a bar graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). High resolution mass spectra are very easy to obtain and are standard for molecular characterization and should also be included. These are fairly simple experiments and will provide much more convincing data that the structures are as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>The authors state (subsection “<italic>pltM</italic> is necessary and sufficient for the <italic>PltR</italic>-mediated activation of <italic>pltL</italic> expression by PG”, first paragraph) &quot;Moreover, <italic>pltM</italic> and <italic>pltR</italic> share similar transcriptional profiles (Clifford et al. 2015).&quot; I was curious how the expression profile of <italic>pltM</italic> compared to rest of the <italic>plt</italic> and <italic>phb</italic> clusters.

Previous studies showed that <italic>phlD</italic> (gene locus ID: PFL_5957), which encodes a type III polyketide synthase, is responsible for PG biosynthesis: heterologous expression of <italic>phlD</italic> led to an accumulation of PG in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cultures, and purified PhlD converted malonyl-coA into PG in vitro(Achkar et al. 2005). More importantly, <italic>phlD</italic> is the only gene for PG production of Pf-5, as a knockout of the <italic>phlD</italic> gene completely abolishes PG production (Kidarsa et al. 2011). To address this, we reiterated in the revised manuscript (page 4, line 66-67), that <italic>phlD</italic> is necessary for PG production.</p><p><italic>A mechanistic analysis would be facilitated by using &quot;co-regulation&quot;, which is the much more informative description used in the impact statement, rather than &quot;crosstalk&quot;, which following its more common definition of &quot;components of different signal transduction pathways affecting one another&quot;, is inappropriate.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

These data have been added to the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors state (subsection “pltM is necessary and sufficient for the PltR-mediated activation of pltL expression by PG”, first paragraph) &quot;Moreover, pltM and pltR share similar transcriptional profiles (Clifford et al. 2015).&quot; I was curious how the expression profile of pltM compared to rest of the plt and phb clusters. Can the authors make a brief comment on this, with the data that is currently available (i.e., the data in Clifford et al.)?</italic> </p><p>The expression profile of <italic>pltM, pltR</italic> and the other genes in the pyoluteorin gene cluster was summarized from previous study (Clifford et al. 2015) and this information and supporting data were added in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>In the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors should indicate at what time point during the culture period these data points were taken.</italic> </p><p>Thank you. GFP expression was tested at 20 hours after inoculation and the metabolites were extracted and tested at 24 hours after inoculation.
