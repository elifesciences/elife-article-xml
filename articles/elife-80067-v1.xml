on the synthesis of small RNA precursors whose sequences define the target spectrum of these silencing pathways. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) variant Rhino permits transcription of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) precursors within transposon-rich heterochromatic loci in germline cells. Current models propose that Rhino’s specific chromatin occupancy at piRNA source loci is determined by histone marks and maternally inherited piRNAs, but also imply the existence of other, undiscovered specificity cues. Here, we identify a member of the diverse family of zinc finger associated domain (ZAD)-C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins, Kipferl, as critical Rhino cofactor in ovaries. By binding to guanosine-rich DNA motifs and interacting with the Rhino chromodomain, Kipferl recruits Rhino to specific loci and stabilizes it on chromatin. In <italic>kipferl</italic> mutant flies, Rhino is lost from most of its target chromatin loci and instead accumulates on pericentromeric Satellite arrays, resulting in decreased levels of transposon targeting piRNAs and impaired fertility. Our findings reveal that DNA sequence, in addition to the H3K9me3 mark, determines the identity of piRNA source loci and provide insight into how Rhino might be caught in the crossfire of genetic conflicts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genes within our DNA encode the essentials of our body plan and how each task in the body is achieved. However, our genome also contains many repetitive regions of DNA that do not encode functional genes. Some of these regions are genetic parasites known as transposons that try to multiply and spread around the DNA of their host. To prevent transposon DNA from interfering with the way the body operates, humans and other animals have evolved elaborate defense mechanisms to identify transposons and prevent them from multiplying.</p><p>In one such mechanism, known as the piRNA pathway, the host makes small molecules known as piRNAs that have sequences complementary to those of transposons, and act as guides to silence the transposons. The instructions to make these piRNAs are stored in the form of transposon fragments in dedicated regions of host DNA called piRNA clusters. These clusters thereby act as genetic memory, allowing the host to recognize and silence specific transposons in other locations within the host’s genome. In fruit flies, a protein called Rhino binds to piRNA clusters that are densely packed to allow piRNAs to be made. However, it remained unclear how Rhino is able to identify and bind to piRNA clusters, but not to other similarly densely packed regions of DNA.</p><p>Baumgartner et al. used a combination of genetic, genomic, and imaging approaches to study how Rhino finds its way in the fruit fly genome. They found that another protein called Kipferl interacts with Rhino and is required for Rhino to bind to nearly all piRNA clusters. Since Kipferl can by itself bind to the sequences that Rhino needs to find, the results suggest that Kipferl acts to recruit and initiate Rhino binding within densely packed piRNA clusters. Further experiments found that, in flies lacking Kipferl, Rhino binds to regions of DNA called Satellite repeats, hinting that these selfish sequences may compete for Rhino for their own benefit.</p><p>The finding that Kipferl and Rhino work together to define the memory system of the piRNA pathway strongly advances our understanding of how a sequence-specific defense system based on small RNAs can be established.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>piRNA pathway</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin formation</kwd><kwd>HP1 proteins</kwd><kwd>transposon biology</kwd><kwd>zinc finger proteins</kwd><kwd>germline biology</kwd><kwd>ZAD zinc finger proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2015-CoG-682181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brennecke</surname><given-names>Julius</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000654</institution-id><institution>Marie Curie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>847548</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Changwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F4303 and W1207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brennecke</surname><given-names>Julius</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumgartner</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kipferl, a ZAD zinc finger protein from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, determines the chromatin binding specificity of the heterochromatin protein variant Rhino, defining piRNA clusters and preventing Rhino sequestration by selfish Satellite repeats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic genomes are littered with transposable elements. By constantly aiming to increase their copy number, transposons pose a major threat to genomic integrity and must therefore be tightly controlled. An important transposon silencing mechanism in animals is the PIWI-interacting small RNA (piRNA) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Siomi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Czech et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ozata et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Senti and Brennecke, 2010</xref>). Its loss leads to transposon de-repression and mobilization, DNA damage, and sterility. At the center of the piRNA pathway are Argonaute proteins of the PIWI clade loaded with 23-30nt long piRNAs which enable sequence specific repression of transposons at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. To control the highly diverse transposon sequence repertoire, an equally diverse set of piRNAs must be generated. Transposon targeting piRNAs are typically encoded in specialized genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Houwing et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aravin et al., 2008</xref>). These so-called piRNA clusters are enriched in transposon sequences, range from a few to several hundred kilobases in length, and act as heritable and adaptive transposon sequence libraries for the piRNA pathway.</p><p>Through their transcription, piRNA clusters provide the essential small RNA precursors with sequence information antisense to active transposon transcripts. The definition of specific genomic loci as piRNA precursor sources is therefore of central importance to determine the pathway’s target spectrum. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> gonads, two general types of piRNA clusters are distinguished based on their mode of transcription: Uni-strand clusters are transcribed on one genomic strand from canonical RNA polymerase II promoters, giving rise to long, single stranded, and poly-adenylated transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goriaux et al., 2014</xref>). The second type are dual-strand piRNA clusters, which are transcribed on both genomic strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klattenhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersen et al., 2017</xref>). Dual-strand clusters are active in germline cells and are embedded within heterochromatin. They differ from canonical RNA polymerase II transcription units by a lack of defined promoters, and by suppression of splicing and cleavage- and polyadenylation signals.</p><p>The molecular identity of dual-strand piRNA clusters is conferred by Rhino, a germline-specific variant of the canonical Heterochromatin Protein 1 a (Su(var)2–5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vermaak and Malik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klattenhoff et al., 2009</xref>). While Su(var)2–5 mediates gene silencing and chromatin compaction, Rhino acts in an opposite manner: It enables the recruitment of several germline-specific proteins, which are required to engage the cellular gene expression machinery at piRNA clusters and enable the nuclear export of the emerging transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">ElMaghraby et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kneuss et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>rhino</italic> mutant flies, dual-strand piRNA clusters lose their transcriptional capacity and convert into canonical heterochromatin. Consequently, piRNA production collapses, transposons are de-repressed, and flies are sterile. Based on these data, Rhino is the defining feature of dual-strand piRNA clusters, and its specific deposition is at the very center of steering piRNA populations to target ‘non-self’ (transposons) but not ‘self’ (genic loci).</p><p>Despite an increasing understanding of how Rhino orchestrates piRNA cluster expression, little is known about how cells control the specific deposition of Rhino onto chromatin. Current models involve a role of maternally inherited Piwi-piRNA complexes in the specification of piRNA cluster identity through Piwi-dependent deposition of H3K9 methylation, which is postulated to define dual-strand clusters at the chromatin level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Thomas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shpiz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akkouche et al., 2017</xref>). In this manner, Rhino can be recruited adaptively to a changing transposon insertion profile. Indeed, Rhino’s N-terminal chromodomain displays specific affinity to H3K9me3, which is consistently present at piRNA clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Thomas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). However, a large fraction of the pericentromeric, H3K9me3 enriched heterochromatin is not or only weakly bound by Rhino. Since its discovery, a major open question has therefore been how Rhino’s genomic binding profile is defined.</p><p>Two observations indicate that, besides H3K9me3, cellular and genomic context impact Rhino’s binding pattern. First, while Rhino is expressed both in ovaries and testes, the identity of dual-strand piRNA clusters differs in the two gonads despite identical DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klattenhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the genomic Rhino profile is dynamic in testes where the X-chromosomal <italic>AT-chX</italic> cluster attracts most of the cellular Rhino pool in differentiating spermatocytes but not at earlier developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Second, while all stand-alone insertions of active transposons are silenced through piRNA-guided heterochromatin formation, only around 20% of the insertions of any given transposon are, by unknown mechanisms, bound by Rhino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shpiz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Radion et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akulenko et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these two observations, Rhino-domains must be defined through a combination of H3K9me3 with additional, unknown activities that bind chromatin via Piwi-independent mechanisms.</p><p>Here, we show that the zinc finger protein CG2678/Kipferl defines the majority of Rhino’s chromatin binding pattern in ovaries. The combinatorial readout of Kipferl’s sequence-specific DNA binding together with Rhino’s affinity to the H3K9me3 mark underlies the selective recognition of heterochromatic loci as substrates for piRNA precursor transcription. Our findings also suggest that distinct chromatin loci might compete for the cellular Rhino pool, offering insight into why Rhino is a fast-evolving protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The H3K9me3 mark alone cannot explain the large diversity of genomic Rhino domains</title><p>As a foundation for studying how Rhino’s chromatin binding specificity is defined molecularly, and how variable it is in fly strains with different transposon insertion profiles, we determined Rhino’s chromatin occupancy genome-wide in two commonly used laboratory strains (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and MTD-Gal4) and in <italic>iso1</italic>, the strain underlying the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoskins et al., 2015</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) confirmed that Rhino binds mostly to extended domains that vary greatly in size and often lack clearly defined boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore divided the genome into nonoverlapping genomic 1-kb tiles and calculated the Rhino enrichment per tile in each strain. This revealed that a substantial fraction of the genome (e.g. 3.9 Mbp corresponding to ~3% of the analyzable genome in the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> strain) showed greater than 4-fold enrichment (p&lt;0.036, Z-score &gt;2.1) for Rhino over input.</p><p>To analyze Rhino’s chromatin binding profile, we divided the genome into pericentromeric heterochromatin and the generally euchromatic chromosome arms (based on H3K9me3 and Su(var)2–5 ChIP-seq data) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The three well-described Rhino-dependent dual-strand piRNA clusters – <italic>cluster 38C</italic>, <italic>42AB</italic>, and <italic>80F –</italic> were not assigned to either category but were analyzed separately as reference loci. Rhino enrichment at major dual-strand clusters but also within the recombination-poor, pericentromeric heterochromatin followed a highly similar pattern in all three fly strains, with only few loci displaying strain-specific quantitative differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> left, middle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Many Rhino domains in pericentromeric heterochromatin (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> panel 1) resembled the large piRNA clusters like <italic>cluster 80F</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> panel 2): they exhibited strong H3K9me3 signal, gave rise to abundant piRNAs, and were enriched in diverse transposon sequences. Within chromosome arms, several strain-specific Rhino domains were apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> right). Based on manual inspection, these corresponded to genomic loci flanking stand-alone transposon insertions (e.g. a <italic>flea</italic> insertion found only in the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> panel 3)). The majority of euchromatic Rhino domains, however, were shared among all three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on the <italic>iso1</italic> data and the reference genome, many of these shared domains were not associated with transposon insertions. Upstream of the <italic>headcase</italic> locus, for example, Rhino was strongly enriched in all strains, although this locus lacks transposon sequences and does not produce abundant piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> panel 4). Nonetheless, these loci displayed dual-strand transcription based on RIP-seq data for Nxf3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">ElMaghraby et al., 2019</xref>), the piRNA precursor specific nuclear export factor, indicating that these loci were functional Rhino domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The poor piRNA output from these transposon-devoid loci is therefore not due to non-functional Rhino, but most likely due to a lack of piRNA target sites for Aub/Ago3-mediated transcript cleavage in the emerging transcripts, which greatly stimulate piRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2015</xref>). Altogether, our data demonstrate that Rhino, in a largely strain-independent manner, binds to thousands of remarkably diverse genomic loci that include, but are not limited to sources of dual-strand piRNAs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>H3K9me3 is insufficient to define the large diversity of genomic Rhino domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ChIP-seq enrichment (genome unique reads; 1-kb tiles, one representative replicate each) of H3K9me3 and Su(var)2–5 along the assembled chromosome 3 sequence in <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> ovaries.

Second, numerous loci in heterochromatin with high H3K9me3 signal were not or only poorly bound by Rhino (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).

In general, transposon de-repression in ovaries lacking Kipferl was less severe compared to ovaries lacking Rhino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>).

This revealed a strong interdependence of Rhino and Kipferl at regions they co-occupied in wildtype ovaries, which included most heterochromatic Kipferl binding sites, as well as roughly 60% of the euchromatic sites. In agreement with our previous results, Rhino’s chromatin occupancy was highly dependent on Kipferl. Loss of Rhino had a more complex effect on Kipferl’s binding pattern: while the Kipferl ChIP-seq signal was reduced at sites co-occupied by Rhino, residual signal was visible at many of these loci. Furthermore, Kipferl binding at sites lacking Rhino enrichment was fully maintained in the absence of Rhino, supporting Kipferl’s ability to bind to chromatin without Rhino. Prompted by these observations, we determined Kipferl peaks in the absence of Rhino, refocusing our analysis on Kipferl’s intrinsic, Rhino-independent chromatin binding sites. In <italic>rhino</italic> mutants, Kipferl was enriched at thousands of narrow peaks. Comparison of the Kipferl signal between wildtype and <italic>rhino</italic> mutants at these sites confirmed that Kipferl’s chromatin occupancy was reduced at sites that were co-occupied by Rhino in wildtype ovaries, while it was unaffected at Kipferl-only peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, while Kipferl bound to chromatin in similarly narrow peaks at stand-alone and Rhino-occupied regions in <italic>rhino</italic> mutants, Rhino seemingly supported the spreading of Kipferl to larger domains in wildtype ovaries.</p><p>Kipferl binding sites in <italic>rhino</italic> mutants were found both in pericentromeric heterochromatin (802 peaks) and within chromosomal arms (3334 peaks), and generally coincided with regions bound by Kipferl and Rhino in wildtype ovaries, demonstrating that Kipferl binds the same sites in both genotypes, yet in different patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Kipferl’s chromatin enrichment was strengthened and expanded from the narrow peaks seen in <italic>rhino</italic> mutant ovaries to broad domains in wildtype ovaries, specifically at peaks where Rhino was present. Kipferl peaks that did not show Rhino binding, on the other hand, did not widen into extended domains. Importantly, Rhino recruitment to Kipferl peaks depended on the presence of H3K9me2/3: Rhino occupied the majority of Kipferl peaks in pericentromeric heterochromatin where H3K9me2/3 is abundant. Within chromosomal arms, Rhino accumulated preferentially at those Kipferl sites that were within a local H3K9me2/3 domain. These findings supported a model in which Kipferl binds chromatin independently of Rhino, Kipferl binding sites act as Rhino nucleation sites when inside local heterochromatin, and Kipferl and Rhino cooperate and spread from nucleation sites into flanking heterochromatic regions, resulting in extended Rhino/Kipferl domains. Consistent with this, Rhino occupancy at and around Kipferl binding sites was dependent on Kipferl and overexpression of Kipferl in germline cells resulted in increased Kipferl binding at all sites, leading to the strengthening of Rhino/Kipferl domains within H3K9me2/3 domains, and the formation of additional small Rhino domains at pre-existing Kipferl sites with low, but detectable H3K9me2/3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Kipferl’s intrinsic chromatin binding profile in <italic>rhino</italic> mutants was strongly predictive of Rhino’s chromatin occupancy, often mirroring the non-uniform enrichment of Rhino in wildtype ovaries, only at lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Indeed, 60% of Kipferl-dependent Rhino bound regions contained or were within 5 kb of a Kipferl nucleation site. However, at several loci (e.g. the <italic>eyeless</italic> gene), the extended Rhino domain in wildtype flies encompassed only very weak or no putative Kipferl nucleation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Considering that Rhino depended on Kipferl also at these loci, we speculate that here, both proteins, supported by local H3K9-methylation and putative additional factors, are required for formation of a stable Rhino/Kipferl domain. Finally, in line with the largely Kipferl-independent Rhino occupancy at piRNA clusters <italic>42AB</italic> and <italic>38C</italic>, we find only weak intrinsic Kipferl binding at these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Nevertheless, Kipferl bound strongly to these clusters in wildtype ovaries, implying that Rhino is capable of stabilizing Kipferl on chromatin. Upon closer inspection, Kipferl influenced Rhino’s chromatin profile even at the Kipferl-independent piRNA cluster <italic>42AB</italic>: While Rhino remained bound at the highly repetitive central regions of this cluster in the absence of Kipferl, several small Kipferl nucleation sites towards the periphery of the cluster seem to support the formation of an extended Rhino domain in wildtype ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, zoom). Based on these data, we conclude that Kipferl is a major specificity factor for Rhino in ovaries, and that Kipferl cooperates with Rhino to form extended Rhino domains from defined nucleation sites, with both proteins supporting each other’s chromatin occupancy. Our data further indicate that Kipferl is not the only Rhino specificity factor but demonstrate that it is also required for the stabilization of Rhino domains nucleated by alternative means.</p><p>According to the nucleation-site model, Kipferl is expected to bind to specific DNA motifs. Consistent with this, its two ZnF arrays are predicted to bind DNA with a specificity for guanosine-rich motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Persikov and Singh, 2014</xref>). We determined sequence motifs that were enriched in Kipferl ChIP-seq peaks identified in <italic>rhino</italic> mutant ovaries. The top enriched motif (found in &gt;80% of all peaks; p&lt;10<sup>–322</sup>) closely matched the in silico predictions for Kipferl’s ZnF arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This GRGGN motif was locally enriched at experimentally determined Kipferl peaks, regardless of whether the peak was located in pericentromeric heterochromatin or chromosomal arms, or whether it was within a Rhino domain or constituted a Kipferl-only site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Additional motifs detected at lower frequency and confidence often displayed variations of the same guanosine-rich motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In support of Kipferl’s specificity for a GRGGN sequence, stable overexpression of FLAG-tagged Kipferl in cultured ovarian somatic stem cells (OSCs), which do not express Kipferl or Rhino, resulted in Kipferl binding at thousands of defined sites that were enriched in the GRGGN sequence motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, although future biochemical experiments will be required to confirm a direct interaction with DNA, our data support a model where the sequence-specific chromatin binding of Kipferl underlies the recruitment and/or stabilization of Rhino at chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Structure-function analysis of Kipferl’s DNA and Rhino binding activities</title><p>The yeast two-hybrid results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and ChIP-seq analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggested that Kipferl binds to both, Rhino and DNA. To examine how these two molecular activities are encoded within the Kipferl protein, we created flies that expressed truncated FLAG-tagged variants instead of endogenous Kipferl, lacking either one of the ZnF arrays (Kipferl<sup>Δ1st-array</sup>, Kipferl<sup>Δ2nd-array</sup>) or the N-terminal ZAD (Kipferl<sup>ΔZAD</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Artificial dimerization of the Kipferl<sup>ΔZAD</sup> variant via the heterologous dimerization domain from the yeast Gcn4 transcription factor or the ZAD of Ouija board, a ZAD-ZnF protein not expressed in ovaries, restored co-localization of Kipferl with Rhino (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, Kipferl<sup>GCN4</sup> and Kipferl<sup>ouib</sup>). Thus, neither the ZAD, nor the second ZnF array are critical for binding to Rhino, suggesting that Kipferl’s first ZnF array, besides its central role in chromatin binding, might also enable Rhino binding.</p><p>Yeast two-hybrid experiments, probing full length Rhino against Kipferl fragments, confirmed that Rhino interacts with Kipferl’s first ZnF array, with no additional interaction interfaces being identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To disentangle the putative DNA-binding and Rhino-binding activities of the first ZnF array, we further narrowed down the interaction between Rhino and Kipferl, revealing a critical role of the 4<sup>th</sup> ZnF (ZnF#4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). We tested this putative split-of-function mutant in vivo. In flies expressing Kipferl<sup>ΔZnF#4</sup> instead of the endogenous protein, Rhino did not co-localize with Kipferl, and displayed the characteristic <italic>kipferl</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, Rhino lost its chromatin occupancy in <italic>kipferl<sup>ΔZnF#4</sup></italic> flies in a pattern also seen in <italic>kipferl</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This included a complete loss of Rhino at Kipferl-dependent loci like <italic>cluster 80F</italic> or the <italic>headcase</italic> locus, but also remaining Rhino signal at Kipferl-independent loci like <italic>cluster 42AB</italic>, where Rhino’s ChIP-seq signal in <italic>kipferl<sup>ΔZnF#4</sup></italic> or <italic>kipferl</italic> null mutant flies was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Kipferl<sup>ΔZnF#4</sup> was diffusely localized in nurse cell nuclei akin to wildtype Kipferl in <italic>rhino</italic> mutants, and <italic>kipferl<sup>ΔZnF#4</sup></italic> females were sub-fertile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

The Rhino- and chromatin-binding activities of Kipferl can therefore be uncoupled: ZnFs 1–3, supplemented by the second ZnF array, allow for putative sequence specific DNA binding, while ZnF 4 interacts with Rhino.</p><p>The finding that the 4<sup>th</sup> C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> ZnF fold in Kipferl is sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>) for Rhino binding was intriguing. Canonical HP1 interactors typically bind the chromoshadow domain dimer of HP1 proteins via PxVxL motif-containing peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thiru et al., 2004</xref>). No such motif was found in Kipferl’s 4<sup>th</sup> ZnF. We inverted the yeast two-hybrid assay to determine which region of Rhino interacts with Kipferl and discovered that Kipferl interacts with Rhino’s chromodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Kipferl did not interact with the Rhino chromoshadow domain, the Rhino hinge region, or the chromodomain of Su(var)2–5. To test these findings in vivo, we generated flies that expressed Rhino variants with an artificial hinge or with a Gcn4 dimerization domain instead of the chromoshadow domain. Both Rhino<sup>CSD-Gcn4</sup> and Rhino<sup>art.-hinge</sup> failed to form extended Rhino domains like the wildtype protein, but were enriched at prominent Kipferl nucleation sites such as those in <italic>cluster 80F</italic> or upstream of the <italic>headcase</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Flies that expressed a Rhino variant with the chromodomain of Su(var)2–5 had rudimentary ovaries, precluding a meaningful ChIP-seq analysis, further supporting a model where the chromodomain contributes more than just binding to methylated H3K9. Our combined data indicate that Kipferl recruits Rhino to chromatin via a direct contact between its 4<sup>th</sup> ZnF and the Rhino chromodomain, and that functional Rhino is required for the extension and strengthening of Rhino/Kipferl domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Kipferl is required for Rhino domains at diverse stand-alone transposon loci</title><p>The piRNA pathway’s primary role is to silence transposable elements. Given their sequence diversity, it was surprising to find that a DNA binding protein with affinity for a short nucleotide motif is required for Rhino’s chromatin occupancy and hence the determination of the ovarian piRNA pool. In fact, transposon sequences overall do not harbor more GRGGN motif occurrences than random genomic tiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Considering that only about 20% of transposon insertions are transformed into Rhino domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akulenko et al., 2018</xref>), the average Rhino enrichment mapped to the consensus sequence would be low. We determined all stand-alone insertions of transposons lacking baseline Kipferl-binding in the MTD-Gal4 strain and displayed the levels of Rhino, Kipferl, H3K9me2/3, and piRNAs in the flanking genomic regions of these insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). While nearly all insertions were embedded in a local H3K9me2/3 domain, Rhino and Kipferl were only enriched at a subset of these insertions. RNAi-mediated depletion of Piwi or Kipferl resulted in loss of Rhino and piRNAs at these insertions. However, while Piwi loss impaired local heterochromatin formation, Kipferl loss did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

In some instances, we find that Rhino-bound insertions occurred nearby a genomic Kipferl binding site, which might be a critical factor to establish a local Rhino domain. In other instances, we find no nearby Kipferl binding site. Here, Kipferl likely acts by stabilizing Rhino which might have been recruited through alternative nucleation factors akin to Kipferl’s role at piRNA clusters <italic>38C</italic> and <italic>42AB</italic>, where Rhino remains chromatin bound in Kipferl mutant ovaries. Taken altogether, our data indicate that Kipferl acts as a recruitment factor for Rhino, and that it stabilizes the formation of extended Rhino domains, both at its own recruitment sites and at domains nucleated by alternative specificity factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study provides direct evidence that DNA sequence is an important determinant of how germline cells define the chromatin binding sites of the fast-evolving HP1 variant protein Rhino. The discovery of Kipferl, a putative DNA-binding zinc finger protein, that cooperates with the H3K9me3 chromatin mark and serves as Rhino guidance factor critically advances our understanding of how dual-strand piRNA source loci are specified.</p><p>By systematically comparing different <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> strains, we find that Rhino domains in ovaries are largely identical between strains yet highly diverse in their genomic location, underlying sequence content, and piRNA output. Given the affinity of Rhino to the histone mark H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Thomas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), current models postulate that maternally inherited piRNAs define the cellular Rhino profile through epigenetic mechanisms during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Thomas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shpiz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akkouche et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, Rhino domains are invariably accompanied by local di- and/or tri-methylation of H3K9. However, despite being targeted by maternally inherited piRNAs, not all transposon insertions are converted into a Rhino domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akulenko et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, while Piwi depletion leads to a loss of Rhino from chromatin at stand-alone transposon insertions, where H3K9me2/3 is dependent on Piwi, most piRNA source loci, including the major piRNA clusters, retain Rhino binding in the absence of Piwi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, we discovered several transposon-free Rhino domains that produce only trace amounts of piRNAs. These domains are difficult to explain by maternally deposited piRNAs as Rhino specifiers, suggesting that additional, locus-specific mechanisms must be in place to define Rhino’s chromatin binding profile. With Kipferl we present a factor capable of chromatin binding upstream of Rhino that has a major impact on nearly all Rhino domains in ovaries, irrespective of their position, transposon content, or piRNA output. Importantly, Kipferl does not influence the H3K9 methylation status, but rather stabilizes Rhino at most of its genomic targets, where H3K9me2/3 is provided through parallel pathways. In this manner, Rhino domains could be established at loci where heterochromatin coincides with Kipferl’s intrinsic chromatin binding pattern. This model provides a possible explanation for the relatively low fraction of transposon insertions that are bound by Rhino, despite piRNA targeting at many other sites. Thereby, Kipferl, with its specific chromatin binding activity, serves as the first example of the long sought-after guidance cue(s) required for specifying Rhino’s binding profile within heterochromatin.</p><p>While Kipferl binds to chromatin upstream of Rhino at a multitude of pronounced Rhino domains, not all Kipferl-dependent Rhino domains contain obvious Kipferl nucleation sites. Here, a combination of low intrinsic affinities of Kipferl and Rhino might underlie their observed co-dependence. Alternatively, additional guidance factors might exist, able to facilitate the recruitment, but not the stable binding of Rhino at these sites. The rare, Kipferl-independent Rhino binding at certain loci (e.g. clusters <italic>42AB</italic> and <italic>38C</italic>) argues in favor of additional specificity factors. An intriguing observation from our work is that Kipferl’s spatio-temporal expression profile differs from that of Rhino: Kipferl levels in ovarian germline stem cells and cystoblasts are very low, and the protein is absent in testes. Kipferl’s ovary-specific expression is therefore a likely contributor for the pronounced differences in Rhino landscapes between ovaries and testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). At the same time, it implies the existence of additional Kipferl-like factors or complementary molecular mechanisms that collaborate with H3K9me2/3 in testes or during early oogenesis where Rhino is functional in the absence of Kipferl. It will be interesting to see whether other Rhino guidance factors share Kipferl’s function as Rhino stabilizer, or if Kipferl presents a special example of a Rhino guidance and support factor.</p><p>Our data indicate that Rhino binds to Kipferl via its chromodomain. Binding of client proteins has so far been assigned to the dimeric C-terminal chromoshadow domain of HP1 family proteins. By recruiting and/or stabilizing Rhino on chromatin via the chromodomain, Kipferl-binding would be compatible with the recruitment of downstream factors like Deadlock via Rhino’s chromoshadow domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Our genetic data imply that DNA binding of Kipferl as well as H3K9me2/3 binding of Rhino are required for the formation of a stable Kipferl-Rhino complex on chromatin. Biochemical and structural work will be required to understand how the Kipferl-Rhino interaction evolved to be specific to the Rhino chromodomain and how it is compatible with simultaneous H3K9me2/3 binding. We were unable to generate Kipferl as a recombinant protein to study its DNA-binding potential or the Rhino-Kipferl interaction in vitro. It will further be interesting to investigate whether other chromatin readers utilize a similar mode of specialized recruitment for additional specificity. Known examples where ZnF proteins are involved in HP1 recruitment are the <italic>Drosophila</italic> HP1 variants HP1b and c, who rely on their cofactors Woc and Row for chromatin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Font-Burgada et al., 2008</xref>). In mouse embryonic stem cells, HP1beta/gamma bind to selected chromatin sites in a complex with the chromatin remodeler CHD4 and the activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ostapcuk et al., 2018</xref>). In both cases, interaction with ZnF proteins allows the H3K9me3-independent recruitment of HP1 variants to sites where their function has not been fully elucidated. This mode of recruitment is distinct from Kipferl’s mode of action, which synergizes with underlying H3K9me2/3 at its binding sites to recruit Rhino to chromatin.</p><p>With an N-terminal ZAD, Kipferl belongs to the largest group of ZnF proteins in insects, with 92 members in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2002</xref>). The functions of the few characterized ZAD-ZnF proteins are diverse and range from transcriptional regulation to chromatin organization and heterochromatin biology. Many ZAD proteins are preferentially expressed in ovaries and during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shapiro-Kulnane et al., 2021</xref>), and some of them, despite having essential functions, are fast evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kasinathan et al., 2020</xref>). It is therefore possible that additional ZAD-ZnF proteins function as guidance factors for Rhino or other HP1 proteins in the germline. If that were the case, the transposon-genome arms race might be a key driver of the diversification of ZAD-ZnF proteins. Diversification of ZnF containing genes is also observed for KRAB or SCAN domain zinc fingers, whose radiation in tetrapods is believed to be fueled by the transposon conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruno et al., 2019</xref>). While KRAB-ZnFs act directly as repressors of transposon expression and show fast evolution of their DNA binding specificity, signatures of positive selection are not concentrated on ZnF domains in ZAD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kasinathan et al., 2020</xref>), indicating different evolutionary pressures acting on the two families of ZnF proteins.</p><p>At this point, we can only speculate about the processes that forced the evolution of a factor like Kipferl. The phenotype of <italic>kipferl</italic> mutants, however, holds important clues. In the absence of Kipferl, the piRNA profile in ovaries is strongly distorted. Most transposons exhibit reduced antisense piRNA levels, and for some this results in their de-repression and accumulation of transposon transcripts in the developing oocyte, potentially causative of the fertility defects of <italic>kipferl</italic> mutant females. One model would therefore be that Kipferl evolved as a dedicated Rhino specificity factor that targets the DNA sequence of some transposons, active in differentiating ovarian germline cells. While only few transposons contain strong Kipferl nucleation sites, we find that the strongest Kipferl binding sites genome-wide are within sequence fragments of the <italic>gypsy8</italic> and <italic>DMRT1</italic> family transposons. This indicates that the DNA motif recognized by Kipferl possibly originated from an ancient invasion of these now inactive elements, offering a potential evolutionary requirement for Kipferl as a direct recruitment factor for Rhino. The Rhino decoration of transposons lacking Kipferl nucleation sites might rely on sporadic genomic Kipferl binding sites which allow their specification as piRNA source loci as local chromatin state permits. The major piRNA cluster <italic>80F</italic> would be a prominent example, where fragments of <italic>gypsy8</italic> and <italic>Rt1A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> insertions induce the Kipferl-dependent recruitment of Rhino and subsequent piRNA production also from neighboring transposons. In support of this, the entire <italic>cluster 80F</italic> is not a strong piRNA source in testes, where Kipferl is not expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, an initially specific homing of Rhino to a subset of transposons via Kipferl might have evolved into a network of transposon insertions within heterochromatin and at selected sites in euchromatic chromosomal arms that co-depend on Kipferl. This system would offer the potential for robust Rhino recruitment, at the cost of occasional off-target Rhino domains, when Kipferl motifs and H3K9 methylation coincide at regions lacking transposon sequences.</p><p>We can, however, also envision an alternative scenario, based on the second major phenotype in <italic>kipferl</italic> mutants: The dramatic re-localization of Rhino from hundreds of domains to Satellite arrays located within pericentromeric heterochromatin. Intriguingly, both the <italic>Rsp</italic> and the <italic>1.688</italic> Satellites are involved in genetic conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferree and Barbash, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferree and Prasad, 2012</xref>). The largest <italic>1.688</italic> Satellite array, the X-chromosomal 359 bp repeat, spans more than 10 Mbp on the pericentromeric X-chromosome and acts as a hybrid lethality locus in crosses between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferree and Barbash, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Females lacking this repeat, when mated to wildtype males, generate non-viable offspring while no defects occur in the reciprocal cross. This phenotype might stem from a requirement for maternally deposited small RNAs (siRNAs or piRNAs) to prevent mitotic catastrophe caused by uncontrolled <italic>1.688</italic> repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Usakin et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>Rsp</italic> Satellite has been identified genetically as part of the Segregation Distorter system, a meiotic drive system in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</xref>). Both <italic>Rsp</italic> and <italic>1.688</italic> Satellites give rise to abundant piRNAs in a Rhino-dependent manner in testes and ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). If piRNA production from <italic>Rsp</italic> and <italic>1.688</italic> Satellites is important to maintain control of <italic>1.688</italic> repeats or to suppress the <italic>Segregation distorter</italic> locus during spermatogenesis, Satellites might have evolved to take advantage of the Rhino system and force piRNA production from their own loci. In this scenario, different genomic loci would compete for the cellular Rhino pool to recruit the Rhino-dependent transcription and export machinery. It is conceivable that proteins working in an analogous way to Kipferl are present at Satellites to sequester Rhino to these repeats. Intriguingly, Rhino is among the fastest evolving proteins in the fly genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vermaak et al., 2005</xref>). Previous models have postulated that the positive selection in Rhino is a consequence of the transposon-genome arms race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Kipferl is conserved among <italic>Drosophila</italic> species with stronger divergence outside the <italic>melanogaster</italic> clade. We do not find pronounced amino acid changes in Kipferl’s zinc fingers involved in DNA binding or interaction with Rhino, nor in the ZAD, although the lack of amino acid polymorphisms at the <italic>kipferl</italic> locus precludes a conclusive analysis of selective forces acting on the protein (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, our findings point to the provocative possibility that selfish Satellite sequences might be among the central drivers behind Rhino’s fast evolution. We speculate that Kipferl might have evolved out of a necessity for a stabilizer of Rhino that allows it to bind its diverse genomic target loci and to avoid being sequestered by selfish Satellite repeats. While Kipferl’s affinity for guanosine-rich sequences optimally opposes the AT-rich Satellite sequences, its low abundance together with the relatively simple DNA motif it recognizes might constitute an optimal level of promiscuous binding across the genome, allowing the targeting of diverse transposon families.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains and husbandry</title><p>All fly stocks were kept at 25 °C with 12 hr dark/light cycles.

For the 1-kb tiles analysis, a pseudocount of 1 was added after normalization to library depth and correction for the mappability of the respective 1-kb tile. Tiles with fewer than 10 mapping piRNAs in all libraries were disregarded for sRNA analysis to avoid distortion due to very low abundant piRNAs. For calculation of piRNAs mapping to TEs, sense and antisense piRNAs were kept separate, and counts were normalized to TE length. For classification of tiles and transposons into somatic, Rhino-independent, and Rhino-dependent source loci, the soma index was determined as the log2 ratio of somatic (Piwi-IP in <italic>piwi</italic> GLKD, normalized to library depth) and germline (GL-Piwi IP, normalized to library depth) piRNAs mapping to each tile or TE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>). Classification by Kipferl-dependency of TEs was achieved by a binary cutoff of at a twofold reduction in antisense piRNA levels in <italic>kipferl</italic> knock down compared to control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18-6"><title>RNA-Seq analysis</title><p>For the RNAseq analysis, genome matching reads (STAR v2.7.10a; settings: <monospace>--outSAMmode NoQS --readFilesCommand cat --alignEndsType Local --twopassMode Basic --outReadsUnmapped Fastx --outMultimapperOrder Random --outSAMtype SAM --outFilterMultimapNmax 1000 --winAnchorMultimapNmax 2000 --outFilterMismatchNmax 3 --seedSearchStartLmax 30 --alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds No --outFilterType BySJout --alignSJoverhangMin 15 --alignSJDBoverhangMin 1</monospace>) were randomized in order and quantified using Salmon (v.1.7.0; settings: --dumpEqWeights --seqBias --gcBias --useVBOpt --numBootstraps 100 l SF --incompatPrior 0.0 --validateMappings). For the analysis we used the FlyBase transcriptome (r6.40) which has been masked for sequences similar to transposons. To include both strands of transposons in the analysis, TE-consensus sequences were added to the FlyBase transcriptome in sense and antisense orientation. For gene expression visualization Salmon results were further processed to GeTMM values using edgeR (v3.34.0). For differential gene expression analysis Salmon results were processed using DeSeq2 (v1.32.0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18-7"><title>TE insertion Calling</title><p>Euchromatic TE insertions were extracted from insertions called previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>), and nearby insertions were merged using bedtools merge -d 100, as these mostly corresponded to the same insertions called at slightly different positions. Further, all insertions overlapping UCSC repeat masker track annotations were discarded. For analysis of non-Kipferl nucleation site containing, but Rhino-dependent TEs, the resulting list was subsequently filtered for elements with no Kipferl enrichment in <italic>rhino</italic> knock out ovaries and at least 10-fold difference in piRNA levels between control and MTD-Gal4 mediated <italic>rhino</italic> germline knock down.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The <italic>Drosophila</italic> ZAD zinc finger protein Kipferl guides Rhino to piRNA clusters&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Zhao Zhang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have greatly enjoyed reading the manuscript and recognized the quality, novelty, and impact of the findings, supported by a large breadth of complementary approaches. How active piRNA-producing loci can emerge from heterochromatin and how they can be distinguished from other heterochromatic loci is an essential question, which more generally touches upon the question of the transcriptional activity of supposedly inert heterochromatin. Importantly, the identification of Kipferl may lead the path for the identification of other sequence-specific determinants of piRNA-producing loci, as H3K9me3-enrichment seems unlikely to be the sole feature allowing piRNA loci to be transcribed.</p><p>We identified five points that need further attention and are listed below. Most of them involve toning down some of the claims and /or integrating prior knowledge in the novel model, such as the epistatic position of Kipferl towards maternally deposited piRNAs in the specification of piRNA-producing loci. Please address them in a revised version of your manuscript. In addition, answer the individual comments of the reviewers in a detailed rebuttal letter.</p><p>1 – Kipferl was identified as a Rhino partner by yeast two-hybrid. However, independent confirmation by co-IP experiments seems to be missing. Please provide such experimental validation.</p><p>2 – Regarding the potential position of Kipferl at the interface of a genetic conflict, reviewers were interested to know whether Kipferl was conserved outside of <italic>melanogaster</italic> and more particularly, in <italic>simulans</italic>, and if so, whether some rapidly evolving amino-acids could be identified between the two species.</p><p>3 – The claim that Kipferl directly binds to DNA should be toned down, as recruitment to Rhino-occupied loci through protein/protein interactions is equally possible at that stage, unless biochemical evidence is provided.</p><p>4 – Please integrate the role of maternally deposited piRNAs into the model of Rhino recruitment to piRNA loci, and where they stand regarding Kipferl. For example, are these two modes of recruitment temporally separated (maternal piRNAs being more in stem/progenitor cells of the female germline, while Kipferl may be acting in more differentiated female germ cells, and be therefore involved in maintenance rather than original specification)? Do maternal piRNAs and Kipferl activate different piRNA clusters? Or do they act redundantly? No specific experiments are required here, but the view(s) of the authors on that matter would be very useful to share, as maternal piRNA-dependent specification of piRNA-producing loci is a well-accepted model.</p><p>5 – The authors propose that Kipferl acts upstream from Rhino but the hierarchy between Kipferl and Rhino seems more complicated than this simple model, as Kipferl binding at piRNA loci can also be reduced or even completely gone in Rhino mutants. The authors indeed discuss that Rhino is required for ectopic Kipferl spreading to Satellite loci, but it seems that Rhino is also required to some extent for Kipferl to bind at canonical piRNA loci. The authors are not required to carry out a tethering experiment-as suggested by reviewer #2- but the text should be modulated accordingly.</p><p>Figure revisions:</p><p>– Please provide statistics in violin and box plots. Currently, the reader may have the impression that changes may be present but non-significant.</p><p>– Genomic coordinates have to be provided on UCSC genome tracks.</p><p>– Please homogenize your scales in figures of genome tracks, particularly when comparing different genotypes for a given locus (see Figures 1C and 5C for example).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Without Kipferl, H3K9me3 seems to mildly (but visibly) increase (Figure 3G) while H3K9me2 seems to mildly (but visibly) decrease (Figure S3G). Is there a statistically significant difference between the two genotypes for K9me2/3? Is there a correlation between change in H3K9me2/3 and change in Rhino binding and what is their correlation coefficient?</p><p>2. In Abstract, Intro and Discussion, authors describe the exciting possibility that Rhino enrichment on satDNA in <italic>kipferl-/-</italic> could reflect a conflict. Given that Rhino binds satDNA in wildtype, what about the alternative possibility that it is merely a passive consequence of Rhino having to re-localize to Kipferl-independent loci in <italic>kipferl-/-</italic>? Or is there a disproportionate, higher-than-expected enrichment onto satDNA, with respect to <italic>42AB</italic> and <italic>38C</italic>, upon loss of Kipferl? Is there an increase in <italic>42AB</italic> and <italic>38C</italic> transcripts in <italic>kipferl-/-</italic> by RNA FISH? What makes up the remaining 79% piRNAs when 21% are satDNA piRNAs at line 307?</p><p>3. It is unclear which sequencing experiment is done with replicates and how many replicates, which should be clearly described. For replicated experiment, is a representative dataset OR the average of replicates shown? In sequencing experiments without replicates, how could one be convinced of the result?</p><p>4. In all confocal images, is only one z-slice shown? Other than Figure 3C, Rhino seems to have additional foci besides the pastry domain at the absence of Kipferl (e.g., Figures 6D, S3C, S3H). Showing the z-projection for single nurse cells might make statements about Rhino localization more convincing, especially the claim that <italic>kipferl, nxf3</italic> double mutants restore Rhino foci that are absent in <italic>kipferl-/-.</italic></p><p>5. The correlation coefficient with respective p-value should be reported whenever a correlation argument is made throughout the manuscript. e.g., lines 161, 347 and throughout Figures7 and S7.</p><p>6. Text description should not exaggerate the result. e.g., &quot;every&quot; at line 556. Text often says Kipferl is important for most/majority of Rhino domains, could it be supported by actual numbers (# out of total #, either # domain or # 1kb tiles)? Given that most active piRNA loci <italic>42AB</italic> and <italic>38C</italic>, as well as telomeric transposons, are all Kipferl-independent, one wonders if Kipferl really controls most/majority of Rhino domains. Since there are many Rhino-only and Kipferl-only domains/1kb tiles, listing actual numbers helps readers contextualize the relationship between Rhino and Kipferl as well as the prevalence of exceptions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a compelling story to establish the function of Kipferl in recruiting Rhino to the piRNA-producing loci in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian genome. I enjoyed reading and considering it in the past few days. I felt that there are some questions still unanswered--particularly how Rhino is recruited to <italic>42AB</italic>. However, given the authors already generated massive amount of data and the complexity of Rhino recruiting mechanisms, I don't think it would be fair to ask for an answer here. Here are a few suggestions:</p><p>1. I think the authors should comment on the potential homolog of Kipferl in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Rhino appears to be rapidly evolving, even simulans Rhino could not be compatible with the <italic>melanogaster</italic> piRNA machineries. Does Kipferl homolog exist in simulans. If yes, how different it is with the <italic>melanogaster</italic> Kipferl, especially the amino acids involving in Rhino and DNA binding. Answering these questions could potentially broaden the impact of this story.</p><p>2. Line159, H3K9me3 or H3K9me2?</p><p>3. I am confused about the message from Line 365-367. Do you mean Rhino peaks towards the periphery?</p><p>4. Line 452: motives or motifs.</p><p>5. The last paragraph is way too long. It is good to only deliver one message per paragraph.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript, although well written, is very dense with a lot of figures which sometimes makes it difficult to follow.</p><p>– In all the manuscript there is no mention of significance in the violin and box plots when the control KD and the <italic>kipferl</italic> KD are compared. As the manuscript now stands, the reader can have the impression that the changes might be important but non-significant.</p><p>– For each UCSC genome browser track, the genomic coordinates of the presented region should be added either on the figure or in the legend.</p><p>Figure Sup 3:</p><p>– Based on the figure legend, there are some inversions the E is the B, the B◊D, the D◊E.</p><p>– The picture of the FISH experiments of the <italic>42AB</italic> and <italic>38C</italic> are not really convincing. Furthermore, it is surprising not to see any <italic>80F</italic> FISH experiments.</p><p>– Figure 4D. the name of the TEs and the presence in cluster <italic>42AB, 38C</italic> is very informative. It should also be added for the Kipferl dependent TE piRNAs. The presence in the cluster 80F should also be described.</p><p>– The scale of the UCSC genome browser tracks are variable. For a given locus it is important to keep the same scale between different genotypes. Figure 1C, considering the heterochromatic region and the <italic>Cluster 80F</italic>, the Rhino ChIP-seq track is at 300 for the <italic>w1118</italic> and MTD-Gal4 genotypes whereas it is at 150 for the <italic>Iso1</italic> genotype. It is the same problem in Figure 5C for the Kipferl ChIP-seq results on the <italic>42AB</italic> cluster.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80067.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1 – Kipferl was identified as a Rhino partner by yeast two-hybrid. However, independent confirmation by co-IP experiments seems to be missing. Please provide such experimental validation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted this experiment several times using various buffer conditions. A co-IP of Rhino and Kipferl has proven to be very challenging. In our experience, most of Kipferl is tightly associated with chromatin and cannot be solubilized under buffer conditions that are compatible with the Rhino interaction. Moreover, co-expression of the two proteins in S2 cells for pull-down Western experiments did not allow any conclusions, as we observed background binding of Kipferl to the beads. However, we have conducted a complementary experiment that strongly supports that Rhino and Kipferl do not only interact in a heterologous yeast two-hybrid assay, but that the two proteins are also in very tight physical proximity in vivo. Briefly, a TurboID experiment (taking advantage of GFP-tagged Rhino in flies co-expressing the TurboID Biotin ligase fused to a GFP nanobody) recovered the complete set of known Rhino interactors, and in addition CG2678/Kipferl. As a control, we used flies expressing nuclear GFP alone alongside TurboID-GFP_nanobody (in a triplicate experiment coupled to label free quantitative mass spectrometry). We added this important complementary evidence for a Rhino-Kipferl interaction to Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – Regarding the potential position of Kipferl at the interface of a genetic conflict, reviewers were interested to know whether Kipferl was conserved outside of melanogaster and more particularly, in <italic>simulans</italic>, and if so, whether some rapidly evolving amino-acids could be identified between the two species.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on sequence conservation and gene synteny, Kipferl orthologs can be confidently identified in several other Drosophilid species, including <italic>D. simulans</italic>. We added the protein sequence alignment of Kipferl paralogs to Figure 2 Figure supplement 1. As far as we can tell, there are no obvious signs for rapidly evolving amino acids in the region that underlies the Rhino interaction (ZnF#4). We also did not find clear signs of positive selection within Kipferl when analyzing <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> natural strains. The absence of signs for positive selection has been mentioned in the previous Discussion and we slightly expanded that statement (last paragraph). In the future, it will be interesting to perform genetic swap experiments with Kipferl orthologs from other species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – The claim that Kipferl directly binds to DNA should be toned down, as recruitment to Rhino-occupied loci through protein/protein interactions is equally possible at that stage, unless biochemical evidence is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is formally possible. We do, however, like to point out that Kipferl does bind chromatin also independently of Rhino (at Kipferl-only loci), foremost based on the data where we expressed Kipferl in the OSC line that does not express detectable Rhino. We toned down the argumentation in the manuscript accordingly throughout the text relating to Figures 5 and 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 – Please integrate the role of maternally deposited piRNAs into the model of Rhino recruitment to piRNA loci, and where they stand regarding Kipferl.

No specific experiments are required here, but the view(s) of the authors on that matter would be very useful to share, as maternal piRNA-dependent specification of piRNA-producing loci is a well-accepted model.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an important point. Our data do not allow strong conclusions at this point. We extended this part of the discussion to reflect our current view on this topic (second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5 – The authors propose that Kipferl acts upstream from Rhino but the hierarchy between Kipferl and Rhino seems more complicated than this simple model, as Kipferl binding at piRNA loci can also be reduced or even completely gone in Rhino mutants.

The authors are not required to carry out a tethering experiment-as suggested by reviewer #2- but the text should be modulated accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in pointing out that our data is not consistent with a strict Kipferl -&gt; Rhino hierarchy. This is as Rhino has a clear impact on Kipferl’s chromatin binding capacity as well. As we do find Kipferl-only loci but not any clear Rhino-only loci, we argue that Kipferl is capable of binding DNA/chromatin in the absence of Rhino, but that Rhino has a strong stabilizing and spreading impact on Kipferl at sites that are within an H3K9-methyl domain. It is, however, important to point out that Rhino is capable of binding chromatin also independently of Kipferl in situations, where Kipferl is experimentally deleted (<italic>kipferl</italic> mutant) or in early stages of oogenesis where Kipferl is barely detectable. We added specific comments to this in the text (Results relating to Figure 5 and paragraph 3 of the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure revisions:</p><p>– Please provide statistics in violin and box plots. Currently, the reader may have the impression that changes may be present but non-significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the mean of the fold change for each violin plot (biological effect size), as well as the statistical significance as calculated via student’s t-test (for ChIP-seq enrichments) or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (for sRNA-seq fold changes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Genomic coordinates have to be provided on UCSC genome tracks.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the coordinates of each screenshot below the locus name in the various figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please homogenize your scales in figures of genome tracks, particularly when comparing different genotypes for a given locus (see Figures 1C and 5C for example).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this overall comment. For Figure 1, however, we think it makes more sense to leave the data display as is and to add a comment in the text saying that “<italic>iso1</italic> has the same pattern, but at some loci shows Rhino ChIP-seq signal at a lower level”. We speculate that this might be due to the fact that the <italic>kipferl</italic> locus in <italic>iso1</italic> differs from the <italic>kipferl</italic> locus in all examined experimental fly strains as it lacks part of the linker between the two zinc finger arrays (this is mentioned in the method section, line 810-816). For Figure 5, we made the y-axis scale consistent between genotypes. We also added panels with a zoom-in to show the remaining Kipferl enrichment pattern in better detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Without Kipferl, H3K9me3 seems to mildly (but visibly) increase (Figure 3G) while H3K9me2 seems to mildly (but visibly) decrease (Figure S3G). Is there a statistically significant difference between the two genotypes for K9me2/3? Is there a correlation between change in H3K9me2/3 and change in Rhino binding and what is their correlation coefficient?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. Our data indicate a small shift from H3K9me2 to me3 upon depletion of Kipferl. However, this was not limited to Rhino-bound genomic tiles. In the absence of more quantitative experiments using spike-in normalization approaches, we refrain from making a strong conclusion from this. Our key argument is that Rhino chromatin occupancy is lost at most sites despite high levels of remaining H3K9-methylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

What makes up the remaining 79% piRNAs when 21% are satDNA piRNAs at line 307?</p></disp-quote><p>Other than piRNAs originating from clusters <italic>42AB</italic> or <italic>38C</italic> (whose levels remain unchanged or decrease slightly), piRNAs derived from several Satellites increase strongly (up to 10-fold) although total piRNA levels in <italic>kipferl</italic> mutant ovaries decrease by about 40%. We did not observe increased RNA FISH signal for <italic>42AB</italic> and <italic>38C</italic> in the <italic>kipferl</italic> mutants compared to wildtype, while a strong increase in RNA FISH signal is seen for Satellites. This argues in favor of sequestration of the piRNA cluster machinery to Satellites, rather than just a distribution of free Rhino to remaining loci capable of binding Rhino. The remaining 80% piRNAs in <italic>kipferl</italic> mutants are somatic piRNAs (~20%) and piRNAs derived from Rhino dependent source loci where Kipferl is less important (e..g. <italic>cluster 42AB</italic>, <italic>cluster 38C,</italic> telomeres).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

This is stated now in the methods section (relating to RNA FISH and immunofluorescence stainings). In <italic>kipferl</italic> mutant nurse cells, the large peri-nuclear accumulations (the ‘Kipferl’) is the most prominent, but not the only visible Rhino domain. Regarding the Nxf3 comment: This might have been misleading in the text (now formulated more clearly, text relating to Figure 3, last paragraph): In <italic>nxf3-kipferl</italic> double mutants, no Rhino domains are restored. It is just that the Kipferl-structure is not anymore at the nuclear periphery, but rather internalized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

As the manuscript now stands, the reader can have the impression that the changes might be important but non-significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We added statistical significance parameters to the relevant plots as well as mean effect sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For each UCSC genome browser track, the genomic coordinates of the presented region should be added either on the figure or in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Coordinates have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure Sup 3:</p><p>– Based on the figure legend, there are some inversions the E is the B, the B◊D, the D◊E.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The picture of the FISH experiments of the <italic>42AB</italic> and <italic>38C</italic> are not really convincing. Furthermore, it is surprising not to see any 80F FISH experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The piRNA cluster FISH experiments aim to establish that the large Rhino accumulations observed in the absence of Kipferl do not correspond to the remaining Rhino-bound piRNA cluster loci. To that end the presented images were selected to depict the large Rhino-GFP domain in the same z plane with foci for both clusters. Due to photo bleaching effects we are not able to image deeper stacks, and likely miss weak Rhino signal that would be expected at 38C and <italic>42AB</italic> foci. We believe that the low levels of Rhino that remain at <italic>42AB</italic> and especially at <italic>38C</italic> are another reason why we don’t see stronger overlap. As <italic>cluster 80F</italic> lacks Rhino occupancy as well as piRNAs, we did not see the importance of a dedicated <italic>cluster 80F</italic> FISH experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4D. the name of the TEs and the presence in cluster <italic>42AB, 38C</italic> is very informative. It should also be added for the Kipferl dependent TE piRNAs. The presence in the cluster <italic>80F</italic> should also be described.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the information about <italic>cluster 80F</italic> to the existing panel, as well as the cluster information about the top 20 elements losing antisense piRNA counts in the <italic>kipferl</italic> knock down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The scale of the UCSC genome browser tracks are variable. For a given locus it is important to keep the same scale between different genotypes. Figure 1C, considering the heterochromatic region and the Cluster <italic>80F,</italic> the Rhino ChIP-seq track is at 300 for the <italic>w1118</italic> and MTD-Gal4 genotypes whereas it is at 150 for the <italic>iso1</italic> genotype. It is the same problem in Figure 5C for the Kipferl ChIP-seq results on the <italic>42AB</italic> cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed this.
