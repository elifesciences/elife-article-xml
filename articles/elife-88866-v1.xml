matrix. However, the mechanism driving the flux of metabolites, in and out, remains unknown. Here, we used TurboID and genome engineering to identify apicoplast transporters in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. Among the many novel transporters, we show that one pair of apicomplexan monocarboxylate transporters (AMTs) appears to have evolved from a putative host cell that engulfed a red alga. Protein depletion showed that AMT1 and AMT2 are critical for parasite growth. Metabolite analyses supported the notion that AMT1 and AMT2 are associated with biosynthesis of isoprenoids and fatty acids. However, stronger phenotypic defects were observed for AMT2, including in the inability to establish <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasite virulence in mice. This study clarifies, significantly, the mystery of apicoplast transporter composition and reveals the importance of the pair of AMTs in maintaining the apicoplast activity in apicomplexans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>apicomplexans</kwd><kwd><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic></kwd><kwd>apicoplast</kwd><kwd>transporters</kwd><kwd>monocarboxylate transporters</kwd><kwd>parasite physiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFC2300800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Xing-Quan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFC2300802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Xing-Quan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31873009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Shaojun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31772445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>De-Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combined cutting-edge technologies discovered a pair of carboxylate transporters that appears evolutionarily different among novel transporters and that is essential for parasite physiology.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phylum Apicomplexa encompasses thousands of intracellular parasites, including <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., the notorious agent of malaria, and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, the highly successful parasite that infects almost all warm-blooded animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Plattner and Soldati-Favre, 2008</xref>). It is believed that apicomplexan evolution included two key independent, and sequential, endosymbiotic events, finally leading to the common ancestor of the chromalveolates (e.g. alveolates, heterokonts, oomycetes, and Cryptomonads) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cavalier-Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Janouskovec et al., 2010</xref>). This ancestor eventually gave rise to the apicomplexans, most of which still contain a secondary non-photosynthetic plastid, the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McFadden and Yeh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oborník et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Salomaki and Kolisko, 2019</xref>). Though endosymbiont origins of the apicoplast were proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Köhler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McFadden et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilson et al., 1996</xref>), it is believed that the apicoplast originates from a red alga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foth and McFadden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McFadden and van Dooren, 2004</xref>). Therefore, the apicoplast membranes have been proposed to evolve from the red algal plastid, the algal plasma membrane, and the host endomembrane when counting from the innermost to outermost membranes of the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McFadden and Yeh, 2017</xref>). This heavily compartmentalized feature poses great challenges for metabolic integration of the organelle within these parasites and, in particular, the transport of metabolites across these membrane systems.</p><p>The apicoplast houses essential biosynthetic pathways. These pathways include the fatty acid synthesis type II (FASII) pathway, methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, Fe–S cluster biosynthesis pathway, (partial) heme biosynthesis pathway, and lysophosphatidic acid synthesis pathway (using the FASII products) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fata and Rabuzzi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jomaa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kloehn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tjhin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Waller et al., 1998</xref>).

The apicoplast FASII pathway in <italic>T. gondii</italic> is key to understand the metabolic flexibility, and can become essential under metabolic adaptation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botté et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krishnan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Primo et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the apicoplast maintains housekeeping activities for genome replication, transcription, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Low et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McFadden and Roos, 1999</xref>). Accordingly, it requires adequate supplies of carbon molecules, energy, reducing equivalents, cofactors, amino acids, nucleotides as well as inorganic ions, to feed the biosynthetic pathways and plastid maintenance activities in the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kloehn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McFadden and Yeh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>). However, compared to plant plastids, the nature of the channels and transporters in the apicoplast remains obscure.</p><p>The apicoplast biosynthetic pathways were characterized through a homology/bipartite signal-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>). A similar approach was utilized to identify phosphate translocators in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (i.e. <italic>Tg</italic>APT1) and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (i.e. <italic>Pf</italic>iTPT and <italic>Pf</italic>oTPT), and a two-pore channel TPC in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. These transporters are capable of supplying phosphorylated carbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fleige et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Karnataki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mullin et al., 2006</xref>), and calcium to the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2021</xref>). It was proposed that an early step in the endosymbiotic event was to integrate transporters that exchange metabolites across the membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cavalier-Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weber et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with that, studies demonstrated that 57–58% of the chloroplast transporters have an origin in the putative host cell in the first endosymbiosis while 20–30% are from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karkar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tyra et al., 2007</xref>). It is plausible that a complex transporting system was produced in the evolution of the secondary plastid (i.e. the apicoplast).</p><p>Recent studies suggested that we still do not know the major source of pyruvate required for the biosynthesis pathways in the apicoplast of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Swift et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xia et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, identifying the apicoplast transporter composition and their functions is critical for an understanding of how these transporters evolved and how the organelle maintains its metabolic and housekeeping activities. In this study, we utilized the apicomplexan model organism <italic>T. gondii</italic> to screen apicoplast membrane proteins, identified from available computational and proteomic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barylyuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>) and from our APT1-TurboID proximity proteomic candidates, and discovered several novel apicoplast transporters. Among the many transporter candidates, one pair of monocarboxylate transporters (AMTs) appeared to have evolved from the putative host cell involved in the evolution of the secondary plastid. Detailed analyses support association of the AMTs with the apicoplast biosynthesis pathways likely by supplying the pathways with substrates. This study opens up the possibilities of tackling difficult questions of substrate transport and especially for the pair of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and in other members of this phylum of deadly parasites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Discovery of novel transporters in the apicoplast of <italic>T. gondii</italic></title><p>To identify apicoplast transporter proteins in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we first analyzed candidates identified in recent studies using combined proteomic and computational analyses in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barylyuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>). The hyperplexed localization of organelle proteins (hyperLOPIT) assigned 129 proteins to the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barylyuk et al., 2020</xref>), of which three proteins were likely transporters, that is APT1 (transmembrane domain, TMD = 6), one major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter (TGME49_309580) (HAP1, hypothetical apicoplast protein 1), and one hypothetical protein (TGME49_267690) (HAP2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). We also mined an apicoplast proteomic dataset obtained by the BioID fusion at acyl carrier protein (ACP) in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>), which reported 16 TMDs ≥6 protein candidates, and two additional candidates annotated as ABC transporters (TMDs &lt;6).

They were temporarily named as HAP3–9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Taken together, these datasets provided only limited numbers of candidate transporters.</p><p>To better define the repertoire of apicoplast transporters, we employed a biotin proximity labeling strategy that is useful for defining organelle proteomes. A promiscuous biotin ligase tag called TurboID was endogenously fused with APT1, using a CRISPR approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b-d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Long et al., 2018</xref>). The apicoplast acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) is a strongly biotinylated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zuther et al., 1999</xref>), which might provide a clear and strong streptavidin labeling at the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Though the streptavidin signal and the protein itself were slightly diffused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Karnataki et al., 2007</xref>), APT1 was reported to mainly localize to four of the apicoplast membranes by an immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM) approach for HA epitopes tagged at the C-terminus of APT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Karnataki et al., 2007</xref>). This feature of APT1 thus provided good biotinylation labeling at potential proteins localized to membranes of the organelle. Predictably, many additional bands present on the APT1-TurboID lane were likely to be apicoplast proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The resultant mass-spectrometry datasets (<italic>N</italic> = 3 for each) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>) were analyzed by comparing the APT1 fusion to the parental line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>). This analysis showed that APT1 itself has the highest p-value associated with its enrichment in the TurboID line, as would be expected for a bait protein. The TMD candidates (TMD ≥6 and 2 ≤ TMD &lt; 6) were evenly distributed on the volcano map plotted by fold changes against p<italic>-</italic>values in a similar pattern to the distribution of known apicoplast proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c</xref>). These features suggested that APT1-TurboID had enriched apicoplast proteins.

In support of this model, immuno-EM provided a further piece of evidence, supporting the membrane localization of AMT1 and AMT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Due to the complexity of the apicoplast membranes, and heterogeneity of immunolabeling, the precise topology of AMT1 and AMT2 within the apicoplast membranes merits future investigation. To analyze the physiological functions of the AMTs, we generated the conditional knockdown lines using an IAA-inducible degron (AID) system in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Long et al., 2017b</xref>).

To conditionally study both proteins together, we fused AMT2 with AID-3HA at the 3′-terminus in the background of AMT1-AID-6Ty, creating a double knockdown line AMT1-AID-6Ty/AMT2-AID-3HA (dKD). Correct integration of the AID fragments was confirmed by diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as demonstrated in the schematic diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). As expected, the AID fusions were efficiently and stably depleted in IAA treatments for 3–36 hr, as shown on western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). It was noteworthy that western blots detected two bands in the single and double AID fusion lines, which might be the precursor and mature forms of AMT1 and AMT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). So far, several membrane proteins have been identified in the apicoplast of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, four of which were observed to be processed (FtsH1, TiC20, ATrx1, and TPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeRocher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Karnataki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karnataki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">van Dooren et al., 2008</xref>).

The parasites were grown in IAA for 24 hr, followed by scraping, purification and re-infection for the assay in the 2nd 24 hr and 3rd 24 hr. Using IFA analysis of the parasites, we observed that parasite replication was significantly affected in the first 24 hr of growth and became worse in the following cycles of 24 hr, especially the 3rd 24-hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results suggested that depletion of the transporters caused strong growth defects and delayed death of the parasites. We wondered if depletion of the proteins could cause loss or breakdown of the apicoplast, as reported previously for many apicoplast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kennedy et al., 2019b</xref>). ACP, an apicoplast marker, was used to test the apicoplast status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Waller et al., 1998</xref>). We observed that ACP partially diffused in the cytosol of intracellular parasites grown in IAA for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>), whereas it completely diffused in the cytosol of extracellular parasites that had grown in IAA for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This observation suggested swelling or breakdown of the apicoplast in the intracellular or extracellular parasites depleted with the AMTs, respectively. Detailed analysis of the phenotypes showed that the ACP diffusion gradually increased while comparing the three cycles for the same AID line in both the intracellular and extracellular parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>). However, it was as low as ~30% in AMT1-AID, compared to those (60–70%) in AMT2-AID and dKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>). These results suggested that depletion of AMT2-AID resulted in much more severe defects (swelling or breakdown) of the apicoplast than that of AMT1-AID, and further depletion of AMT1-AID had no further effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Depletion of the proteins resulted in defects in metabolic pathways</title><p>Based on the evolutionary predictions and features of MCTs, we suspected that the AMTs might be involved in transport of substrates, such as pyruvate, lactate, amino acids, as reported for human MCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Felmlee et al., 2020</xref>). As such, depletion of AMT1 and AMT2 would result in reduced levels of the metabolites isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and fatty acids in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. We first designed experiments to examine the possible defect of IPP synthesis in the AID lines upon induction, by assaying the capabilities of endocytic trafficking of green fluorescent protein (GFP) vesicles to the vacuolar compartment (VAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dou et al., 2014</xref>). Our recent data showed that GFP transport to the VAC following its uptake from host cell cytosol is dependent on protein prenylation of Rab1B and YKT6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). These proteins are modified at the C-terminal motif by isoprenoids, the synthesis of which could be specifically inhibited by atorvastatin at the host cells and by zoledronate in the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2013</xref>), as demonstrated in a schematic and in positive experiments (TIR1 with two drugs at IC50 concentrations) with reduced GFP transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Therefore, measuring the endocytic trafficking of GFP vesicles in parasites in the absence/presence of atorvastatin could reflect levels of protein prenylation and isoprenoids (IPP). The substrates modified at the proteins were mainly derived from the apicoplast biosynthesis pathway – the MEP pathway. We then assayed the TIR1 and AID lines by growing them in GFP expressing HFF monolayers, where experimental groups were controlled by absence/presence of atorvastatin and IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and where morpholinurea-leucine-homophenylalanine-vinylsulfone-phenyl (LHVS) was added to avoid degradation of GFP in the VAC. Following endocytosis of GFP vesicles by the micropore (manuscript in press), GFP vesicles were successfully transported to and accumulated in the VAC of TIR without IAA, with a high percentage (&gt;20%) of parasites containing GFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, the GFP vesicles diffused through the cytosol, and were unable to accumulate at the VAC in the AID parasites grown in IAA with the absence/presence of atorvastatin, as shown by significantly reduced percentages (~8%) of the parasites in the AID lines induced for 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We further tested Rab1B stability in the AMT-AID lines grown in IAA for 12 hr, which showed a strong defect of reduced protein abundance of Rab1B by scoring of parasites with normal or abnormal level of Rab1B using an IFA approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This phenotype was observed in parasites with a reduced supply of isoprenoids by drug inhibition or knockdown of prenyl-transferase GGT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). These results altogether thus suggested that the IPP synthesis is significantly decreased in the AID lines depleted with the transporters. However, it was noteworthy that parasites depleted with AMT1-AID and AMT2-AID had similar levels of reduced GFP transport and parasites with reduced protein abundance of Rab1B at the 12 hr of IAA induction, suggesting that depletions of AMT1 and AMT2 resulted in similar levels of IPP reduction in parasites.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Depletion of AMT1 and AMT2 caused defects of methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and fatty acid synthesis type II (FASII) pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) The MEP activity was strongly affected in the IAA-inducible degron (AID) lines.

Herein, our results underscored the importance of the transporters for supporting the MEP pathway in the apicoplast. This was further manifested by a reduced level of mitochondrial membrane potential detected by mitotracker red in the AMT1-AID or AMT2-AID lines grown in IAA for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). IPP is the precursor for synthesis of ubiquinone, an essential electron carrier required for electron transport in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kennedy et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sleda et al., 2022</xref>).

The metabolomics detected 66 metabolites in total in these lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4a</xref>). After analyses using Dunnett’s multiple comparison methods, 15, 23, and 34 differential metabolites were identified in the parasite groups depleted with either AMT1-AID, AMT2-AID, or both (dKD) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4b</xref>), in comparison with TIR1. Interestingly, three AID lines shared 13 differential metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The shared metabolites included fatty acids and lipids, such as myristic acid (C14 fatty acid), palmitoleic acid (C16 fatty acid), trans-oleic acid (C18 fatty acid), and phospholipids containing C14 and C18 fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>). These results were consistent with previous studies where inactivated FASII proteins led to reduced synthesis of fatty acids up to 18 carbons long, and exogenous additions of the C14 and C16 fatty acids could complement growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ramakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>). Studies suggested that lipids can be partially acquired from the host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krishnan et al., 2020</xref>), which includes those in the endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koreny et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wan et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we observed that the endocytic vesicles containing GFP were diffused in the parasite cytosol, indicating that the host cell-derived lipids were not affected in the protein-depleted parasites. We then concluded that depletion of the transporters significantly impaired the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids by the FASII activity in the parasite. In contrast to the same level of reduced endocytic trafficking of GFP vesicles in the AID lines, an overall trend toward lower levels of myristic acid (C14 fatty acid), palmitoleic acid (C16 fatty acid), and trans-oleic acid (C18 fatty acid) was observed in AMT2-AID and tKD parasites in comparison with the AMT1-AID parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

This would likely result from defective membrane potential caused by a reduced supply of IPP for synthesis of ubiquinone, as described above, or synthesis of heme that requires co-operation between the mitochondrion and the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harding et al., 2020</xref>). Another two metabolites, creatine and lactic acid, were likely associated with reduced metabolic levels in the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The untargeted metabolomics tends to identify differential metabolites by comparing the AID to TIR1 lines. Pyruvate was not identified, as it is actually a product of glycolysis in the cytosol.

To find out the reason for this, we first examined the protein level of one AMT (fused with 6 HA) in another AMT’s AID-Ty line, thus assuring no reciprocal effect on protein level. After IAA induction for 36 hr, we did not see obvious changes to protein levels in the 6HA fusions in the AID-Ty lines on western blots and IFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Considering an MCT could transport biotin in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daberkow et al., 2003</xref>), we wondered if AMT2 was able to transport biotin for activation of ACC1, which is a key enzyme in FASII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zuther et al., 1999</xref>). ACC1 was endogenously fused with 6HA in the AID lines by a CRISPR approach. Upon protein depletion in IAA for 36 hr, ACC1 was found to be gone only in the AMT2-AID parasites, but not in the AMT1-AID parasites, as demonstrated by western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further analysis showed that ACC1 was gone in some parasites within a single vacuole in the AMT2-AID-depleted parasites, where ACP was clearly stained with a slight diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

The quantification assay showed that only ~40% of the vacuoles contained one or two parasites with ACC1 signal (types 2 and 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). However, ACC1 in those parasites was still biotinylated, as shown in streptavidin stains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

Those mice infected with TIR1 succumbed to lethal toxoplasmosis by day 10 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Conversely, the IAA treatment ultimately prevented acute virulence caused by the parasite lines with the AMT2 depletion (i.e. AMT2-AID and dKD), and it postponed mouse death by the AMT1-AID depletion.

It was clear that AMT1-AID was efficiently degraded in mice by the treatment of IAA in only 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results demonstrated that the mice infection assays were robust. However, the strong growth impairment conferred by AMT1 depletion in parasites in cell culture surprisingly resulted in only reduced parasite virulence in mice. We assume that this discrepancy is related to the relatively modest defects, such as the ACP diffusion/apicoplast abnormality (revealed by TEM)/FASII activity, as observed in the AMT1-depleted parasites. Thus, the remaining apicoplast is still functionally generating an adequate amount of metabolites, allowing the parasites to survive in mice. However, the discrepancy is possibly associated with different transport capabilities of substrates by AMT1 and AMT2. Though this does not perfectly explain the discrepancy, weaker phenotypes in AMT1-depleted parasites argue for this possibility. Collectively, AMT2 was obviously essential for establishing <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection and virulence in mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most of the apicomplexan parasites, such as <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., harbor a vestigial plastid, which undergoes several fitness-conferring or essential metabolic pathways in the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kloehn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lim and McFadden, 2010</xref>). However, the transporters that are responsible for exchanging metabolites between the apicoplast and the parasite remain elusive, due to difficulties in identification of those transporters in the multiple membranes that surround the organelle. Here, we fully exploited the currently available data, and the high-efficiency of proximity biotin labeling and CRISPR-Cas9 tagging approaches in the model apicomplexan <italic>T. gondii</italic>, and discovered several novel transporters in the apicoplast. Among those putative transporters, most of them appear to be derived from the endosymbiont (i.e. a red alga) in the evolution of the secondary plastid, and only the pair of MCTs AMT1 and AMT2 is likely to be derived from the putative host cell that originally engulfed the endosymbiont. Protein depletion of the AMT1 and AMT2 using a highly efficient technique, the TIR1-AID system, resulted in defects of plaque formation in vitro, ACP diffusion/apicoplast loss and biosynthetic pathways of the MEP and FASII. However, depletion of AMT2 clearly caused stronger defects including ACP diffusion/apicoplast loss, FASII produced fatty acids, ACC1 stability and removal of mouse virulence. These results indicate that complex transporting functions are likely to exist in the apicoplast involving AMT1 and AMT2.</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted the difficulty in identifying apicoplast transporters, because of strong backgrounds in the proteomics resulting from high activity and nonspecific labeling of the biotin ligase (BioID) fused with apicoplast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sayers et al., 2018</xref>). This remained true for our proximity proteomics from APT1-TurboID. Fortunately, our focused screening leveraged high efficiency by genomic editing in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, yielding positive results for 12 putative transporters. These novel transporters provided an important resource for evolution and functional analyses. Their conservation, including in plastid-deficient taxa, that is Gregarina and Cryptosporidia, indicates that these proteins were relics of the former plastid in evolution via endosymbiont gene transfers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gould et al., 2008</xref>). Studies suggested that the metabolic integration of the primary plastid (e.g. chloroplast) was mainly driven by targeting transporters from a heterotrophic protist – the host cell, but not from the endosymbiont – cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karkar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tyra et al., 2007</xref>). However, our preliminary study in evolution indicated that most novel transporters were likely to be derived from the endosymbiont. In sharp contrast, the pair of MCTs (AMT1 and AMT2) may have an origin in a heterotrophic protist – the putative host cell. This observation therefore provides a perspective that the pair of AMTs may play critical roles in the metabolic integration of the algal endosymbiont into the parasites.</p><p>Our immuno-EM and confocal imaging provided a strong support for the membrane localization of the pair of transporters AMT1 and AMT2 in the apicoplast, indicating that the AMTs are likely to transport substrates in the membranes. We observed that the AMTs appeared to have two bands on western blot, which might be processed versions, or produced by alternative splicing or produced by an alternative initiator codon. Concerning the processing and targeting, apicoplast membrane proteins in <italic>T. gondii</italic> appear to be more complex than those in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, by comparison to PfiTPT and PfoTPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mullin et al., 2006</xref>). Our phenotypic analysis showed that depletion of the transporters AMT1 and AMT2 caused strong defects on plaque formation and parasite replication, suggesting that both transporters are critical on the apicoplast membranes. However, we observed disparate degrees of phenotypic disruption in the AMT1- and AMT2-depleted parasites. Depletion of AMT2 always caused stronger defects in ACP diffusion, FASII fatty acids, apicoplast loss, and mouse virulence. AMT2 is additionally associated with loss of ACC1, a key enzyme for FASII, found in the majority of parasites in a vacuole, likely providing another piece of evidence to explain the greater phenotypic defects. Several attempts to delete ACC1 failed in our study, supporting a critical role of ACC1 in the FASII process. Genetic studies suggest that depletion of FASII enzymes led to loss of apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the observation of ACC1 loss supports stronger phenotypes in AMT2-AID-depleted parasites. In addition, depletion of the AMTs caused an initially gradual defect, but then a much more focused sharper defect in parasite replication in the 3rd 24 hr and showed a delayed death phenotype. Previous studies showed that parasite replication exhibited gradual deceases upon depletion of TPC and APT1 by utilization of a low efficient knockdown strategy – the tetracyclin-inducible system (TATi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2021</xref>). It is unknown whether the TATi system would mask the growth phenotype, yet, the AMT depletion appeared to have such a sharper change in the third cycle (24 hr in a growth cycle). Collectively, the AMTs are critical to parasites, yet AMT2 is more important to the apicoplast membrane function.</p><p>Based on knowledge of MCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Felmlee et al., 2020</xref>), the pair of AMTs is likely to transport pyruvate, lactate, amino acids, and other substrates. We thus suspect that AMT1 and AMT2 might be associated with transporting pyruvate and amino acids, since these are essential for the apicoplast metabolism. Pyruvate is the central metabolite that connects many metabolic pathways in living organisms. It must be imported into organelles for specific metabolic pathways, as suggested with pyruvate import by the NHD1/Bass2-protein coupling function in the chloroplast of C4 plants, and by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Furumoto, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Furumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gasperotti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herzig et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, studies have suggested that the major pyruvate source has still not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Niu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Swift et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xia et al., 2019</xref>). Pyruvate is one of the key carbon sources for the condensation with triose phosphates to initiate the biosynthesis pathway of MEP in the parasite. Meanwhile, pyruvate is the only carbon source in the FASII pathway for biosynthesis of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>). The possible role on pyruvate import by the AMTs could provide a good explanation for the defects on MEP and FASII pathways, specifically, the phenotypes reflecting the reduced levels of IPP synthesis in the AMT-depleted parasites. We attempted to define this possible function of the AMTs by a pyruvate sensor PyronicSF in the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arce-Molina et al., 2020</xref>), and by a complementation of an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> knockout strain that is deficient in pyruvate import (a generous gift from Prof. Kirsten Jung) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gasperotti et al., 2020</xref>). However, several attempts with these approaches were not successful in generating the strain required for detailed examination of pyruvate import capability either in the parasite or in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain.</p><p>Our work successfully identifies several novel apicoplast transporters, thus greatly unraveling the mystery of the apicoplast membrane composition and opening up possibilities to tackle difficult questions about metabolite transport in the apicomplexans. The most intriguingly findings in this study are the identification of the pair of MCTs AMT1 and AMT2, which are likely derived from the putative host cell that engulfed a red algal during the evolution of this group of parasites. Metabolic analysis together with other phenotypic analyses supported the notion that the pair of AMTs is associated with the MEP and FASII biosynthesis pathways. However, though both transporters belong to the MCTs, the phenotypic defects differ greatly, supporting a complex function for AMT2 in the apicoplast, however, the substrates transported by the AMTs still await further clarification. Collectively, the MCTs are likely to control similar essential processes in related protists, especially in other members of this phylum of deadly parasites.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>This study has begun to look into the possibly evolutional origins of newly identified transporters although, as yet, observations are preliminary and await further analysis to clarify specific questions, as demonstrated in the detailed evolutionary analysis of chloroplast transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karkar et al., 2015</xref>). Our further analysis on the phenotypes of two of these transporters, AMT1 and AMT2, using parasites depleted with these activities, demonstrates differing degrees of defects at critical points in the parasite’s physiology and metabolism. We also observed similar phenotypes reflecting decreased levels of the MEP biosynthesis activity upon depletion of AMT1 and AMT2, indicating that phenotypic outcomes did not result from apicoplast abnormality, since other phenotypic outcomes were more severe in the AMT2-depleted parasites. We predict, therefore, that the metabolic defects possibly result from a reduced supply of substrates by each of the transporter. It is noteworthy that other studies provided us with comparable knowledge in phenotypes in TPC- and APT1-depleted parasites. In these parasites, metabolic defects in the apicoplast pathways were observed by indirect measurements as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2021</xref>). However, these phenotypes were possibly caused by pleiotropic effects of apicoplast loss, since they were analyzed by a comparably slow inactivation system to deplete the transporters of TPC and APT1 (with an induction of at least 3–4 days). Nevertheless, in our case with a highly efficient inactivation system, we still cannot exclude the effect of apicoplast loss on phenotypic results caused by depletion of the AMTs. Therefore, a more precise understanding of the functions of the AMTs will require further identification of the topology, protein interactions and substrate transport capability in the complex configuration of the apicoplast membranes. Our work, as yet, unsuccessful, in attempting to use a pyruvate sensor and/or a heterologous expression the AMTs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, is the first attempt to examine the transport capability of pyruvate by AMT1 and AMT2. Thereafter, the application of more sophisticated approaches, such as <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, an improved <italic>E. coli</italic> system, or a yeast expression system, may enable us to tackle the important question of substrate transport by AMT1 and AMT2. Future progress in this direction will thus shed critical insights into the discrepancies in parasite growth that we observe when comparing cell culture versus infections in mice.</p></sec></sec><sec

Viruses were collected and mixed with polybrene in a 12-well plate well containing 30–50% confluent HFF-1 cell monolayers. After 24 hr of post-transduction, the cell monolayers were re-seeded with incubation of puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) for 3 days. The cell monolayers were then maintained and expanded in D5 media. The TIR1 and AID lines were grown in the cell monolayers with IAA, 10 μM LHVS and 12.5 μM atorvastatin for 12, 24, or 36 hr. LHVS inhibits cysteine protease CPL to accumulate GFP derived from host cell cytosol, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dou et al., 2014</xref>), Atorvastatin can inhibit synthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) in host cells, to decrease the supply of FPP and GGPP from the host cells to the parasites. In parallel, TIR1 was grown in the host cells with 10 μM LHVS, 0.3 μM zoledronic acid, and 12.5 μM atorvastatin, serving as a positive control to observe defects in GFP transport by decreasing protein prenylation in parasites. The addition of atorvastatin and zoledronic acid could specifically inhibit the FPP and GGPP supply both in host cells and parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2013</xref>), thus inhibiting GFP transport to the VAC in parasites, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>. Purified parasites were adhered onto poly-lysine-coated coverslips, followed with fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min.

Although it is clear metabolite exchange between the parasite cytosol and the apicoplast must occur, very few transporters associated with the apicoplast have been identified. The current study combines data from previous studies with new data from biotin proximity labeling to identify new apicoplast resident proteins including two putative monocarboxylate transporters termed MCT1 and MCT2. The authors conduct a thorough molecular phylogenetic analysis of the newly identified apicoplast proteins and they provide compelling evidence that MCT1 and MCT2 are necessary for normal growth and plaque formation in vitro along with maintenance of the apicoplast itself. They also provide indirect evidence for a possible need for these transporters in isoprenoid biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis within the apicoplast. Finally, mouse infection experiments suggest that MCT1 and MCT2 are required for normal virulence, with MCT2 completely lacking at the administered dose. Overall, this study is generally of high quality, includes extensive quantitative data, and significantly advances the field by identifying several novel apicoplast proteins together with establishing a critical role for two putative transporters in the parasite. The study, however, could be further strengthened by addressing the following aspects:</p><p>Main comments:</p><p>1. The conclusion that condition depletion of AMT1 and/or AMT2 affects apicoplast synthesis of IPP is only supported by indirect measurements (effects on host GFP uptake or trafficking, possibly due to effects on IPP dependent proteins such as rabs, and mitochondrial membrane potential, possibly due to effects on IPP dependent ubiquinone). This conclusion would be more strongly supported by directly measuring levels of IPP. If their or technical limitations that prevent direct measurement of IPP then the author should note such limitations and acknowledge in the discussion that the conclusion is based on indirect evidence.</p><p>2. The conclusion that condition depletion of AMT1 and/or AMT2 affects apicoplast synthesis of fatty acids is also poorly supported by the data. The authors do not distinguish between the lower fatty acid levels being due to reduced synthesis of fatty acids, reduced salvage of host fatty acids, or both. Indeed, the authors provide evidence that parasite endocytosis of GFP is dependent on AMT1 and AMT2. Host GFP likely enters the parasite within a membrane bound vesicle derived from the PVM. The PVM is known to harbor host-derived lipids. Hence, it is possible that some of the decrease in fatty acid levels could be due to reduced lipid salvage from the host. Experiments should be conducted to measure the synthesis and salvage of fatty acids (e.g., by metabolic flux analysis), or the authors should acknowledge that both could be affected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88866.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study Hui Dong et al. identified and characterized two transporters of the monocarboxylate family, which they called Apcimplexan monocarboxylate 1 and 2 (AMC1/2) that the authors suggest are involved in the trafficking of metabolites in the non-photosynthetic plastid (apicoplast) of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (the parasitic agent of human toxoplasmosis) to maintain parasite survival. To do so they first identified novel apicoplast transporters by conducting proximity-dependent protein labeling (TurboID), using the sole known apicoplast transporter (TgAPT) as a bait. They chose two out of the three MFS transporters identified by their screen based and protein sequence similarity and confirmed apicoplast localisation. They generated inducible knock down parasite strains for both AMC1 and AMC2, and confirmed that both transporters are essential for parasite intracellular survival, replication, and for the proper activity of key apicoplast pathways requiring pyruvate as carbon sources (FASII and MEP/DOXP). Then they show that deletion of each protein induces a loss of the apicoplast, more marked for AMC2 and affects its morphology both at its four surrounding membranes level and accumulation of material in the apicoplast stroma. The authors attempted to decipher the function of the transporters on metabolic functions of the apicoplast: (a) notably for IPP synthesis through the assessment of vesicle import allowed by IPP-based anchors, which was found to be affected in the mutants, as well as (b) apicoplast fatty acid synthesis by indirect assessment of vesicle import. However, none of them directly concluded on the actual function of the transporters. Furthermore heterologous complementation in bacterial system also failed to demonstrate the transporters' function.</p><p>However, this study is very timely, as the apicoplast holds several important metabolic functions (FASII, IPP, LPA, Heme, Fe-S clusters...), which have been revealed and studied in depth but no further respective transporter have been identified thus far. hence, new studies that could reveal how the apicoplast can acquire and deliver all the key metabolites it deals with, will have strong impact for the parasitology community as well as for the plastid evolution communities. The current study is well initiated with appropriate approaches to identify two new putatively important apicoplast transporters, and showing how essential those are for parasite intracellular development and survival. However, in its current state, this is all the study provides at this point (i.e. essential apicoplast transporters disrupting apicoplast integrity, and indirectly its major functions, FASII and IPP, as any essential apicoplast protein disruption does). The study fails to deliver further message or function regarding AMC1 and 2, and thus validate their study. Currently the manuscript just describes how AMC1/2 deletion impacts parasite survival without answering the key question about them: what do they transport. The authors yet have to perform key experiments that would reveal their metabolic function. Ideally the authors would work further and determine the function of AMC1 and 2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88866.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jiong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sun Yat-sen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Guangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Wen-Bin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanxi Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taigu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>De-Hua</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sun Yat-sen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Guangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Hui-Yong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Rui-Bin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Washington University in St. Louis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">St Louis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hide</surname><given-names>Geoff</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Salford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Salford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lun</surname><given-names>Zhao-Rong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sun Yat-sen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Guangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Xing-Quan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lanzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Shaojun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic vestigial chloroplast, is a key metabolic organelle for the synthesis of certain lipids in apicomplexan parasites.

To address the detailed function of the transporters, in the past three months, we have re-constructed plasmids (with codon-optimized DNA sequences of the genes) for expression of the transporters in a regular expression <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (BL21DE3) and in a pyruvate import knockout <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (a gift from Prof. Kirsten Jung), to examine the transport capability in vitro. And, we have also re-constructed a new plasmid containing a new leading peptide for targeting the pyruvate sensor PyronicSF to the apicoplast in the parasite, to probe the possible substrate pyruvate. However, we did not successfully observe expression of the transporters in the above <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, and we were unable to target the sensor to the correct localization (the apicoplast) in the parasite. As a result, all efforts have led the study to the current version of manuscript on the functional identification of transporters. We will keep working on this aspect, attempting to dissect out the exact transport function of the transporters in the future. In the current manuscript, we have discussed the limitations of our study in the last part of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Main comments</p><p>1.

If there are technical limitations that prevent direct measurement of IPP then the author should note such limitations and acknowledge in the discussion that the conclusion is based on indirect evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer very much for the suggestions. We have tried to establish the measurement of IPP using a commercial company in recent months, yet we have not been successful in making the assay work. Considering the problem of indirect evidence, we have discussed this limitation in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The conclusion that condition depletion of AMT1 and/or AMT2 affects apicoplast synthesis of fatty acids is also poorly supported by the data. The authors do not distinguish between the lower fatty acid levels being due to reduced synthesis of fatty acids, reduced salvage of host fatty acids, or both. Indeed, the authors provide evidence that parasite endocytosis of GFP is dependent on AMT1 and AMT2. Host GFP likely enters the parasite within a membrane bound vesicle derived from the PVM. The PVM is known to harbor host-derived lipids. Hence, it is possible that some of the decrease in fatty acid levels could be due to reduced lipid salvage from the host. Experiments should be conducted to measure the synthesis and salvage of fatty acids (e.g., by metabolic flux analysis), or the authors should acknowledge that both could be affected.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer very much for comments and suggestions. We partially agree with the comments that the depletion of transporters could affect lipids scavenged from the host cells, as endocytic vesicles are indeed derived from the parasite plasma membrane at the micropore and potentially from the host cell endo-membrane system, as demonstrated with the micropore endocytosis in our previous study (pmid: 36813769). Our latest study has addressed this by showing that the endocytic trafficking of GFP vesicles is regulated by prenylation of proteins (e.g. Rab1B and YKT6.1), depletion of which resulted in diffusion of GFP vesicles, but not disappearance of GFP vesicles in the parasites (pmid: 37548452), indicating that the vesicles (containing lipids) enter the parasites. In the current manuscript, the percentage of parasites containing GFP foci was significantly reduced in AMT1/AMT2-depleted parasites, and instead, parasites containing GFP diffusion appeared and the percentage was almost equal to the reduced level of parasites with GFP foci. These results suggested that endocytic vesicles (e.g. GFP vesicles) were continuously generated by the micropore in the parasites depleted with AMT1/AMT2, and that the vesicle trafficking was regulated by proteins modified by IPP derivatives that were derived from the apicoplast. Based on these observations, we considered that lipids in endocytic vesicles should not contribute to the reduced level of fatty acids and other lipids in parasites depleted with AMT1/AMT2. We have added in a short discussion concerning the fatty acids and lipids reduced in the parasites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study Hui Dong et al. identified and characterized two transporters of the monocarboxylate family, which they called Apcimplexan monocarboxylate 1 and 2 (AMC1/2) that the authors suggest are involved in the trafficking of metabolites in the non-photosynthetic plastid (apicoplast) of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (the parasitic agent of human toxoplasmosis) to maintain parasite survival. To do so they first identified novel apicoplast transporters by conducting proximity-dependent protein labeling (TurboID), using the sole known apicoplast transporter (TgAPT) as a bait. They chose two out of the three MFS transporters identified by their screen based and protein sequence similarity and confirmed apicoplast localisation. They generated inducible knock down parasite strains for both AMC1 and AMC2, and confirmed that both transporters are essential for parasite intracellular survival, replication, and for the proper activity of key apicoplast pathways requiring pyruvate as carbon sources (FASII and MEP/DOXP). Then they show that deletion of each protein induces a loss of the apicoplast, more marked for AMC2 and affects its morphology both at its four surrounding membranes level and accumulation of material in the apicoplast stroma. This study is very timely, as the apicoplast holds several important metabolic functions (FASII, IPP, LPA, Heme, Fe-S clusters...), which have been revealed and studied in depth but no further respective transporter have been identified thus far. hence, new studies that could reveal how the apicoplast can acquire and deliver all the key metabolites it deals with, will have strong impact for the parasitology community as well as for the plastid evolution communities. The current study is well initiated with appropriate approaches to identify two new putatively important apicoplast transporters, and showing how essential those are for parasite intracellular development and survival. However, in its current state, this is all the study provides at this point (i.e. essential apicoplast transporters disrupting apicoplast integrity, and indirectly its major functions, FASII and IPP, as any essential apicoplast protein disruption does). The study fails to deliver further message or function regarding AMC1 and 2, and thus validate their study. Currently, the manuscript just describes how AMC1/2 deletion impacts parasite survival without answering the key question about them: what do they transport? The authors yet have to perform key experiments that would reveal their metabolic function. I would thus recommend the authors work further and determine the function of AMC1 and 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank very much the reviewer for his/her positive evaluation of our work. To address the detailed function of the transporters, in the past three months, we have re-constructed plasmids (with codon-optimized DNA sequences of the genes) for expression of the transporters in a regular expression <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (BL21DE3) and in a pyruvate import knockout <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (a gift from Prof. Kirsten Jung), to examine the transport capability in vitro. And, we have re-constructed a new plasmid containing a new leading peptide for targeting the pyruvate sensor PyronicSF to the apicoplast in the parasite, to probe the possible substrate pyruvate. However, we were unable to successfully observe expression of the transporters in the above <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, and we were unable to target the sensor to the correct localization (the apicoplast) in the parasite. As a result, all these efforts have led the study to the current version of manuscript on the functional identification of transporters. We will keep working on this aspect, attempting to dissect out the exact transport function of the transporters in the near future. In this current manuscript, we have discussed the limitations of our study in the last part of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comments</p><p>Line 35: ...appears to have evolved...</p><p>Line 67: remove first comma</p><p>Line 105: thereafter or therefore?</p><p>Line 130: define ACP</p><p>Line 131: define TMD</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank very much the reviewer for the suggestions, and we have revised the points in the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: more information on APT1 would be helpful for readers to interpret the results from turboID e.g., consider showing an illustration showing, according to Karnataki et al 2007 that APT1 likely occupies all 4 membranes of the apicoplast.

We analyzed the localization information of APT1 in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, based on the studies as the reviewer proposed (Karnataki, et al., 2007; DeRocher et al., 2012). The HA tag at the C-terminus of APT1 was distributed at the four membranes of the apicoplast, indicating that the topology of APT1 might be difficult to be defined at the membranes. Considering this information, we felt hesitant to clearly describe the topology in a schematic diagram about the protein APT1. Nevertheless, the TurboID tagging at the C-terminus of APT1 was an excellent model for identification of potential transporters localized at membranes of the apicoplast. We have put more information about the topology of APT1 in the manuscript, thus providing a better understanding of the proteomic results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: add a space between &quot;T.&quot; and &quot;gondii&quot;</p><p>Figure 2: remove period between &quot;Fitness&quot; and &quot;scores&quot;</p><p>Figure 2: different fonts are used within the figure.

The introduction (and the study?) lacks information about other key functions of the apicoplast: heme synthesis, lysophosphatidic acid synthesis (using FASII products). The explanations about the roles of FASII/DOXP are partial and not fully citing important references: Krishnan et al. 2020, and Amiar et al. 2020 are also key to understanding how the role of FASII is metabolically flexible depending on nutrient content. A whole part on the fact that FASII is not only dispensible but can also become essential under metabolic adaptations conditions, are missing (Botté et al. 2013, Amiar et al. 2020, Primo et al. 2021). These novel important facets of parasite biology should be mentioned as well as directly linked to the author's topic. This is more minor but could bring new ideas to the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank very much the reviewer for the suggestions.
