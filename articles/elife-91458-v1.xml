The discovery of four classes of guanidine-sensing riboswitches and two pathways for guanidine degradation in bacteria hint at widespread sources of unconjugated guanidine in nature. So far, only three enzymes from a narrow range of bacteria and fungi have been shown to produce guanidine, with the ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE) as the most prominent example. Here, we show that a related class of Fe<sup>2+</sup>- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODD-C23) highly conserved among plants and algae catalyze the hydroxylation of homoarginine at the C6-position. Spontaneous decay of 6-hydroxyhomoarginine yields guanidine and 2-aminoadipate-6-semialdehyde. The latter can be reduced to pipecolate by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase but more likely is oxidized to aminoadipate by aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH7B <italic>in vivo</italic>. Arabidopsis has three 2-ODD-C23 isoforms, among which Din11 is unusual because it also accepted arginine as substrate, which was not the case for the other 2-ODD-C23 isoforms from Arabidopsis or other plants. In contrast to EFE, none of the three Arabidopsis enzymes produced ethylene. Guanidine contents were typically between 10 and 20 nmol*(g fresh weight)<sup>-1</sup> in Arabidopsis but increased to 100 or 300 nmol*(g fresh weight)<sup>-1</sup> after homoarginine feeding or treatment with Din11-inducing methyljasmonate, respectively. In 2-ODD-C23 triple mutants, the guanidine content was strongly reduced, whereas it increased in overexpression plants. We discuss the implications of the finding of widespread guanidine-producing enzymes in photosynthetic eukaryotes as a so far underestimated branch of the bio-geochemical nitrogen cycle and propose possible functions of natural guanidine production.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>guanidine</kwd><kwd>homoarginine</kwd><kwd>Fe<sup>2+</sup></kwd><kwd>2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase</kwd><kwd>aldehyde dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartig</surname><given-names>Jörg S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>2-Oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases from clade C23 are the major source of guanidine in plants and release guanidine from arginine or homoarginine by C5 or C6 hydroxylation, respectively.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitrogen availability is a limiting factor for productivity in many ecosystems and plants are the major contributors to assimilation of nitrogen into organic matter from inorganic precursors. The largest proportion of nitrogen is used in primary metabolism for the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and their precursors. Additionally, many secondary metabolites that serve for internal signaling, adaptation or interactions with other organisms are nitrogen-containing molecules. Guanidine, which exclusively occurs as the protonated guanidinium cation under physiological conditions, has been discovered as a degradation product of guanine and arginine under chemically harsh conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bénech and Kutscher, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strecker, 1861</xref>). Thirty-two years after its discovery in 1861, guanidine was detected in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schulze, 1893</xref>). However, guanidine has no known function in plants, and it is unclear to which extent and how plants can synthesize and metabolize this nitrogen-rich compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marsden et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, two enzymatic pathways for guanidine catabolism were recently discovered in bacteria and many bacteria express guanidine importers or exporters in response to externally supplied or internally produced guanidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Funck et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schneider et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Bacterial genes involved in guanidine metabolism are often regulated by members of four independent guanidine riboswitch classes, which may indicate an ancient evolutionary origin of guanidine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lenkeit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Salvail et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sherlock and Breaker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sherlock et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Only two enzymes are known to release guanidine from arginine in side reactions. The Ethylene Forming Enzyme (EFE) from <italic>Pseudomonas savastanoi</italic> converts 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) into ethylene and this activity depends on structural changes induced by binding of arginine to the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukuda et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). In a second reaction with roughly 50% turnover rate, EFE also catalyzes the hydroxylation of arginine at the C5 atom, yielding unstable 5-hydroxyarginine, which spontaneously decays to glutamate-5-semialdehyde (GSA) and guanidine. The arginine-4,5-desaturase NapI predominantly catalyzes desaturation of the C4-C5 bond but also produces a small proportion unstable 5-hydroxyarginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunham et al., 2018</xref>). Both enzymes belong to the class of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODD), which use molecular oxygen to catalyze a broad range of reactions typically involving an Fe<sup>IV</sup>-oxo-intermediate formed after the initial conversion of 2-OG to succinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farrow and Facchini, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hausinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herr and Hausinger, 2018</xref>). Other enzymes from this family, like VioC or OrfP, catalyze the hydroxylation of arginine at C3 or C3 and C4, respectively, without initiating guanidine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yin and Zabriskie, 2004</xref>). A third guanidine-producing enzyme, the guanylurea hydrolase GuuH from <italic>Pseudomonas mendocina</italic> strain GU, is from a different protein family and may have evolved recently to utilize guanylurea generated by metformin degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tassoulas et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In plants, the family of 2-ODDs has diversified immensely, and it has been divided into three subfamilies according to sequence similarity and the types of reactions that the respective enzymes catalyze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prescott and John, 1996</xref>). Subfamily A comprises RNA demethylases and related enzymes, subfamily B comprises prolyl-hydroxylases that function in posttranslational protein modification, and the largest subfamily C comprises enzymes that act in the synthesis or modification of plant hormones, pigments and other secondary metabolites. Besides the 2-ODDs with known enzymatic function, subfamily C also contains many proteins of unknown function. Among these, Arabidopsis Din11 (<underline>D</underline>ark-<underline>in</underline>duced11; At3g49620) has been identified because its expression was induced by prolonged dark treatment, which leads to C-starvation and the induction of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Magen et al., 2022</xref>). Din11 orthologs are encoded in the genomes of most analyzed plants and green algae, and Arabidopsis as well as many other <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> express three paralogs of this protein: Din11, At3g49630 and At3g50210, among which At3g50210 seems to be the most ancestral form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In rice, the single Din11 ortholog has been named 2-ODD33 and was reported to have weak melatonin-2-hydroxylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byeon and Back, 2015</xref>). Because the numbering of the 2-ODDs in rice does not reflect their phylogenetic relationship and the phylogenetic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawai et al., 2014</xref> used DOX as rather uncommon acronym for the 2-ODDs, we propose a hybrid nomenclature with 2-ODD followed by a denominator for the phylogenetic clade as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawai et al., 2014</xref>. According to this nomenclature, we propose 2-ODD-C23.1 as systematic name for At3g50210, 2-ODD-C23.2 for Din11 and 2-ODD-C23.3 for At3g49630.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogeny of the 2-ODD clade C23.</title><p>Excerpt of the gene tree for <italic>Din11</italic> from EnsemblPlants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plants.ensembl.org">https://plants.ensembl.org</ext-link>, accessed Feb. 2023).

No other homoarginine-metabolizing enzymes have so far been reported from plants.</p><p>Here, we describe the identification of plant 2-ODD-C23 isoforms as homoarginine-6-hydroxylases, which initiate the decay of 6-hydroxyhomoarginine to 2-aminoadipate-6-semialdehyde (AASA) and guanidine. Within the 2-ODD-C23 clade, we found Din11/2-ODD23.2 to be special because it accepted also arginine as substrate to produce 5-hydroxy-arginine. This finding identifies 2-ODD-C23s as the first eukaryotic enzymes that release free guanidine from conjugated precursors, an activity previously only known as side reaction of rare bacterial enzymes. AASA accumulation is toxic because it inactivates the enzyme cofactor pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) by adduct formation. Therefore, AASA is detoxified by oxidation to aminoadipate by ALDH7B4 (AASA-DH, At1g54100; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Končitíková et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Karnebeek et al., 2016</xref>).

We focused on the three 2-ODD-C23 isoforms from Arabidopsis (Din11/2-ODD-C23.2, At3g49630/2-ODD-C23.3 and At3g50210/2-ODD-C23.1) and the orthologs from rice and soybean, which are encoded by single-copy genes. We also included Ava5009 from <italic>Anabaena variabilis</italic> as representative of the most similar group of cyanobacterial 2-ODDs, although it is probably not orthologous to 2-ODD-C23 from plants and green algae. When we compared the annotation of Din11 with RNAseq data, we noticed that only very few RNAseq reads cover the 5′-end of the mRNA, whereas the coverage strongly increases 89 bp downstream of the predicted transcription start site, at a position 13 bp after the annotated start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A second ATG codon in the same reading frame is located 62 bp downstream of the major transcription start site. Comparison of the predicted protein sequences showed that the first 24 amino acids of the annotated Din11 (At3g49620.1, here termed Din11L) do not align with 2-ODD-C23 homologs from other plant species, whereas the variant starting with the second ATG codon (termed Din11s) aligns well over its entire length. Nevertheless, we were able to amplify the coding sequence of Din11L from Arabidopsis cDNA.</p><p>Of the three Arabidopsis 2-ODD-C23 isoforms, only the short variant of Din11 induced guanidine production (detected and quantified by LC-MS, see materials and methods section) when overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Guanidine production was stimulated by addition of arginine to the culture medium, whereas addition of 2-OG had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We speculated that the other 2-ODD-C23 isoforms might use a compound similar to arginine as substrate and supplemented the cultures with various other guanidine compounds known to occur in nature (methylguanidine, guanidinoacetate, guanidinopropionate, guanidinobutyrate, agmatine, homoarginine, taurocyamine).

Therefore, we wondered if AASA/P6C production by 2-ODD-C23 might serve a signaling rather than a metabolic function. As in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures, P5CR might convert AASA/P6C to pipecolate, which is the direct precursor for the mobile defense signal N-hydroxypipecolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zeier, 2021</xref>).

An alternative route for AASA/P6C metabolism would be oxidation of AASA to aminoadipate by an aldehyde dehydrogenase. For maize and pea, it was shown that ALDH7B has a high affinity for AASA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Končitíková et al., 2015</xref>).

For the cofactor NAD<sup>+</sup>, ALDH7B4 had a <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> of 324±17 µM, whereas the enzyme was almost inactive with NADP<sup>+</sup> as electron acceptor and neither was NADPH formation linear over time nor did it show a linear correlation with the amount of enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>).

P6C reduction to pipecolate suggests that the oxidative route is predominantly occurring under physiological conditions.

The aminoadipate content in Arabidopsis rosettes was also below the level for reliable quantification [1 nmol (g Fw)<sup>–1</sup>] but increased to almost 6 nmol (g Fw)<sup>–1</sup> in At3g50210:GFP-overexpression plants after supply of external homoarginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

All analyzed 2-ODD-C23 proteins mediated the hydroxylation of homoarginine at the C6 position, thereby inducing its decay to AASA and guanidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is in sharp contrast to <italic>P. savastanoi</italic> EFE, which was virtually inactive with homoarginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinez and Hausinger, 2016</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values for homoarginine hydroxylation by the plant enzymes were higher than the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> of <italic>P. savastanoi</italic> EFE for arginine (50 µM) and the A<sub>max</sub> values were intermediate between the values for ethylene formation (54 nmol s<sup>–1</sup> mg<sup>–1</sup>) and arginine hydroxylation (1.2 nmol s<sup>–1</sup> mg<sup>–1</sup>) reported for EFE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinez and Hausinger, 2016</xref>). Among the biochemically characterized plant 2-ODDs from class C, DMR6/S5H had a lower <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (5.1±1.4 µM) and a similar A<sub>max</sub> (5.9±1.1 nmol s<sup>–1</sup> mg<sup>–1</sup>) for salicylate hydroxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2017b</xref>). Din11, which is exclusively present in <italic>Brassicaceae</italic>, additionally accepted arginine as substrate. Although Din11 has a lower specific activity and a higher <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for the reaction with arginine, the low concentration of homoarginine in Arabidopsis may lead to a preferential hydroxylation of arginine by Din11. 2-ODD33, the 2-ODD-C23 ortholog from rice, was previously reported to have melatonin-2-hydroxylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byeon and Back, 2015</xref>). However, the reported rate of 2-hydroxymelatonin accumulation by purified, recombinant 2-ODD33 was 1000-fold lower than the hydroxylation of homoarginine in our experiments, indicating that homoarginine is the preferred substrate of 2-ODD-C23 enzymes.</p><p>The evolutionary origin of 2-ODD-C23 function is at present ambiguous. Loss of the gene in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> has previously led to the interpretation that these enzymes were specific to plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawai et al., 2014</xref>). However, putative orthologs of 2-ODD-C23 are present in other green algae, whereas the protein with the highest degree of similarity in the cyanobacterium <italic>Anabaena variabilis</italic> (Ava5009) did not have homoarginine-6-hydroxylase activity when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It is thus conceivable that the production of guanidine from homoarginine or arginine evolved in photosynthetic eukaryotes. The single-copy 2-ODD-C23 isoforms from rice and soybean accepted exclusively homoarginine as substrate, indicating that arginine hydroxylation by Arabidopsis Din11 derived from neofunctionalization after at least two duplication events in the <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Sequence alignments between bacterial and fungal EFEs and plant 2-ODDs did not reveal a close relationship between Din11 and EFE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating an independent evolution of arginine-5-hydroxylase activity in both enzymes.</p><p>The guanidine content was strongly reduced in mutant plants devoid of 2-ODD-C23 expression, indicating that 2-ODD-C23s are the major source of free guanidine in Arabidopsis. At3g50210 mediated the major part of the homoarginine-dependent guanidine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) which is consistent with the highest specific activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and the highest basal expression level of At3g50210 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, Din11 expression has the highest dynamic range and induction of Din11 by MeJA caused a strong increase in guanidine production, presumably from arginine as precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This increase was virtually absent in <italic>din11</italic> single mutants and the triple mutants, indicating that it was exclusively attributable to Din11 activity. Based on a basal guanidine content of 120 nmol (g dry weight)<sup>–1</sup> (equivalent to 7 ppm) in Arabidopsis and our observation that other plants have similar or even higher contents of guanidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), we estimated the global annual production of guanidine by plants. With a total annual biomass production of 5*10<sup>10</sup> t by land plants, this estimation yields an annual guanidine production of 3.5*10<sup>5</sup> t by plants, corresponding roughly to the 2.5-fold of the industrial production in 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Precision Reports, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Plants were shown to transport but barely metabolize guanidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marsden et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that nitrogen released as guanidine cannot be efficiently recycled by plants. Considering the often growth-limiting function of nitrogen for plants, this raises the question whether guanidine may serve as a defense or signaling compound. In soil, a greater proportion of bacteria contains genes for guanidine import and assimilation than among bacteria associated with human skin or the gut, which preferentially contain genes for guanidine exporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinn et al., 2021</xref>). Since bacteria differ in their responses to guanidine, it is possible that guanidine accumulation or even secretion is a way for plants to modulate their microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sharma et al., 2023</xref>). A similar function was proposed for hydroxyguanidine that was secreted by <italic>Pseudomonas canavaninivorans</italic> after degradation of plant-produced canavanine by a PLP-dependent canavanine-γ-lyase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hauth et al., 2022</xref>). Induction of Din11 expression and guanidine production by wounding and MeJA may also point to a function of guanidine in the defense against or repulsion of herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caarls et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffiths, 2020</xref>). Expression of Din11 was additionally induced in several mutants or after treatments that cause ROS accumulation, indicating that ROS may act as second messenger in the induction of Din11 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gadjev et al., 2006</xref>). Further studies will be required to determine the biological purpose of guanidine production from homoarginine or arginine by 2-ODD-C23 enzymes.</p><p>In addition or alternatively, the second reaction products of 2-ODD-C23s, AASA/P6C or GSA/P5C could represent physiologically functional products. GSA/P5C produced by cytosolic Din11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is most likely converted to proline by P5CR, which is a cytosolic enzyme in plants as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Funck et al., 2012</xref>). Thereby, the activity of Din11 may explain the observation that besides glutamate also arginine can serve as precursor for proline synthesis in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Frank, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Winter et al., 2015</xref>). So far, no combination of enzymes residing in the same compartment was known that could catalyze the conversion of arginine to proline without glutamate as intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trovato et al., 2019</xref>). However, the exclusive occurrence of Din11 orthologs in <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> indicates that this metabolic pathway is not common among plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The maximal guanidine concentration of 400 nmol (g Fw)<sup>–1</sup> observed in MeJA-treated Arabidopsis plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) argues against a major contribution to stress-induced proline accumulation, which typically reaches 5–10 µmol (g Fw)<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forlani et al., 2019</xref>). Besides the induction by MeJA, expression of Din11 was also induced by prolonged dark treatment, which led to its initial identification and naming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujiki et al., 2001</xref>). Prolonged dark treatment causes C-starvation in plants and results in the induction of autophagy to mobilize energy by breakdown of cellular components and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Magen et al., 2022</xref>). Degradation of homoarginine by 2-ODD-C23s is unlikely to be a relevant contribution to energy production during C-starvation because the observed homoarginine content was very low in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, degradation of arginine via Din11 to GSA/P5C and guanidine may serve to mobilize the C-skeleton of arginine without overloading the nitrogen metabolism. Degradation of arginine via arginase to ornithine and urea would result ultimately in glutamate and ammonia formation by glutamate dehydrogenase and urease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Winter et al., 2015</xref>). High ammonia concentrations are toxic for plants, especially when the energy or the enzymes to re-assimilate it into glutamine are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moreira et al., 2022</xref>). However, the extent of chlorophyll degradation was not different between WT plants, 2-ODD-C23 triple mutants and overexpressing plants, indicating that the efficiency of autophagy in remobilizing carbon and nitrogen does not depend on 2-ODD-C23 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We are not aware of any reports describing a function of homoarginine in plants except the storage and defense function in seeds of hyperaccumulating <italic>Lathyrus</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell, 1980</xref>). As we were not able to resolve homoarginine from methylarginine in our plant extracts, we can at present not interpret or explain the reduction of the content of the substance with m/z ratio 189 in both, 2-ODD-C23 overexpression plants and 2-ODD-C23 triple mutants.</p><p>AASA originating from the decay of 6-hydroxyhomoarginine can be converted to pipecolate by P5CR after spontaneous cyclisation to P6C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujii et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Struys et al., 2014</xref>). In this way, 2-ODD-C23s might contribute to the production of the mobile defense signal N-hydroxypipecolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zeier, 2021</xref>). However, the direct comparison of the kinetic properties of P5CR and ALDH7B4 suggested that oxidation of AASA to aminoadipate by ALDH7B4, which is a shared reaction with the lysine degradation pathway, is the main pathway under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arruda and Barreto, 2020</xref>). We did not find information about the rate of AASA-cyclisation to P6C or the equilibrium concentrations in plants. In human plasma from patients with ALDH7A1 defects, approximately equal concentrations of both compounds were detected after FMOC-derivatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xue et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with the kinetic properties of P5CR and ALDH7B4, no increase of the pipecolate content after feeding with external homoarginine was observed in Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the 2-ODD-C23 isoform At3g50210. Instead, a small increase in aminoadipate content was observed, indicating that AASA was indeed oxidized by ALDH7B4, but the rate of aminoadipate metabolism apparently exceeded the rate of synthesis by 2-ODD-C23 and ALDH7B4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> lacks a specific AASA-DH and consequently cyclisation to P6C followed by reduction to pipecolate by the constitutively expressed P5CR (proC) is the main route of homoarginine metabolism in 2-ODD-C23 expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In humans, homoarginine is formed from lysine and arginine by mitochondrial glycine amidinotransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choe et al., 2013</xref>). It is discussed that homoarginine interferes with NO production from arginine and thus might be an important regulator of NO signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koch et al., 2023</xref>). Plants seem to lack NO synthases that use arginine as substrate and do not have proteins with significant sequence similarity to glycine amidinotransferase, although a protein with similar activity has been isolated from <italic>Lathyrus sativus</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">León and Costa-Broseta, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Srivenugopal and Adiga, 1980</xref>). Thus, the biosynthesis and physiological function of homoarginine in plants will need to be addressed in future studies. In humans, the accumulation of AASA as consequence of mutations in ALDH7A1/Antiquitin, which is the ortholog of Arabidopsis ALDH7B4, leads to developmental retardation and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouchereau and Schiff, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brocker et al., 2013</xref>). The disease symptoms are caused by formation of adducts of AASA with PLP, thereby inactivating PLP-dependent enzymes. In plants, ALDH7B enzymes may similarly serve to detoxify AASA derived from homoarginine hydroxylation by 2-ODD-C23s or from lysine degradation by the bifunctional lysine-ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase (LKR/SDH, At4g33150) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arruda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goncalves-Butruille et al., 1996</xref>). Mutation of Arabidopsis ALDH7B4 was reported to increase drought and salt sensitivity, whereas the sensitivity to herbicides was not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gil-Monreal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kotchoni et al., 2006</xref>). In rice, mutation of ALDH7B6 reduced seed viability and caused the accumulation of pigments in the endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shin et al., 2009</xref>). Our analyses show that Arabidopsis ALDH7B4 has an even lower <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (11.9 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) for AASA than the previously analyzed orthologs from rice and pea (97 and 89 µM respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Končitíková et al., 2015</xref>). It remains to be determined if ALDH7B4 functions specifically to prevent AASA accumulation or if it additionally acts nonspecifically on a broad range of aldehydes and semialdehydes.</p><p>Overall, our characterization of plant 2-ODD-C23s as homoarginine-6-hydroxylases is to our knowledge the first description of eukaryotic enzymes that mediate the production of guanidine. Although homoarginine represents a low abundant metabolite of unknown function and origin in most analyzed plants, the large amount of plant biomass produced every year implies that substantial amounts of guanidine enter the biological nitrogen cycle via the action of 2-ODD-C23 enzymes. The second product of 6-hydroxyhomoarginine decay, AASA/P6C, was primarily fed into the lysine degradation pathway by ALDH7B. So far, Din11 from Arabidopsis was the only 2-ODD-C23 isoform that accepted also the abundant arginine as substrate, but its low expression level and low specific activity apparently prevented excessive diversion of arginine toward guanidine and proline production. Consistently, the reduced guanidine content was so far the only phenotypical difference that we detected in Arabidopsis mutants lacking all three 2-ODD-C23 isoforms. Although neither homoarginine nor guanidine are highly abundant metabolites in Arabidopsis, the observed differences in the triple mutants and overexpressor plants confirm that the 2-ODD-C23 isoforms can catalyze homoarginine hydroxylation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Induction of Din11 by prolonged dark treatment, wounding, and reactive oxygen species provides hints that guanidine, AASA, or GSA may function in defense responses or other biotic interactions. We speculate that plants use guanidine production to influence guanidine-sensing or guanidine-assimilating microbes and plan to test this hypothesis in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Din11 (At3g49620);
