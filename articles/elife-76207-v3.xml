bisphosphonate (N-BP). Although it is rare, BRONJ has caused apprehension among patients and healthcare providers and decreased acceptance of this antiresorptive drug class to treat osteoporosis and metastatic osteolysis. We report here a novel method to elucidate the pathological mechanism of BRONJ by the selective removal of legacy N-BP from the jawbone using an intra-oral application of hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP) formulated in liposome-based deformable nanoscale vesicles (DNV). After maxillary tooth extraction, zoledronate-treated mice developed delayed gingival wound closure, delayed tooth extraction socket healing and increased jawbone osteonecrosis consistent with human BRONJ lesions. Single cell RNA sequencing of mouse gingival cells revealed oral barrier immune dysregulation and unresolved proinflammatory reaction. HMDP-DNV topical applications to nascent mouse BRONJ lesions resulted in accelerated gingival wound closure and bone socket healing as well as attenuation of osteonecrosis development. The gingival single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated resolution of chronic inflammation by increased anti-inflammatory signature gene expression of lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. This study suggests that BRONJ pathology is related to N-BP levels in jawbones and demonstrates the potential of HMDP-DNV as an effective BRONJ therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bisphosphonate</kwd><kwd>osteonecrosis of the jaw</kwd><kwd>oral barrier inflammation</kwd><kwd>therapeutic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE022552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R44DE025524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ebetino</surname><given-names>Frank H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006004</institution-id><institution>Tohoku University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Leading young researcher overseas visit program fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okawa</surname><given-names>Hiroko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19J117670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kondo</surname><given-names>Takeru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C06RR014529</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BioVinc LLC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gift fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The targeted removal of legacy bisphosphonate from the jawbone by competitive equilibrium therapy not only elucidated the pathological mechanism of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) but also established a highly translatable therapeutic option for BRONJ.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) are prototypical antiresorptive agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ebetino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cremers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McKenna et al., 2020</xref>) initially marketed to prevent bone fractures and to treat osteopenia or osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black and Rosen, 2016</xref>). N-BPs have been widely prescribed for postmenopausal women who have a bone mineral density T score of −2.5 or less, a history of spine or hip fracture, or a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanis et al., 2007</xref>) indicating increased fracture risk. N-BP treatment with an increased dose and frequency is also given to patients with multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mhaskar et al., 2017</xref>) or metastatic cancers to bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Carrigan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldvaser and Amir, 2019</xref>) to address tumor-induced osteolysis, hypercalcemia, and bone pain. N-BPs are well tolerated, exhibit few side-effects, and have established clinical benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gordon, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In the 2000’s, cases of osteonecrosis in the jawbone (ONJ) emerged among a minority of patients with a history of N-BP treatment, usually occurring at a dental infection site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khan et al., 2015</xref>) or after dentoalveolar surgery such as a tooth extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marx, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ruggiero, 2009</xref>). Originally designated as ‘bisphosphonate-related ONJ’ (BRONJ), this syndrome has also proven to be associated with non-bisphosphonate antiresorptive agents such as denosumab, a humanized anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody and anti-angiogenesis drug. As a result, the American Association for Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) has proposed the term ‘Medication-related ONJ’ (MRONJ) reflecting the association of ONJ with a multiplicity of antiresorptive agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ruggiero et al., 2014</xref>). Incidents of MRONJ reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) peaked from the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2014 with approximately 30,000 cases during this period, among which BRONJ represented the major fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). The FAERS database may underreport incidents because of variations in provider’s perceptions of how severe an event needs to be to warrant submission of the event report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alatawi and Hansen, 2017</xref>). We present an alternative MRONJ estimation of approximately 23,511 new cases per year in the US (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Considering the long cure period, the cumulative MRONJ patient number may exceed this annual estimation; however, it is highly conceivable that MRONJ is a rare disease defined by the FDA’s orphan disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kempf et al., 2018</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Estimated MRONJ case numbers in the US based on MRONJ incidence for the major underlying diseases<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2"><sup>*</sup></xref>.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Underlying diseases</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">New cases in the US (Year)</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">MRONJ incidence</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Estimated MRONJ cases (Year)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2"><sup>*</sup></xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Multiple myeloma</td><td align="center" valign="top">34,920<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3"><sup>†</sup></xref></td><td align="center" valign="top">5.16% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rugani et al., 2016</xref>)</td><td align="center" valign="top">1,802</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Breast cancer</td><td align="center" valign="top">330,840<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn4"><sup>‡</sup></xref></td><td align="center" valign="top">2.09% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rugani et al., 2016</xref>)</td><td align="center" valign="top">6,915</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Prostate cancer</td><td align="center" valign="top">248,530<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3"><sup>†</sup></xref></td><td align="center" valign="top">3.80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rugani et al., 2016</xref>)</td><td align="center" valign="top">9,444</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Osteoporosis/Low bone mass</td><td align="center" valign="top">53,500,000<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn5"><sup>§</sup></xref></td><td align="center" valign="top">0.01% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khan et al., 2017</xref>)</td><td align="center" valign="top">5,350</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="3"><bold>Estimated annual incidents of MRONJ</bold></td><td align="center" valign="top">23,511</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>MRONJ: Medication-related osteonecrosis in the jawbone.</p></fn><fn id="table1fn2"><label>*</label><p>Based on an assumption that all these patients were treated by antiresorptive medications.</p></fn><fn id="table1fn3"><label>†</label><p>American Cancer Society.

The extent of a BRONJ lesion has been measured for the absolute or relative open wound area and the time taken for mucosa to completely cover necrotic tissue and exposed bone (‘cure period’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beth-Tasdogan et al., 2017</xref>). A multicenter case registry study reported either resolution (35%) or improvement (10%) in 207 evaluable BRONJ patients within the study period of 2 years with conservative treatments such as irrigation and antibiotic medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schiodt et al., 2018</xref>). However, 37% of patients did not respond to the conventional treatment and exhibited either progression or stable conditions. Although the reported case incident is small, long-lasting severe clinical symptoms of MRONJ in some patients have created apprehension among patients and healthcare providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jha et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) workshop on ‘Pathway to Prevention (P2P) for Osteoporotic Fracture’ in 2018 highlighted the acute need of research to mitigate serious adverse events such as MRONJ and atypical femur fracture to prevent the increasing threat of osteoporotic fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siu et al., 2019</xref>). The P2P workshop particularly highlighted the markedly decreased acceptance of antiresorptive medications by osteoporosis patients, despite the significant benefit of these drugs for this indication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van de Laarschot et al., 2020</xref>). The recent decline in N-BP prescription, reflecting diminished patient acceptance of these drugs, has been linked to a statistical rise in bone-related complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). Due to the long-lasting half-life of N-BPs once chemisorbed to bone, the discontinuation of N-BPs and switching to other antiresorptive medications may still pose a risk of developing BRONJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anagnostis et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore urgent to reduce the BRONJ risk associated with these otherwise effective medications for pathological osteolysis.</p><p>The mechanism of BRONJ is not yet fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). BRONJ exclusively occurs in the jawbone, which uniquely associated with the gingival oral barrier tissue with one of the most active barrier immunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moutsopoulos and Konkel, 2018</xref>). The presence of N-BP on the jawbone is shared by all BRONJ patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lo Faro et al., 2019</xref>) and it is conceivable that jawbone N-BP may uniquely interact with oral barrier immunity. The major challenge has been the difficulty in separating the systemic and oral effects of N-BP therapy, which has severely hindered the elucidation of the mechanisms of BRONJ.</p><p>N-BP chemisorption to bone results from its high affinity to hydroxyapatite (HAp), the mineral component of bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nancollas et al., 2006</xref>). Recent investigations in our laboratories revealed that pre-adsorbed N-BPs can be displaced from HAp by exposure to a second N-BP/BP in aqueous buffer both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hokugo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hokugo et al., 2019</xref>). This led us to envision a new experimental model based on the selective removal of pharmacologically active legacy N-BP locally from jawbone by intra-oral application of a second BP with low pharmacological potency (lpBP). Here, we describe a liposome-based deformable nanoscale vesicle (DNV) formulation for topical trans-oral mucosa delivery of an lpBP to the underlying jawbone, and report its effect in attenuating N-BP-induced oral lesions using a murine BRONJ model and the elucidation of the mechanism involved in this pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP, also known as hydroxymethylene bisphosphonate) was selected as the lpBP</title><p>N-BPs such as zoledronate (ZOL) act on osteoclasts by inhibiting farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), thus interfering with the mevalonate pathway and protein prenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Russell, 2007</xref>). The nitrogen-containing side chain of N-BPs, an essential pharmacophore in all potent N-BP antiresorptive drugs, is absent in HMDP which, however, retains an α-OH group together with two phosphonate groups, conferring high affinity to HAp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Synthetic apatite (carbonate apatite)-coated culture wells were pretreated with fluorescently tagged ZOL (FAM-ZOL: 10 µM). After thorough washing to remove non-chemisorbed FAM-ZOL, the wells were challenged by application of HMDP (10 µM in Milli-Q treated pure water: MQW). FAM-ZOL on the synthetic apatite was reduced by half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and the wash solution contained a signal of dissociated FAM-ZOL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

A single application of HMDP increased the pit area, albeit at no statistical significance. When HMDP was applied twice, the resorption pit size significantly increased and reached the level of ZOL-untreated blank wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Although the FAM-ZOL experiment suggested that ZOL would not completely be removed after two applications of HMDP, osteoclastic activity was restored to a nearly normal level as ZOL-untreated control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We postulate that there may be a threshold bioavailable concentration of N-BP causing osteoclast abnormality. Therefore, our goal is not to be complete removal of legacy N-BP from the jawbone, but rather to decrease the local N-BP concentration below a BRONJ-triggering threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Preparation of the HMDP-deformable nanoscale vesicle (DNV) formulation</title><p>In our previous proof-of-concept experiment, HMDP directly injected into mouse palatal gingiva in ZOL-pretreated mice prior to the maxillary first molar extraction was shown to prevent the development of BRONJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hokugo et al., 2019</xref>).

The present study demonstrated the oral barrier inflammation of ZOL-pretreated mice, which was densely localized adjacent to the alveolar bone surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

It is also possible that HMDP-DNV treatment facilitated the necrotic bone sequestration between 2 weeks and 4 weeks after tooth extraction.</p><p>Recently, osteoclasts have been found to maintain the ability to secrete a set of anti-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drissi and Sanjay, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tseng et al., 2015</xref>). N-BPs such as ZOL altered osteoclasts to increase the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tseng et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, osteoclasts are found to be an efficient feeder cells supporting natural killer cells in an ex vivo system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>). A cluster of osteoclasts induced by dentoalveolar infection and surgery may play a critical role in supporting and regulating the oral barrier immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsukasaki et al., 2018</xref>). Denosumab has been used in the same indications as N-BP through a different pharmacological mechanism; but denosumab-related ONJ (DRONJ) demonstrated similar clinical and radiographic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boquete-Castro et al., 2016</xref>). We postulate that the lack of viable osteoclasts as a local immune coordinator may cause the dysregulation of oral barrier immunity leading to the development of BRONJ and DRONJ.</p><p>It must be noted that not all patients exposed to antiresorptive medications develop MRONJ. In fact, its incidence is quite small. Therefore, other confounding factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of MRONJ. Clinical case studies proposed an increased risk of BRONJ in patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujieda et al., 2020</xref>), autoimmune hepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Boer et al., 2012</xref>), and Sjogren syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kuo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liao et al., 2019</xref>). N-BP-treated rodent models combined with experimental rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Molon et al., 2016</xref>) or concurrent dexamethasone treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inoue et al., 2021</xref>) developed exacerbated BRONJ lesion supporting the susceptibility of compromised systemic immunity. However, a study of larger BRONJ cohort did not show a clear relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lescaille et al., 2013</xref>). Autoimmune diseases are often treated with immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids, which might affect the susceptibility of BRONJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Preidl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schwaneck et al., 2020</xref>). Glucocorticoids are widely used in combination therapies for multiple myeloma and breast cancer involving use of N-BP and other antiresorptive drugs which are implicated in MRONJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inoue et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The systemic and local confounding factors certainly play a significant role in the disease severity of BRONJ. However, the present studies of topical oral administration of HMDP-DNV demonstrated that targeted removal of ZOL from the jawbone was the single most effective therapy to prevent and accelerate the resolution of BRONJ. We further underline that the local intra-oral application of HMDP-DNV did not affect the distant skeletal system and thus the pathological mechanism of BRONJ is likely localized within the oral tissue. These observations support our hypothesis that being above the threshold dose level of oral N-BP holds the critical key for the pathological mechanism to develop BRONJ. Finally, the work reported here establishes the basis for the development of this novel treatment as an effective prophylactic and therapeutic method for ZOL-induced BRONJ, and possibly for BRONJ associated with other N-BPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemical reagents</title><p>ZOL was acquired from UCLA Medical Center Pharmacy (Reclast, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland).

Briefly, cationic DOTAP lipid with DPPC and CH were dissolved in a 10 mM chloroform solution at a 5:3:2 volume ratio and the mixture was allowed to dryness. The dried lipid mixture was resuspended in isopropyl alcohol (final concentration 10 mM). To this solution, Span80 (15% v/v) was added. In the case of non-deformable DNV (nDNV), Span80 was not added. The lipid solution was filtered (0.2 µm) before injection in the reactor.</p><p>The aqueous solution was comprised of deionized water and the BP compound (12.9 µM) and filtered (0.2 µm). The organic and aqueous solutions were used for DNV synthesis using microfluidics reactor (Syrris, Royston, UK) with a 26 µL reactor chip at 1000 µL/min organic stream and 5000 µL/min aqueous stream, followed by dialysis to remove the non-encapsulated BP compound and free lipids and then freeze-dry processes.

An aliquot of the lyophilized AF647-ZOL-DNV or AF647-ZOL-nDNV was lysed by adding acetonitrile (ACN). Next, samples were shaken for half an hour, then 350 μL of water was added to solubilize the compounds and samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 22,000×g. The supernatant was collected for HPLC. A standard curve was created using the original 12.9 µM stock solution of each of the compounds by HPLC for AF647-ZOL-DNV. Using the equation for the line of best fit for the signals received, we inputted the average signal given by the samples post-dialysis to obtain their concentration.

The mixture was vortexed for 3 mins and sonicated for 20 mins to break the DNVs. This sequence was repeated once. Next, 2 mL LCMS grade water was added to each vial and the mixture was vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 mins. Following the centrifugation, 1.5 mL of the supernatant was collected and separated from the pellet. A 5 μg/mL HMDP stock solution was prepared from the supernatant using maximum theoretical encapsulation value of 100 μg/vial. From the stock, 200 µL, 100 µL, and 40 µL corresponding to 1000 ng, 500 ng, and 200 ng HMDP respectively, were added to 1-dram glass vials. To each vial was added 200 µL of 500 ng/mL etidronate disodium solution as internal standard (IS). The samples were lyophilized. 500 µL trimethyl orthoacetate (TMOA) and 150 µL acetic acid was added to the lyophilized samples, and the mixture was heated at 100°C for 1 hr for derivatization. The solvents were evaporated under a stream of air. The residue was dissolved in 1 mL LCMS water. The samples were filtered, transferred to 1 mL HPLC vials, and the HMDP content was analyzed using LCMS. For generating standard curve, standard solutions were prepared by adding known concentrations of HMDP to 1-dram glass vials along with 200 µL of 500 ng/mL etidronate disodium as IS. The solutions were lyophilized, derivatized, and processed as mentioned above.</p><p>The LCMS system consisted of Waters Aquity H-class UPLC coupled with Waters Xevo G2-XS QTOF equipped with Masslynx 4.2 software (Waters, Massachusetts, USA). Chromatography was performed on Syncronis C18 Column (2.1×50 mm, particle size 1.7 μm, Thermo Scientific) using water (mobile phase A) and ACN (mobile phase B) at 30 °C and 0.4 mL/min. The chromatography gradient was 0–0.3 mins (0% B), 0.3–0.8 mins (0–100% B), 0.8–1.6 mins (100% B), 1.6–2 mins (100–0% B), and 2–3.5 mins (0% B). The QTOF was operated in positive ion mode monitoring <italic>m/z</italic> transitions for methylated derivates of HMDP (313-&gt;161) and etidronate (327-&gt;267). Measurements of at least three different concentrations with 3×–5× replicating tests at each concentration were performed, and the final EE value is calculated as the average value of these tests. Using the theoretical concentration of the samples after synthesis, we were able to calculate the encapsulation efficiency of the liposomes as 23%, which was verified (+/-5%) by direct analysis of the unmodified HMDP-DNV formulation by a <sup>31</sup>P NMR method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Estimation of HMDP content in HMDP-DNV by <sup>31</sup>P NMR</title><p>To verify the HMDP content of HMDP-DNV, we conducted an independent analysis based on <sup>31</sup>P NMR.

By this method, the final EE value for HMDP-DNV averaged to 23% which corresponds to a concentration of 3.0 µM for HMDP encapsulated by the liposome. Unlike the LCMS-based approach, <sup>31</sup>P NMR analysis does not require chemical derivatization of the HMDP. Thus, an aliquot of the HMDP-DNV formulation was used directly as the sample. The average integration of the <sup>31</sup>P NMR signal for an accurately weighed sample of HMDP in D<sub>2</sub>O was determined relative to the signal of an external reference of known concentration (analytically pure MDP [methylenebisphosphonic acid, disodium salt]). The same system was then used to determine the concentration of HMDP in the HMDP-DNV formulation, in D<sub>2</sub>O. The value obtained by the latter method was 2.7 µM, which agreed within error with the value of 3.0 µM from the LCMS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Topical drug application to the mouse palatal mucosa and AF647-ZOL-DNV delivery to the jawbone</title><p>We designed a topical application protocol for delivery of BP-DNV to the maxillary jawbone through palatal mucosa. Mouse oral appliances were fabricated using clear orthodontic dental resin to fit to the entire mouse palatal mucosa surface between the molar teeth. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and placed on a surgical bed to open the mandible. Threeµl of AF647-ZOL-DNV or AF647-ZOL-nDNV reconstituted in MQW or 20% polyethylene glycol solution was pipetted to the palatal mucosa and covered by an oral appliance. The mandible was closed with a bite block and the animal was placed in the anesthesia chamber. Mice were kept anesthetized for 1 hr and the oral appliance was then removed. After 24–48 hr, mouse maxillae were harvested and the AF647 fluorescent signal was measured by an imaging reader (LAS-3000, Fujifilm Corp, Tokyo, Japan). While AF647-ZOL-DNV assisted the trans-oral epithelial delivery, some AF647-ZOL-DNV appeared to be disintegrated in the oral cavity and the released AF647-ZOL was adsorbed to the exposed tooth surface or the enamel structure. Thus, we set the region of interest (ROI) only on the palatal bone excluding the tooth structure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Induction and characterization of BRONJ lesion in the mouse model</title><p>Female C57Bl/6J mice (8–10 weeks of age) received a bolus intravenous injection of ZOL (500 µg/kg in saline solution) or vehicle saline solution from the retro-orbital venous plexus.

The ONJ-related exposed bone is a chronic manifestation of antiresorptive medication. In clinical studies, as the authors mentioned, the efficacy of treatments to treat BRONJ related oral wounds takes a long time, even years.</p><p>– The authors justified the evaluation of the HMDP-DNV treatment for only 2 wks based on the experience that providing a soft diet post-extraction contributes to the oral wound's healing process; however, as it is well-established, the uneventful wound healing (without infection) of the extraction socket in a rodent could take several weeks and even months to complete if bone healing is taken into account. Moreover, if we consider that N-BPs delay healing, an experiment that only investigates the model for two weeks is insufficient; therefore, it is likely that the model is investigating the effects on early healing but not BRONJ.</p><p>– Another limitation of the study is that it only tested a one-time point. If the treatment effect of HMDP-DNV, as the authors implied, were not to revitalize the necrotic bone but to remove the affected bone by normalizing the osteoclastic activity and halting further necrosis, earlier time points would be needed to substantiate these statements. In addition, to investigate BRONJ development and progression later time points would have been important.</p><p>– The authors stated that BRONJ is predominantly induced by the oral N-BP and suggested that HMDP-DNV is a possible effective therapy for BRONJ. Then, what would be the explanation that only 0.005 % and 1-5% of the patients taking osteoporosis or oncologic doses of N-BPs get BRONJ but not all of them?</p><p>– Since bisphosphonates' main effects inhibit osteoclast and bone resorption, it is surprising that osteoclasts and bone resorption were not quantitatively assessed in the alveolar bone tissues in the in vivo study.</p><p>– In the introduction, the authors presented an alternative MRONJ &quot;prevalence&quot; estimation of approximately 36,000 new cases per year (Table 1). They claimed that still considered within the FDA's orphan disease definition of under 200,000 annually. There are two possible issues with this sentence. First, the definition states 200,000 people, BUT the estimation is not per year but at a specific time. Second, it is incorrect to refer to prevalence. Prevalence is the proportion of people in a population with a particular disease or condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to call it incidence since it refers to &quot;new cases&quot; of disease in a population over a specific period.</p><p>– In the introduction, the authors claimed that HMDP-DNV topical applications to &quot;nascent mouse BRONJ lesions&quot; resulted in accelerated gingival wound closure and bone socket healing as well as attenuation of osteonecrosis development. This statement is inaccurate because the BRONJ lesion never developed in the HMDP-DNV treated group, according to the data presented at 2 wks. Therefore, it appears to be more a &quot;preventive approach.&quot; In order to make this statement, earlier time points would be required to substantiate the &quot;nascent BRONJ lesions&quot; developed in HMDP-DNV.</p><p>– Please add a reference for the FRAX score (line 62-64).</p><p>– Refs 5 and 9 are only for osteoporosis doses (lines 66-67) but not the oncologic dose in the abstract.</p><p>– Considering that BRONJ affects mature adults, why did the authors utilize 8-10 wks old mice? The wound healing is faster in younger than older mice as in humans.</p><p>– The quality of the gross photos in Figure 2E is poor. Therefore, it is highly recommended to replace them with better photos.</p><p>– Figures 2F and 2G show something that it is concerning. The photos intend to show the higher intensity of the AF647-ZOL-DNV signal after topical application. First, the photos of the controls show moderate red fluorescent background. Second, the photos for the different doses of AF647-ZOL-DNV show higher intensity but primarily in the calcified tissues of the teeth rather than in the maxillary bones. The signal intensity observed in maxillae appears to be the resultant irradiation from the molars rather than from the maxillary bone. In addition, the figure legend expresses that the signal is after the topical application. What does immediately after mean? Was it immediately after the application or after 2 wks post-extraction? The latter is an important issue that should be clarified.</p><p>– Figure 4B: the authors claim to depict an unhealed open wound. I interpret the images differently, with gingival coverage but over a depressed palatal surface, as expected in a healed wound. In my experience, the ulcerated mucosa looks very different. Were these lesions corroborated/validated with histopathology?</p><p>– The quality of MicroCT images in Figure 4E is poor. In addition, what are the white arrows depicting?</p><p>– What is the region of interest to measure the osteonecrosis depicted in Figure 4F? A description of the analyzed area should be included in the method. Furthermore, histologic photomicrographs supporting these findings would be a good addition.</p><p>– According to the study, HMDP-DNV has a high affinity for the hydroxyapatite but does not inhibit the FPPS and does not interfere with the mevalonate pathway and protein prenylation, as the active N-BPs like ZA. Though this is the mechanism to explain the rescue of bone resorption, what would be the mechanism that explains the effects of HMDP-DNV on the immune cells as presented in the single cell RNA sequencing data in Figures 5 and 6?</p><p>– Following up on the previous point, how to conceal that systemic treatment with N-BPs (e.g., ZA) has systemic effects on the immune system, but the HMDP-DNV treatment can locally modify the immune cell phenotype? Adaptive immune functions and inflammation are not just &quot;local&quot; events but involve systemic events, where lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophyls, etc are produced and activated at different organs, recirculate, and are homed at specific organs and tissues.</p><p>– In addition, the authors found that N-BP chemisorption to HAp was not permanent but rather a dynamic molecular equilibrium on the bone surface. However, It is unclear how a compound like HMDP-DNV could affect the inflammatory cells in the oral wound.</p><p>– BRONJ and DRONJ are clinically and histopathologically indistinguishable and share the same antiresorptive mechanism. Is the anti-RANKL antibody expected to induce the same effects to immune cell function as N-BPs?</p><p>– It is well-established clinically and preclinically that oral infection is a risk factor for BRONJ. However, this study never mentioned infection as part of the BRONJ pathogenesis. Indeed, most of the rodent models of BRONJ or DRONJ that involve tooth extraction without associated infection fail to develop the signature of the disease, which is necrotic exposed bone.</p><p>– Even though the dose of HMDP for Tc-99m HMDP administration for PET scan is 0.5 mg/mL but also considering that HMDP-DNV competitively displaces ZA from the hydroxyapatite in calcified tissues, would it be concerning for patients undergoing cancer and being treated with ZA to use 99mTc-HMDP PET/CT for diagnosis and follow-ups?</p><p>– In results, page 15, lines 296-298, the authors wrote: &quot;Histological evaluations of mouse tooth extraction wound showed delayed bone healing and epithelial hyperplasia leading to the exposure of jawbone in ZOL-treated mice consistent with BRONJ lesion in humans. However, the description of these findings is confusing since wound healing involves epithelial hyperplasia and wound coverage. Besides, Figure 5A does not show any difference in the oral/gingival epithelium, and the hyperplasia is not evident in the photo.</p><p>– In the IL-17F and FOXP3 graphs of Figure 5E, the symbols for the No treatment and HMDP-DNV mice groups cannot be distinguished. It would be helpful to modify these graphs to make the data more noticeable.</p><p>– The authors postulate that the lack of viable osteoclast as a local immune coordinator may cause the dysregulation of the oral barrier immunity, leading to BRONJ and DRONJ. Moreover, the jawbone N-BP appears to reduce oral osteoclast adversely. However, the study does not show any osteoclast quantification. Furthermore, this is the opposite of most clinical and preclinical studies showing that osteoclast number does not change or even increase in individuals treated with bisphosphonates…</p><p>There are a few problems with this. First, it is known that the treatment does not reduce the number of osteoclasts. Indeed, clinical and preclinical studies have shown that, in contrast, osteoclast number does not change or is even increased, though the cells are sometimes detached from the bone surfaces.</p><p>– There is no information in the Methods about the number of mice per group in the BRONJ modeling experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76207.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A minor weakness is that BRONJ can occur clinically in the setting of suppressed inflammation with the use of glucocorticoids- arguing against a purely pro-inflammatory mechanism.</p><p>Given that BRONJ usually happens in the setting of high frequency doses of BPs, the authors could assess whether HMDP-DNV displacement works in that setting too, which is probably the most clinically relevant one.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out, glucocorticoids are widely used as combination therapies for multiple myeloma and breast cancer with the use of N-BP and other chemotherapy. Since their discovery in 1940s, glucocorticoids are prescribed as anti-inflammatory agent and the mechanism of action is mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor. Because the glucocorticoid receptors are expressed by many different cells, there is considerable heterogeneity in therapeutic effects. Although glucocorticoids exhibit anti-inflammatory effect, studies reported that glucocorticoid treatment could exacerbate the peripheral immune response and increase the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Furthermore, glucocorticoids may directly interact with osteocytes and induce apoptosis causing nontraumatic osteonecrosis.</p><p>While the pathological role of glucocorticoids has not been fully established, concomitant glucocorticoid medication with N-BP has been postulated to contribute to the severity of BRONJ, possibly as an immunosuppression agent. Although it is beyond the current scope of our investigation, it will be important to address whether HMDP-DNV displacement would work in the clinically relevant polypharmacy condition. The Discussion section has been revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it would be interesting to note if there is evidence for pro-inflammatory signaling at other mucosal sites in the mice with BP treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important comment. We examined the gingival histology on the non-tooth extraction side. It was clearly observed that without the oral insult created by tooth extraction, gingival inflammation was not observed. The revised manuscript includes new Figure 5 reporting the unwounded jawbone.</p><p>Besides oral mucosa, it is well documented that N-BP has the gastrointestinal adverse effects such as erosions and ulcers in stomach and small intestine. The mechanism of gastrointestinal irritation is not well understood. However, N-BP taken by oral administration is though to directly interact with the phospholipids lining the luminal side of gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the mechanism appears to be distinct from BRONJ. This section was beyond the scope of the current study and was not included in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific concerns and suggestions for improvement are given below:</p><p>– A major weakness of this study is that it only investigates the effects of treatments 2 wks post-extraction.

We performed an additional experiment, in which the outcome of HMDP-DNV topical treatment to the tooth extraction wound of ZOL-injected mice was obtained after 4 weeks of the tooth extraction. In addition to the reported effect of HMDP-DNV at 2 weeks after tooth extraction, this additional experiment addressed (1) the longer study period and (2) more than one time point for treatment assessment.</p><p>The complete tooth extraction socket wound healing was reported to occur in 21 days (3 weeks) in mice and 12-24 weeks in humans. Therefore, the additional experiment of 4 weeks in mice should be equivalent to 16-32 weeks (3-8 months) in humans. The new experiment revealed that the HMDP-DNV treatment normalized the tooth extraction wound healing of ZOL-treated mice at 2 weeks and 4 weeks of tooth extraction, whereas ZOL-treated mice without HMDP-DNV topical treatment sustained the abnormal tooth extraction wound healing. As such, new long-term data ensured the lasting treatment effect of HMDP-DNV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Another limitation of the study is that it only tested a one-time point.

In addition, to investigate BRONJ development and progression later time points would have been important.</p></disp-quote><p>We value this comment. In fact, the new data at 4 weeks after tooth extraction demonstrated a substantial bone removal from the affected alveolar bone, resulting in the decreased osteonecrosis area.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors stated that BRONJ is predominantly induced by the oral N-BP and suggested that HMDP-DNV is a possible effective therapy for BRONJ. Then, what would be the explanation that only 0.005 % and 1-5% of the patients taking osteoporosis or oncologic doses of N-BPs get BRONJ but not all of them?</p></disp-quote><p>The present study examined the pathological mechanism of BRONJ. As pointed out, not all patients exposed to N-BP develop BRONJ. In fact, the incidence of BRONJ is quite small. Therefore, other concurrent factors may be involved to cause BRONJ. In our mouse model, BRONJ-like lesion was observed only at the tooth extraction area and the contralateral unwounded side did not show any noticeable abnormality, suggesting that the dentoalveolar surgery played an important role in the mouse BRONJ lesion. A recent multicenter retrospective survey reported that dentoalveolar surgery and tooth extraction increased the risk of BRONJ.</p><p>N-BP adsorbed on bone mineral stays inactive until bone resorption by osteoclasts, which release N-BP from bone surface to the local environment. Tooth extraction induces not only bone remodeling in the bony socket but also unusual osteoclastogenesis on the external surface of alveolar bone. It is highly conceivable that osteoclasts on the alveolar bone surface could release N-BP to the oral environment. The present study demonstrated the oral barrier inflammation of ZOL-treated mice, which was densely localized adjacent to the alveolar bone surface. It has been reported that N-BP mediates M1 macrophage polarization and impairs neutrophil function. The single cell RNA sequencing analysis in the present study suggested the gene expression signature of proinflammatory myeloid cells, which was reversed to anti-inflammatory phenotypes by the HMDP-DNV treatment removing ZOL, suggesting that prolonged oral inflammation in the BRONJ lesion might be induced by released N-BP in the oral barrier tissue.</p><p>Separately, the present study demonstrated that osteoclasts on the alveolar bone surface in ZOL-treated mice were found to form abnormally shallow bone resorption lacunae, suggesting that osteoclasts internalized N-BP were likely to be inactivated. The HMDP-DNV treatment appeared to normalize the osteoclastic activity generating large resorption lacunae, resulting in the removal of necrotic bone at 4 weeks after tooth extraction. The resolution of BRONJ often occurs after the necrotic bone is sequestrated. It is tempting to speculate that bone sequestration might have occurred in HMDP-DNV treated mice between 2 weeks and 4 weeks of tooth extraction.</p><p>It must be noted that single treatment of HMDP-DNV did not prevent the development of BRONJ. Therefore, we postulate that there is a threshold of the bioavailable N-BP dose on the jawbone required to cause BRONJ. The repeated HMDP-DNV treatments may have decreased the ZOL dose levels below the threshold to induce BRONJ even with dentoalveolar surgery.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study suggests that the above threshold dose of N-BP adsorbed on the jawbone may constitute one of the critical factors. However, the pathological mechanism of BRONJ may involve multiple events, which may explain why not all patients with the history of N-BP treatment develop BRONJ. The Discussion section was revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Since bisphosphonates' main effects inhibit osteoclast and bone resorption, it is surprising that osteoclasts and bone resorption were not quantitatively assessed in the alveolar bone tissues in the in vivo study.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed an additional experiment. To determine bone resorption endpoints, we performed Immunohistochemical experiments using anti-Cathepsin K (Ctsk) antibody to clearly identify osteoclasts. We found that untreated jawbone of ZOL-treated mice showed deformed Ctsk-positive osteoclasts that were persistently observed until 4 weeks of tooth extraction healing. By contrast, the HMDP-DNV-treated jawbone of ZOL-treated mice showed normalized Ctsk-positive osteoclasts at the early wound healing period (2 weeks). At the long-term wound healing period (4 weeks), osteoclasts were not observed. New Figure 5 was created.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the introduction, the authors presented an alternative MRONJ &quot;prevalence&quot; estimation of approximately 36,000 new cases per year (Table 1). They claimed that still considered within the FDA's orphan disease definition of under 200,000 annually. There are two possible issues with this sentence. First, the definition states 200,000 people, BUT the estimation is not per year but at a specific time. Second, it is incorrect to refer to prevalence. Prevalence is the proportion of people in a population with a particular disease or condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to call it incidence since it refers to &quot;new cases&quot; of disease in a population over a specific period.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the “prevalence” to “incidence.” The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 defines a rare disease as a disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 people in the US. Considering a long cure period, the cumulative number of MRONJ patients may exceed this annual estimation; however, it is highly conceivable that MRONJ is a rare disease defined by the FDA’s rare disease.
