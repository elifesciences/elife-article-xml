auditory information from the brainstem to the thalamus. However, this study uncovers the multifaceted role of the IC in bridging auditory processing, sensory prediction, and reward prediction. Through extracellular recordings in monkeys engaged in a sound duration-based deviation detection task, we observed a 'climbing effect' in neuronal firing rates, indicative of an enhanced response over sound sequences linked to sensory prediction rather than reward anticipation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate reward prediction errors within the IC, highlighting its complex integration in auditory and reward processing. Further analysis revealed a direct correlation between IC neuronal activity and behavioral choices, suggesting its involvement in decision-making processes. This research highlights a more complex role for the IC than traditionally understood, showcasing its integral role in cognitive and sensory processing and emphasizing its importance in integrated brain functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inferior colliculus</kwd><kwd>sound duration</kwd><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>prediction error</kwd><kwd>reward behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>STI2030-Major Projects</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022ZD0204800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Xiongjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>STI2030-Major Projects</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022ZD0204600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Xiongjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32171044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Xiongjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32100827</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhai</surname><given-names>Yuying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inferior colliculus integrates auditory and cognitive functions, playing critical roles in sensory prediction, reward processing, and decision-making beyond its traditional role as a sensory relay.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain's architecture is a complex hierarchy, where functions become increasingly sophisticated from lower to higher levels. The cerebral cortex, for instance, is pivotal for higher-order cognitive functions such as decision-making, motivation, attention, learning, memory, problem-solving, and conceptual thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kremkow and Alonso, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miterko et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, subcortical sensory systems are traditionally viewed as mere conduits for sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sherman, 2016</xref>), despite suggestions of thalamic structures playing roles in advanced perceptual tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherman, 2005</xref>). Yet, the involvement of sensory neurons below the thalamo-cortical level in cognitive behaviors remains an underexplored domain. Within the auditory hierarchy, spanning seven stages from the cochlea to the auditory cortex (AC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pickles, 2015</xref>), the inferior colliculus (IC) emerges as a crucial intermediary, instrumental in processing spatial representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen and Knudsen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ono and Ito, 2015</xref>) and novelty detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malmierca et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pérez-González et al., 2005</xref>). Utilizing the oddball paradigm, researchers have identified stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) within the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayala et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duque and Malmierca, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malmierca et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Valdés-Baizabal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Valdés-Baizabal et al., 2017</xref>), where neurons decrease their response to frequently occurring sounds while maintaining robust reactions to deviant ones. This phenomenon, indicative of predictive coding, underscores the IC's relevance with sensory prediction. Exploration along the auditory pathway suggests SSA's origination from the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carbajal and Malmierca, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khouri and Nelken, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2023</xref>). Intriguingly, the dynamic interplay between sensory prediction and sensory encoding, particularly within lower sensory systems charged with the faithful representation of external stimuli, remains an underexplored yet captivating area of inquiry.</p><p>Traditionally viewed as a key player in auditory processing, the IC is situated in the auditory midbrain and serves as a vital conduit, channeling inputs from the brainstem's auditory nuclei towards the thalamocortical auditory pathway. Intriguingly, the IC is endowed with dopamine receptors and exhibits nerve terminals positive for tyrosine hydroxylase, signifying a channel for dopaminergic inputs originating from the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nevue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nevue et al., 2016</xref>). This positions the IC as a crucial intersection where auditory processing and reward mechanisms converge. Recent research underscores the significant influence of dopamine on modulating auditory responses within the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gittelman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoyt et al., 2019</xref>). This modulation suggests a complex interplay wherein dopamine has the potential to either suppress or enhance neural activity in the IC, depending on various factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gittelman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoyt et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies were conducted in rodents, and the existence and role of dopaminergic inputs and reward processing in the primate IC remain underexplored. This amalgamation of sensory and reward coding within the IC paves new paths for research, urging a deeper inquiry into how this midbrain entity integrates auditory and reward information to mold behavioral processes, thereby redefining the traditional auditory-centric view of the IC and opening avenues for understanding its multifaceted role in cognitive and sensory modulation.</p><p>In this research, we embarked on a deviation detection task centered around sound duration with trained monkeys, performing extracellular recordings in the IC. Our observations unveiled a 'climbing effect'—a progressive increase in firing rate after sound onset, not attributable to reward but seemingly linked to sensory experience such as sensory prediction. Moreover, we identified signals of reward prediction error and decision-making. These findings propose that the IC's role in auditory processing extends into the realm of complex perceptual and cognitive tasks, reshaping previous assumptions about its functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deviant response dynamics in duration deviation detection</title><p>Neurons within IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) are distinguished by their ability to sustain firing, illustrating a consistent encoding of sound duration through tonic firing throughout the entire auditory length in one example neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An analysis of 104 neurons (53 from Monkey B and 51 from Monkey J) demonstrated that these neurons maintained sustained firing responses to sounds of varying durations—100, 500, and 1000 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Monkeys were trained to perform a deviation detection task focusing on duration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> outline the behavioral task, presenting repetitive sounds in blocks with oddball stimuli. Each block consisted of 3–6 repeated white-noise bursts of 300 ms duration at 600 ms interstimulus intervals, concluding with either a standard sound (control condition) or a deviant sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Monkeys were required to press a button within 600 ms after the offset of the deviant stimulus to receive a water reward. Correct rejections occurred when the monkey refrained from pressing the button within 600 ms following a standard sound in control trials, where the deviant duration equaled the standard duration. The task difficulty was modulated by setting deviant durations at five levels: 300 (control), 357, 425, 506, and 600 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with the pressing ratio approaching zero in the control condition and increasing with the deviant duration, reaching 1 at the 600 ms deviant duration in one example session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>The initial analysis focused on the deviant response during correct trials, revealing that an example IC neuron exhibited continuous firing throughout the sound presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Following the transient peak response in the initial 0–60 ms window, the neuron's firing rate began to increase approximately 100 ms after the sound's onset, continuing until the sound's conclusion. This phenomenon, illustrated by aligning the responses to the sound's offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicated a proportional increase in firing rate with longer sound durations, suggesting a duration-dependent 'climbing effect'. To quantitatively assess this dynamic, the neuronal firing rate was examined across different sound durations within two distinct temporal windows: the 'onset window' (0–60 ms post-sound onset) and the 'late window' (−100–0 ms relative to sound offset). Notably, the firing rate of the example neuron in the late window escalated with increasing duration (p=6.51e-23, ANOVA with post-hoc test; red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), while remaining constant in the onset window (p=0.69, ANOVA with post-hoc test; black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), contrasting sharply with the non-behavior condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) which showed no climbing effect.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neuronal climbing effect in deviation detection behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) depicting example neuronal responses to different deviant sounds aligned to deviant onset (light gray, 300 ms deviant sound; gray, 357 ms deviant sound; black, 425 ms deviant sound; pink, 506 ms deviant sound; red, 600 ms deviant sound).

Sound durations were analyzed at three levels (100, 500, and 1000 ms for the non-behavior condition as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and five levels (300, 357, 425, 506, and 600 ms for the behavior condition, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In the same neuronal population (n=99), the firing rate increased after the transient peak response for the behavior situation (red line of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), while the firing rate stayed constant for the non-behavior condition from 100 ms to the end of the sound (blue line of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The 'Response Dynamic Index' (RDI) was introduced to quantify the climbing effect, calculated as the normalized difference between responses in the late window (−100–0 ms relative to the sound's offset) and the after-peak window (100–200 ms relative to the sound's onset). This comparative analysis indicated a significantly higher RDI in the behavior condition (p=4.40e-19, paired t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating the climbing effect's reliance on behavioral context. Additionally, RDIs across various deviant sounds showed strong correlations (p&lt;0.001, Pearson Correlation Analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and similar values across differing deviants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The same example neuron exhibited the climbing effect post-peak response to standard stimuli, which intensified as successive standard sounds progressed from the second to the seventh stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The firing rate markedly decreased from the first to the second sound in both the late window (p=3.33e-11, paired t-test, red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and onset window (p=2.02e-40, paired t-test, black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Interestingly, no climbing effect was noted in the late window for the first stimulus, and the effect amplified with each subsequent standard presentation.</p><p>To monitor the dynamic of the climbing effect across repetitive sound presentations, we analyzed responses to the 300 ms sound across the entire oddball block in population. We normalized the firing rate relative to the response to the first stimulus in the block, considering both the onset and late windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), to account for variability across the neuronal population. In the onset window, responses remained relatively stable from the second to the seventh sound (black line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Conversely, in the late window, responses ascended from the second to the fourth stimulus (ANOVA with post-hoc test: second versus fourth, p=8.29e-4, red line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and maintained a stable level from the fourth to the seventh stimulus (p=0.653, ANOVA with post-hoc test, red line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This pattern was mirrored in the peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), which consolidated responses from the second to the seventh stimulus in one scale (left ordinate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and the first stimulus in another scale (right ordinate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) for comparative purposes. Onset responses to the second through seventh stimuli completely overlapped, but responses in the late window diverged. The response profile remained flat in the late window for the first stimulus (black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating a minimal climbing effect. Remarkably, starting from the second stimulus, the climbing effect began to manifest and progressively intensified, with a notable increase observed from the second to the fourth stimulus. This effect appeared to stabilize and overlap in responses from the fourth to the seventh sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), illustrating the nuanced modulation of neuronal firing rates across successive sound presentations within the oddball sequence.

We demonstrated that the climbing effect is dynamically modulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>), and this modulation is driven primarily by sensory prediction rather than reward anticipation, as controlling for reward effects showed minimal impact on the response profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). This modulation by preceding sensory experiences indicates that the IC is more than merely a relay station, suggesting a more intricate role in auditory processing influenced by both ascending and descending neural pathways. The IC's extensive descending network of connections, including those from the AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajo and Moore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coleman and Clerici, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diamond et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">FitzPatrick and Imig, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winer et al., 2002</xref>), thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuwabara and Zook, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winer et al., 2002</xref>), and limbic system areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coleman and Clerici, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marsh et al., 2002</xref>), underscores its integration within broader sensory and cognitive processes, potentially underpinning the observed climbing effect.</p><p>The accumulation of the climbing effect across successive sound presentations appears to be intrinsically linked to the structure of oddball stimulation. Within the oddball paradigm, both sensory and reward predictions intensify alongside the recurrence of standard sounds, suggesting that the strength of these predictions could significantly influence neuronal responses. Our experimentation with rewards has effectively dismissed the role of reward prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), highlighting the potential significance of sensory prediction in molding the climbing effect. Historically, oddball stimuli have been a focal point for investigating novelty detection within the AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carbajal and Malmierca, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malmierca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhai et al., 2019</xref>), though many studies lacked incorporation of a relevant behavioral task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khouri and Nelken, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2023</xref>). Sensory prediction was indirectly assessed by contrasting predictive and non-predictive stimuli in control experiments, hence not addressing sensory prediction in a direct, real-time manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carbajal and Malmierca, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fishman and Steinschneider, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>). The progression of the climbing effect with successive sound presentations could potentially offer a direct and real-time perspective on the impact of sensory prediction. Notably, while the onset response remained consistent from the second through the seventh sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), significant dynamic changes in the late response window suggest a prolonged period is required for sensory prediction to exert its influence. Further research is required to explore the underlying neuronal mechanisms and functional significance of this dynamic change comprehensively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Decision related signal in IC</title><p>Having established how behavioral modulation affects responses in IC, we now delve into the relationship between IC responses and behavioral choices in a trial-by-trial analysis within a duration deviation detection task. This approach provides insight into the potential role of sensory neurons in perceptual tasks by comparing neural responses and perceptual decisions concurrently in the same subject. While numerous studies have explored this dynamic for cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>), the contribution of subcortical neurons to decision-making processes remains less understood. To our knowledge, this study offers the direct correlation between IC neuron activity and perceptual choice, observed in real-time during experiments with animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These correlations are crucial for understanding the mechanisms by which population encoding and decoding influence and direct behavior. Focusing on the deviation detection task—a ubiquitous aspect of sensory systems and an ongoing phenomenon in daily life—we employed an oddball paradigm with randomized presentations of standard sound numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) to simulate natural occurrences of deviant stimuli. This approach allowed us to closely examine both the behavioral responses of monkeys and the corresponding neuronal correlates in the IC.</p><p>When neural responses were grouped based on behavioral choices, the PSTHs diverged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating a strong correlation between neural firing variations and choice variations. Notably, within the overall population, the two PSTHs, sorted by the monkeys' choices, diverged before the end of the sound, converged after its end, and diverged once more prior to the movement decision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This pattern during the sensory encoding phase underscores a potential critical role for IC in managing duration-sensitive behaviors. Traditionally, decision signals are thought to be predominantly driven by top-down inputs, as evidenced by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cumming and Nienborg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nienborg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nienborg and Cumming, 2009</xref>). While the decision-related signal in the IC may derive from these top-down mechanisms, our findings also entertain the possibility that variations in IC neuronal activity could directly modulate higher brain areas, influencing behavioral outcomes. In either scenario, our findings clearly demonstrate the IC's significant involvement in cognitive processing, extending well beyond its traditional role as a mere auditory relay station.</p><p>Furthermore, neuronal responses to sound duration typically become more transient throughout the auditory pathway with neurons in the thalamus and cortex primarily showing onset responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Linden, 2011</xref>; deCharms and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">deCharms and Merzenich, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWeese et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Metzger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nevue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rauschecker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yasui et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhai et al., 2019</xref>). However, exceptions exist, as sustained neurons have been identified in the medial geniculate body (MGB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allon et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartlett and Wang, 2011</xref>) and the AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rauschecker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). In stark contrast, the majority of IC neurons exhibit sustained responses to prolonged sounds across various species, including frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ratnam and Feng, 1998</xref>), bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2008</xref>), and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pérez-González et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yin et al., 2008</xref>). Our examination of IC neurons in macaque monkeys revealed a similar sustained firing pattern in response to long-duration sounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), aligning with observations across diverse species. This evolutionary conservation of sustained response characteristics in the IC suggests its capacity to encode sound duration. However, the implications of this capability for behavior have remained uncertain. The present study offers direct evidence highlighting the significant role of the IC in decision-making processes related to duration perception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Reward effect and reward prediction error in IC</title><p>In addition to the role in sensory processing, another important finding in our study is the existence of a reward effect and a reward prediction error in the IC. The connection between the IC and the reward system is not very clear, but some studies have suggested that dopamine may play a role in modulating auditory processing in the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gittelman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoyt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nevue et al., 2015</xref>). Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the reward system and other functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoyt et al., 2019</xref>). Dopamine may have heterogeneous effects on the responses of many neurons in the IC, such as suppressing or enhancing neural activity, depending on various factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoyt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nevue et al., 2015</xref>). However, the exact mechanisms and functions of dopamine modulation in the IC are still not fully understood, particularly in primates. In this study, we first noticed that some auditory neurons responded to the reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>), but the reward modulation effect on auditory responses is slim in the awake monkey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>).</p><p>Like the response of the dopaminergic neurons in the reward system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hollerman and Schultz, 1998</xref>), the reward response of IC neurons displays prediction error signals, which were uncovered in two experiments. Firstly, during the experiment in which sound was followed by reward, the reward responses were significantly stronger in the initial 15 trials than in the final 15 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), as the reward is a surprise at the beginning while becoming a routine at the end. Secondly, during the deviation detection task, as the number of standard sounds was randomly chosen and the monkeys were not informed about the end of the stimulation in the control trials, the reward in such trials was not expected, but then a strong response was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). By contrast, during the deviant trials, the monkey pressed the button, expected a reward, and no reward response was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Collectively, these findings affirm the presence of reward prediction error signals in the IC, underscoring its sophisticated engagement in reward-related auditory processing dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Biological sample (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, male)</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Monkey J;Monkey B</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Hubei Topgene Biotechnology Co., Ltd.</td><td align="left" valign="middle"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.topgenebio.com">http://en.topgenebio.com</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="middle">MATLAB R2022a</td><td align="left" valign="middle">MathWorks</td><td align="left" valign="middle">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Other</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Auditory Workstation RZ6</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Tucker-Davis Technologies, TDT, Alachua, FL</td><td align="left" valign="middle"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.tdt.com/component/rz6-multi-i-o-processor/">https://www.tdt.com/component/rz6-multi-i-o-processor/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Other</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Speaker, LS50</td><td align="left" valign="middle">KEF, UK</td><td align="left" valign="middle"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://uk.kef.com/products/ls50-meta">https://uk.kef.com/products/ls50-meta</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Other</td><td align="left" valign="middle">¼´´condenser microphone, 4954</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Brüel &amp; Kjær, Nærum, Denmark</td><td align="left" valign="middle"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hbkworld.com/en">https://www.hbkworld.com/en</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Other</td><td align="left" valign="middle">PHOTON/RT analyzer</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Brüel &amp; Kjær, Nærum, Denmark</td><td align="left" valign="middle"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hbkworld.com/en">https://www.hbkworld.com/en</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Other</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Epoxy-coated tungsten microelectrodes</td><td align="left" valign="middle">FHC Inc.</td><td align="left" valign="middle">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_018426">SCR_018426</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Other</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Remote-controlled microdrive</td><td align="left" valign="middle">FHC Inc.</td><td align="left" valign="middle"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fh-co.com/product-category/star/">https://www.fh-co.com/product-category/star/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Other</td><td align="left" valign="middle">26-gauge transdural guide tubes</td><td align="left" valign="middle">other</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/><td align="left" valign="middle">Self-made by Yu lab.

All stimuli were presented contralateral to the recording site.</p><p>Data were collected from two male rhesus monkeys (<italic>M. mulatta</italic>), which were chronically implanted with a plastic head-restraint ring and a recording grid, as described in detail in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu et al., 2015</xref>).

Raw neural activity was amplified and filtered (300 Hz to 3000 Hz). The spike train of the neuron was analyzed off-line. Single units were identified based on waveform shape, latency, and amplitude. Only well-isolated neurons were included in the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Auditory stimulation</title><p>Tones (100 ms; 5 ms rise-fall time) with multiple combinations of frequencies and intensities were presented to determine the frequency response areas (FRAs).

We used the FRAs to determine the characteristic frequency (CF).</p><p>To assess the ability of sustained firing in the IC, we presented white noise bursts with three kinds of duration (100 ms, 500 ms, 1000 ms) at 2 s interstimulus intervals.

At both steps, the monkeys received a water reward when they made the correct response.</p><p>During the recording session, the sound was presented in blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In each block, 3–6 repeated white noise bursts (standard sound) were presented at 600 ms interstimulus interval, and the last stimulus was either the same sound (the control condition) or a deviant sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The monkey needed to press the button immediately within 600 ms after the offset of the deviant stimulus to get the reward of a drop of water. The reward was controlled electronically by a valve located outside the sound-proof room to prevent any noise interference from the valve. The task reaction time setting precluded the possibility that the monkey made the decision just because it was the last stimulus in the block; in the control condition, the monkey did not need to press the button within 600 ms after the onset of the last stimulus to get the reward. The number of standard stimuli was randomly selected from 3 to 6 to avoid that the monkey made the decision based on counting the number of sounds and avoided that the monkey guessed when the deviant would be presented, so that the monkey had to press the button based on the detection of the current deviant stimulus. In each recording session, the standard duration was kept the same (300 ms), but the deviant duration was systematically changed to control the difficulty of the task according to the following formula: Duration<sub>deviant</sub> = Duration <sub>standard</sub> * λ<sup>n</sup> (n=0,1,2,3,4) (λ=1.19), where Duration<sub>deviant</sub> and Duration<sub>standard</sub> were deviant and standard duration, respectively. Thus, in each session, 5 conditions were presented. Each condition was usually presented 30–40 times.

All experimental procedures were conducted at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. The procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang University (ZJU20200148) and were performed in strict accordance with the principles outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Throughout the study, the health and well-being of the monkeys were closely monitored daily by researchers and animal care staff. To enhance their welfare, enrichment activities were provided, including the introduction of toys and food-based rewards to encourage exploratory behavior within their home cages.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-101142-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The raw data, preprocessed data, and the MATLAB code for the main content have been uploaded to Zenodo: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14539959">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14539959</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhai</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanigawa</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Tu</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Rauschecker</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>The Multifaceted Role of the Inferior Colliculus in Sensory Prediction, Reward Processing, and Decision-Making</data-title><source>Zenodo</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5281/zenodo.14539958</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Prof. Liping Wang for their invaluable comments on the early version of the manuscript, as well as to Xiaokai Kou and Fujin Gao for their assistance with the experiments.

The authors show us two major findings based on their experiments. The first one is climbing effect, which means that neurons' activities continue to increase along time course. The second one is reward effect, which refers to sudden increase of IC neurons' activities when the rewarding is given. Climbing effect is a surprising finding, but reward effect has not been explored clearly here.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Complex cognitive behaviors can be regarded as simple ideals of generating output based on information input, which depends on all kinds of input from sensory systems. The auditory system has hierarchic structures no less complex than those areas in charge of complex functions. Meanwhile, IC receives projections from higher areas, such as the auditory cortex, which implies IC is involved in complex behaviors. Experiments in behavioral monkeys are always time-consuming work with hardship, and this will offer more approximate knowledge of how the human brain works.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>These findings are more about correlation but not causality of IC function in behaviors.</p><p>About 'reward effect', it is still unknown if the true nature of reward effect is the simple response to the sound elicited by the electromagnetic valve of rewarding system. The authors claimed the testing space is sound-proofed and believed this is enough to support their opinion. Since the electromagnetic valve was connected to the water tube, and the water tube was attached to a monkey-chair or even in monkey's mouth, the click sound may transmit to the monkey independently on air. There are simple ways to test what happens. One is to add a few trials without reward and see what happens, or to vary the latency between sound sequence and reward.</p><p>Only one of the major findings is convincing, this definitely reduces the credibility of the authors' statements.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

Indeed, our goal was to provide a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted roles of the inferior colliculus (IC) in auditory processing and beyond, particularly in sensory prediction and reward processing. The use of electrophysiological recordings in behaving monkeys was central to our approach, as we sought to uncover the underexplored aspects of IC function in these complex cognitive domains. We are pleased that the reviewer recognizes the value of investigating the IC, a structure that has not been adequately explored in primates compared to other auditory regions like the cortex and thalamus. This feedback reinforces our belief that our work contributes significantly to advancing the understanding of the IC's roles in cognitive processing.</p><p>We look forward to addressing any further points the reviewers may have and refining our manuscript accordingly. Thank you for your constructive feedback and for recognizing the strengths of our research approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors cited several papers focusing on dopaminergic inputs in the IC to suggest the involvement of this brain region in cognitive functions. However, all those cited work were done in rodents. Whether monkey's IC shares similar inputs is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful comment on the limitations of extrapolating findings from rodent models to monkeys, particularly concerning dopaminergic inputs to the Inferior Colliculus (IC). While it is true that most studies on dopaminergic inputs to the IC have been conducted in rodents, to our knowledge, no studies have been conducted specifically in primates. To address the reviewer's concern, we have added a statement in both the introduction and discussion sections of our manuscript:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Introduction: &quot;However, these studies were conducted in rodents, and the existence and role of dopaminergic inputs in the primate IC remain underexplored.&quot; (P.5, Line. 16-17)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Discussion: &quot;However, the exact mechanisms and functions of dopamine modulation in the inferior colliculus are still not fully understood, particularly in primates. &quot; (P.21, Line. 7-9)</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors confused the two terms, novelty and deviation. According to their behavioral paradigm, deviation rather than novelty should be used in the paper because all the stimuli have been presented to the monkeys during training. Therefore, there is actually no novel stimuli but only deviant stimuli. This reflects that the author has misunderstood the basic concept.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's clarification regarding the distinction between &quot;novelty&quot; and &quot;deviation&quot; in the context of our behavioral paradigm. We agree that, given the nature of our experimental design where all stimuli were familiar to the monkeys during training, the term &quot;deviation&quot; more accurately describes the stimuli used in our study rather than &quot;novelty.&quot;</p><p>To address this, we have revised the manuscript to replace the term &quot;novelty&quot; with &quot;deviation&quot; wherever applicable. This change has been made to ensure accurate terminology is used throughout the paper, thereby eliminating any potential misunderstanding of the concepts involved in our study.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important distinction, which has improved the clarity and precision of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Most of the conclusions were made based on correlational analysis or speculation without providing causal evidences.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's concern regarding the reliance on correlational analyses in our study. Indeed, we acknowledge that the conclusions drawn primarily reflect correlations between neuronal activity and behavioral outcomes, rather than direct causal evidence. This limitation is common in many electrophysiological studies, particularly those conducted in behaving primates, where directly manipulating specific neural circuits to establish causality presents significant challenges, especially in comparison to research in mice.</p><p>This complexity is further compounded when considering the IC's role as a key lower-level relay station in the auditory pathway. Manipulating IC activity could have a widespread impact on auditory responses in downstream pathways, potentially influencing sensory prediction and decision-making processes.</p><p>Despite this limitation, our study provides novel evidence suggesting that the IC may exhibit multiple facets of cognitive signaling, which could inspire future research aimed at exploring the underlying mechanisms and broader functional implications of these signals.</p><p>To address the reviewer's concerns, we have made the following adjustments to the manuscript:</p><p>(1) Clarified the Scope of Conclusions: We have revised the language in the Results and Discussion sections to explicitly state that our findings represent correlational relationships rather than causal mechanisms. For example, we have referred to the associations observed between IC activity and behavioral outcomes as &quot;correlational&quot; and have refrained from making definitive causal claims without supporting experimental evidence.</p><p>&quot;Finally, to determine whether the IC plays a role in decision-making processes related to auditory perception, we analyzed the correlation between neuronal activity and behavioral choices in the duration deviation detection task.&quot; (P.14, Line. 4-6)</p><p>(2) Proposed Future Directions: In the Discussion section, we have included suggestions for future studies to directly test the causality of the observed relationships.</p><p>&quot;Further research is required to explore the underlying neuronal mechanisms and functional significance of this dynamic change comprehensively.&quot; (P.18, Line. 11-12)</p><p>We believe these revisions provide a more balanced interpretation of our findings while emphasizing the importance of future research to build on our results and establish causal relationships. Thank you for raising this critical point, which has led to a more rigorous and transparent presentation of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Results are presented in a very &quot;straightforward&quot; manner with too many detailed descriptions of phenomena but lack of summary and information synthesis. For example, the first section of Results is very long but did not convey clear information.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback regarding the presentation of our results.

Instead of restating the findings, we now focus more on their implications, limitations, and how they advance the current understanding of the Inferior Colliculus (IC) and its broader cognitive roles.</p><p>&quot;We demonstrated that the climbing effect is dynamically modulated (Figure 2D-G), and this modulation is driven primarily by sensory prediction rather than reward anticipation, as controlling for reward effects showed minimal impact on the response profile (Figure 3D, E). This modulation by preceding sensory experiences indicates that the IC is more than merely a relay station, suggesting a more intricate role in auditory processing influenced by both ascending and descending neural pathways.&quot; (P.17, Line. 1-5)</p><p>(2) Incorporation of Related Work: We have expanded the Discussion to include a more comprehensive comparison with existing literature, specifically highlighting studies that have reported similar findings. For example, we now discuss the work by Metzger et al. (2006), which demonstrated similar firing patterns of IC neurons and correlated these with reward-related processes. This comparison helps contextualize our results and emphasizes the novel contributions our study makes to the field.</p><p>&quot;Metzger and colleagues reported a gradual increase in neural activity—termed late-trial ramping—in the IC during an auditory saccade task. Similar to our results, they observed no climbing effect in the absence of a behavioral task. Both studies support the idea that the climbing effect depends on both behavioral engagement and reward. While both pieces of research emphasize the IC's complex role in integrating auditory processing with cognitive functions related to reward and behavior, our findings provide further insight by distinguishing between the effects of sensory prediction and reward anticipation on IC neuronal activity.&quot; (P.16, Line. 16-24)</p><p>We believe these revisions have significantly improved the quality of the Discussion by reducing unnecessary repetition and providing a more thorough engagement with the relevant literature.

The auditory system has hierarchic structures no less complex than those areas in charge of complex functions. Meanwhile, IC receives projections from higher areas, such as auditory cortex, which implies IC is involved in complex behaviors. Experiments in behavioral monkeys are always time-consuming works with hardship, and this will offer more approximate knowledge of how the human brain works.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer's positive summary of our work and recognition of the effort involved in conducting experiments on behaving monkeys. We agree with the reviewer that the inferior colliculus (IC) plays a significant role beyond mere sensory transmission, particularly in integrating sensory inputs with higher cognitive functions. Our study aims to shed light on these complex functions by revealing the climbing effect of IC neurons during decision-making tasks and exploring how reward influences this dynamic.</p><p>We are encouraged that the reviewer acknowledges the importance of investigating the IC's role within the broader framework of complex cognitive behaviors and appreciates the hierarchical nature of the auditory system. The reviewer's comments reinforce the value of our research in contributing to a more nuanced understanding of how the IC might contribute to sensory-cognitive integration.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the significance of using behavioral monkey models to approximate human brain function.

We fully acknowledge the importance of distinguishing between correlation and causality. As outlined in our response to Question 3 from Reviewer #1, we recognize the limitations of relying on correlational data and the inherent challenges in establishing direct causal links, particularly in electrophysiological studies involving behaving primates, and given the lower-level role of the IC in the auditory pathway.</p><p>We have taken steps to clarify this distinction throughout our manuscript.

The effect is clearly related to training and learning process, but it still requires more exploration to rule out a few explanations. First, repeated white noise bursts with fixed inter-stimulus-interval of 0.6 seconds was presented, so that monkeys might remember the sounds by rhymes, which is some sort of learned auditory response. It is interesting to know monkeys' responses and neurons' activities if the inter-stimuli-interval is variable. Second, the task only asked monkeys to press one button and the reward ratio (the ratio of correct response trials) was around 78% (based on the number from Line 302). so that, in the sessions with reward, monkeys had highly expected reward chances, does this expectation cause the climbing effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these insightful points regarding the 'climbing effect' observed in the oddball paradigm and its potential relationship with training, learning processes, and reward expectation. Below, we address each of the reviewer's specific concerns:</p><p>(1) Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) and Rhythmic Auditory Response:</p><p>The reviewer suggests that the fixed inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 0.6 seconds might lead to a rhythmic auditory response, where monkeys could anticipate the sounds. We appreciate this perspective and recognize its relevance. However, we believe that rhythm is unlikely to be a significant contributor to the 'climbing effect' for two key reasons:</p><p>a) The 'climbing effect' begins as early as the second sound in the block (as shown in Fig. 2D and Fig. 3B), before any rhythm or pattern could be fully established, since rhythm generally requires at least three repetitions to form.</p><p>b) In our reward experiment (Figs. 4-5), the sounds were also presented at regular ISIs, which could have facilitated rhythmic learning, yet the observed climbing effect was comparatively small in those conditions.</p><p>Unfortunately, we did not explore variable ISIs in this current study, so we cannot directly address this concern with the available data.</p><p>(2) Reward Expectation and Climbing Effect:</p><p>The reviewer raises a valid concern regarding whether the 'climbing effect' might be influenced by the monkeys' high reward expectation, especially given the high reward ratio (~78%) in the sessions. While it is plausible that reward expectation could contribute to the observed increase in neuronal firing rates, we believe the results from our reward experiment (Fig. 4) suggest otherwise.</p><p>In this experiment, even though reward expectation was likely formed due to the consistent pairing of sounds with rewards (100% reward delivery), we did not observe a significant climbing effect in the auditory response. Additionally, the presence of reward prediction error (Fig. 4D) further supports the idea that while the monkeys may indeed form reward expectations, these expectations do not directly drive the climbing effect in the IC.</p><p>To make this distinction clearer, we have added sentences in the revised manuscript explicitly discussing the relationship between reward expectation and the climbing effect.</p><p>&quot;Within the oddball paradigm, both sensory and reward predictions intensify alongside the recurrence of standard sounds, suggesting that the strength of these predictions could significantly influence neuronal responses. Our experimentation with rewards has effectively dismissed the role of reward prediction (Figures 3 and 4), highlighting the potential significance of sensory prediction in molding the climbing effect.&quot; (P.17, Line. 14-19)</p><p>We believe these revisions provide a clearer understanding of the factors contributing to the climbing effect and effectively address the reviewer's concerns. We sincerely thank the reviewer for these valuable suggestions, which have allowed us to improve the clarity and depth of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Reward effect&quot; on IC neurons' responses were shown in Fig. 4. Is this auditory response caused by physical reward action or not? In reward sessions, IC neurons have obvious response related to the onset of water reward. The electromagnetic valve is often used in water-rewarding system and will give out a loud click sound every time when the reward is triggered. IC neurons' responses may be simply caused by the click sound if the electromagnetic valve is used.

A more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between IC neuronal activity and reward prediction is necessary. Providing population-level data would significantly strengthen the findings concerning the IC's complex functionalities. Additionally, the discussion of reward prediction in lines 437-445, which describes IC neuron responses in control experiments, does not sufficiently demonstrate that IC neurons can encode reward expectations. It would be valuable to include the responses of IC neurons during trials with incorrect key presses or no key presses to better illustrate this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We deeply appreciate the detailed feedback provided regarding the conclusions on the inferior colliculus (IC)'s role in reward prediction within our manuscript. We acknowledge the importance of a robust and comprehensive presentation of our findings, particularly when discussing complex neural functionalities.</p><p>In response to the reviewers' concerns, we have made the following revisions to strengthen our manuscript:</p><p>(1) Inclusion of Population-Level Data for IC Neurons:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included population-level results for IC neurons in a supplementary figure. Initially, we focused on two example neurons that did not exhibit motor-related responses to key presses to isolate reward-related signals. However, most IC neurons exhibit motor responses during key presses (as indicated in Fig.6), which can complicate distinguishing between reward-related activity and motor responses. This complexity is why we initially presented neurons without motor responses. To clarify this point, we have added sentences in the Results section to explain the rationale behind our selection of neurons and to address the potential overlap between motor and reward responses in the IC.</p><p>&quot;This phenomenon was further supported by examining the responses in the duration deviation detection task. Since most IC neurons exhibit motor responses during key presses (Supplementary Figure 6), which can complicate distinguishing between reward-related activity and motor responses, we specifically selected two neurons without motor responses during key presses (Figure 5).&quot; (P.13, Line. 10-15)</p><p>(2) Addition of Data on Key Press Errors and No-Response Trials:</p><p>In response to the reviewer's suggestion, we have demonstrated Peri-Stimulus Time Histograms (PSTHs) for two example neurons during error trials as below, including incorrect key presses and no-response trials. Given that the monkeys performed the task with high accuracy, the number of error trials is relatively small, especially for the control condition (as shown in the top row of the figure below). While we remain cautious in drawing definitive conclusions from this limited trials, we observed that no clear reward signals were detected during the corresponding window (typically centered around 150 ms after the end of the sound). It is important to note that the experiment was initially designed to explore decision-making signals in the IC, rather than focusing specifically on reward processing. However, the data in Fig. 6 demonstrated intriguing signals of reward prediction error, which is why we believe it is important to present them.</p><p>When combined with the results from our reward experiment (Fig. 5), we believe these findings provide compelling evidence of reward prediction errors being processed by IC neurons.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PSTH of the neuron from Figure 5A during a key press trial under control condition.The number in the parentheses in the legend represents the number of trials for control condition.

Our observations unveiled a 'climbing effect'—a progressive increase in firing rate after sound onset, not attributable to reward but seemingly linked to sensory experience such as sensory prediction.

This setup ensured that any potential auditory noise from the valve was minimized and unlikely to influence the IC neuronal activity.</p><p>To address this concern more explicitly, we have added a description in the Methods section detailing this setup. This revision clarifies the steps we took to rule out this potential confound, strengthening the validity of our claim that the observed IC activity is genuinely related to reward processing and not a simple auditory response to the valve's operation.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing attention to this critical aspect of our experimental design, and we hope this clarification enhances the interpretation of our findings.</p><p>&quot;The reward was controlled electronically by a valve located outside the sound-proof room to prevent any noise interference from the valve.&quot; (P.24, Line. 6-7)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Since monkeys are smart, simple Go/NoGo design is not a good strategy. The task with more buttons to press, such as 2-AFC or 4-AFC task, may prevent artificial effect of unwanted behaviors and offer us more reliable and useful data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to implement a more complex behavioral task, such as a 2-Alternative Forced Choice (2-AFC) or 4-AFC design, to reduce the possibility of unwanted behaviors and to gather more reliable data. We agree that such paradigms could offer additional insights and help control the monkeys' decision-making processes by reducing potential confounding factors related to the simplicity of Go/NoGo responses.</p><p>In our current study, we chose the Go/NoGo task because it aligns with our primary experimental goal: investigating the relationship between IC activity and sensory prediction, decision-making, and reward processing in a simplified manner. This task allowed us to focus on reward prediction and sensory responses without introducing additional complexity that could increase the cognitive load on the monkeys and affect their performance. It is worth noting that training monkeys to perform auditory tasks is generally more challenging compared to visual tasks, though they are indeed capable of complex learning.</p><p>Moreover, this novelty detection task was initially designed as an oddball paradigm to explore predictive coding along the auditory pathway. Our lab has concentrated on this topic for several years, with the majority of current research focusing on non-behavioral subjects such as rodents. Implementing a more advanced paradigm like 2-AFC would have increased training time and required a different approach than our core objective.</p><p>That said, we agree that future studies would benefit from using more sophisticated tasks, such as 2-AFC or 4-AFC paradigms, as they could offer a more refined understanding of decision-making processes while enhancing the quality of data by minimizing unwanted behaviors. We believe that incorporating more advanced behavioral paradigms in future work will further enhance the rigor and reliability of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 52, &quot;challenges...&quot;, sounds a little bit too much. The authors tried to sell the ideal that IC is more than simple sensory relay point. I agree with that and I know the experiments on monkeys are not easy to gain too much comprehensive data. But to support authors' further bold opinions, more analysis is need to be done.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback on the tone of the statement in Line 52, where we describe the findings as &quot;challenging&quot; conventional views of the IC as a simple sensory relay point. We agree that while our data provides intriguing insights into the multifunctionality of the IC, especially in sensory prediction, decision-making, and reward processing.</p><p>To address this, we have toned down the language in the revised manuscript to better reflect the current state of our findings. Rather than presenting the results as a direct challenge to existing knowledge, we now describe them as contributing to a growing body of evidence that suggests the IC plays a more integrative role in auditory processing and cognitive functions.</p><p>&quot;This research highlights a more complex role for the IC than traditionally understood, showcasing its integral role in cognitive and sensory processing and emphasizing its importance in integrated brain functions.&quot; (Abstract, P.3, Line.12-15)</p><p>&quot;This modulation by preceding sensory experiences indicates that the IC is more than merely a relay station, suggesting a more intricate role in auditory processing influenced by both ascending and descending neural pathways.&quot; (P.17, Line. 3-5)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 143, &quot;peak response&quot;, it is better not to refer this transient response as &quot;peak response&quot;. How about &quot;transient response&quot; or &quot;transient peak response&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion regarding the terminology used in Line 143. We agree with the reviewer that referring to this as simply a &quot;peak response&quot; could be misleading. To improve clarity and precision, we have revised the term to &quot;transient peak response&quot; as recommended.</p><p>We believe this adjustment better captures the nature of the neuronal activity observed and avoids confusion. The manuscript has been updated accordingly, and we appreciate the reviewer's valuable input.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Is it possible to manipulate IC area and check the affection in behavior task?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to manipulate the IC area and observe its effect on behavior during the task. Indeed, this would provide valuable causal evidence regarding the role of the IC in sensory prediction, decision-making, and reward processing, which would complement the correlational findings we have presented.</p><p>However, in this particular study, we focused on electrophysiological recordings to observe naturally occurring neuronal activity in behaving monkeys. While it is certainly feasible to manipulate IC activity, such as through pharmacological inactivation, optogenetics, or electrical stimulation, these techniques pose technical challenges in primates. Moreover, manipulating the IC, given its role as a lower-level relay station in the auditory pathway, could potentially disrupt auditory processing more broadly, complicating the interpretation of behavioral outcomes.</p><p>That said, we agree that introducing such manipulations in future studies would significantly enhance our understanding of the causal role of the IC in cognitive and sensory functions. We have now emphasized this as a key future research direction in the revised manuscript's discussion section.
