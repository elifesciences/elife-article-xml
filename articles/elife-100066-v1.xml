Disease control is highly challenging due to an increasing number of drug treatment failures. African trypanosomes are extracellular, blood-borne parasites that mainly rely on glycolysis for their energy metabolism within the mammalian host. Trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes are therefore of interest for the development of trypanocidal drugs. Here, we report the serendipitous discovery of a camelid single-domain antibody (sdAb aka Nanobody) that selectively inhibits the enzymatic activity of trypanosomatid (but not host) pyruvate kinases through an allosteric mechanism. By combining enzyme kinetics, biophysics, structural biology, and transgenic parasite survival assays, we provide a proof-of-principle that the sdAb-mediated enzyme inhibition negatively impacts parasite fitness and growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic></kwd><kwd>camelid single-domain antibody</kwd><kwd>pyruvate kinase</kwd><kwd>allosteric inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli </italic>BL21(DE3)</kwd><kwd><italic>T. brucei</italic> Lister 427 single-marker (Tb427sm)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004418</institution-id><institution>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRP95</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Versées</surname><given-names>Wim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004385</institution-id><institution>Universiteit Gent</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BOF.STG.2018.0009.01/01N01518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magez</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007660</institution-id><institution>Universiteit Antwerpen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>41391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sterckx</surname><given-names>Yann G-J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G013518N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magez</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1137622N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claes</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>COST Action CA21111</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA21111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sterckx</surname><given-names>Yann G-J</given-names></name><name><surname>Caljon</surname><given-names>Guy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A camelid single-domain antibody potently and specifically inhibits pyruvate kinases from trypanosomatids.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) comprise a wide variety of communicable diseases that are prevalent in (sub)tropical regions and affect more than 1 billion people worldwide. It is becoming increasingly clear that NTDs constitute a major health threat in both developing and developed countries, with those living in poverty being especially vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Picado et al., 2019</xref>). NTDs are typically characterized by a low mortality and high morbidity, which results in a severe impact on the quality of life and economic productivity of those affected. In recent times, NTD control has become more complicated by globalization, human migration, climate change and the altered distribution of disease-transmitting vectors (including mosquitoes, flies, and ticks). Consequently, even currently unaffected areas (including the Western world) are confronted with the (re-)emergence of NTDs. The WHO has listed 20 NTDs that should be tackled in the interest of global health and well-being (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en">https://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en</ext-link>). Three of these are caused by trypanosomatids, a group of flagellated, single-celled eukaryotic organisms comprising parasites of the <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> genera. <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> spp. encompass African trypanosomes, which are extracellular parasitic protists that cause human and animal trypanosomoses (HAT and AAT, respectively).</p><p>To be effective, the battle against trypanosomes requires a concerted approach including vaccination, drug treatment, and vector control. However, the development of an effective vaccine against these parasites is thwarted by sophisticated immune-evasion strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pays et al., 2023</xref>), while vector control may be hampered due to resistance of the insect vector to insecticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Field et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, chemotherapy is an essential pillar for clinical management, control and/or elimination. Unfortunately, a number of reports describe treatment failure or parasite resistance to the currently available drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Rycker et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, there is a need for alternative compounds, preferably with novel modes of action and/or designed based on mechanistic insights of the target’s structure-function relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Field et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Rycker et al., 2018</xref>). This need is especially pressing for AAT, which strongly impedes sustainable livestock rearing in Sub-Saharan Africa. AAT results in drastic reductions of draft power, meat, and milk production by the infected animals (small and large ruminants), and its control relies mainly on vector control and chemotherapy, with only few drugs currently available. The lack of routine field diagnosis has resulted in the misuse of trypanocidal drugs, thereby accelerating the rise of parasite resistance and further exacerbating the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richards et al., 2021</xref>). As such, AAT-inflicted annual losses are estimated at around $ 5 billion (and the necessity to invest another $ 30 million each year to control AAT through chemotherapy), thereby having a devastating impact on the socio-economic development of Sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fetene et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, HAT is perceived as a minor threat as it has reached a post-elimination phase as a public health problem with less than 1000 yearly documented cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franco et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, new and effective drugs for HAT treatment have recently become available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Rycker et al., 2023</xref>). HAT control currently relies on case detection and treatment, and vector control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Büscher et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>African trypanosomes are extracellular parasites that have a bipartite life cycle involving insect vectors and mammals as hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radwanska et al., 2018</xref>). Most HAT (<italic>T. brucei gambiense</italic> and <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic>) and AAT (<italic>T. b. brucei</italic> and <italic>T. congolense</italic>) causing trypanosomes are uniquely vectored by tsetse flies (<italic>Glossina</italic> spp.) and are confined to Sub-Saharan Africa. <italic>T. b. evansi</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> (both causative agents of AAT) have expanded beyond the tsetse belt due to their ability to be mechanically transmitted by a variety of biting flies (<italic>Glossina</italic>, <italic>Stomoxys</italic>, and <italic>Tabanus</italic> spp.). Finally, <italic>T. b. equiperdum</italic> infects equids and represents an exception as it is transmitted directly from animal to animal through sexual contact. For all African trypanosomes, the predominant parasite form within the mammalian host is called the bloodstream form (BSF) which, as the name suggests, resides mainly inside the host bloodstream. The BSF also colonizes sites such as the lymphatics, the skin, brain, testes, adipose tissue, and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trindade et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caljon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capewell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krüger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mabille et al., 2022</xref>). Given its niche, the BSF has steady access to high blood glucose concentrations (∼5 mM) and has evolved to exclusively rely on glycolysis to power its metabolism. For this reason, trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes (of which most are localized in organelles called glycosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szöör et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haanstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) have received much interest and attention as targets for the development of trypanocidal compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verlinde et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haanstra and Bakker, 2015</xref>). Indeed, informed by computational models of trypanosomal glycolysis, RNAi experiments have shown that a reduction in glycolytic flux induces growth impairment and eventually leads to parasite death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haanstra et al., 2011</xref>). This principle was recently successfully exploited by McNae, Kinkead, Malik and co-workers, who developed a novel and selective small-molecule inhibitor of the trypanosomal glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNae et al., 2021</xref>). The compound impairs PFK activity via an allosteric mechanism and was validated to lead to parasite death in vitro as well as in an in vivo mouse model. Pyruvate kinase (PYK) represents another attractive glycolytic target. This non-glycosomal enzyme catalyses the last step of the glycolysis (the irreversible conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The importance of this reaction is twofold: (i) the generation of ATP through the transfer of a phosphoryl group from PEP to ADP and (ii) the formation of pyruvate, a crucial metabolite of the central metabolism. Like most PYKs, trypanosomatid PYKs are homotetramers. The PYK monomer is a ∼55 kDa protein organized into four domains termed ’N’, ’A’, ’B’, and ’C’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The A domain constitutes the largest part of the PYK monomer and is characterized by an (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>/<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>)<sub>8</sub>-TIM barrel fold that contains the active site. Together with the N-terminal domain, it is also involved in the formation of the PYK tetramer AA’ dimer interfaces. The B domain is known as the flexible ’lid’ domain that shields the active site during enzyme-mediated phosphotransfer. Finally, the C domain harbors the binding pocket for allosteric effectors and stabilizes the PYK tetramer by formation of CC’ dimer interfaces. Because of their role in ATP production and distribution of fluxes into different metabolic branches, the activity of trypanosomatid PYKs is tightly regulated through an allosteric mechanism known as the ‘rock and lock’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morgan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pinto Torres et al., 2020</xref>). In this model (which is detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the binding of substrates and/or effectors (and analogs thereof) to the active and effector sites, respectively, trigger a conformational change from the enzymatically inactive T state to the catalytically active R state. Known effector molecules for trypanosomatid PYKs are fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F26BP), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16BP) and sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), with F26BP being the most potent one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Schaftingen et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callens and Opperdoes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ernest et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tulloch et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, trypanosomatid PYKs seem to be largely unresponsive to the allosteric regulation of enzyme activity by free amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Callens et al., 1991</xref>), which contrasts with human PYKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaneton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>). Known trypanosomatid PYK inhibitors impair enzymatic activity through occupation of the PYK active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we describe an allosteric mechanism for the inhibition of trypanosomatid PYKs, which was identified through a camelid single-domain antibody (sdAb aka nanobody) raised against <italic>T. congolense</italic> PYK (<italic>Tco</italic>PYK). By using a combination of enzyme kinetics assays, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and macromolecular X-ray crystallography (MX), we demonstrate that sdAb42 (one of the sdAbs raised against <italic>Tco</italic>PYK) is a potent inhibitor that impairs enzyme function by selectively binding and stabilizing the enzyme’s inactive T state. The sdAb42 epitope is located far away from the active and effector sites, and perturbation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) further reveals the epitope contains residues that are characterized by (i) a high allosteric coupling intensity to the active site and (ii) critical components of the allosteric communication pathway between the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK effector and active sites. In addition, we show that the inhibitory mechanism of sdAb42 applies to trypanosomatid PYKs in general, as its epitope is highly conserved among <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites. Finally, we provide evidence that the production of sdAb42 as an ‘intrabody’ (intracellularly produced sdAb) has a modest effect on parasite growth in transgenic <italic>T. brucei</italic> lines.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure-function relationship of trypanosomatid PYKs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of a trypanosome, with a focus on their glycosome biochemistry.

The different PYK domains are color-coded as in panel (<bold>B</bold>). In the absence of substrates (PEP and ADP) and effectors (F26BP or F16BP), trypanosomatid PYKs reside in a T-state (red box). The binding of substrates causes the enzyme to ‘rock’ (R-state boxed in yellow). This consists of several structural rearrangements across the entire PYK tetramer that involve (i) AC-core rotation of 6°–8° (with residues 430–434 as a pivot point), (ii) closing of the lid domain (rotation of 30°–40°), (iii) stabilisation of the AA’ dimer interfaces, and (iv) flipping of the Arg311 side chain as part of remodeling the catalytic pocket for substrate accommodation. The binding of effectors to PYK’s C domain generates a ‘lock’ in addition to the ‘rock’. This prompts the enzyme to adopt a conformation primed for efficient catalysis (R-state boxed in blue); this involves (i) the 6°–8° AC-core rotation, (ii) stabilisation of the CC’ dimer interfaces, and (iii) the Arg311 flip. The presence of substrates and effectors “rock and lock” the enzyme in the R-state (green box).

hypothesised that sdAb42 inhibits <italic>Tco</italic>PYK activity by selectively binding and stabilizing the enzyme’s inactive T state. A first finding that supports this idea is that the sdAb42 epitope is significantly distorted when <italic>Tco</italic>PYK transitions from the T to the R state (Cα RMSD of 3.70 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Second, we were also able to crystallise the sdAb42:<italic>Tco</italic>PYK complex in the presence of sulfate, which acts as a phosphate mimic that can bind both the active and effector sites of trypanosomatid PYKs. As a result, sulfate binding has the potential to initiate the ‘rock and lock’, thereby ushering the transition from the inactive T to the active R state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tulloch et al., 2008</xref>). A detailed inspection of the electron density revealed the presence of sulfate molecules in the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK effector site at the positions usually occupied by the phosphoryl groups of the cognate effector molecules fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite the presence of these sulfates, <italic>Tco</italic>PYK clearly remains in a T state conformation when bound by sdAb42. Third, thermal unfolding followed by CD spectroscopy shows that sdAb42 significantly stabilises apo <italic>Tco</italic>PYK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In accordance with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pinto Torres et al., 2020</xref>), apo <italic>Tco</italic>PYK displays an apparent melting temperature (T<sub>m,app</sub>) of ∼46 °C. The binding of sdAb42 leads to a remarkable increase in the enzyme’s thermal stability (ΔT<sub>m,app</sub> = 10.3°C). When taken together, the data strongly indicate that sdAb42 impairs <italic>Tco</italic>PYK activity by selectively binding and stabilising the enzyme’s inactive T state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The sdAb42 epitope contains residues that are critical for the allosteric communication between the enzyme’s effector and active sites</title><p>To better understand the mechanistic basis of <italic>Tco</italic>PYK inhibition by sdAb42, we performed in silico perturbation analyses, which allows (i) prediction of allosteric correlations between residue pairs, (ii) prediction of residues with a high allosteric coupling intensity (ACI) to the active site (and thus allosteric sites or ‘allosteric hotspots’), (iii) identification of allosteric communication pathways between an enzyme’s active site and known effector sites, and (iv) identification of critical residues within these pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The ACI predictions performed on the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK T and R state tetramer structures reveal that the sdAb42 epitope largely coincides with an ‘allosteric hotspot’ located on the enzyme’s surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Especially the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK residues contacted by sdAb42’s CDR1 (Arg20, Ser44, Val348, Ile352) display high ACI values (&gt;0.75) implying that a perturbation of these residues will have a high probability of propagating to the active site and, hence, affecting enzyme activity. Interestingly, the ACI values of these residues are higher in the T state compared to the R state tetramer, which implies that the allosteric coupling between the sdAb42-recognized ‘allosteric hotspot’ and the enzyme’s active site appears to be stronger in the T state conformation. This finding is further supported through the ‘Allosteric Pocket Prediction (APOP)’ method, which is employed for the identification of allosteric binding pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kumar et al., 2023</xref>). The APOP analysis identifies sites overlapping with the sdAb42 epitope as highly ranking allosteric ligand binding pockets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), thereby further underlining its feature as an ‘allosteric hotspot’.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Perturbation analysis reveals distinct allosteric communication pathways in T and R state <italic>Tco</italic>PYK.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) Surface representation of the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK tetramer in its T (<bold>A</bold>) and R state (<bold>C</bold>).

This unveiled an intriguing disparity with regards to the allosteric communication pathways in the enzyme’s T and R state conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the TcoPYK T state tetramer, the allosteric pathways can be defined as ‘intersubunit’ since they run from the effector site in one subunit to the active site of a second subunit across the AA’ interface. These pathways involve Arg311 and residues of the AA’ interface, consistent with their roles in the ‘rock and lock’ mechanism during which conformational changes along intermonomer interfaces allow <italic>Tco</italic>PYK to transition from the T into the R state upon substrate/effector binding. Some of the pathways’ critical residues are closely connected to the sdAb42 epitope: Ala21, Asn22, Ile350, and Cys351. This is corroborated by an additional investigation of the allosteric communication pathway within <italic>Tco</italic>PYK through entropy transfer analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hacisuleyman and Erman, 2017</xref>), which identifies key residues involved in the T to R state transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), some of which are part of or closely connected to the sdAb42 epitope: Phe13, Pro15, Tyr143, Pro181, Cys183, and Val268. In contrast, the R state communication pathways link up the active and effector sites within individual monomers and can thus be considered as “intrasubunit”. This results in a different set of critical residues, which no longer run past the sdAb42 epitope, hence explaining the lower ACI values of this site in the <italic>Tco</italic>PYK R state structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The sdAb42 epitope is conserved in trypanosomatid pyruvate kinases</title><p>Given that trypanosomatid PYKs display a high degree of sequence identity (at least 70%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we assessed whether the ‘allosteric hotspot’ identified through perturbation analysis and the overlapping sdAb42 epitope would be conserved across <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p><p>Mapping the degree of sequence conservation onto the structure of <italic>Tco</italic>PYK clearly illustrates that the sdAb42 epitope is well conserved among trypanosomatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The impact of these differences on binding energy was first assessed through an <italic>in silico</italic> ΔΔ G analysis, which predicts that the single Ile352Val (corresponding <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK epitope) and triple Lys43Gln/Val348Ala/Ile352Leu (corresponding <italic>Lme</italic>PYK epitope) mutations are expected to have a negative impact on binding energy and thus affinity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This is experimentally confirmed through the determination of the binding affinities of the different sdAb42 – trypanosomatid PYK complexes through isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). As previously determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pinto Torres et al., 2018</xref>), sdAb42 binds <italic>Tco</italic>PYK with a high affinity in the low nM range (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.90 ± 0.07 nM), while the affinity of sdAb42 for <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK and <italic>Lme</italic>PYK is roughly 40-fold lower (K<sub>D</sub> values of 37.16 ± 14.80 nM and 42.54 ± 10.81 nM, respectively). Given that the three enzymes operate via the ‘rock and lock’ mechanism, it could be expected that the sdAb42 inhibition mechanism applies to all trypanosomatid PYKs.

shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref> were performed by incubating the apo enzymes with sdAb42 prior to the addition of substrate and effector molecules. Based on our current working hypothesis and the relatively high affinity of sdAb42 toward trypanosomatid PYKs, this would readily lock the enzymes in their T state with very little to no chance of reverting back to the R state conformation. In a more realistic setting, the enzymes would be surrounded by substrate and effector molecules prior to their encounter with an exogeneous inhibitor. Consequently, the enzymes would be involved in their kinetic cycle by continuously transitioning between the T and R states. Hence, under such circumstances, we would expect that sdAb42 binding is delayed until the enzymes return to their T state conformation. Moreover, for inhibition to occur, this binding event must take place before the enzymes cycle back to the R state. In other words, enzyme inhibition under such circumstances would be expected to be less efficient.</p><p>To explore the inhibition behavior of sdAb42 in more detail, we performed the kinetic experiments by saturating the trypanosomatid PYKs with fixed effector concentrations prior to the addition of fixed, saturating substrate concentrations and increasing amounts of sdAb42. A careful inspection of the collected activity curves reveals the presence of non-linear features in the early phases, which is exacerbated with increasing inhibitor concentrations (especially pronounced for <italic>Tco</italic>PYK; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, top inset). Such non-linear behavior is typical for so-called ‘slow-binding inhibition’, which can indeed be explained by the requirement of a <italic>Tco</italic>PYK R- to T-state transition prior to sdAb42-mediated enzyme inhibition, thereby supporting the above-mentioned hypothesis. While a full quantitative analysis of the slow-binding kinetics displayed by sdAb42 is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, the collected data sets allow for the determination of IC<sub>50</sub>-values by only considering the rates at longer time ranges when the slow phase of inhibition has come into effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, bottom inset). In this way we find that sdAb42 inhibits <italic>Tco</italic>PYK with an IC<sub>50</sub> of ∼350 nM, from which two observations can be made. First, the IC<sub>50</sub>-value determined under these assay conditions is roughly 24-fold higher compared to the IC<sub>50</sub> measured under assay conditions in which <italic>Tco</italic>PYK is first incubated with sdAb42 prior to the addition of substrate and effector molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which indeed confirms that enzyme inhibition is less efficient under these circumstances.

The same approach was employed to generate a negative control line expressing sdAb BCII10. Since genetic engineering and culturing of <italic>T. congolense</italic> is notoriously difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awuah-Mensah et al., 2021</xref>), we opted to perform our experiments in <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</p><p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> clearly demonstrate that (i) the intrabodies could successfully be produced upon Tet induction and that (ii) sdAb42 appears to induce a growth defect in a dose-dependent manner while BCII10 does not. A rapid loss of sdAb42 intrabody was noted, resulting in heterogenous in situ expression levels. To investigate the effect of sdAb levels on growth burden more thoroughly, a large-scale experiment was performed in which low and high intrabody expressing monoclonal lines were obtained by single cell sorting followed by growth curve analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This reveals that increasing sdAb42 expression levels lead to larger growth defects, supporting a positive correlation between intrabody levels and impaired fitness (Pearson correlation, <italic>r</italic>=0.95; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). As expected, BCII10 levels have no impact on parasite growth (Pearson correlation, <italic>r</italic>=–0.72), even at median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values that are significantly higher compared to those seen for the sdAb42 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In addition, we observed that, while sdAb BCII10 levels remain stable over time, sdAb42 levels decrease rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We suspect that this is the result of a parasite defense mechanism at the translational but not transcriptional level (sdAb42 transcript levels remain stable, data not shown) to specifically counter sdAb42 (but not BCII10) production. We interpret this finding as additional evidence for the detrimental effect of the sdAb42 intrabody on parasite growth.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The intracellular production of sdAb42 generates a growth defect in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The top panel schematically depicts the principle underlying the tetracycline (Tet) controlled production of the sdAb-mCherry fusion protein.

Especially enzymes and transporters involved in glycolysis are of interest for drug development purposes for two main reasons. First, many parasitic protists heavily rely on glycolysis within their vertebrate hosts to sustain their energy metabolism: <italic>Giardia</italic> spp. trophozoites, <italic>Trichomonas</italic> spp., <italic>Entamoeba</italic> spp. trophozoites, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. intraerythrocytic stages, <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp., <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> spp. BSFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Upcroft and Upcroft, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saunders et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2014</xref>). Second, the glycolytic enzymes and transporters are sufficiently different from their vertebrate host homologs such that they may be specifically targeted. Recent work on <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> demonstrates that achieving parasite killing by inhibiting glycolysis remains a viable avenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNae et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khan et al., 2023</xref>). Regarding trypanosomes, although the inhibition of glycolytic flux has been an area of intense research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verlinde et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haanstra and Bakker, 2015</xref>), there is a clear need for novel compound classes with novel modes of action and/or designed based on mechanistic insights in the target’s structure-function relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Field et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Rycker et al., 2018</xref>). In this paper, we report the serendipitous discovery of a camelid sdAb (sdAb42) that allosterically inhibits the enzymatic activity of trypanosomatid PYKs.</p><p>sdAb42 was originally identified within a diagnostic context, in which its target <italic>Tco</italic>PYK was shown to be a reliable biomarker for the detection of active <italic>T. congolense</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pinto Torres et al., 2018</xref>). Besides possessing a diagnostic potential, our data now demonstrate that sdAb42 selectively and potently inhibits <italic>Tco</italic>PYK enzymatic activity. A thorough structural investigation reveals that this inhibition proceeds through an allosteric mechanism, in which sdAb42 selectively binds the enzyme’s inactive T state, thereby ‘locking’ <italic>Tco</italic>PYK in a catalytically inactive conformation. An explanation for the latter is provided through ACI analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), which suggests that the epitope targeted by sdAb42 is an ‘allosteric hotspot’ in the AA’ intersubunit communication pathway required for the ‘rocking and locking’ of trypanosomatid PYKs. In other words, the binding of sdAb42 to this AA’ intersubunit site is proposed to prevent <italic>Tco</italic>PYK from ‘rocking and locking’ into its active R state conformation. Interestingly, the location of this ‘allosteric hotspot’ is reminiscent of the binding site for free amino acids found in human PYKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaneton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, various amino acids have been shown to be allosteric regulators of human PYK activity. However, in contrast to human PYKs, trypanosomatid PYKs seem to be largely unresponsive to the allosteric regulation of enzyme activity by free amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Callens et al., 1991</xref>). This resonates with the previous finding that PYKs from different species have evolved different allosteric strategies to regulate enzyme activity and that these differences could be exploited in drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morgan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The ‘allosteric hotspot’ targeted by sdAb42 is well conserved among trypanosomatids, which would suggest that this sdAb has the potential to inhibit other trypanosomatid PYKs. Indeed, the data presented here show that sdAb42 also blocks the enzymatic activity of <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK and <italic>Lme</italic>PYK (two reference enzymes for studying the structure-function relationship of trypanosomatid PYKs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>), albeit with a lower efficiency in comparison to <italic>Tco</italic>PYK. The explanation for these observations is two-fold. First, while most residues constituting the epitope are identical among the three investigated PYKs, the differences (Ile352Val and Lys43Gln/Val348Ala/Ile352Leu in <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK and <italic>Lme</italic>PYK, respectively) seem sufficient to cause the affinity to drop 40-fold. Second, the kinetic data recorded for experiments in which the trypanosomatid PYKs were first saturated with substrate and effector molecules prior to sdAb42 addition reveal that sdAb42 operates through a ‘slow-binding inhibition’ mechanism. Since the sdAb42 epitope is located relatively far away from both active and effector sites (∼20 and ∼40 Å, respectively), it seems highly unlikely that the observed ‘slow-binding inhibition’ kinetics are the result of a direct competition between sdAb42 and substrates and/or effectors. Instead, given that sdAb42 selectively binds and locks the enzyme’s inactive T state, these data can be explained by the idea that sdAb42 can only bind to trypanosomatid PYKs after having undergone an R- to T-state transition. An additional observation in this context, is the 400-fold difference between the K<sub>D</sub> and IC<sub>50</sub> values. Although we currently do not have a mechanistic explanation, similar differences have been observed for the sdAb-mediated allosteric inhibition of other kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the data demonstrate that sdAb42 inhibits three trypanosomatid PYKs through the same allosteric mechanism, of which the potency most likely depends on a combination of binding affinity and intrinsic enzyme dynamics. This probably also explains why the use of sdAb42 as an ‘intrabody’ in a <italic>T. brucei</italic> model generates a growth defect instead of completely killing off the parasite. Our results indicate that intracellular sdAb42 production impairs parasite growth in a dose-dependent manner, which we interpret as follows: increasingly higher intracellular sdAb42 levels lead to a higher degree of <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK complexation and inhibition, which in turn reduces the glycolytic flux (and/or lead to toxic accumulation of upstream glycolytic intermediates due to the lack of appropriate activity regulation mechanisms in enzymes such as hexokinase and PFK), thereby negatively impacting parasite fitness. The interplay between a lower binding affinity for <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK and the slow-binding inhibition mode necessitates that relatively high intracellular sdAb42 concentrations need to be reached to fully block all intracellular <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK activity, as suggested by the in vitro IC<sub>50</sub> measurements (<italic>Tbr</italic>PYK IC<sub>50</sub>∼1400 nM). Earlier work by Albert and colleagues suggests that achieving trypanosome death through <italic>Tbr</italic>PYK inhibition would require an 88% reduction in the enzyme’s V<sub>max</sub>, thereby resulting in lowering the glycolytic flux below 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2005</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that trypanosomes cannot survive more than 12 hr in a situation wherein their ATP synthesis flux is reduced by harvesting only 1 instead of 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfert et al., 2001</xref>). Hence, it has been proposed that novel trypanosomatid PYK inhibitors should be used in concert with inhibitors of trypanosomatid glucose transporters and PFK to achieve synergistic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haanstra et al., 2011</xref>). However, the high intracellular sdAb42 levels required to instill an 88% reduction in TbrPYK’s V<sub>max</sub> are unlikely to be reached within this model system. Especially since we observed that the transgenic parasite lines appear to specifically counter sdAb42 production (but not of the BCII10 control). Interestingly, this counter-selection does not occur at the transcript, but at the protein level. While the exact mechanism remains unknown, trypanosomes are known to mainly regulate gene expression through extensive post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clayton, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Based on the presented results, we propose that sdAb42 may pinpoint a site of vulnerability on trypanosomatid PYKs that could potentially be exploited for the design of novel chemotherapeutics. Indeed, antibodies (or fragments thereof) are valuable drug discovery tools. Antibodies (and camelid sdAbs especially) are known for their ability to ‘freeze out’ specific conformations of highly dynamic antigens, thereby exposing target sites of interest, which could be exploited for rational drug design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lawson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khamrui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Dongen et al., 2019</xref>). While the design of novel small molecules inspired on the sdAb42-mediated allosteric inhibition mechanism will require further investigation, the results presented here may provide a foundation to fuel such an endeavour.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, recombinant protein production, and purification</title><p>All details concerning cloning, protein production and purification of <italic>Tco</italic>PYK have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pinto Torres et al., 2018</xref>).

Through the determination of the crystal structure and biophysical experiments, the authors show that the nanobody binds to the inactive T-state of the enzyme, and in silico analysis shows that the binding site coincides with an allosteric hotspot, suggesting that nanobody binding may affect the enzyme active site. Binding to the T-state of the enzyme is further supported by non-linear inhibition kinetics. PYK is an important enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, and inhibition is likely to have an impact on organisms such a trypanosomes, that heavily rely on glycolysis for their energy production. The nanobody was generated against Trypanosoma congolense PYK, but for technical reasons the authors progressed to testing its impact on cell viability in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> brucei. First, they show that sdA42 is able to inhibit Tbb PYK, albeit with lower potency. Cell-based experiments next show that expression of sdA42 has a modest, and dose-dependent effect on the growth rate of Tbb. The authors conclude that their data indicates that targeting this allosteric site affects cell growth and is a valuable new option for the development of new chemotherapeutics for trypanosomatid diseases.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work clearly shows that sdA42A inhibits Trypanosome and Leishmania PYK selectively, with no inhibition of the human orthologue. The crystal structure clearly identifies the binding site of the nanobody, and the accompanying analysis supports that the antibody acts as an allosteric inhibitor of PYK, by locking the enzyme in its apo state (T-state).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The most impactful claim of this work is that sdAb42-mediated inhibition of PYK negatively affects parasite growth and that this presents an opportunity to develop novel chemotherapeutics for trypanosomatid diseases. For the following reasons I think this claim is not sufficiently supported:</p><p>- The authors do not provide evidence of target-engagement in cells, i.e. they do not show that sdA42A binds to, or inhibits, Tbb PYK in cells and/or do not provide a functional output consistent with PYK inhibition (e.g. effect on ATP production). Measuring the extent of target engagement and inhibition is important to draw conclusions from the modest effect on growth.</p><p>- The authors do not explore the selectivity of sdA42A in cells. Potentially sdA42A may cross-react with other proteins in cells, which would confound interpretation of the results.</p><p>- sdA42A only affects minor growth inhibition in Tbb. The growth defect is used as the main evidence to support targeting this site with chemotherapeutics, however based on the very modest effect on the parasites, one could reasonably claim that PYK is actually not a good drug target. The strongest effect on growth is seen for the high expressor clone in Figure 4a, however here the uninduced cells show an unusual profile, with a sudden increase in growth rate after 4 days, something that is not seen for any of the other control plots. This unexplained observation accentuates the growth difference between induced and uninduced, and the growth differences seen in all other experiments, including those with the highest expressors (clones 54 and 55) are much more modest. The loss of expression of sdA42A over time is presented as a reason for the limited effect, and used to further support the hypothesis that targeting the allosteric site is a suitable avenue for the development of new drugs. However, strong evidence for this is missing.</p><p>- For chemotherapeutic interventions to be possible, a ligandable site is required. There is no analysis provided of the antibody binding site to indicate that small molecule binding is indeed feasible.</p><p>(2) The authors comment on the modest growth inhibition, and refer to the need to achieve over 88% reduction in Vmax of PYK to see a strong effect, something that may or may not be achieved in the cell-based model (no target-engagement or functional readout provided). The slow binding model and switch of species are also raised as potential explanations. While these may be plausible explanations, they are not tested which leaves us with limited evidence to support targeting the allosteric site on PYK.</p><p>(3) The evidence to support an allosteric mechanism is derived from structural studies, including the in silico allosteric network predictions. Unfortunately, standard enzyme kinetics mode of inhibition studies are missing. Such studies could distinguish uncompetitive from non-competitive behaviour and strengthen the claim that sdAb42 locks the enzyme complex in the apo form.</p><p>(4) As general comment, the graphical representation of the data could be improved in line with recent recommendations: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/5114d8e9/webinar-report-transforming-data-visualisation-to-improve-transparency-and-reproducibility">https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/5114d8e9/webinar-report-transforming-data-visualisation-to-improve-transparency-and-reproducibility</ext-link>.</p><p>- Bar-charts for potency are ideally presented as dot plots, showing the individual data points, or box plots with datapoints shown.</p><p>- Images in Figure 7 show significant heterogeneity of nanobody expression, but the extent of this can not be gleaned from Figure 7B. It would be much better to use box plots or violin plots for each cell line on this figure panel. The same applies to Figure 10.</p><p>Comments on revision:</p><p>The authors have reduced the emphasis on the potential drug discovery applications. They are now referring to opportunities using a so called &quot;chemo-superior&quot; approach. This is not a commonly used term, and the newly added text seems to indicate that &quot;chemo-superiors&quot; target sites exposed by antibody binding, whereas the paper that the authors refer to (Lawson, 2012), defines &quot;chemo-superiors&quot; as small-molecules that induce similar effects to antibodies. I suggest removing the term &quot;chemo-superior&quot; altogether, as it has not been used since being coined in 2012, and instead simply point out the examples where antibodies have successfully informed small molecule design.</p><p>Unfortunately, the authors were unable to carry out additional experiments. Any experimental data to support their hypotheses as to why the observed growth defect is only marginal, and how the effect on growth could be increased, would have been very useful. As such, the evidence to support embarking on a drug discovery campaign for this allosteric site remains very limited.</p><p>The authors do provide some evidence of a druggable allosteric pocket, that partially overlaps with the antibody binding site, which is useful. However, I also ran the APOP tool on TcoPYK and it reveals 217 potential allosteric pockets all over the protein. The authors should provide the rank and APOP confidence score for the pocket that they have selected, to show that this is a high confidence allosteric pocket.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100066.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Out of the 20 Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) highlighted by the WHO, three are caused by members of the trypanosomatids, namely Leishmanaisis, Trypanosomiasis, and Chagas disease. Trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes including pyruvate kinase (PyK) have long been recognised as potential targets. In this important study, single-chain camelid antibodies have been developed as novel and potent inhibitors of PyK from the T, congolense. To gain structural insight into the mode of action, binding was further characterised by biophysical and structural methods, including crystal structure determination of the enzyme-nanobody complex. The results revealed a novel allosteric mechanism/pathway with significant potential for the future development of novel drugs targeting allosteric and/or cryptic binding sites.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper covers an important area of science towards the development of novel therapies for three of the Neglected Tropical Diseases. The manuscript is very clearly written with excellent graphics making it accessible to a wide readership beyond experts. Particular strengths are the wide range of experimental and computational techniques applied to an important biological problem. The use of nanobodies in all areas from biophysical binding experiments and X-ray crystallography to in-vivo studies is particularly impressive. This is likely to inspire researchers from many areas to consider the use of nanobodies in their fields.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There is no particular weakness, but I think the computational analysis of allostery, which basically relies on a single server could have been more detailed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id

In this re-worked version, we implemented the textual changes suggested by the reviewers and performed additional in silico work. The reviewers also presented valuable suggestions for additional experiments. However, we currently don’t have dedicated hands and funding for this project, which renders it impossible for us to perform additional “wet lab” experiments at this stage. We have thus not included new experimental “wet lab” data. Finally, the claim that our results may be exploited for the design of novel chemotherapeutics perhaps came across stronger than we intended to. We still believe our findings indicate a potential for such an endeavor, but this clearly requires further investigation and experimental evidence. We have softened this statement by removing it from the abstract and have edited the discussion to end as follows.</p><p>“Based on the presented results, we propose that sdAb42 may pinpoint a site of vulnerability on trypanosomatid PYKs that could potentially be exploited for the design of novel chemotherapeutics. Indeed, antibodies (or fragments thereof) are valuable drug discovery tools. Antibodies (and camelid sdAbs especially) are known for their ability to &quot;freeze out&quot; specific conformations of highly dynamic antigens, thereby exposing target sites of interest, which could be exploited for rational drug design (the development of so-called &quot;chemo-superiors&quot;, (Lawson, 2012; Khamrui et al., 2013; van Dongen et al., 2019)). While the design of a &quot;chemo-superior&quot; inspired on the sdAb42-mediated allosteric inhibition mechanism will require further investigation, the results presented here provide a foundation to fuel such an endeavour.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>REVIEWER 1:</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors identified nanobodies that were specific for the trypanosomal enzyme pyruvate kinase in previous work seeking diagnostic tools.

The reality is that with fexinidazole now available and acoziborole soon to be available, with &lt;1,000 cases of human African trypanosomiasis in each of the last five years, the case for needing new drugs is difficult to make. For Animal trypanosomiasis, however, the need for novel drugs is much more pressing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and have included an additional section in the Introduction’s second paragraph, which reads as follows.</p><p>“Hence, there is a need for alternative compounds, preferably with novel modes of action and/or designed based on mechanistic insights of the target’s structure-function relationship (Field et al., 2017; De Rycker et al., 2018). This need is especially pressing for AAT, which strongly impedes sustainable livestock rearing in Sub-Saharan Africa. AAT results in drastic reductions of draft power, meat, and milk production by the infected animals (small and large ruminants), and its control relies mainly on vector control and chemotherapy, with only few drugs currently available. The lack of routine field diagnosis has resulted in the misuse of trypanocidal drugs, thereby accelerating the rise of parasite resistance and further exacerbating the problem (Richards et al., 2021). As such, AAT-inflicted annual losses are estimated at around $5 billion (and the necessity to invest another $30 million each year to control AAT through chemotherapy), thereby having a devastating impact on the socio-economic development of Sub-Saharan Africa (Fetene et al., 2021). In contrast, HAT is perceived as a minor threat as it has reached a post-elimination phase as a public health problem with less than 1,000 yearly documented cases (Franco et al., 2022). In addition, new and effective drugs for HAT treatment have recently become available (De Rycker et al., 2023). HAT control currently relies on case detection and treatment, and vector control (Büscher et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1.2: A few pedantic things can be tidied up too, for example on line 61 it is stated tsetse flies are part of the life cycle for all trypanosomes while some veterinary species e.g. T. evansi and some T.vivax strains use other biting flies for transmission.

This non-glycosomal enzyme catalyses the last step of the glycolysis (the irreversible conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate; Figure 1A). The importance of this reaction is two-fold: (i) the generation of ATP through the transfer of a phosphoryl group from PEP to ADP and (ii) the formation of pyruvate, a crucial metabolite of the central metabolism. Like most PYKs, trypanosomatid PYKs are homotetramers. The PYK monomer is a ∼55 kDa protein organized into four domains termed ’N’, ’A’, ’B’, and ’C’ (Figure 1B). The A domain constitutes the largest part of the PYK monomer and is characterized by an (𝛼/𝛽)8-TIM barrel fold that contains the active site. Together with the N-terminal domain, it is also involved in the formation of the PYK tetramer AA’ dimer interfaces. The B domain is known as the flexible ’lid’ domain that shields the active site during enzyme-mediated phosphotransfer. Finally, the C domain harbors the binding pocket for allosteric effectors and stabilizes the PYK tetramer by formation of CC’ dimer interfaces. Because of their role in ATP production and distribution of fluxes into different metabolic branches, the activity of trypanosomatid PYKs is tightly regulated through an allosteric mechanism known as the &quot;rock and lock&quot; model (Morgan et al., 2010, 2014; Pinto Torres et al., 2020). In this model (which is detailed in Figure 1C), the binding of substrates and/or effectors (and analogs thereof) to the active and effector sites, respectively, trigger a conformational change from the enzymatically inactive T state to the catalytically active R state. Known effector molecules for trypanosomatid PYKs are fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F26BP), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16BP) and sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), with F26BP being the most potent one (van Schaftingen et al., 1985; Callens and Opperdoes, 1992; Ernest et al., 1994; Tulloch et al., 2008). Interestingly, trypanosomatid PYKs seem to be largely unresponsive to the allosteric regulation of enzyme activity by free amino acids (Callens et al., 1991), which contrasts with human PYKs (Chaneton et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2018). Known trypanosomatid PYK inhibitors impair enzymatic activity through occupation of the PYK active site (Morgan et al., 2011).”</p><p>In the Results, although I am not qualified to analyse the structural data in detail I am confident in the ability of the authors to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1.4: Differences in nanobody binding kinetics to the T. congolense enzyme when compared to <italic>T. brucei</italic> and Leishmania enzymes are attributed to the relatively few amino acid differences in those sites.

Instead, given that sdAb42 selectively binds and locks the enzyme’s inactive T state, these data can be explained by the idea that sdAb42 can only bind to trypanosomatid PYKs after having undergone an R- to T-state transition. To clarify this matter, we slightly reformulated the discussion as indicated below.

The system adapts to the lowered flux and relevant changes are mostly transient.

Through the determination of the crystal structure and biophysical experiments, the authors show that the nanobody binds to the inactive T-state of the enzyme, and in silico analysis shows that the binding site coincides with an allosteric hotspot, suggesting that nanobody binding may affect the enzyme active site. Binding to the T-state of the enzyme is further supported by non-linear inhibition kinetics. PYK is an important enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, and inhibition is likely to have an impact on organisms such a trypanosomes, that heavily rely on glycolysis for their energy production. The nanobody was generated against Trypanosoma congolense PYK, but for technical reasons the authors progressed to testing its impact on cell viability in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> brucei. First, they show that sdA42 is able to inhibit Tbb PYK, albeit with lower potency. Cell-based experiments next show that expression of sdA42 has a modest, and dose-dependent effect on the growth rate of Tbb. The authors conclude that their data indicates that targeting this allosteric site affects cell growth and is a valuable new option for the development of new chemotherapeutics for trypanosomatid diseases.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work clearly shows that sdA42A inhibits Trypanosome and Leishmania PYK selectively, with no inhibition of the human orthologue. The crystal structure clearly identifies the binding site of the nanobody, and the accompanying analysis supports that the antibody acts as an allosteric inhibitor of PYK, by locking the enzyme in its apo state (T-state).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The most impactful claim of this work is that sdAb42-mediated inhibition of PYK negatively affects parasite growth and that this presents an opportunity to develop novel chemotherapeutics for trypanosomatid diseases. For the following reasons I think this claim is not sufficiently supported:</p><p>Comment 2.1: The authors do not provide evidence of target-engagement in cells, i.e. they do not show that sdA42A binds to, or inhibits, Tbb PYK in cells and/or do not provide a functional output consistent with PYK inhibition (e.g. effect on ATP production). Measuring the extent of target engagement and inhibition is important to draw conclusions from the modest effect on growth.</p><p>The authors do not explore the selectivity of sdA42A in cells. Potentially sdA42A may cross-react with other proteins in cells, which would confound interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern. While it is theoretically possible that sdAb42 may non-specifically (cross-)react with other proteins in the cell, this would be highly unlikely based on the following arguments. First, many studies have employed sdAbs as intrabodies and reported on specific sdAb-mediated effects (outstanding reviews on the topic are Cheloha et al. (PMID 32868455) and Soetens et al. (PMID 33322697)). Second, it has been demonstrated that selecting sdAbs from an immune library through phage display or “bacteriomatch” (a bacterial system similar to yeast two hybrid) yields highly similar results (Pellis et al., PMID 22583807), thereby indicating that sdAbs interact specifically with their target antigens in an intracellular environment. Third, we identified TcoPYK as the target for sdAb42 by employing sdAb42 as bait in a pull-down from a parasite whole cell lysate (Pinto Torres et al., PMID 29899344). The pull-down fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and we observed a clear prominent band, which was further analysed by mass spectrometry and revealed TcoPYK as the target with great certainty. Even though the affinity of sdAb42 for TbrPYK is lower, it still remains high (nM affinity) and we expect it to bind TbrPYK with high specificity.</p><p>Regarding measuring the effect on ATP production, we would like to state that such experiments are not obvious. Instead of measuring ATP levels, one should measure ATP turnover as ATP levels may not necessarily be decreased. The latter was observed to be the case for the specific inhibition of trypanosomal PFK (Nare et al. PMID 36864883). The specific trypanosomal PFK inhibitor inhibits motility (and growth) of T. congolense IL3000 at concentrations that only slightly affect ATP levels. One could think of repeating the sdAb42 experiments in a T. congolense model. However, T. congolense BSF metabolism is more complicated than that of <italic>T. brucei</italic> BSF. First, the T. congolense glucose metabolic network is more expanded, allowing a lower glucose consumption rate to produce ATP and metabolites for growth. Second, pyruvate is not excreted but further metabolised, in part in the mitochondrion. Steketee et al. (PMID 34310651) have shown that T. congolense also takes up pyruvate from the medium. One can thus check if (increased) external pyruvate (partially) rescues the growth inhibition by sdAb42. It will not provide proof, but maybe an indication. As mentioned above, we are currently unable to perform such additional experiments due to lack of dedicated hands and funding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2.2: sdA42A only affects minor growth inhibition in Tbb. The growth defect is used as the main evidence to support targeting this site with chemotherapeutics, however based on the very modest effect on the parasites, one could reasonably claim that PYK is actually not a good drug target. The strongest effect on growth is seen for the high expressor clone in Figure 4a, however here the uninduced cells show an unusual profile, with a sudden increase in growth rate after 4 days, something that is not seen for any of the other control plots. This unexplained observation accentuates the growth difference between induced and uninduced, and the growth differences seen in all other experiments, including those with the highest expressors (clones 54 and 55) are much more modest. The loss of expression of sdA42A over time is presented as a reason for the limited effect, and used to further support the hypothesis that targeting the allosteric site is a suitable avenue for the development of new drugs. However, strong evidence for this is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the growth effect of sdAb42 expression is modest, and we have provided several explanations as to why this could be the case. In addition, as mentioned at the start of this rebuttal, the claim that our results may be exploited for the design of novel chemotherapeutics was perhaps expressed stronger than we intended to. We still believe our findings indicate a potential for such an endeavor, but this clearly requires further investigation and experimental evidence as mentioned by the reviewer.</p><p>We, however, disagree that PYK would not be a good drug target. Its potential to serve as a drug target is related to its fundamentally important role in trypanosomal glycolysis and not to the features of sdAb42. Steketee et al. (PMID 34310651) have shown that glycolysis is essential for <italic>T. congolense</italic> BSF, despite a lower glycolytic flux than in <italic>T. brucei</italic> BSF. The <italic>T. congolense</italic> glucose metabolic network is more expanded, allowing a lower glucose consumption rate to produce ATP and metabolites for growth. Also here, PYK is thus almost certainly essential and from that perspective a good drug target.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2.3: For chemotherapeutic interventions to be possible, a ligandable site is required. There is no analysis provided of the antibody binding site to indicate that small molecule binding is indeed feasible.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment and have included APOP analysis on the TcoPYK T state crystal structure (see also reply to Comment 3.1). Briefly, APOP works by detecting pockets and then perturbing each pocket in the protein's elastic network (GNM) by adding stiffer springs between the surrounding residues. The pockets are scored and ranked based on the calculated shifts in the eigenvalues of the global GNM modes and their local hydrophobic densities, thereby also considering the pocket’s surface accessibility, which renders it suitable for the identification of allosteric (and druggable) pockets. The APOP analysis identifies pockets overlapping with the sdAb42 epitope as highly ranking allosteric ligand binding pockets. The data have been summarized in an additional supplementary figure (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1). The manuscript also contains details on the performed APOP analysis in the Materials and Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2.4: The authors comment on the modest growth inhibition, and refer to the need to achieve over 88% reduction in Vmax of PYK to see a strong effect, something that may or may not be achieved in the cell-based model (no target-engagement or functional readout provided). The slow binding model and switch of species are also raised as potential explanations. While these may be plausible explanations, they are not tested which leaves us with limited evidence to support targeting the allosteric site on PYK.</p></disp-quote><p>In our understanding of this remark, we believe it be related to Comments 2.1 and 2.2 and thus refer to our answers formulated above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2.5: The evidence to support an allosteric mechanism is derived from structural studies, including the in silico allosteric network predictions.

Although such a thorough kinetic analysis would be interesting in its own right, we would like to argue that this type of very detailed kinetics is outside the scope of this paper. This is especially the case taking into account that this analysis could be complicated by the slow-onset inhibition behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2.6: As general comment, the graphical representation of the data could be improved in line with recent recommendations: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/5114d8e9/webinar-report-transforming-data-visualisation-to-improve-transparency-and-reproducibility">https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/5114d8e9/webinar-report-transforming-data-visualisation-to-improve-transparency-and-reproducibility</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Bar-charts for potency are ideally presented as dot plots, showing the individual data points, or box plots with datapoints shown.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Images in Figure 7 show significant heterogeneity of nanobody expression, but the extent of this can not be gleaned from Figure 7B.

This conversion from v<sub>0</sub> to v<sub>ss</sub> indeed occurs in a fashion following single exponential behavior.
