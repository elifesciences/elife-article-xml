Argonaute proteins, forming the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), to repress target gene expression post-transcriptionally. Although microRNAs are critical regulators in mammalian cell differentiation, our understanding of how microRNA machinery, such as the miRISC, are regulated during development is still limited. We previously showed that repressing the production of one Argonaute protein, Ago2, by Trim71 is important for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) self-renewal (Liu et al., 2021). Here, we show that among the four Argonaute proteins in mammals, Ago2 is the major developmentally regulated Argonaute protein in mESCs. Moreover, in pluripotency, besides the Trim71-mediated regulation of <italic>Ago2</italic> (Liu et al., 2021), <italic>Mir182/Mir183</italic> also repress <italic>Ago2</italic>. Specific inhibition of this microRNA-mediated repression results in stemness defects and accelerated differentiation through the let-7 microRNA pathway.

Most miRNAs are produced from long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) through successive processing by two double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) endonucleases named Drosha and Dicer, generating pre-miRNAs and ~22 nt dsRNAs, respectively. One RNA strand in the ~22 nt dsRNA, the mature miRNA, is selectively incorporated into the Argonaute (Ago) protein, forming the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ha and Kim, 2014</xref>). In animals, miRISC recognizes its target mRNAs through partial base pairings mediated by the miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartel, 2009</xref>). The Ago protein recruits GW182 proteins to down-regulate target mRNA expression through mRNA degradation and/or translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nilsen, 2007</xref>). Although miRNAs play critical regulatory roles in mammalian cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameres and Zamore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebert and Sharp, 2012</xref>), our understanding on how miRNA machinery, particularly the miRISC, are regulated during development is still limited.</p><p>We recently found that Ago2, a key component in the miRISC, is repressed at the mRNA translation level by an RNA-binding protein named Trim71 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). This repression of <italic>Ago2</italic> inhibits stem cell differentiation mediated by the conserved pro-differentiation let-7 miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Büssing et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Ago2</italic> is developmentally regulated during stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, and beg for characterization of additional regulators of <italic>Ago2</italic>. Moreover, besides Ago2, there are three additional Ago proteins (Ago1, Ago3, Ago4) in mammals that function redundantly in the miRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Meister, 2013</xref>). The relative abundance of these Ago proteins and their contribution to miRNA activities during cell differentiation, however, are still unknown.</p><p>Here, using mESC fate decisions between pluripotency and differentiation as a mammalian cell differentiation model, we determined that Ago2 is the predominant Ago protein in mESCs, and Ago2 level increases when mESCs exit pluripotency. In the pluripotent state, <italic>Mir182</italic> and <italic>Mir183</italic>, two conserved miRNAs abundantly expressed in mESCs, repress <italic>Ago2</italic> and control the stemness of mESCs. Specific inhibition of <italic>Mir182</italic>/<italic>Mir183</italic>-mediated repression of <italic>Ago2</italic> results in stemness defects and accelerated differentiation of mESCs through the let-7 miRNA pathway.

Two miRNAs abundantly expressed in mESCs, <italic>Mir182</italic>/<italic>Mir183</italic>, contribute to the repression of <italic>Ago2</italic> in the pluripotent state. This miRNA-mediated regulation of <italic>Ago2</italic> is critical to maintaining stemness. Our findings raise several interesting aspects of miRNAs in stem cell biology.</p><p>First, since Ago2 is the predominant Ago protein in mESCs, the Ago2 expression pattern during mESCs’ transition from self-renewal to differentiation argues that although certain individual miRNAs may be required for pluripotency (e.g., <italic>Mir182/Mir183</italic>), the global miRNA activity is suppressed in the pluripotent state and induced when mESCs initiate differentiation. Consistent with this notion, knocking out key components in global miRNA biogenesis, such as Dgcr8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kanellopoulou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Murchison et al., 2005</xref>), or Ago2 in the miRISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), does not negatively affect mESCs self-renewal. However, differentiation in all these mutant mESCs is severely compromised. Thus, at the global level, miRNAs may play more important roles in mESC differentiation.</p><p>Second, previous studies indicate that the two components of the miRISC, the Ago protein and its associated miRNA, mutually regulate each other. In the absence of miRNAs, the Ago protein is destabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Martinez and Gregory, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Smibert et al., 2013</xref>), while miRNAs are also unstable if they are not associated with Ago proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Winter and Diederichs, 2011</xref>). Thus, the effective miRNA activity depends on the limiting component in the miRISC. Our previous studies indicated that the conserved pro-differentiation <italic>let-7</italic> miRNAs are sensitive to Ago2 levels because an increase of Ago2 results in specific stabilization of <italic>let-7</italic> miRNAs that are otherwise degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, for <italic>let-7</italic> miRISC, Ago2 is possibly the limiting component in mESCs. Repression of <italic>Ago2</italic> by either <italic>Mir182</italic>/<italic>Mir183</italic> as we characterized here or Trim71 as we identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) likely limits the effective <italic>let-7</italic> miRISCs. Interestingly, the pro-differentiation <italic>let-7</italic> miRICSs can positively auto-regulate their own biogenesis through inhibiting Lin28a, a conserved <italic>let-7</italic> target, because Lin28a inhibits the biogenesis of <italic>let-7</italic> miRNAs through promoting their pre-miRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tsialikas and Romer-Seibert, 2015</xref>). Thus, the effective <italic>let-7</italic> miRNAs need to be tightly controlled in stem cells. The two repression mechanisms on <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA contribute to limiting the amount of effective <italic>let-7</italic> miRISCs and maintaining pluripotency in mESCs. We speculate that similar mechanisms of regulating miRISCs by RNA-binding proteins and miRNAs may exist in other developmental processes. Moreover, Ago2 is dysregulated under many pathological conditions, such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, regulating miRISCs through modulating Ago2 levels may also contribute to pathogenesis.</p><p>Finally, it is noticed that the <italic>Mir182Δ/Mir183Δ</italic> mESCs displayed stronger defects in self-renewal and differentiation than the 3’UTR mutant mESCs did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Thus, besides <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA, <italic>Mir182</italic>/<italic>Mir183</italic> may regulate additional mRNAs that are important for stem cell biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Pre-miRNA and miRNA quantifications were using the Takara’s Mir-X miRNA quantification method. qPCR was performed in triplicate for each sample using the SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Proteins were harvested in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktail) and quantified with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to PVDF membranes. Western blotting was performed using a BlotCycler (Precision Biosystems) with the corresponding primary and secondary antibodies. The membranes were then treated with the Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad), and the resulting signal was detected using an ImageQuant LAS 500 instrument (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Colony formation assay and exit pluripotency assay</title><p>For colony formation assay, 500 cells were plated on a 12-well plate in 2i + Lif media or Lif media (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 15% FBS, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1000 U/ml Lif). For exit from pluripotency assay, 1000 cells were plated on a gelatin-coated six-well plate in differentiation media (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 15% FBS, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) for 2 days, then cultured in 2i + Lif media for another 5 days.

The cells were then harvested and lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween-20, with freshly added proteinase inhibitors). The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was used for RNA antisense purification; 5 mg lysate in 500 µl lysis buffer was used for each purification. Specifically, a set of 5’-end biotinylated anti-sense DNA oligos and 5 µl RNase inhibitor (NEB) were added to the lysate, resulting in a final concentration of 0.1 µM for each oligo. The lysate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr on a rotating platform. Then, 100 µl Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen) was added and the lysate further incubated for 30 min at room temperature on a rotating platform. The magnetic beads were isolated through a magnetic stand and then subject to four washes, with each wash in 500 µl high salt wash buffer (5× PBS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100). The washed beads were resuspended in 100 µl DNaseI digestion mix (1× DNaseI digestion buffer with 5 µl DNaseI [NEB]) and incubated at 37°C for 20 min, followed by adding 350 µl LET-SDS buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM LiCl, 20 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1% SDS) and 50 µl proteinase K (20 mg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The beads were then incubated on a thermomixer at 55°C 1000 rpm for 2 hr. The RNA was isolated through phenol extraction and isopropanol precipitation with glycoblue (Ambion) as a coprecipitant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Antibodies, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72289-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72289-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Through a series of in vitro molecular assays, the authors showed that AGO2 is the major developmentally regulated Argonaute protein in mESCs, and that AGO2 is repressed by microRNA-182/microRNA-183. The experiments appear well-designed and the methods are technically sound. However, the study provides only marginal conceptual advances, especially given the very recent publication of a study by the same group showing how AGO2 is regulated by the heterochronic gene Trim71 (Liu et al., 2021, <italic>eLife</italic>).

Corroborating previous evidences establishing high mRNA levels for only one paralog of Argonautes (Ago2) in mESCs, the authors demonstrated that the Ago2 is expressed at high levels in mESCs at protein levels too, and that the AGO2 levels are elevated upon mESC differentiation. Using many independent and orthogonal experiments, the authors find with abundance of evidence that miRNAs, miR-182 and miR-183 whose conserved bindings are present in the 3'UTR of Ago2 and whose expression negatively correlates with AGO2 levels in mESCs directly repress AGO2 levels and that the loss of this miRNA-mediated repression of AGO2 promotes enhanced differentiation of mESCs in vitro. The strongest evidence of this direct regulation of AGO2 comes from the experiments where miR-182/183 sites are deleted in the AGO2 3'UTR (3'UTR mutant), which recapitulates the phenotype. While these results robustly show that AGO2/miR-182/183 axis enhances mESC differentiation during the induced transition of mESCs from the ground state to the primed state, this work doesn't show whether this axis is sufficient to control the differentiation in the ground/naive state. Finally, in concordance with their prior findings (Liu et al. 2021), the authors show that the AGO2 levels modulated by miR-182/183 also control the let-7-dependent differentiation of mESCs.</p><p>While the previous reports showed that miR-182/183 suppresses differentiation-inducing miRNAs, including let-7, miR-26 and miR-218, this work forms a unique niche and provides a link between miR-182/183 and let-7 in the form of miR-182/183-mediated repression of AGO2. The experiments in this paper follow a logical progression and provide high quality data. The conclusions are mostly supported by the data.</p><p>However, in its current form, this paper needs clarification on some fundamental aspects and some additional data. See below for the details.</p><p>1) The authors use as readout the reduction in colony formation during the transition of mESCs to the primed state, where the undifferentiated colonies are already reduced to 30%, and where there could be many confounding effects from large transcriptional changes. It is surprising that the authors didn't use the colony formation in naive/ground state as the readout and show that the increased AGO2 levels cause cells to lose stemness. They could potentially see much larger effects in the ground state, attributable directly to AGO2/miR-182/183. If using naive/ground state in these experiments is experimentally not feasible, the authors should discuss that.</p><p>2) Though the authors conclude that the elevated levels of AGO2 selectively stabilizes let-7 family members, the mechanism of this selectively is lacking. This model might be an over-simplification, since the increased AGO2 levels can cause system-wide cascade of direct and indirect effects, some of which might be responsible for this increased selectivity. It is likely that LIN28A, which is expressed at higher levels in mESCs and is involved in the well-established feedback loop with let-7 miRNA family, is involved in this let-7-specificity. A plausible alternative hypothesis is that the increased levels of AGO2 in 3'UTR mutant or during differentiation stabilizes all actively produced mature miRNAs equally. However, most miRNAs may not cause an immediate impact on levels of other miRNAs or the miRNA machinery, but the newly formed let-7-miRISCs reduce the high levels of LIN28A, promoting the elevated levels of mature let-7 miRNAs, which competes with other mature miRNAs and saturates the newly formed AGO2 molecules. This hypothesis doesn't assume that the increased AGO2 selectively stabilizes let-7 solitarily.</p><p>3) The authors claim that AGO2 repression via miR-182/183 is important for proper differentiation of mESC, however, the data in this paper doesn't show an impact of AGO2 repression on defective differentiation.</p><p>Some potential outstanding questions that the authors may want to explore towards this paper or the future work are: (1) how do miR-182/183 levels are modulated during the differentiation process and if modulating their levels is sufficient to promote differentiation in the ground/naive state; (2) this paper suggests that the inhibition of many differentiation-inducing miRNAs that has been shown previously to be trigged by miR-182/183 (Wang et al., 2017), is orchestrated through miR-182/183 mediated suppression of miRISC machinery. It would be of great importance to investigate how do miR-182/183 themselves escape the effect of inhibited miRISC machinery, e.g., do these miRNAs have higher half-life in mESCs? (3) Does the loss of AGO2 repression only enhance the differentiation or does it also trigger defective differentiation? (4) What is the significance of this regulation in vivo.</p><p>&quot;Two lines of evidence indicated that miR-182/miR-183 targets Ago2 mRNA.&quot; – should use &quot;regulates&quot; instead of &quot;targets&quot;, since the evidence for direct targeting comes later in the paper.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;microRNA-mediated regulation of microRNA machinery controls cell fate decisions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors demonstrated that the Ago2 is expressed at high levels in mESCs at protein levels and that the AGO2 levels are elevated upon mESC differentiation.

This revised manuscript includes additional data and clarifications: the authors have responded effectively to comments raised in review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Liu and colleagues follow-up on their previous work showing that Ago2 expression is regulated in mESC by Trim-71 by proposing that Ago2 expression is also directly regulated by miR-182/miR-183 and that loss of this interaction affect mESC differentiation by resulting in let-7 stabilization.</p><p>Using elegant genetic and biochemical approaches they convincingly show that Ago2 is directly repressed by miR-183/miR-183, as either loss of these two miRNAs or mutation of their binding sites in the Ago2 3'UTR results in upregulation of Ago2 expression by approximately 2 fold.</p><p>They also show that targeted inactivation of miR-182/183 and, to a slightly lesser extent, mutation of miR-182/miR-183 binding sites in Ago2's 3'UTR promote differentiation of mESC in vitro.</p><p>The manuscript is very well written, the experiments are elegant and include all the appropriate controls, and their results are largely consistent with the model proposed by the authors. While the authors convincingly demonstrate that miR-182/182 directly regulate Ago2, it is slightly less clear whether the proposed increased activity of let-7 can fully explain the observed phenotype.</p><p>Overall this is a solid manuscript, although as discussed below not all conclusions are supported by conclusive evidence. I concur with reviewer 1 that the study provides relatively minor conceptual advance, but it can be argued that these results will be of interest to specialists in the field of miRNa and ESC biology.</p><p>A major concern I have regards the strength of the conclusion that the impaired stem cell function upon loss of miR-182/183 activity on Ago2 is mediated by increased activity of let-7. The LNA-based experiments are suggestive, but although they prove that blocking let-7 helps preventing differentiation, they do not prove that increased let-7 function underlies the observed phenotype in the Ago2 UTR mutant. In fact, the only evidence that let-7 activity is increased is a modest upregulation of let-7 members expression. Whether this is sufficient to affect gene expression to a detectable extent is unclear. The evidence would be strengthened substantially if the authors showed increased let-7-mediated gene repression in the UTR mutant. A straightforward and relatively inexpensive experiment would be to perform RNAseq analysis on the wt and UTR-mutant mESCs. The authors' model leads to the prediction that the a relatively selective de-repression of predicted let-7 targets should be observed in the UTR mutant samples.</p><p>1) Figures 2C and 2D appear swapped in their description in the main text (lines 107-114)</p><p>2) lines 132-135: I am not sure the authors can define the effect of the 3'UTR as not &quot;in cis&quot;. Even if mediated by loss of miRNA binding, as is likely, the effect would still be on the transcript harboring the mutation, so technically, as far as I know, in cis. Perhaps a different language would be more appropriate. For example, the authors could say that the fact that deletion of miR-182/183 in a the 3'UTR-mut background doesn't result in additional upregulation of Ago2 provides additional evidence that the UTR mutation results in Ago2 upregulation by preventing miR-182/183 binding.</p><p>3) It appears to me that loss of miR-182/183 has a stronger effect on ESC differentiation than mutation of their Ago2 3'UTR binding sites. This suggests that miR-182 promote ESC pluripotency by additional mechanism independent from Ago2. Perhaps the authors should comment on this in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72289.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

It is surprising that the authors didn't use the colony formation in naive/ground state as the readout and show that the increased AGO2 levels cause cells to lose stemness. They could potentially see much larger effects in the ground state, attributable directly to AGO2/miR-182/183. If using naive/ground state in these experiments is experimentally not feasible, the authors should discuss that.</p></disp-quote><p>The naïve/ground state mESCs were maintained through culturing mESCs in the presence of two chemical inhibitors: PD0325901 and CHIR-99021, which block mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3, respectively. These inhibitions potently block the stem cell differentiation, thereby maintaining mESCs in the naïve/ground state. Although this condition provides high percentage of AP+ colonies in the colony formation assay, the strong inhibition of differentiation by the chemical inhibitors will “mask” many pro-differentiation effects. Thus, the colony formation assay is usually performed in the 15% FBS + Lif medium, where both prostemness and pro-differentiation phenotypes can be observed.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we add this rational so that general readers can understand why we did the stemness assays in the 15% FBS + Lif medium instead of the 2i+lif medium (line 109 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Though the authors conclude that the elevated levels of AGO2 selectively stabilizes let-7 family members, the mechanism of this selectively is lacking. This model might be an over-simplification, since the increased AGO2 levels can cause system-wide cascade of direct and indirect effects, some of which might be responsible for this increased selectivity. It is likely that LIN28A, which is expressed at higher levels in mESCs and is involved in the well-established feedback loop with let-7 miRNA family, is involved in this let-7-specificity. A plausible alternative hypothesis is that the increased levels of AGO2 in 3'UTR mutant or during differentiation stabilizes all actively produced mature miRNAs equally. However, most miRNAs may not cause an immediate impact on levels of other miRNAs or the miRNA machinery, but the newly formed let-7-miRISCs reduce the high levels of LIN28A, promoting the elevated levels of mature let-7 miRNAs, which competes with other mature miRNAs and saturates the newly formed AGO2 molecules. This hypothesis doesn't assume that the increased AGO2 selectively stabilizes let-7 solitarily.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this reviewer’s very insightful comments on the potential mechanisms by which the increased Ago2 specifically stabilizes and increases let-7 miRNAs in mESCs. Indeed, the data from our previous paper (Liu et al., 2021 <italic>eLife</italic>) indicated that Lin28a plays an important role in the let-7’s specific response to Ago2 levels, which is exactly as the reviewer predicted. Specifically, in Figure 5 of the previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper, we showed that when Ago2 level was induced, in addition to the specific increase of let7 mature miRNAs, there were also specific decrease of both Lin28a and Trim71, the two conserved (from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to human) targets of let-7 microRNAs. Thus, Ago2, let7 miRNAs, and Lin28a forms a delicate regulatory loop, which makes let-7 mature miRNA level sensitive to Ago2 levels. Specifically, a slight increase of the let-7 miRNAs caused by elevated Ago2 decreases Lin28a. This decrease alleviates Lin28a-mediated inhibition on the maturation of let-7 miRNAs, resulting in more let-7 pre-miRNAs become mature let-7 miRNAs, which further decreases Lin28a levels and prevents more let-7 pre-miRNA from Lin28a-mediated degradation. Thus, this positive regulatory loop amplifies let-7 miRNAs and makes the pro-differentiation let-7 miRNAs sensitive to Ago2 levels in stem cells. We made this point in the Discussion section of the previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper.</p><p>Although the regulatory loop involving Lin28a is the most likely explanation, we agree with the reviewer that it is difficult to identify the exact causal factor on why let-7 is specifically increased when Ago2 is elevated, using the in vivo system. Because as the reviewer nicely points out “the increased AGO2 levels can cause system-wide cascade of direct and indirect effects, some of which might be responsible for this increased selectivity.” We believe a complete resolution on this issue would require an in vitro system that can recapitulate these regulatory events, which can limit the potential system-wide cascade of indirect effects and enable specific and direct studies on the interplay among let-7 miRNA (pre-miRNA), Lin28a, Ago2, and Dicer (pre-miRNA processing machinery). Unfortunately, however, currently we don’t know such an in vitro system exists. Thus, we acknowledge the limitations in interpreting the results from the in vivo studies in mESCs.</p><p>As discussed above, our current work is closely related to the previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper. Thus, we feel the Research Advance format of <italic>eLife</italic>, which can be linked to the previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper, would be an ideal format for us to present these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that AGO2 repression via miR-182/183 is important for proper differentiation of mESC, however, the data in this paper doesn't show an impact of AGO2 repression on defective differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel the definition on “defective differentiation” mentioned by the reviewer is vague to us. Because “defective differentiation” can suggest many scenarios (e.g., mESCs do not differentiate at all, differentiate faster or slower, etc.). If we define the “defective differentiation” as any differentiation process that is different from the WT mESCs differentiation, then we believe that our results from this manuscript and the previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper shows that repressing Ago2 expression (by either miR-182/miR-183 in this study or Trim71 as described in the previous study) prevents mESCs from defective differentiation (as loss of these regulations accelerate the differentiation process of mESCs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some potential outstanding questions that the authors may want to explore towards this paper or the future work are:</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful comments and suggestions on this work and on our future studies. We provide our response below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) How do miR-182/183 levels are modulated during the differentiation process and if modulating their levels is sufficient to promote differentiation in the ground/naive state;</p></disp-quote><p>First, previous genomic studies and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional studies (Pulecio et al., 2017; Rajagopal et al., 2016) indicate that at the transcriptional level, the production of miR-182 and miR-183 is regulated by the pluripotency factor Nanog in mESCs. These observations explain, in part (at the production level), why these miRNAs are highly expressed in mESCs.</p><p>Second, the ground state of mESCs is a transient developmental stage, and in culture, this state is normally maintained via the two chemical inhibitors (PD0325901 and CHIR99021). As discussed in the first point of the public review from this reviewer, these two chemical inhibitors “mask” many pro-differentiation effects. The following two observations (from our study and the literature), obtained from standard mESC culture conditions (15% FBS + lif), however, argues that inhibition of miR-182/miR-183 triggers differentiation: a) the miR-182/mi-183 knockout mESCs have very few AP+ colonies compared to the WT mESCs (Figure 2C); b) in Dgcr8 knockout mESCs, where normal differentiation is blocked due to the absence of endogenous miRNAs, miR-182/miR-183 can inhibit the strong differentiation effects induced by let-7 miRNAs (Wang et al., 2017). These results from both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies strongly argue that decrease of miR-182/miR-183 levels can trigger differentiation in mESCs, and miR-182/miR-183 play important roles in maintaining pluripotency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) this paper suggests that the inhibition of many differentiation-inducing miRNAs that has been shown previously to be trigged by miR-182/183 (Wang et al., 2017), is orchestrated through miR-182/183 mediated suppression of miRISC machinery. It would be of great importance to investigate how do miR-182/183 themselves escape the effect of inhibited miRISC machinery, e.g., do these miRNAs have higher half-life in mESCs?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised a great question regarding regulations of miRISC in mESCs. The interpretation of the results could be: a) miR-182/183 have unique features that enable them to escape the effects of repressed miRISC machinery, as the reviewer suggested; or alternatively, b) among miRNAs expressed in mESCs, let-7s are uniquely sensitive to miRISC machinery.</p><p>To discriminate these two possibilities, we measured the stabilities of miR-183/miR-183 and let-7 miRNAs in mESCs maintained in the ground state (2i+lif) and differentiating mESCs (-lif medium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>):</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72289-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>These results indicate that there was no change of miR-182/miR-183 stability when mESCs were either in the ground state or in the differentiating state. Interestingly, however, let-7 miRNAs (let-7a, let-7f, miR-98) have significantly higher stability in differentiating mESCs than that in the ground state mESCs. This increase of stability correlates with Ago2 levels, as differentiating mESCs have higher Ago2 level than ground state mESCs have (Figure 1C). Combined with our previous observation that increase of Ago2 specifically increase and stabilize let-7 miRNAs in mESCs (Figure 5 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 2 in Liu et al., 2021 <italic>eLife</italic>), these observations argue that it is the let-7 miRNAs that are uniquely sensitive to Ago2 levels in mESCs.As the reviewer pointed out in the point 2) of the public review, and as we discussed in the previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper (Liu et al., 2021 <italic>eLife</italic>), this let-7 miRNAs’ unique sensitive to Ago2 levels could be due to the deliciated positive autoregulatory loops among let-7 miRNAs, Ago2, and Lin28a (a conserved let-7 target).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does the loss of AGO2 repression only enhance the differentiation or does it also trigger defective differentiation?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in the point 3) of the public review, we feel that the meaning of “defective differentiation” is not clear to us. If “defective differentiation” is defined as any differentiation process that is different from the differentiation of WT mESCs, then loss of Ago2 repression results in accelerated mESC differentiation, which is a form of defective differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What is the significance of this regulation in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that dissecting the in vivo relevance of this regulation (miR-182/miR-183 mediated regulation of Ago2) using animal models is of high significance for future work. Interestingly, miR-183 knockout mouse displays eye defects (Xiang et al., 2017), suggesting that absence of miR-182/miR-183 mediated regulation of Ago2 may contribute to these developmental defects.</p><p>One challenge of using animal models to determine the in vivo relevance of regulations of stemness is what phenotypes to look for in the genetically modified animals. The simplest scenario is the lethal phenotype, such as the <italic>Ago2</italic> knockout mouse. Complicated scenarios include animals that do not have lethal phenotype but with some defects in certain tissues or cells, such as the Lin28a knockout mouse (Sato et al., 2020). We believe using cell-based experimental system to generate mechanistic insights at the molecular level will be of great help and significance to interpret the phenotypes of animal models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Two lines of evidence indicated that miR-182/miR-183 targets Ago2 mRNA.&quot; – should use &quot;regulates&quot; instead of &quot;targets&quot;, since the evidence for direct targeting comes later in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We made this change as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>References:</p><p>Pulecio, J., Verma, N., Mejia-Ramirez, E., Huangfu, D., and Raya, A.

While the authors convincingly demonstrate that miR-182/182 directly regulate Ago2, it is slightly less clear whether the proposed increased activity of let-7 can fully explain the observed phenotype.</p><p>Overall this is a solid manuscript, although as discussed below not all conclusions are supported by conclusive evidence. I concur with reviewer 1 that the study provides relatively minor conceptual advance, but it can be argued that these results will be of interest to specialists in the field of miRNa and ESC biology.</p><p>A major concern I have regards the strength of the conclusion that the impaired stem cell function upon loss of miR-182/183 activity on Ago2 is mediated by increased activity of let-7. The LNA-based experiments are suggestive, but although they prove that blocking let-7 helps preventing differentiation, they do not prove that increased let-7 function underlies the observed phenotype in the Ago2 UTR mutant. In fact, the only evidence that let-7 activity is increased is a modest upregulation of let-7 members expression. Whether this is sufficient to affect gene expression to a detectable extent is unclear. The evidence would be strengthened substantially if the authors showed increased let-7-mediated gene repression in the UTR mutant. A straightforward and relatively inexpensive experiment would be to perform RNAseq analysis on the wt and UTR-mutant mESCs. The authors' model leads to the prediction that the a relatively selective de-repression of predicted let-7 targets should be observed in the UTR mutant samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciated the reviewer’s insightful comment!</p><p>We did exactly the same experiment as the reviewer described in our previous paper on the mESCs with the Trim71 binding site deleted in the 3’UTR of <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA (Figure 4 in Liu et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2021). Through transcriptomic profiling via RNA-seq, we found that mRNAs with predicted let-7 binding sites showed increased level in the mutant mESCs than those in the WT mESCs compared to the mRNAs without let-7 binding sites, indicating increased let-7 miRNA activity (Figure 4E in Liu et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2021)</p><p>Here we used a different approach to address the same issue. Instead of examining mRNA levels, we measured protein level of an evolutionarily conserved let-7 target, Lin28a (the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We observed that there was a decrease of Lin28a in the 3’UTR mutant mESCs. Moreover, there were no changes for Nanog and Oct4, which are not let-7 targets. There results argue that let-7 miRNA activity is increased in the 3’UTR mutant mESCs.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72289-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Figures 2C and 2D appear swapped in their description in the main text (lines 107-114)</p></disp-quote><p>We double checked Figures2C/2D and their corresponding descriptions in the main text, and we confirmed that they are in the correct order.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) lines 132-135: I am not sure the authors can define the effect of the 3'UTR as not &quot;in cis&quot;. Even if mediated by loss of miRNA binding, as is likely, the effect would still be on the transcript harboring the mutation, so technically, as far as I know, in cis. Perhaps a different language would be more appropriate. For example, the authors could say that the fact that deletion of miR-182/183 in a the 3'UTR-mut background doesn't result in additional upregulation of Ago2 provides additional evidence that the UTR mutation results in Ago2 upregulation by preventing miR-182/183 binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We made changes to correct the confusion caused by “in cis” in the revised manuscript (in line 132-134 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It appears to me that loss of miR-182/183 has a stronger effect on ESC differentiation than mutation of their Ago2 3'UTR binding sites.

Perhaps the authors should comment on this in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we added an additional paragraph (line 237-240) in the discussion commenting on this important implication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
