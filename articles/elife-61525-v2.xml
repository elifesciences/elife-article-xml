the bacterial cell envelope that surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane to protect the cell from osmotic lysis. Important antibiotics such as β-lactams and glycopeptides target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Class A penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are bifunctional membrane-bound peptidoglycan synthases that polymerize glycan chains and connect adjacent stem peptides by transpeptidation. How these enzymes work in their physiological membrane environment is poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel Förster resonance energy transfer-based assay to follow in real time both reactions of class A PBPs reconstituted in liposomes or supported lipid bilayers and applied this assay with PBP1B homologues from <italic>Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> in the presence or absence of their cognate lipoprotein activator. Our assay will allow unravelling the mechanisms of peptidoglycan synthesis in a lipid-bilayer environment and can be further developed to be used for high-throughput screening for new antimicrobials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>penicillin-binding protein</kwd><kwd>assay</kwd><kwd>bacterial cell wall</kwd><kwd>Förster Resonance Energy Transfer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>BBSRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R017409/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vollmer</surname><given-names>Waldemar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2015-StG-679239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loose</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBO ALTF 1163-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baranova</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Human Frontiers Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HFSP LT 000824/2016-L4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baranova</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The synthesis of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan was reconstituted in lipid bilayers and detected by a novel Förster resonance energy transfer real-time assay.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peptidoglycan (PG) is a major cell wall polymer in bacteria. It is composed of glycan strands of alternating N-actetylglucosamine (Glc<italic>N</italic>Ac) and N-acetylmuramic acid (Mur<italic>N</italic>Ac) residues interconnected by short peptides. PG forms a continuous, mesh-like layer around the cell membrane to protect the cell from bursting due to the turgor and maintain cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). The essentiality and conservation of PG in bacteria make PG metabolism an ideal target of antibiotics.</p><p>Class A penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are bifunctional PG synthases which use the precursor lipid II to polymerize glycan chains (glycosyltransferase [GTase] reactions) and crosslink peptides from adjacent chains by DD-transpeptidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goffin and Ghuysen, 1998</xref>). Moenomycin inhibits the GTase and β-lactams the transpeptidase function of class A PBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sauvage and Terrak, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macheboeuf et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, PBP1A and PBP1B account for a substantial proportion of the total cellular PG synthesis activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2016</xref>) and are tightly regulated by interactions with multiple proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Typas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Egan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2017</xref>), including the outer membrane-anchored activators LpoA and LpoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Typas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jean et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Historically, in vitro PG synthesis assays have been crucial to decipher the biochemical reactions involved in PG synthesis and determine the mode of action of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Izaki et al., 1968</xref>). However, these studies were limited by the scarcity of lipid II substrate and the inability to purify a sufficient quantity of active enzymes. Lipid II can now be synthesized chemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">VanNieuwenhze et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwartz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ye et al., 2001</xref>) or semi-enzymatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breukink et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egan et al., 2015</xref>), or isolated from cells with inactivated MurJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qiao et al., 2017</xref>). Radioactive or fluorescent versions of lipid II are also available to study PG synthesis in a test tube. However, there are several drawbacks with currently available PG synthesis assays. First, most assays are end-point assays that rely on discrete sampling and therefore do not provide real-time information about the enzymatic reaction. Second, some assays involve measuring the consumption of lipid II or analysing the reaction products by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sjodt et al., 2018</xref>) or high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) after digestion with a muramidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertsche et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Born et al., 2006</xref>). These laborious techniques make assays incompatible with high-throughput screening and hinder the determination of kinetic parameters. A simple, real-time assay with dansyl-labelled lipid II substrate overcomes these problems but is limited to assay GTase reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwartz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Offant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Recently, two types of real-time TPase assays have been described. The first uses non-natural mimics of TPase substrates such as the rotor-fluorogenic 470 D-lysine probe Rf470DL, which increases its fluorescence emission upon incorporation into PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>). The second assay monitors the release of D-Ala during transpeptidation in coupled enzymatic reactions with D-amino acid oxidase, peroxidases, and chromogenic or fluorogenic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frére et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gutheil et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catherwood et al., 2020</xref>). Coupled assays are often limited in the choice of the reaction conditions, which in this case must be compatible with D-amino acid oxidase activity. Hence, each of the current assays has its limitations and most assays exclusively report on either the GTase or TPase activity, but not both activities at the same time.</p><p>Another major drawback of many of the current assays is that they include detergents and/or high concentration (up to 30%) of the organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to maintain the PG synthases in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Offant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biboy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lebar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catherwood et al., 2020</xref>). However, both detergents and DMSO have been shown to affect the activity and interactions of <italic>E. coli</italic> PBP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Egan and Vollmer, 2016</xref>). Importantly, a freely diffusing, detergent-solubilized membrane enzyme has a very different environment compared to the situation in the cell membrane where it contacts phospholipids and is confined in two dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavutis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhdanov and Höök, 2015</xref>). Here, we sought to overcome the main limitations of current PG synthesis assays and establish a system with more physiological experimental conditions. We used sensitive Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) detection for simultaneous monitoring of GTase and TPase reactions. The real-time assay reports on PG synthesis in phospholipid vesicles or planar lipid bilayers. We successfully applied this assay to several class A PBPs from pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, demonstrating its robustness and potential use in screening assays to identify PBP inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Real-time assay for detergent-solubilized <italic>E. coli</italic> PBP1B</title><p>To develop a FRET-based real-time assay for PG synthesis using fluorescently labelled lipid II, we prepared lysine-type lipid II versions with high quantum yield probes, Atto550 (as FRET donor) and Atto647n (as FRET acceptor), linked to position 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mohammadi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egan et al., 2015</xref>).

We therefore included unlabelled <italic>meso</italic>-diaminopimelic acid (<italic>m</italic>DAP)-type lipid II into reactions of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> with lipid II-Atto550 and lipid II-Atto647n (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both probes were incorporated into the produced PG or glycan chains as indicated by SDS-PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, I</xref>). After the reaction, fluorescence spectra taken at the excitation wavelength of the donor fluorophore (Atto550, λ<sub>abs</sub>=552 nm) showed a reduced donor emission intensity (λ<sub>fl</sub>=580 nm) and an increased emission of the acceptor fluorophore (Atto647n, λ<sub>fl</sub>=665 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, I</xref>) indicative of FRET between the two fluorophores. Analysis of the fluorescence spectra allowed to calculate FRET efficiencies which we found to be 29 ± 6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Ampicillin, which inhibits the TPase, blocked the formation of crosslinked PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, II</xref>) and reduced the FRET efficiency to one third (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, II, D</xref>). Moenomycin, which blocks the GTase, and, indirectly, TPase activities completely abolished the incorporation of fluorescent lipid II and the associated signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, III, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertsche et al., 2005</xref>). These results demonstrate that incorporation of the labelled probes into PG by PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> results in fluorescence energy transfer that depends on the GTase and TPase activity, with the latter being the major contributor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay to monitor peptidoglycan synthesis in real time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the reactions of a class A penicillin-binding protein (PBP) (GTase-TPase) with unlabelled lipid II and the two versions of labelled lipid II, yielding a peptidoglycan (PG) product that shows FRET.

FRET efficiencies were calculated using the (ratio)<sub>A</sub> method, in which the enhancement of emission of the acceptor due to the donor is calculated by comparing the emission of (only) the acceptor when exciting at the donor excitation with the emission of the acceptor when exciting only the acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vámosi and Clegg, 1998</xref>). For this, two spectra were taken for every sample, either exciting at 552 nm (donor excitation) or at 650 nm (acceptor excitation). To process the spectra and separate the emission of the acceptor from that of the donor in the spectra taken at the donor excitation, reference spectra were measured from (1) reactions containing lipid II-Atto550 and unlabelled lipid II (donor reference), (2) reactions containing lipid II-Atto647n and unlabelled lipid II (acceptor references at both excitation wavelengths), and (3) reactions containing only unlabelled lipid II (background references at both excitation wavelengths).

Changes in FI<sub>donor</sub> and FI<sub>acceptor</sub> were much higher when both fluorescent lipid II versions were present, in agreement with energy transfer. Thus, we used the ratio between both signals (FI<sub>acceptor</sub>/FI<sub>donor</sub>) as a real-time readout for FRET and PG synthesis. Without LpoB, FRET appeared after ~5 min and slowly increased until it plateaued after 50–60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left). By contrast, reactions with LpoB(sol) showed an immediate and rapid increase in FRET which reached the plateau after 10–20 min, consistent with faster PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left). In agreement with the end-point analysis described above, we found no FRET in samples containing moenomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, middle), and ampicillin generally reduced the final fluorescence ratio level by approximately threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, middle). Analysis of reaction products by SDS-PAGE also confirmed that crosslinked PG was only produced in the absence of antibiotics, while the presence of ampicillin still allowed the formation of glycan chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>The GTase reaction began after a lag phase, consistent with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egan et al., 2014</xref>), which is likely caused by a slower initiation of glycan chain synthesis compared to the rate of polymerization. We measured the slope of FRET reaction curves during the linear raise in signal after the lag phase (when present) and compared the slopes with or without activator. Slopes with LpoB were approximately ten- or twentyfold higher than without the activator, in the absence or presence of ampicillin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

MepM digestion had a negligible effect on the FRET efficiency of glycan chains produced in the presence of ampicillin but reduced the FRET efficiency by approximately twofold for crosslinked-PG samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This confirms that inter-chain FRET is a major contributor to the final FRET signal. MepM did not reduce FRET efficiency to the same value as ampicillin, presumably because of incomplete digestion of the labelled PG.

Overall, we conclude that, in the absence of LpoB, FRET can arise from GTase activity alone (intra-chain FRET), but the overall contribution from the TPase activity (inter-chain FRET) is dominant.</p><p>To study in more detail the contribution of intra-chain FRET, we varied the molar fraction of fluorescent lipid II and measured the activity of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> in the presence or absence of activator. Confirming a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van't Veer et al., 2016</xref>), PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> alone was unable to use lipid II-Atto550 and lipid II-Atto647n for polymerization when unlabelled lipid II was not present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right). Surprisingly, addition of LpoB allowed PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> to produce short, non-crosslinked individual PG chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>) that gave rise to a slow but large increase in FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), indicating that polymerization of labelled lipid II occurred in the absence of unlabelled lipid II. To investigate this effect further, we varied the proportion of fluorescent lipid II over non-fluorescent (but radioactive) lipid II and measured the reaction slopes and, at the end of the reaction time, the final FI<sub>acceptor</sub>/FI<sub>donor</sub> ratio and amounts of unused lipid II versions, in the presence or absence of activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). LpoB slightly increased consumption of all versions of lipid II by PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) but did not affect the proportion of fluorescent material that was incorporated into PG, which reflected the initial percentage of fluorescent lipid II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the absence of LpoB, the final FI<sub>acceptor</sub>/FI<sub>donor</sub> ratio increased with increasing proportions of labelled lipid II, but this increase was steeper in the presence of LpoB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As similar proportions of fluorescent material were incorporated into PG with or without activator, the difference in the final FRET must arise by fluorophores located closer together within the PG produced when LpoB is present. Finally, the reaction slopes did not change significantly with increasing proportions of labelled lipid II in the absence of LpoB but increased in its presence up to 50% of fluorescent lipid II, and then plateaued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that LpoB stimulates the incorporation of fluorophores in consecutive positions along the glycan chain and thus increases the contribution of intra-chain FRET. Thus, the increase in slopes observed with activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) reflects not only a higher PG synthesis rate but also a higher contribution of intra-chain FRET.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FRET assay to monitor PG synthesis in liposomes</title><p>To establish the FRET assay for membrane-embedded PG synthases, we reconstituted a version of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> with a single cysteine at the cytoplasmic N-terminus into liposomes prepared from <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipids (EcPL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

As PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> did not accept Atto550- or Atto647-derivatized lipid II for GTase reactions in the absence of unlabelled lipid II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), we reconstituted PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> in liposomes along both Atto-labelled substrates and initiated the reaction by adding unlabelled lipid II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> reaction rates in liposomes were slower than in the presence of Triton X-100 for all conditions tested (compare curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, measured at 37°C, with the ones in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, measured at 25°C), and there was a longer lag time before FRET started to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left). Moenomycin blocked the increase in FRET, while ampicillin reduced the final FRET levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, middle). For unknown reasons, the FRET signal with moenomycin was initially higher than without moenomycin and then decreased to initial values without moenomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, middle), independent of the class A PBP used (see below) but not in empty liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). LpoB(sol) produced an approximately tenfold increase in the initial slope, measured as explained above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and the resulting final FRET was much higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left). In some experiments with PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> liposomes in the presence of ampicillin and LpoB(sol), we noticed a slow decrease in FRET after a fast initial increase, and the production of short glycan chains instead of the long chains produced normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). As in detergents, without unlabelled lipid II membrane-bound PBP1B produced a FRET signal only in the presence of LpoB(sol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right). The analysis of the final products by SDS-PAGE confirmed that both Atto550 and Atto647n were incorporated into glycan chains or crosslinked PG during the reaction in liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

We set up reactions in the presence or absence of a soluble version of the lipoprotein activator LpoP<sup>Pa</sup>(sol) for PBP1B<sup>Pa</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greene et al., 2018</xref>). There is currently no reported activator of PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup>, but next to the gene encoding PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup> we identified a hypothetical gene encoding a lipoprotein containing two tetratricopeptide repeats (Uniprot code D0C5L6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>) which we subsequently found to activate PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup> (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). We named this protein LpoP<sup>Ab</sup> and purified a version without its lipid anchor, called LpoP<sup>Ab</sup>(sol). We were able to monitor PG synthesis activity by FRET for both PBPs in the presence or absence of their (hypothetical) activators using the Triton X-100-solubilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplements 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">8</xref>) or liposome-reconstituted proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). Our experiments revealed the differences in the activities and the effect of activators between both PBP1B-homolgoues which we discuss in the following paragraphs.</p><p>PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup> showed GTase activity in the presence of Triton X-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A</xref>) and was stimulated ~3.3-fold by LpoP<sup>Ab</sup>(sol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6B</xref>); LpoP<sup>Ab</sup>(sol) also accelerated the consumption of lipid II-Atto550 and glycan chain polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6C</xref>). We measured a low FRET signal for PG produced by the detergent-solubilized enzyme in the FRET assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>) and poor production of crosslinked PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7C</xref>), unlike in the case of the other PBPs. However, the liposome-reconstituted PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup> displayed a higher TPase activity than the detergent-solubilized enzyme (compare gels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7C</xref>). In addition, the final FRET signal was substantially higher in liposomes than in detergents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>). Moenomycin completely blocked FRET development, while ampicillin had a negligible effect on the final FRET levels in detergents and only a small effect in liposomes (~1.2-fold reduction), indicating that intra-chain FRET is the major contributor to FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>). LpoP<sup>Ab</sup>(sol) stimulated PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup>, with a higher effect in detergents (12.3-fold increase) than liposomes (~2.5-fold increase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A, B</xref>).</p><p>PBP1B<sup>Pa</sup> displayed robust TPase activity in detergents and liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8C</xref>), and ampicillin reduced the final FRET signal by ~1.8-fold in Triton X-100 and ~1.5-fold in liposomes, indicating a substantial contribution of inter-chain FRET to the FRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8A</xref>). The addition of LpoP<sup>Pa</sup>(sol) resulted in an increase in the final FRET by ~2.2-fold in the membrane and ~2.1-fold in detergents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8A</xref>), and accelerated initial slopes by ~4.2-fold in the membrane and ~11.5-fold in detergents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8B</xref>); lipid II consumption was increased under both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8C</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that LpoP<sup>Pa</sup>(sol) stimulates both GTase and TPase activities in agreement with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caveney et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PG synthesis on supported lipid bilayers</title><p>As we were able to successfully reconstitute active class A PBPs in membranes and monitor their activity in real time, we next aimed to characterize the behaviour of these enzymes in the membrane in more detail by reconstituting them on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). SLBs are phospholipid bilayers formed on top of a solid support, usually a glass surface, and they allow for studying the spatial organization of transmembrane proteins and their diffusion along the membrane by fluorescence microscopy at high spatiotemporal resolution.</p><p>We optimized the reconstitution of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> in SLBs formed with EcPL and used the optimized buffer conditions for activity assays on liposomes. To support lateral diffusion and also improve stability of the proteins incorporated into SLBs, we employed glass surfaces coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) end-functionalized with a short fatty acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roder et al., 2011</xref>) to anchor the EcPL bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We noticed a decrease in membrane diffusivity and homogeneity at a high surface density of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To maintain the integrity of the SLB, we reduced the density of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> on SLBs from ~10<sup>−3</sup> mol protein/mol lipid in liposomes to a range of 10<sup>−6</sup> to 10<sup>−5</sup> mol protein/mol lipid. Using a fluorescently labelled version of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> reconstituted in SLBs, we were able to track the diffusion of single PBP1B molecules in the plane of lipid membrane in the presence or absence of substrate lipid II by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

We incubated SLBs containing PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> with radioactive lipid II and digested any possible PG produced with a muramidase and analysed the digested material by HPLC. Due to the low density and amount of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> on each SLB chamber, we expected a small amount of PG product; hence, we included LpoB(sol) to boost the activity of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup>. Under these conditions, about 12% of the added radiolabelled lipid II was incorporated into PG after an overnight incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, products of both the GTase and TPase activities of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> were detected, and these products were absent in the presence of moenomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). After overnight PG synthesis reactions with radioactive lipid II, about 32% of the radioactivity remained in the membrane fraction after washing (PG products and unused lipid II) and 68% was in the supernatant. The analysis of the membrane and wash fractions by HPLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>) revealed that SLB-reconstituted PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> produced crosslinked PG while, importantly, the wash fraction contained no PG products, confirming that the PG synthesis occurred on the SLBs and this PG remained attached to the bilayer. The fraction of membrane-attached radioactivity was almost the same (33%) when PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> was not present in the bilayer, indicating that PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> did not affect lipid II binding to the bilayer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>FRET assay on supported bilayers</title><p>Next, we adapted the FRET assay to SLBs and TIRF microscopy, taking advantage of the photostability and brightness of the Atto550 and Atto647n probes. Our aim was to visualize PG synthesis by class A PBPs at high resolution as a first step towards understanding PG synthesis at a single molecule level. We used a similar approach as for liposomes, where both Atto550- and Atto647n-labelled lipid II were co-reconstituted with PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> on SLBs and PG synthesis was triggered by the addition of unlabelled lipid II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To measure any change in FRET due to PG synthesis, we took advantage of the fact that upon photobleaching of the acceptor probe in a FRET pair the emitted fluorescence intensity of the donor increases as absorbed energy cannot be quenched by a nearby acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verveer et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, we detected an increase in lipid II-Atto550 fluorescence intensity upon photobleaching of the Atto647n probe after the addition of unlabelled lipid II and LpoB(sol), indicating the presence of FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When we bleached the acceptor at different time points of the reaction, we found the FRET signal to increase after a lag phase of ~8 min.

In addition, the FRET signal was abolished when the muramidase cellosyl was added after the PG synthesis reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results imply that the FRET signal detected by microscopy is primarily due to the transpeptidase activity of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup>, in agreement with the results obtained on liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay on a planar lipid membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FRET acquisition by TIRF microscopy.

We first analysed the recovery of fluorescence intensity after photobleaching to monitor the diffusion of lipid II-Atto647n during PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Only when crosslinking was permitted (absence of ampicillin), the diffusion coefficient of lipid II-Atto647n decreased two- to threefold in a time-dependent manner. The time needed to reach the minimum diffusivity value (~10 min) was similar to the lag detected in the increase of FRET efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The fraction of immobile lipid II-Atto647n did not change significantly in the presence or absence of ampicillin (13 ± 2% or 18 ± 6%, respectively, p-value=0.15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that the crosslinked PG was still mobile under these conditions, but diffused more slowly. We also compared the diffusion of lipid II-Atto647n during the PG synthesis reaction with that of an Alexa Fluor 488-labelled membrane-anchored peptide in the presence or absence of ampicillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The inhibition of TPase by ampicillin only affected the diffusivity of lipid II (2.9 ± 0.4 µm<sup>2</sup>/s with ampicillin and 0.67 ± 0.1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s without), while that of the lipid probe remained unchanged (1.6 ± 0.65 µm<sup>2</sup>/s with ampicillin and 1.94 ± 0.62 µm<sup>2</sup>/s without). This shows that the membrane fluidity was not altered by the PG synthesis reaction and therefore was not the cause of the change in lipid II diffusivity upon transpeptidation. As the immobile fraction of labelled lipid II did not increase after PG synthesis and the diffusion was reduced only two- to threefold, we concluded that lipid II-Atto647n was incorporated into small groups of crosslinked glycan chains which can still diffuse on the bilayer.</p><p>In summary, we report the incorporation of active PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> into SLBs, where we could track a decrease in the diffusion of the protein and its substrate during PG synthesis reactions. Using this system, we detected an increase in FRET upon initiation of PG synthesis, only occurring when transpeptidation was not inhibited.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although class A PBPs are membrane proteins and PG precursor lipid II is embedded in the bilayer, few studies have provided information about the activity of these important enzymes in a membrane environment. Here, we developed a new assay that reports on PG synthesis by these enzymes in detergents, on liposomes, or on SLBs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Intra-chain vs. inter-chain FRET</title><p>For all PBPs and conditions tested, FRET increased when only the GTase domain was active (i.e., when FRET occurred between probes incorporated along the same strand), but the FRET signal was always higher when transpeptidase was active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplements 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">8</xref>). For detergent-solubilized PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup>, the FRET curve closely followed the rate of the production of crosslinked PG as determined by HPLC analysis of the products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>), and the FRET of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup>-produced labelled PG decreased substantially upon digestion with an endopeptidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). These results indicate that inter-chain FRET (arising from both fluorophores present on different, adjacent glycan chains) was a main component of the total FRET signal. Why is this the case? FRET depends on the distance and orientation of the two probes. It might be sterically unfavourable that two large Atto550 and Atto647n containing lipid II molecules simultaneously occupy the donor and acceptor sites in the GTase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van't Veer et al., 2016</xref>), preventing the incorporation of probes (and high FRET) at successive subunits on a single glycan chain. Indeed, for all PBPs tested either in detergents or liposomes, the incorporation of labelled lipid II into glycan chains was more efficient when unlabelled lipid II was present, and, for most enzymes, an activator was required to polymerize glycan chains using labelled lipid II in the absence of unlabelled lipid II. We thus hypothesize that the TPase activity brings glycan chains to close proximity, reducing the distance between probes sufficiently to produce high levels of FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis with labelled lipid II versions and detection of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A mixture of Atto550-lipid II, Atto647n-lipid II, and unlabelled lipid II is utilized by a class A penicillin-binding protein (PBP) with or without inhibition of the TPase activity by a β-lactam. FRET can only occur between fluorophores within the same glycan strand in linear glycan chains produced in the presence of a β-lactam (left reaction, dashed arrows). When the TPase is active (right reaction), FRET can occur either between probes within the same strand (dashed arrows) or between probes on different strands of the crosslinked PG product (solid arrows). We hypothesize that at any time only one labelled lipid II molecule occupies the two binding sites in the GTase domain and that therefore two probes within the same strand are separated by at least one subunit. As a result, average distances between probes in different strands may be shorter than between probes within the same strand, and thus inter-chain FRET contributes stronger to the total FRET signal than intra-chain FRET. (<bold>B</bold>) Lipoprotein-stimulated PBPs produced short chains when labelled lipid II versions were incubated in the absence of unlabelled lipid II (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In this situation, crosslinking does not occur due to the attachment of the probe to the mDAP residue in the pentapeptide. Within these short strands, intra-chain FRET is stronger than within the long glycan strands depicted in (<bold>A</bold>) due to a shorter average distance between the probes.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61525-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitation of the FRET assay</title><p>The FRET assay is sensitive and currently the only method that allows to follow PG synthesis continuously in the membrane. Naturally, there are also limitations with the assay. First, the overall FRET signal is a combination from intra-chain and inter-chain FRET, which both depend on the average distances and orientation of the fluorophore molecules on the growing glycan chains. We currently do not have a method to measure these parameters individually and determine whether and how they change during the process of PG synthesis, preventing the determination of absolute rates for GTase and TPase reactions. Second, different class A PBPs may produce slightly different distribution and density of fluorophores in the PG synthesized, hence differences in FRET signals may not always reflect different reaction rates. Third, an activator can potentially enhance the ability of a class A PBP to incorporate the fluorescent lipid II analogues, as we observed for LpoB<sup>Ec</sup> and PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup>, leading to an increase in intra-chain FRET. Due to these limitations, the assay is inherently semi-quantitative, but with appropriate control samples (β-lactams; only labelled lipid II) it is possible to determine whether the FRET signal follows more the GTase (intra-chain FRET) or TPase (inter-chain FRET) reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Coupled reactions in class A PBPs and their activation</title><p>Our assay revealed the effect of Lpo activators on PBP1B analogues from three bacteria. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> uses LpoP to stimulate its PBP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greene et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caveney et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we identified an LpoP homologue in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and showed that it stimulated its cognate PBP1B.

An elegant recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catherwood et al., 2020</xref>) described the use of a coupled D-Ala release assay to determine the kinetic parameters of the TPase activity of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> and the effect of LpoB on this rate. Based on their observation that PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> had barely any TPase activity in the absence of LpoB, the authors concluded that the LpoB-mediated TPase activation explains the essentiality of LpoB for PBP1B function in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catherwood et al., 2020</xref>). However, the assay used an enzyme concentration that is too low to support GTase activity in the absence of LpoB, as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pazos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, the essentiality of LpoB can be readily explained by its primary effect, the greater than tenfold stimulation of the GTase rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egan et al., 2014</xref>). Our results provide an alternative explanation for PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> essentiality. Activation by LpoB was much more needed when PBP1B was embedded in the membranes of liposomes and supported bilayers, compared to detergent-solubilized enzyme, supporting the idea that cellular PBP1B strictly requires LpoB for GTase activity. In vitro, LpoB also stimulated the TPase causing PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> to produce a hyper-crosslinked PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Typas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egan et al., 2018</xref>) and the same was observed for LpoP<sup>Pa</sup> and PBP1B<sup>Pa</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caveney et al., 2020</xref>). The GTase and TPase contribute both to the signal in our FRET assay, and the relative contribution of intra-chain FRET (due to the GTase) and inter-chain FRET (due to the TPase) can be modified by an activator that enables the incorporation of two adjacent probe molecules on the same glycan chain. Therefore, to untangle the effects of activators on each of the activities requires a single quantitative model accounting for the GTase and TPase rates and including parameters for the initiation, elongation, and termination of glycan chain synthesis of membrane-embedded enzymes. Currently, such a model is not available and our assay could help to develop such a model in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Class A PBP activities in the membrane</title><p>Remarkably, we found slower reaction rates in liposomes than in detergents for all enzymes tested. Several possible factors can explain this, including a slow incorporation of the added unlabelled lipid II into liposomes, a limited capacity of the liposomes to incorporate the unlabelled lipid II, or the accumulation of the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate by-product that has been showed to inhibit PBP1B activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hernández-Rocamora et al., 2018</xref>). None of these factors should change in the presence of LpoB. Hence, we favour the alternative explanation that the membrane-embedding of PBP1B hinders lipid II binding, slowing down the reaction. Remarkably, PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup> showed higher TPase activity in liposomes than in detergents. This observation highlights again that detergents can affect the activity of membrane proteins and that experimental conditions in PG synthesis assays should be as close as possible at the physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Towards single-molecule PG synthesis</title><p>We also adapted the FRET assay to SLBs and super resolution microscopy to study how PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> polymerizes PG on SLBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As with the liposome assays, we detected an increase in FRET signal upon triggering PG synthesis that correlated with transpeptidation. Importantly, we could follow the diffusion of the reaction products, which indicates that PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> does not completely cover the surfaces with a layer of PG but instead produced smaller patches of crosslinked glycan chains. We attribute this to the fact that PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> was reconstituted at a very low density in order to ensure the homogeneity and stability of the SLBs. Remarkably, we detected a reduction of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> diffusivity in the presence of lipid II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Previous in vivo single-molecule tracking of fluorescent-protein tagged class A PBPs reported the presence of two populations of molecules, a fast diffusing one and an almost immobile one with a near-zero diffusing rate, which was assumed to be the active population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vigouroux et al., 2020</xref>).

However, most of these report on either the GTase or TPase reaction, but not both at the same time, and most available methods are not applicable to the membrane. The scintillation proximity assay by Kumar et al. reports on PG production in a membrane environment and in real time, but it is rather crude in that it uses membrane extract instead of purified protein and relies on the presence of lipid II-synthesizing enzymes present in the extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it uses radioactivity detection and is not amenable to microscopy, in contrast to methods based on fluorescently labelled substrates. An important advantage of our new assay over other real-time PG synthesis assays is that it uses natural substrates for transpeptidation, that is, nascent glycan strands, instead of mimics of the pentapeptide, and its ability to measure the activities in a natural lipid environment.</p><p>Our new FRET assay can potentially be adopted to assay PG synthases in the presence of interacting proteins, for example, monofunctional class B PBPs in the presence of monofunctional GTases (cognate SEDS proteins or Mtg proteins) or interacting class A PBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertsche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sjodt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derouaux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banzhaf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sjodt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taguchi et al., 2019</xref>).

Radiolabelled lipid II was included to allow for quantification of non-fluorescent lipid II consumption at the end of reactions. The total concentration of lipid II was kept at 15 µM, and the molar ratio of lipid II-Atto550 to lipid II-Atto647n was 1:1. At each proportion of fluorescent lipid II, PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> reactions were measured in triplicate with and without LpoB (2 µM), and two control reactions with substrate but no enzyme were prepared to determine the amount of each type of lipid II consumed.

This maximizes the amount of information captured from the change in the spectrum due to FRET and normalizes the intensity removing any non-specific jumps in the signal due to bubbles in the reaction well or lamp instability. The slope of reaction curves obtained by the FRET assay was calculated when the ratio started to rise, avoiding the lag phase when present. Only the linear phase of each curve was used. For example, for PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> in detergents, slopes were calculated from 10 to 15 min in the absence of LpoB and within the first minute in the presence of activator. To compare our results with prior reports, we report the fold-change in the slope in the presence of the corresponding Lpo activator, that is, the ratio between the slope in a condition with activator and the slope at the same condition without activator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Determination of FRET efficiency</title><p>For the determination of FRET efficiency, reactions were prepared in the same conditions as for the plate reader assays but they were incubated at 37°C for 1 hr in Eppendorf tubes instead and boiled for 5 min afterwards.

The appropriate lipid or mixture of lipids was dried in a glass test tube under stream of N<sub>2</sub> to form a lipid film followed by desiccation under vacuum from 2 hr. When labelled lipid II was co-reconstituted with the indicated class A PBP, they were added at 1:200 mol:mol phospholipid to each lipid II-Atto550 and lipid II-Atto647n. Resuspension into multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) was achieved by addition of 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 with or without 150 mM NaCl as indicated in each experiment and several cycles of vigorous mixing and short incubations in hot tap water. The final lipid concentration was 5 g/L. To form large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), MLVs were subjected to 10 freeze–thaw cycles and then extruded 10 times through a 0.2 µm filter. LUVs were destabilized by the addition of Triton X-100 to an effective detergent:lipid ratio of 1.40 and mixed with proteins in different protein-to-lipid molar ratios (1:3000 for PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> and PBP1B<sup>Pa</sup>, and 1:2000 for PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup>).

In these conditions, concentration of lipid II-Atto550 and lipid II-Atto647n would be 14.5 µM each, assuming no loss of lipids during sample preparation. The final concentrations of enzymes for the reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, determined by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels, were ~0.59 µM for PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup>, ~0.81 µM for PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup>, and ~0.53 µM for PBP1B<sup>Pa</sup>. When indicated, activators LpoB(sol), LpoP<sup>Ab</sup>(sol), or LpoP<sup>Pa</sup>(sol) were added at a concentration of 2 µM.

Briefly, a thin lipid film of EcPL extract was prepared by N<sub>2</sub>-assisted chloroform evaporation. After 2 hr of drying under vacuum, the lipid film was rehydrated to 5 mM (total phosphorus concentration) in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 supplemented with 20 mM Triton X-100. The suspension of lipids/detergent was extensively vortex, freeze/thawed for five cycles, and sonicated using a water-bath sonicator for 10 min (on ice, to avoid lipids overheating upon sonication). To prepare proteoliposomes, full-length PBP1B produced as described above and containing 0.05% Triton X-100 was mixed with a lipid–detergent suspension at the indicated ratio, usually 1:25,000 (protein:lipids), and incubated for 10 min at room temperature (RT). Incorporation of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> into liposomes was achieved by addition of 2× excess of β-cyclodextrin solution for 5 min (at RT) with subsequent twentyfold dilution in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The rapid depletion of detergent by addition of β-cyclodextrin leads to the formation of very small unilamellar vesicles with an average diameter of 18–25 nm and narrow size distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roder et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To prepare liposomes with fluorescently labelled lipid II, the extract of EcPL was supplemented with 2 mol% solution of either lipid II-Atto550 or lipid II-Atto647n.

TIRF microscopy, using a set up described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baranova et al., 2020</xref>), was used to monitor an increase in FRET efficiency and spatial reorganization of FRET signal over the time course of PG synthesis. To detect real-time FRET on supported lipid membranes, we used the so-called ‘acceptor photobleaching approach’ where a region of interest of about 10 × 10 µm was photobleached in the acceptor channel (lipid II-Atto647n) and the increase in fluorescence intensity of the donor (lipid II-Atto550) was recorded within a delay of 1 s. We found that in our experiments photobleaching of the acceptor dye was the only process that contributed to the recorded increase in the donor fluorescence signal. Accordingly, the relative increase in donor fluorescence can be used as a direct readout for the FRET efficiency and could therefore be calculated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verveer et al., 2006</xref>).

For each time point, a new region of interest in the same chamber was photobleached, and the change in the donor intensity was recorded to calculate FRET efficiency using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>.</p><p>To have a control on the lipid membrane integrity during PG synthesis, the phospholipid DODA-tris-Ni-NTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beutel et al., 2014</xref>) was included during reconstitution at a 0.1 mol% ratio. DODA-tris-Ni-NTA was then visualized using a His<sub>6</sub>-containing peptide (CMSQAALNTRNSEEEVSSRRNNGTRHHHHHH) labelled with Alexa488 on its single Cys residue, which we added in the same experiment in which we performed FRET analysis. To compare the fluidity and immobile fraction of lipid II-Atto647n before and after 1 hr of the synthesis reaction with the fluidity of phospholipids in the lipid membrane, the same region of interest was photobleached with a laser first at 640 nm and afterwards at 480 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>In vitro PG synthesis assay using radiolabelled lipid II on SLBs</title><p>To assay PG synthesis on SLBs using radioactively labelled lipid II, we first reconstituted PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> on SLBs containing EcPL extract and a 1:10<sup>5</sup> PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> to lipid molar ratio, as described above. Due to the low density of the enzyme, several 1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> chambers were assayed for every condition in order to accumulate a measurable signal. In every chamber, reactions were started by addition of 10 µM [<sup>14</sup>C]-labelled lipid II and 4 µM LpoB(sol) in a total volume of 100 µL per chamber. The synthesis reaction was carried out in 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The chambers were incubated overnight (~16 hr) at 37°C and covered with parafilm. Reactions were stopped by addition of 100 µM moenomycin. To digest the produced PG, cellosyl was added at 0.05 g/L in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100. After 1 hr incubation at 37°C, samples from six chambers were pooled in an Eppendorf tube, concentrated using a speed-vac evaporator, reduced using sodium borohydride, and analysed by HPLC as described above. For the experiment to determine lipid II incorporation and the localization of the produced PG, before addition of moenomycin, chambers were washed by removal of 50 µL of buffer and addition of 50 µL of fresh buffer while mixing. This was repeated five times. The removed volume from each wash was pooled and treated the same as the samples left in the chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Single-molecule tracking and analysis</title><p>To perform single-molecule tracking, MGC-<sup>64</sup>PBP1B-his C77S C795S was labelled with the photostable far-red dye Dy647N as described above and then reconstituted into a polymer-supported lipid membrane as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roder et al., 2014</xref>). Single-molecule tracking experiments were performed at a low protein-to-lipid molar ratio (1:10<sup>−6</sup>). At this ratio, supported lipid membrane was largely homogeneous with the lowest immobile fraction from all the ratios tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The single-molecule motion of PBP1B was measured prior to and after the addition of 1.5 µM lipid II after 15 min ex situ incubation in the presence of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> buffer and in the absence of LpoB(sol). The localization and tracking of PBP1B particles were performed by the SLIMfast software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roder et al., 2014</xref>). To ensure that non-specifically stuck PBP1B particles did not contribute to the measured diffusion coefficient, the immobile particles were excluded using the DBSCAN spatial clustering algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sander et al., 1998</xref>) with the following clustering parameters: a search area of 100 nm and a minimal time window of 30 frames at 65 ms/frame acquisition time. The displacement distribution for active PBP1B (in the presence of lipid II) was compared to the displacement distribution of PBP1B before lipid II addition by fitting the two-component Rayleigh distribution and comparing the weighted contribution of each population. The mean-squared displacement (MSD) was fitted to each individual trajectory longer than 650 ms (10 frames). Each MSD curve was fitted with a linear fit considering max 30% of the lag time for each trajectory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>FRAP analysis</title><p>To control membrane fluidity upon the reconstitution of the transmembrane PBP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and fluidity of lipid II Atto-647n during PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>), we used a Matlab-based GUI frap_analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jönsson, 2020</xref>) in details described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jönsson et al., 2008</xref>). This code allows to quantify the contribution of the immobile fraction to the estimated diffusion coefficient and is particularly suitable for the analysis of 2D diffusion with the photobleaching contribution during the recovery.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Alexander Egan (Newcastle University) for purified proteins LpoB(sol) and LpoP<sup>Pa</sup>(sol), Federico Corona (Newcastle University) for purified MepM, and Oliver Birkholz and Jacob Piehler (Department of Biology and Center of Cellular Nanoanalytics, University of Osnabrück) for their help with PBP1B reconstitution into polymer-SLBs and initial guidance on single particle tracking.

The authors examine how the assay performs in detergent and in liposomes; they also assess whether the assay will be useful for studying regulators of peptidoglycan biosynthesis enzymes by applying it to previously studied lipoprotein activators of aPBPs, and a new lipoprotein activator that is similar to a previously studied one. The major advantage of the current assay in comparison to the original dansylated lipid II assay is that the FRET assay can monitor both GTase and TPase activities. Finally, the current FRET assay has the potential to become single-molecule study-compatible. The Vollmer lab is one of only a few that can carry out studies of PG biosynthetic enzymes, and he has teamed up with an expert in microscopy on this manuscript. The experiments are technically challenging and generally well done and the technical advances should be useful to the field. However, new biological/mechanistic insights are few. The work also needs to be significantly strengthened with more critically analyzed data, control experiments and better writing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) FRET controls and calculations:</p><p>a) The authors should provide donor-only and acceptor-only controls under the same conditions for all experiments to allow the calculation of FRET efficiency quantitatively (preferably using the Ratio A method Clegg RM, Methods in Enzymology, 1992, 211, p353). This quantification is important because one major potential advantage of this method could be studying the kinetics of GTase and TPase activities, which may offer mechanistic insight on the enzyme's working. The Facceptor /Fdonor ratio measurement is convenient and can be useful for screening of a large sample size but is prone to artifacts such as fluorescence quenching due to reasons other than FRET, especially when the way the system is set up does not allow precise determination of the donor/acceptor ratio and attachment positions. These donor only or acceptor only experiments are also important for the FRAP measurement in the SLB assay.</p><p>b) In Figure 4 the authors used a ratiometric FRET equation Erel = IA/(IA+ID) in the semi-single-molecule assay to determine FRET efficiency. This measurement should be unified to allow direct comparison of FRET between different types of experiments (solubilized, liposomes, SLBs, bulk or single-molecule). As mentioned above, the acceptor intensity consists of the intensities from donor-excitation (FRET), direct-excitation, and bleed-through from the donor. Donor emission could be quenched due to reasons (such as the local environment as that in the dansyl-lipid II assay) other than FRET. More control experiments will allow the authors to determine how this impact the true acceptor signal resulting from FRET.</p><p>c) There appears to be a major difference in the fluorescence intensity spectra between the detergent-solubilized (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) and liposome experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, C, D). In the detergent solubilized experiments, there appears to be little change in the intensity of the donor peak from PBP1B to +LpoB. However, in the liposome experiments the LpoB has a drastic loss of donor signal compared to that of PBP1B. This is another reason why calculating FRET efficiency instead of the relative ratio would allow for a better comparison between the experiments. This drastic loss of donor signal in the liposome experiments is seen in all 3 species. The authors should address why there is such a difference in the FRET profiles between these two experiments.</p><p>d) The authors rely on &quot;Relative Slope&quot; to show how the addition of LpoB impacts the PBP1B activity. Is the &quot;Relative slope&quot; calculated by normalizing the slope of a reaction with LopB to that without LopB? How is the time window determined? As this ratio does not really inform on the enzyme activity, it would be difficult for other groups to use the same method and to compare to this metric. It is also difficult to judge whether the GTase is faster or slower in the presence of TPase activity without the absolute values. Please provide the absolute measurement of the slope (or the initial velocity V0) using a better determined FRET efficiency value as in point 1a.</p><p>e) Additionally, perhaps the authors could determine the reaction velocities at different substrate concentrations to see if Michaelis-Menten kinetics could be applied? A reanalysis of the data with better quantifications with regard to enzyme's kinetics would benefit the community significantly by providing a more complete picture of enzyme's activity rather than only comparing PBP1B alone to +LpoB.</p><p>2) According to the authors' data and others' work, PBP1B can only synthesize short, uncrosslinked PG chains when its TPase is inhibited. When the TPase is not inhibited, the crosslinking could somehow help and accelerate the PG chains synthesis by the GTase. The entire signal change should be because of both GTase and TPase activities. The authors mentioned that the first slow phase reflects the GTase activity and the second fast phase reflects the TPase, but I do not find it convincing.</p><p>a) Please define which section is slow and which section is fast in the FRET curves-in the presence of LpoB, it does not appear to have a slow-phase if the initial lag phase of rise is the slow-phase the authors mentioned.</p><p>b) In the presence of Amp, the slope of the initial rise appears to be slower than that in the absence of Amp, which, could be the reason that the authors argue that TPase help accelerate GTase. Please provide absolute quantifications using FRET efficiency to show that this is indeed the case.</p><p>c) Can the authors add D,D-endopeptidase in the system after the end of the reaction to uncrosslink the peptides and see how much FRET signal remains, which should be contributed by the pure GTase activity? This signal could be compared with that in the presence of Amp to examine the authors' claim.</p><p>3) The lag of TPase activity behind GTase activity as shown in Figure 1F is intriguing. The lag appears to be on the order of 5-10 min in this system and suggest that the GTase and TPase activities are not synchronous. Does this mean that even though PBP1B has both activities in one single molecule, but the two reactions are catalyzed asynchronously by two different molecules?</p><p>4) The authors suggest that the decrease of FRET signal in Figure 2C, E and G is due to additional changes of fluorophore's spectroscopic properties. If so why such changes were not observed in the detergent or SLB experiments, if the product is the same? The authors should obtain parallel time points using radio-labeled Lipid II and run the products of both assays on HPLC to show that the decrease of FRET signal in these experiments did not correspond to changed product.</p><p>5) The SLB assay has great potentials to allow single-molecule measurement of glycan chain elongation and crosslinking kinetics. It is disappointing, though, to find out that no single-lipid II molecules in the polymerized PG can be visualized. Is this because the lipid II concentration too high on the SLB? Does it need to be that high?</p><p>6) To fully drive home the message that the new FRET is better in many ways than previous assays, the authors should compare it with the dansyl-lipid II assay side by side (i.e., not putting the other assay in the supplemental figures) and quantitatively.</p><p>7) Similarly, there appeared to be significant differences in FRET signals between the detergent, liposome and SLB assays with or without Amp, and it is difficult to compare the enhancement by LpoB among these assays. Please address these differences.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) It is stated that: &quot;As expected, ampicillin did not prevent the stimulation of PBP1B by LpoB(sol), which accelerated the FRET increase by 10-20 times with or without ampicillin, consistent with the previously reported stimulation of both GTase and TPase activities.&quot; Although other results may suggest TPase activity is stimulated, one cannot draw the conclusion from the FRET assay results here that LpoB stimulates TPase activity – only that TPase activity boosts the FRET signal. There is some confusion in the manuscript about what can and cannot be concluded about mechanism from the FRET assays.</p><p>2) The authors use initial rates from the FRET assay to compare effects of LpoB in Figure 1 (and later do the same for other conditions/other activators). Initial rate conditions are used to quantify reaction rates for enzymes because under these conditions substrate depletion and product inhibition do not impact the rate. Initial rates are misleading when comparing a hyperbolic progress curve to a sigmoidal progress curve. The authors should comment on this, clarify the time frame over which the initial rates were measured (perhaps indicated with a figure), and also report the slopes of the &quot;fast&quot; phase of the reactions where activator is not present.</p><p>3) There is a pattern of low mass bands in the PAGE gel in Figure 1D for the LpoB reactions; these are barely visible in the reactions without LpoB. At the same time, the glycan strands are shorter in length for the LpoB reaction compared to the reaction without LpoB (lanes 2 and 6). (Shorter glycan strands were observed previously for LpoB - e.g, Paradis-Bleau et al.; Lupoli et al.). I am curious about whether these observations are connected (and therefore whether they are connected to how LpoB achieves activation).</p><p>4) The authors comment that the combined assays suggest that the total FRET signal emerges from two steps that have different rates. I recommend either refining or removing this comment. The statement suggests that it might be possible to extract rates for the two steps alluded to from the FRET signal. But there are more than two steps and two rates. For polymerization reactions, initiation and elongation rates are often substantially different and there is evidence in the literature that this is case for PG synthesis. (The slow rate of reaction for the &quot;only labelled Lipid II&quot; reactions does not report on the rate of polymerization with unlabeled Lipid II present because the products are very short – so the polymerization does not &quot;take off&quot; the way it does in the other reactions.) Moreover, there are likely two rates for crosslinking in vitro because the first crosslinks are formed intermolecularly and later crosslinks are formed intramolecularly. Finally, the FRET signal itself is different for uncrosslinked and crosslinked PG – as the authors note, it reaches a higher maximum for the latter.</p><p>5) Figure 2C: was the lane 7 sample in the gel the same as the one for which the fluorescence trace is shown? The fluorescence trace looks flat but lane 7 shows polymerization. In other gels, other lanes that show comparable levels of polymerization also show a FRET signal.</p><p>6) I already mentioned that the discussion could use some work, but wanted to elaborate. The explanation for how TPase activity increases the FRET signal is plausible and supported by the data. But the section on &quot;coupled reactions in Class A PBPs&quot; is confusing because it is not clear what the authors are trying to accomplish with it. There has been a lot of debate about what LpoB does to activate PBP1b and how it does it. That LpoB affects both GTase activity and TPase activity has been shown repeatedly to one degree or another, and the idea that one activity influences the other in this context has been discussed explicitly going back at least to 2014 (Egan et al., 2014; Lupoli et al., 2014). The authors discuss the idea again here, evidently in response to a recent paper (Catherwood et al.) that attributes LpoB's essentiality to its effects on TPase activity. They conclude that Catherwood's conditions may have overemphasized the TPase effect. I don't think arguing this point is the most important use of the discussion space. The authors should clarify how they think about what the FRET assays show with respect to mechanism of Lpo activators and try to connect their work to a path forward.</p><p>Summary: there is a lot of nice material in this manuscript and I believe the authors are pushing the field ahead with the FRET assays, particularly their use in SLMs. However, the analysis of the results is not at the same level as the technical innovations and this should be improved. Mainly text revisions could make the paper suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>, but it will take some work on the part of the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes studies of generation of improved in vitro assay systems for peptidoglycan synthesis, using liposomes and supported lipid bilayers. This work can be very influential as this synthetic process is a primer candidate for the development for additional antibiotics, and the detection methods utilized are potentially adaptable to high-throughput screens.</p><p>Overall the paper is well written and the data are convincing. I have a few comments below, primarily concerning the data presentation.</p><p>1) Figures 1A, 2B, and 5: These figures show some of the fluorescently-labeled peptides as being involved in crosslinks. I do not think there is evidence in this paper that these substrates are ever used by transpeptidases. They do not appear to show up in obvious radioactively-labeled HPLC peaks. Doesn't this suggest that they are NOT being crosslinked? All off the crosslinked material seen in HPLC peaks is simply the radiolabeled Lipid II.</p><p>2) Figure 1C: I don't understand why the slope with LpoB is greater in the presence of Amp? Can the authors comment?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Real time monitoring of peptidoglycan synthesis by membrane-reconstituted penicillin binding proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The revised manuscript has provided evidence for all the three with improved clarity, new control experiments, and better FRET efficiency calculations, but it still lacks the rigor in the quantitative (or semi-quantitative) aspect of the assay. Specifically, the authors need to provide evidence that the F<sub>acceptor</sub>/F<sub>donor</sub> ratio indeed reflects proportionally to either just the GTase activity or a combined GTase and TPase activity. The authors did show qualitatively that this ratio is altered when the activator LpoB (or P) or drugs are used, but it is difficult to use this ratio to compare quantitatively (or semi-quantitatively) the rates of different reactions catalyzed by different enzymes, or the same enzyme but with different mutations and regulators. Being able to do so will greatly enhance the impact of the FRET assay and promote its wide adoption in the field.</p><p>It appears that the measured F<sub>acceptor</sub>/F<sub>donor</sub> ratio is not only dependent on the GTase and TPase activities of PBP1B, but some other effects that influence the fluorescence of the dyes. These other effects will make it difficult to use the FRET assay to quantitatively compare different reactions. For example, in Figure 3C, the reaction with Amp (VII) barely had any signal change in F<sub>acceptor</sub>/F<sub>donor</sub>, but the corresponding gel lane cleared showed polymerized, linear PG strands, suggesting that the polymerization reaction is not reflected in the fluorescence ratio measurement. The rise and decay of the +LpoB/Amp (III) reaction also look strange-this reaction had a similar PG ladder on the gel as reaction (-LpoB/Amp)VII, but the fluorescence ratio measurements are drastically different. Another example is the comparison between the three PBP1Bs: it appears that crosslinking activities have different contributions to the fluorescence ratio measurement: ampicillin completely abolished the fluorescence ratio signal for PBP1BEc but not for PBP1BAb. It is hard to imagine that these highly homologous enzymes would have very different mechanisms to synthesize PG.</p><p>A likely explanation for these different fluorescence signals in these reactions is probably what the authors suggested, that some spectroscopic properties of the dyes changed due to the incorporation and/or local environment. Another possibility is that these enzymes of different species may handle the dye-labeled LipidII differentially, one PBP1B may have more difficulty in accepting the dye-labeled LipidII than the other PBP1B. Yet another possibility could also be that the stimulation effect of LpoB is simply that now more dye-labeled LipidII v.s. unlabeled Lipid II can be incorporated, but not necessarily the rate at which Lipid II is incorporated.</p><p>It is understandable that these in vitro experiments are extremely challenging, but fluorescence measurements are sensitive and prone to artifacts, and the authors should perform control experiments to make sure that the measured signal indeed reflects the desired enzymatic activities. In particular, in calculating the fluorescence ratio, the donor-only and acceptor-only controls need to be run simultaneously to determine how much fluorescence change is due to the local environment change, and how much is due to FRET. The authors have performed these control experiments but only used them for the end-point measurements. These controls should also be performed for the real-time measurements (with LpoB, with or without Amp), which could help to explain some strange changes in the measured fluorescence ratio (such as that in Figure 3C).</p><p>The goal, hopefully, is that one can confidently interpret the ~ 25-fold higher initial slope of PBP1BEc with LpoB in the presence of ampicillin as a 25-fold (or proportionally) higher GTase activity of PBP1BEc stimulated by LpoB (such as that in Figure 3D). Similarly, one can use the smaller fold-increase of the initial slopes in the cases of PBP1BAb and PBP1BPa in the presence of their cognate activators to draw the conclusion that these activators do not stimulate these PBP1Bs to the same extent as that of PBP1BEc. If the fold enhancement of the initial slopes by LpoB in the presence and absence of ampicillin are similar to each other, one perhaps can say that here LpoB only stimulates the GTase activity, and so on and so forth.</p><p>The new FRET assay bears great potential in providing a sensitive and quantitative way to characterize both GTase and TPase activities in ways not possible before. The Vollmer laboratory also has the expertise to make this assay hugely impactful for the field. These experiments can become powerful, but they need critical controls.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61525.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Hernández-Rocamora et al. describes a FRET-based real time assay that allows for continuous monitoring of peptidoglycan synthesis by aPBPs.

These donor only or acceptor only experiments are also important for the FRAP measurement in the SLB assay.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that we did not provide donor-only and acceptor-only controls to calculate FRET efficiency quantitatively. To address this point, we have now measured apparent FRET efficiencies using the suggested ratio A method for the end products of the reactions of <italic>E. coli</italic> PBP1B in detergents in the presence ampicillin or moenomycin, or without antibiotic. We measured samples containing only lipid II-Atto647n+lipid II (acceptor reference) and samples containing only lipidII-Atto550+lipid II (donor reference). With these data we demonstrate that signals arising in these reactions are indeed due to FRET, and we provide the values for FRET efficiencies. The new data shown in Figure 1B-D.</p><p>We respectfully question the reviewer suggestion to calculate FRET efficiencies when monitoring reactions in real time, for several reasons. First, FRET efficiencies will not be useful to provide any meaningful distances between fluorophores, because probe molecules are unlikely to be positioned homogeneously within the PG produced. Very likely, probe molecules are separated by variable distances and with a range of different orientations, giving rise to a mixture of FRET between probes from the same glycan chain and different chains.</p><p>Second, calculating FRET efficiency in real time would require combining signals arising from different reactions in different wells (the references with donor-only or acceptor-only plus the sample with both) which, in practice, would substantially increase the noise in the final reaction curve. This problem would be exacerbated in the membrane system, which would require to use different liposome preparations for the different samples (because the labelled lipid versions need to be reconstituted together with the enzyme).</p><p>We believe that the F<sub>acceptor</sub>/F<sub>donor</sub> ratio is useful even if a small part of the signal might come from quenching. We demonstrated that the F<sub>acceptor</sub>/F<sub>donor</sub> ratio monitors PG synthesis reactions, because the rise in the ratio requires the incorporation of the probes into peptidoglycan, as verified by the controls with ampicillin and moenomycin.</p><p>To measure FRET within a PG layer on a supported lipid bilayer, we performed acceptor photobleaching or donor dequenching experiments, where the energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor is irreversibly blocked and its intensity is increased. The relative increase in donor fluorescence can be used a direct readout for the FRET efficiency as photobleaching of the acceptor dye is the only process that contributes to the recorded increase in the donor fluorescence signal (see for example Verveer et al., 2006). In rare cases, an increase in donor fluorescence can be recorded even in the absence of acceptor dye, which could result in an overestimation of the FRET efficiency. To our knowledge, this has so far only been found when fluorescent proteins were used (Karpova et al., 2003). Additionally, the donor signal could appear brighter due to spectral crosstalk. In this the FRET signal would be underestimated as the relative intensity increase after acceptor bleaching is decreased.</p><p>To test for these two opposing effects, we performed several control experiments. First, in the presence of Ampicillin, there was no increase in donor intensity and the calculated FRET efficiency was 0 (Figure 5B). Second, the signal was dramatically reduced after treatment with cellosyl and when the PBP1B E233Q mutant was used (Figure 5B-C). Additionally, we now also performed a control experiment, where only Lipid II Atto550 and Atto647n, and not PBP1B, are present in the assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Also under these conditions, the donor intensity was unchanged upon acceptor bleaching and the calculated FRET efficiency was therefore 0. We therefore conclude that there is no contribution of acceptor fluorescence in the donor channel in the absence of PG synthesis.</p><p>Together with the controls performed in our spectroscopic assays in solution, we are confident that the increase in donor intensity was soley due to the activity of PBP1B and not caused by an unidentified photophysical process or spectral crosstalk. We added a comment on this issue to the revised text.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Only Lipid II-Atto647N and Lipid-Atto550 were present in the membrane.</title><p>After photobleaching of the acceptor dye (Att647N), we did not observe an donor increase in intensity in the bleached area.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61525-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In Figure 4 the authors used a ratiometric FRET equation Erel = IA/(IA+ID) in the semi-single-molecule assay to determine FRET efficiency. This measurement should be unified to allow direct comparison of FRET between different types of experiments (solubilized, liposomes, SLBs, bulk or single-molecule). As mentioned above, the acceptor intensity consists of the intensities from donor-excitation (FRET), direct-excitation, and bleed-through from the donor. Donor emission could be quenched due to reasons (such as the local environment as that in the dansyl-lipid II assay) other than FRET. More control experiments will allow the authors to determine how this impact the true acceptor signal resulting from FRET.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that a different equation was used to calculate FRET efficiency 4 than for detergents or liposomes. However, the equation we used is not the one indicated by the reviewer but:</p><p>(1) E = (ID,pb – ID) / ID,pb = 1 – (ID/ID,pb)</p><p>Where ID,pb is the donor intensity before photobleaching and ID,pb is the donor intensity after photobleaching (Verveer et al., 2006). This equation uses the donor fluorescence to calculate FRET, the acceptor fluorescence is not relevant in this calculation.</p><p>Due to the very low concentration and density of PBP enzyme on the supported bilayer the comparison of reaction rates from these experiments with the ones from liposomes or detergents is not meaningful. For a description of our controls performed, please refer to our answer to question 1a</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) There appears to be a major difference in the fluorescence intensity spectra between the detergent-solubilized (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) and liposome experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, C, D). In the detergent solubilized experiments, there appears to be little change in the intensity of the donor peak from PBP1B to +LpoB. However, in the liposome experiments the LpoB has a drastic loss of donor signal compared to that of PBP1B. This is another reason why calculating FRET efficiency instead of the relative ratio would allow for a better comparison between the experiments. This drastic loss of donor signal in the liposome experiments is seen in all 3 species. The authors should address why there is such a difference in the FRET profiles between these two experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The activity of PBP1B without LpoB is lower in liposomes than in detergents, hence the difference is more prominent in the end-point spectra of PBP1B versus PBP1B+LpoB in liposomes. We now discuss this difference in the revised text. We also added further comments on the difference between the behaviour of PBPs in the membrane and in detergents to Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The authors rely on &quot;Relative Slope&quot; to show how the addition of LpoB impacts the PBP1B activity. Is the &quot;Relative slope&quot; calculated by normalizing the slope of a reaction with LopB to that without LopB? How is the time window determined? As this ratio does not really inform on the enzyme activity, it would be difficult for other groups to use the same method and to compare to this metric. It is also difficult to judge whether the GTase is faster or slower in the presence of TPase activity without the absolute values. Please provide the absolute measurement of the slope (or the initial velocity V0) using a better determined FRET efficiency value as in point 1a.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making these points. The relative slope is indeed the ratio between the slope in the presence of LpoB and the slope without LpoB under the same conditions. This method has been used when measuring the activation by LpoB using the dansyl-Lipid II method to measure GTase activity (e.g. Egan et al., 2014, 2018) and we used this method in order to compare our results with those from the literature. We relabelled the plots from “Relative slope” to “Fold change in initial slope” to better describe them.</p><p>The slopes were calculated in the linear part of the curve after the signal started to increase. We now explain in the main text how slopes were calculated and provide more details in the experimental section. The absolute values for the slopes and the time window used to calculated them for each condition are now listed in the source files for the corresponding figures (Figures 1, 3, and Figure 3—figure supplement 5, Figure 3—figure supplement 6 and Figure 3—figure supplement 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Additionally, perhaps the authors could determine the reaction velocities at different substrate concentrations to see if Michaelis-Menten kinetics could be applied? A reanalysis of the data with better quantifications with regard to enzyme's kinetics would benefit the community significantly by providing a more complete picture of enzyme's activity rather than only comparing PBP1B alone to +LpoB.</p></disp-quote><p>To determine enzyme kinetics parameters was not our goal when developing this method although, in theory, the method should be useful for this purpose. Searching the literature we noticed that the kinetics of class A-PBP GTase and TPase activities have only been quantified separately, never both reactions together. We believe that developing a precise quantitative theoretical model for both activities is out of the scope of this paper and would require extensive new experiments and modelling.</p><p>We also noticed that the kinetics of the individual activities of <italic>E. coli</italic> PBP1B have been reported in the literature, but only for the detergent solubilized enzyme. Schwartz et al. (2002) established that glycosyltransferase activity followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the presence of the detergent decyl-PEG using an HPLC assay (Schwartz et al., 2002). Catherwood et al. (2020) used a D-Ala release assay to determined that PBP1B transpeptidase did not follow Michaelis-Menten in reactions with lipid II (mDAP) – same as here – and in the presence of Triton X-100. We now discuss these issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) According to the authors' data and others' work, PBP1B can only synthesize short, uncrosslinked PG chains when its TPase is inhibited. When the TPase is not inhibited, the crosslinking could somehow help and accelerate the PG chains synthesis by the GTase. The entire signal change should be because of both GTase and TPase activities. The authors mentioned that the first slow phase reflects the GTase activity and the second fast phase reflects the TPase, but I do not find it convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to respectfully correct the statement made by the reviewer in the first sentence. TPase-inhibited PBP1B can indeed synthesise long chains (e.g., lane 2 on Figure 2C). The reviewer might have confused this fact with the results of control samples performed with only fluorescently-derivatised lipid II analogues (right panel in Figure 1E and lanes 4 and 8 in Figure 1—figure supplement 3B). We discuss that the binding of two labelled lipid II molecules to the two binding sites (donor and acceptor) in the GTase domain of PBP1B is probably hindered due to the big size of the Atto550 and Atto647n probes. Hence, in the absence of unlabelled lipid II, PBP1B on its own is unable to form glycan chains, but with LpoB PBP1B is stimulated to produce short glycan chains under these conditions.</p><p>We have now removed the statement cited by the reviewer, which was confusing and only intended for PBP1B reactions without LpoB. We did not mean to imply that all FRET signal was due to transpeptidation and only stated that transpeptidation was necessary for a substantial increase in FRET signal. Our model is that FRET arises from glycosyltransferase reactions (intra-chain FRET) and transpeptidation (inter-chain FRET), and the second contribution is higher in the absence of LpoB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Please define which section is slow and which section is fast in the FRET curves-in the presence of LpoB, it does not appear to have a slow-phase if the initial lag phase of rise is the slow-phase the authors mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer comments, there is a lag phase in the increase in FRET in reactions with only PBP1B, but this disappears in the presence of activator, LpoB (Figure 1E, left panel). This lag phase occurs in reactions with or without ampicillin (Figure 1E, middle panel) and it has been previously observed with the dansyl-lipid II method when measuring glycosyltransferase rates (Schwartz et al., 2002). The suppression of the lag phase by LpoB was also observed using the dansyl-lipid II method (Egan et al., 2014). Thus we hypothesize that LpoB accelerates the initiation of GTase, in addition to the rate of glycan chain elongation. In our case, we also have to take into account that LpoB allows PBP1B to incorporate two labelled lipid II molecules consecutively, as demonstrated in the controls with only Atto550- and Atto647n-labelled lipid II (Figure 1E, right panel). Thus, LpoB most likely enhances the intra-chain FRET, consistent with the observation that LpoB increased not only the reaction slope but also the final FRET signal in reactions with ampicillin when only intra-chain FRET is possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In the presence of Amp, the slope of the initial rise appears to be slower than that in the absence of Amp, which, could be the reason that the authors argue that TPase help accelerate GTase. Please provide absolute quantifications using FRET efficiency to show that this is indeed the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the misunderstanding. We did not intend to claim that the TPase helps accelerate the GTase. In the statement we only meant to say that the FRET signal increased rapidly once transpeptidation occur in reactions without activator and without ampicillin. We therefore removed the confusing statement. We address the last sentence made by the reviewer in our reply to the next point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Can the authors add D,D-endopeptidase in the system after the end of the reaction to uncrosslink the peptides and see how much FRET signal remains, which should be contributed by the pure GTase activity? This signal could be compared with that in the presence of Amp to examine the authors' claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we did not intend to claim that the TPase helps accelerate the GTase. Our model was and still is that the in the absence of activator, inter-chain FRET is a major contributor to the FRET signal. This is now demonstrated in new data we present in the new Figure 1B-D in which we show that the addition of ampicillin (which blocks cross-link formation) causes a decrease of FRET efficiency to 30% of the value without antibiotic, and this result is commented in the revised text.</p><p>In addition, we carried out the experiment with a DD-endopeptidase, as suggested by the reviewer, and shown these new data in the new Figure 2A-B. We used the endopeptidase MepM to digest PG produced in the presence or absence of ampicillin. We found that MepM was unable to digest all cross-links in Atto-labelled PG, but caused a substantial reduction in the cross-linked PG (compare lanes M in the presence or absence of ampicillin on new Figure 2A). Consistent with this result, MepM digestion of the labelled PG reduced the FRET efficiency by 2-fold while, as expected, MepM did not significantly affect the FRET efficiency of the uncross-linked PG synthesised in the presence of ampicillin (new Figure 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The lag of TPase activity behind GTase activity as shown in Figure 1F is intriguing. The lag appears to be on the order of 5-10 min in this system and suggest that the GTase and TPase activities are not synchronous. Does this mean that even though PBP1B has both activities in one single molecule, but the two reactions are catalyzed asynchronously by two different molecules?</p></disp-quote><p>Our results or published data do not suggest that both activities are catalysed “asynchronously”. Rather, PBP1B requires ongoing GTase reactions for efficient TPase activity (Bertsche et al., 2005) and Catherwood et al. (2020) recently demonstrated that PBP1B uses peptides in the growing glycan chain synthesised by the GTase domain as TPase donors (<italic>i.e</italic>. they link the D-Ala in fourth position in the pentapeptides of the growing chain to the mDAP group in an acceptor chain) (Catherwood et al., 2020).</p><p>One might expect a short lag between the start of the GTase and the beginning of the TPase because the growing chain has to grow at least to ~8 subunits to reach the TPase site (Sung et al., 2009). However, the experiment of Figure 1F (new Figure 2E) is not suited to measure a possible lag phase because of the sampling rate (every 5 min) and the possibility that, at the beginning of the reaction, small peaks are missed because of the detection limit and the inherent noise of radioactivity detection in chromatography. For example, in Figure 1F (new Figure 2E) at 5 min, the area of the Penta peak is only 459 CPM (over a peak width of 0.8 min) and a possible smaller TetraPenta peak would be barely detectable over the signal noise, which is ~90 CPM/min.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors suggest that the decrease of FRET signal in Figure 2C, E and G is due to additional changes of fluorophore's spectroscopic properties. If so why such changes were not observed in the detergent or SLB experiments, if the product is the same? The authors should obtain parallel time points using radio-labeled Lipid II and run the products of both assays on HPLC to show that the decrease of FRET signal in these experiments did not correspond to changed product.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry, we are confused by the reviewer's question. We only see a downwards slope in the FRET curve of PBP1B reactions with LpoB and ampicillin in liposomes (old Figure 2C, middle panel), not in old Figure 2E or Figure 2G. We speculate in the text that this decrease could be due to the influence of the membrane on the fluorescence of the probe. If our speculation is correct, this decrease should not be observed on SLBs because due to the very low lipid II concentrations in those experiments, little PG is produced and, as inter-chain FRET is the major contributor to the FRET signal, very little or no FRET signal is observed with ampicillin. In assays with detergents there is no membrane that can affect fluorescence properties and, consistent with our speculation, we did not observe a negative slope (new Figure 1E, middle panel).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The SLB assay has great potentials to allow single-molecule measurement of glycan chain elongation and crosslinking kinetics. It is disappointing, though, to find out that no single-lipid II molecules in the polymerized PG can be visualized. Is this because the lipid II concentration too high on the SLB? Does it need to be that high?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that lipid II concentrations are too high in SLB for single molecule analysis, and this is so because concentrations low enough for single molecules do not support PG synthesis. We agree with the reviewer that single-molecule measurements of glycan chain elongation and cross-link formation is a worthy goal. We are working towards this goal but it is still a big step from where we are now with the current technology, which we believe already provides a major advance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) To fully drive home the message that the new FRET is better in many ways than previous assays, the authors should compare it with the dansyl-lipid II assay side by side (i.e., not putting the other assay in the supplemental figures) and quantitatively.</p></disp-quote><p>Both EcPBP1B and PaPBP1B have been studied by dansyl-lipid II assay in the literature (Schwartz et al., 2002, Egan et al., 2014, Caveney et al., 2020) and we did not repeat those published assays here. We performed the dansyl-lipid II assay for AbPBP1B and included it into the ms, because there was no prior information about this enzyme in the literature. We did not mean to claim that our assay is superior to the dansyl-lipid II because it provides better data, but because it allows to monitor transpeptidation and glycosyltransferase activity of the membrane-reconstituted enzymes (as is stated in the Discussion). Where relevant, we compared our results from the FRET assay with prior results in the literature obtained with dansyl-lipid II, <italic>i.e.</italic> when comparing the activation of the GTase rate by LpoB and LpoP regulators (“Coupled reactions in class A PBPs” section in the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Similarly, there appeared to be significant differences in FRET signals between the detergent, liposome and SLB assays with or without Amp, and it is difficult to compare the enhancement by LpoB among these assays. Please address these differences.</p></disp-quote><p>The conditions in SLB are not comparable to the conditions in liposomes and detergents, due to the low density of PBP1B in SLBs. This difference is discussed in the text (Results section on SLBs). As for the comparison between liposomes and detergents, we may expect differences in behaviour of enzymes because of the following reasons: (1) possible effects of detergents on enzyme activity and (2) kinetics of enzymatic reactions occurring on the membrane are different from reactions occurring in solution. We comment about the specific difference in behaviour of the enzymes in membranes in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) It is stated that: &quot;As expected, ampicillin did not prevent the stimulation of PBP1B by LpoB(sol), which accelerated the FRET increase by 10-20 times with or without ampicillin, consistent with the previously reported stimulation of both GTase and TPase activities.&quot; Although other results may suggest TPase activity is stimulated, one cannot draw the conclusion from the FRET assay results here that LpoB stimulates TPase activity – only that TPase activity boosts the FRET signal. There is some confusion in the manuscript about what can and cannot be concluded about mechanism from the FRET assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We agree that the FRET assay only does not allow the conclusion about TPase rate. Some activators enable PBPs to polymerise Atto-lipid II without unlabelled lipid II (thus reducing the distance between probes within the chains and increasing intra-chain FRET), hence we cannot conclude from FRET results alone that the activators stimulate the TPase. We have carefully edited the text to avoid this inaccurate statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use initial rates from the FRET assay to compare effects of LpoB in Figure 1 (and later do the same for other conditions/other activators). Initial rate conditions are used to quantify reaction rates for enzymes because under these conditions substrate depletion and product inhibition do not impact the rate. Initial rates are misleading when comparing a hyperbolic progress curve to a sigmoidal progress curve. The authors should comment on this, clarify the time frame over which the initial rates were measured (perhaps indicated with a figure), and also report the slopes of the &quot;fast&quot; phase of the reactions where activator is not present.</p></disp-quote><p>The slopes were calculated from the linear part of the curve when the signal started to increase after the lag phase (when present). For example, for reactions with detergent-solubilised <italic>E. coli</italic> PBP1B, we measured the slope from 10-20 min without LpoB (after the lag phase), but from 0-1.3 min with LpoB (no lag). The calculation of initial rates is now explained briefly in the Results text and in detail in the Materials and methods section. We now provide the absolute values for the slopes and the time windows used to calculate them for each condition in the source files for the corresponding figures (new Figures 1, 3, and Figure 3—figure supplement 5, Figure 3—figure supplement 6 and Figure 3—figure supplement 7). We have also relabelled the figures as “Fold change in initial rate” to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is a pattern of low mass bands in the PAGE gel in Figure 1D for the LpoB reactions; these are barely visible in the reactions without LpoB. At the same time, the glycan strands are shorter in length for the LpoB reaction compared to the reaction without LpoB (lanes 2 and 6). (Shorter glycan strands were observed previously for LpoB - e.g, Paradis-Bleau et al.; Lupoli et al.). I am curious about whether these observations are connected (and therefore whether they are connected to how LpoB achieves activation).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing to this observation. We would like to be hesitant to use the relatively crude method of SDS-PAGE to compare smaller differences in glycan chain lengths, as they might occur between samples with or without LpoB. Egan <italic>et al.</italic> (2018) observed an increase in the heterogeneity of chain lengths produced by PBP1B in the presence of LpoB, contradicting the results by Paradis-Bleu <italic>et al.</italic> and Lupoli <italic>et al.</italic> (Egan et al., 2018). Egan et al. also provided evidence that the solvent demethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) used in high concentration in the other studies, reduced the PBP1B-LpoB affinity and might itself has an effect on glycan chain length distribution. We believe it is outside the scope of the current manuscript to clarify this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors comment that the combined assays suggest that the total FRET signal emerges from two steps that have different rates. I recommend either refining or removing this comment. The statement suggests that it might be possible to extract rates for the two steps alluded to from the FRET signal. But there are more than two steps and two rates. For polymerization reactions, initiation and elongation rates are often substantially different and there is evidence in the literature that this is case for PG synthesis. (The slow rate of reaction for the &quot;only labelled Lipid II&quot; reactions does not report on the rate of polymerization with unlabeled Lipid II present because the products are very short – so the polymerization does not &quot;take off&quot; the way it does in the other reactions.) Moreover, there are likely two rates for crosslinking in vitro because the first crosslinks are formed intermolecularly and later crosslinks are formed intramolecularly. Finally, the FRET signal itself is different for uncrosslinked and crosslinked PG – as the authors note, it reaches a higher maximum for the latter.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We agree that our statement was confusing and we removed it from the manuscript. We thank the reviewer also for their comments on the different rates for GTase and TPase. We have added a more extensive discussion on GTase and TPase rates of class A PBPs, citing the relevant literature, and commenting on what can be concluded from our data on this topic in the rewritten “Coupled reactions in class A PBPs and their activation” section of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2C: was the lane 7 sample in the gel the same as the one for which the fluorescence trace is shown? The fluorescence trace looks flat but lane 7 shows polymerization. In other gels, other lanes that show comparable levels of polymerization also show a FRET signal.</p></disp-quote><p>We double checked the gels and the lanes are the same. Although there are some short glycan chains on lane 7, most of the lipid II remained unpolymerised. Besides, for FRET to occur in the absence of crosslinking more than one label has to be incorporated per chain and they should be sufficiently close together. The very low FRET thus indicates that very few probes are incorporated per chain at distances close enough to produce FRET.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I already mentioned that the discussion could use some work, but wanted to elaborate. The explanation for how TPase activity increases the FRET signal is plausible and supported by the data. But the section on &quot;coupled reactions in Class A PBPs&quot; is confusing because it is not clear what the authors are trying to accomplish with it. There has been a lot of debate about what LpoB does to activate PBP1b and how it does it. That LpoB affects both GTase activity and TPase activity has been shown repeatedly to one degree or another, and the idea that one activity influences the other in this context has been discussed explicitly going back at least to 2014 (Egan et al., 2014; Lupoli et al., 2014). The authors discuss the idea again here, evidently in response to a recent paper (Catherwood et al.) that attributes LpoB's essentiality to its effects on TPase activity. They conclude that Catherwood's conditions may have overemphasized the TPase effect. I don't think arguing this point is the most important use of the discussion space. The authors should clarify how they think about what the FRET assays show with respect to mechanism of Lpo activators and try to connect their work to a path forward.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these points. Based on the reviewer's suggestions we have extensively rewritten the part about “Coupled reactions in Class A PBPs” in the Discussion. We now discuss the effects of Lpo activators on activities of PBPs more broadly, with an emphasis to what our results can add to the ongoing discussions. In particular, we discuss the importance of assaying PBPs in the membrane environment based on our findings that LpoB is required for the activities of several PBPs we studied, when they were reconstituted into the membrane. We also discuss that this observation agrees with the absolute requirement of LpoB for the function of PBP1B in the cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript describes studies of generation of improved in vitro assay systems for peptidoglycan synthesis, using liposomes and supported lipid bilayers. This work can be very influential as this synthetic process is a primer candidate for the development for additional antibiotics, and the detection methods utilized are potentially adaptable to high-throughput screens.</p><p>Overall the paper is well written and the data are convincing. I have a few comments below, primarily concerning the data presentation.</p><p>1) Figures 1A, 2B, and 5: These figures show some of the fluorescently-labeled peptides as being involved in crosslinks. I do not think there is evidence in this paper that these substrates are ever used by transpeptidases. They do not appear to show up in obvious radioactively-labeled HPLC peaks. Doesn't this suggest that they are NOT being crosslinked? All off the crosslinked material seen in HPLC peaks is simply the radiolabeled Lipid II.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. Although it is technically possible that fluorescently-labelled pentapeptides participate as donors in the transpeptidase reaction, as depicted in our schemes, we found no evidence for this to happen in the HPLC assay. Thus, we have modified the schemes in the cited figures and now avoid showing Atto-labelled pentapeptides participating directly in cross-links.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1C: I don't understand why the slope with LpoB is greater in the presence of Amp? Can the authors comment?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1C (Figure 1F in the revised manuscript) we present the ratio between the slope of reactions with or without LpoB (relative slope = slope LpoB / slope no activator). Hence, Figure 1C indicates that the presence of LpoB causes a larger change in reaction slopes in the presence of ampicillin than in its absence. This was the same for all pairs of PBP1B-activator pairs studied, except for AbPBP1B/AbLpoP in detergents. The slope changes produced by activators in the presence of ampicillin reflect the acceleration of the GTase, while the slope changes produced in the absence of antibiotic reflect the combined effect of regulators on GTase and TPase rates. As we cannot separate the TPase and GTase rates from the curves without ampicillin, it is difficult to know what exactly causes this difference. In the revised manuscript we discuss the challenge to separating the effect of an Lpo activator on the GTase rates from the effect on the TPase rates.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>The major advantages of the assay are three-fold, (1) it is a real-time; (2) it is applicable to membrane-embedded enzymes, and (3) it can monitor both GTase and TPase. The revised manuscript has provided evidence for all the three with improved clarity, new control experiments, and better FRET efficiency calculations, but it still lacks the rigor in the quantitative (or semi-quantitative) aspect of the assay. Specifically, the authors need to provide evidence that the F<sub>acceptor</sub>/F<sub>donor</sub> ratio indeed reflects proportionally to either just the GTase activity or a combined GTase and TPase activity. The authors did show qualitatively that this ratio is altered when the activator LpoB (or P) or drugs are used, but it is difficult to use this ratio to compare quantitatively (or semi-quantitatively) the rates of different reactions catalyzed by different enzymes, or the same enzyme but with different mutations and regulators. Being able to do so will greatly enhance the impact of the FRET assay and promote its wide adoption in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for appreciating the advantages of the new assay. The control experiment shown in Figure 2AB and other experiments with inhibitors (Figures 1E; Figure 3C,E,G; Figure 3—figure supplement 7A, Figure 3—figure supplement 7B), demonstrate that the increase in F<sub>acceptor</sub>/F<sub>donor</sub> ratio is proportional to the GTase or GTase-TPase rates. However, it is currently not possible to precisely quantify their respective contributions (see our responses below).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that we cannot provide quantitative comparison of the catalytic rates of different enzyme based only on FRET increase. This is due to an inherent limitation of using (fluorescent) modified substrates in an enzymatic assay: different enzymes can potentially have different rates for utilising those substrates. We added a paragraph about the limitations of the assay to Discussion.</p><p>As for the effect of activators, we performed a new experiment, added the data to the manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and present these in the section “Intra-chain versus Inter-chain FRET”. These data clarify the effect of activators on the final FRET signal and on the slopes of the reaction curves.</p><p>With the appropriate control reactions (β-lactams, using only labelled lipid II) it was possible to determine in every case whether the FRET signal follows more closely the GTase (intra-chain FRET) or the TPase (inter-chain FRET) activities.</p><p>In conclusion, we are convinced that our novel FRET assay can be used to measure PG synthesis activity of a wide variety of enzymes and that it offers a straightforward approach for the biochemical screening of inhibitors and paves the way for detailed mechanistic studies of PG synthases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It appears that the measured F<sub>acceptor</sub>/F<sub>donor</sub> ratio is not only dependent on the GTase and TPase activities of PBP1B, but some other effects that influence the fluorescence of the dyes. These other effects will make it difficult to use the FRET assay to quantitatively compare different reactions. For example, in Figure 3C, the reaction with Amp (VII) barely had any signal change in F<sub>acceptor</sub>/F<sub>donor</sub>, but the corresponding gel lane cleared showed polymerized, linear PG strands, suggesting that the polymerization reaction is not reflected in the fluorescence ratio measurement. The rise and decay of the +LpoB/Amp (III) reaction also look strange-this reaction had a similar PG ladder on the gel as reaction (-LpoB/Amp)VII, but the fluorescence ratio measurements are drastically different. Another example is the comparison between the three PBP1Bs: it appears that crosslinking activities have different contributions to the fluorescence ratio measurement: ampicillin completely abolished the fluorescence ratio signal for PBP1BEc but not for PBP1BAb. It is hard to imagine that these highly homologous enzymes would have very different mechanisms to synthesize PG.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the results with PBP1B in the membrane require careful controls and that the interpretation is more difficult in part due to the lower activity of membrane-reconstituted PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> in the absence of LpoB. Therefore, in new experiments we performed reactions of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> in liposomes for 90 min (instead of 60 min), as for the reactions with PBP1B<sup>Pa</sup> and PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup> in liposomes. We think this new data shows more clearly the differences in activity between PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> in the membrane with and without LpoB, and we have updated Figure 3C accordingly.</p><p>The reviewers correctly observed that the polymerization reaction seen by SDS-PAGE is not always reflected in the fluorescence ratio measurement (FRET). This is true for several reasons:</p><p>i) We noticed that the image software automatically adjusts the contrast of files before exporting them, making weaker bands (e.g. bands for short strands) easier to visualize but misrepresenting their contribution to the total signal. We added a section to Materials and methods about fluorescent scanning of gels and their analysis, in which we mention the image processing. For quantification of gel signals in Figure 1 —figure supplement 5 we used the original image files without contrast adjustment. We have now uploaded the original image files for all gels presented as source data files.</p><p>ii) Regarding the examples discussed by the reviewers: The reactions with PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> liposomes with ampicillin without LpoB (-LpoB/+Amp, VII in previous Figure 3C, II in current Figure 3C) contain much more unused lipid II in their corresponding gel lanes than reactions in which LpoB was present (+LpoB/+Amp, III in previous Figure 3C, VI in current Figure 3C), consistent with a smaller signal change in F<sub>acceptor</sub>/F<sub>donor</sub> in the corresponding reactions curves. We investigated the rise and decay of the signal in the +LpoB/+Amp reaction with new experiments (see below, point iv).</p><p>iii) As discussed in the section “Intra-chain FRET versus inter-chain FRET”, our data suggests that with LpoB, PBP1B produces PG chains with more densely packed fluorophores. This is consistent with the glycan chains produced in the presence of Ampicillin without LpoB showing less FRET than with LpoB.</p><p>iv) We were also puzzled by the decaying FRET signal for +LpoB/Amp condition, which we previously had tested for a single preparation of liposomes. Thus, we repeated the assay at the same conditions (LpoB/Amp) several times with two new liposome preparations and using ampicillin from two different suppliers. We did not consistently observe this decay in FRET during the reactions and instead observed that the reaction at these conditions had two possible outcomes even with the same liposome preparation and ampicillin supplier: (i) (most often): no FRET-decay during reactions and long PG chains produced; (ii) (less often) FRET-decay and short chains at the end of reactions. We cannot currently explain why reactions of PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> liposomes with LpoB/Amp (and only these reactions) can have the two outcomes. It appears that the decay in the FRET signal did not happen because of environmental effect on the probes, but because of different enzyme activity. We have updated the data on Figure 3C and added a comparison of the different possible outcomes of the assay in this particular condition on Figure 3—figure supplement 2A. We comment on these results in section “FRET assay to monitor PG synthesis in liposomes”.</p><p>We disagree with the reviewers’ statement that &quot;It is hard to imagine that these highly homologous enzymes would have very different mechanisms to synthesize PG.&quot;. Actually, the similarity between different PBP1B homologues is not so high. Sequence comparison shows 33% identity and 45% similarity between PBP1B<sup>Ab</sup> and PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup>, and 41% identity and 52% similarity between PBP1B<sup>Pa</sup> and PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> and, importantly, their activators have different structures. Such differences could be the reason why, for example, ∆<italic>lpoP</italic> ∆PBP1A is viable in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Greene et al. 2018, PNAS 115(12):3150-3155), while ∆<italic>lpoB</italic> ∆PBP1A is lethal in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Paradis-Bleau et al., 2010, Cell 143(7):1110-20.), indicating that PBP1B<sup>Pa</sup> has higher residual activity in the cell in the absence of activator.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A likely explanation for these different fluorescence signals in these reactions is probably what the authors suggested, that some spectroscopic properties of the dyes changed due to the incorporation and/or local environment. Another possibility is that these enzymes of different species may handle the dye-labeled LipidII differentially, one PBP1B may have more difficulty in accepting the dye-labeled LipidII than the other PBP1B. Yet another possibility could also be that the stimulation effect of LpoB is simply that now more dye-labeled LipidII v.s. unlabeled Lipid II can be incorporated, but not necessarily the rate at which Lipid II is incorporated.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the discussion of these possibilities by the reviewers and believe the new controls added to the paper clarify most of their hypothesises:</p><p>1) Changes in spectroscopic properties of the dyes due to incorporation to PG or local environment effects: the end point controls with donor-only and acceptor-only as fluorescent lipid II versions show that FRET occurs. In addition, the new real-time controls with donor-only or acceptor-only as fluorescent lipid II version in detergents or liposomes (Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 4) demonstrate that changes in donor or acceptor fluorescence are minimal unless there is PG synthesis and both fluorophores are present in the reaction. Finally, as discussed above, we demonstrate that the FRET decay observed in some reactions with PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> liposomes and LpoB/Amp reflects a change in the type of glycan chains produced (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A).</p><p>2) Different enzymes having different reactivity towards labelled lipid II: we always assumed that this can be the case. This is an inherent limitation of any assay that uses fluorescent labelled substrates and is now discussed in the text (Discussion).</p><p>3) LpoB might affect the rate of incorporation of dye-labelled lipid II versus incorporation of non-labelled lipid II: It is known that LpoB stimulates the GTase rate with non-fluorescent lipid II (e.g. Figure 4 in Lupoli et al., 2014 J Am Chem Soc. 136:52-55). The new data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 commented in the section “Intra-chains versus Inter-chain FRET” show that LpoB does not increase the proportion of dye-labelled lipid II that gets incorporated into PG and suggests that the faster FRET increase in the presence of LpoB is not only caused by faster GTase rate but also reflects a more dense packing of the fluorophores in the final PG product. Presumably, LpoB allows PBP1B<sup>Ec</sup> to incorporate labelled substrate molecules more densely along the glycan chain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is understandable that these in vitro experiments are extremely challenging, but fluorescence measurements are sensitive and prone to artifacts, and the authors should perform control experiments to make sure that the measured signal indeed reflects the desired enzymatic activities. In particular, in calculating the fluorescence ratio, the donor-only and acceptor-only controls need to be run simultaneously to determine how much fluorescence change is due to the local environment change, and how much is due to FRET. The authors have performed these control experiments but only used them for the end-point measurements. These controls should also be performed for the real-time measurements (with LpoB, with or without Amp), which could help to explain some strange changes in the measured fluorescence ratio (such as that in Figure 3C).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewers and explained above, we incorporated these real-time controls for detergents and liposomes reactions in Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 4, respectively. In both cases, the changes in donor or acceptor fluorescence are minimal unless they are both present in the reaction with active enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The goal, hopefully, is that one can confidently interpret the ~ 25-fold higher initial slope of PBP1BEc with LpoB in the presence of ampicillin as a 25-fold (or proportionally) higher GTase activity of PBP1BEc stimulated by LpoB (such as that in Figure 3D). Similarly, one can use the smaller fold-increase of the initial slopes in the cases of PBP1BAb and PBP1BPa in the presence of their cognate activators to draw the conclusion that these activators do not stimulate these PBP1Bs to the same extent as that of PBP1BEc. If the fold enhancement of the initial slopes by LpoB in the presence and absence of ampicillin are similar to each other, one perhaps can say that here LpoB only stimulates the GTase activity, and so on and so forth.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that an ideal assay would precisely quantify the GTase and TPase rates in detergents and the membrane. However, this was not our goal when we set up the FRET assay and, indeed, by its nature, the FRET assay cannot provide absolutely quantitative data for reaction rates for several reasons:</p><p>1) FRET depends on the average distances and orientation of the fluorophore molecules on the growing glycan chains and the resulting PG. We cannot know the distribution and orientation of the fluorophores on the growing glycan chain and whether these parameters remain constant during the synthesis of a glycan chain and there is currently no method to determine these parameters.</p><p>2) Different PBPs may produce PG chains with different distribution/density of fluorophores, depending on their affinities to the different lipid II variants.</p><p>3) There is currently no methodology available to validate our data, as there is no other published assay that allows quantification of absolute GTase rates.</p><p>We discuss these limitations in a new section “Limitation of the FRET assay”. The new real-time control with donor-only or acceptor-only as labelled substrates (Figure 1—figure supplement 4, Figure 3—figure supplement 4) don't support the idea that the fluorophores are highly sensitive to the environment and reinforce our conclusion that FI<sub>acceptor</sub>/FI<sub>donor</sub> ratio is specific for FRET. The new data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 clarify what is the cause of the changes in FRET of the produced PG when LpoB is added, and help to interpret FRET curves with or without activators.</p><p>Our motivation to develop this assay was not to quantify the GTase rates for a detailed mechanistic comparison between different enzymes. Instead, we aimed to develop the first method to monitor PG synthesis continuously in a biomimetic membrane. Assays with fluorescently-labelled substrates do not report directly on the reaction rates of the enzymes for the unlabelled substrate, complicating precise comparisons between different enzymes (or combinations of enzyme and activator). However, these fluorescent substrates are the key to the specific and sensitive real time detection of PG synthesis in the membrane. In addition, as the assay does not require a complicated setup, it has the potential to be widely used in basic research and for screening for inhibitors. Hence, we believe that the assay will be widely used by the PG community despite its semi-quantitative nature.</p></body></sub-article></article>
