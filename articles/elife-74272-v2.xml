However, the role of translation initiation in the early induction of specific genes remains unclear. Here, we show human translation initiation factor eIF3 interacts with select immune system related mRNAs including those encoding the T cell receptor (TCR) subunits TCRA and TCRB. Binding of eIF3 to the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNA 3‚Äô-untranslated regions (3‚Äô-UTRs) depends on CD28 coreceptor signaling and regulates a burst in TCR translation required for robust T cell activation. Use of the <italic>TCRA</italic> or <italic>TCRB</italic> 3‚Äô-UTRs to control expression of an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) improves the ability of CAR-T cells to kill tumor cells in vitro. These results identify a new mechanism of eIF3-mediated translation control that can aid T cell engineering for immunotherapy applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translation initiation serves as a key gatekeeper of protein synthesis in eukaryotes and requires the action of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hern√°ndez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pelletier and Sonenberg, 2019</xref>). In humans, eIF3 is a 13-subunit protein complex that coordinates the cellular machinery in positioning ribosomes at the mRNA start codon. Several lines of evidence indicate eIF3 also serves specialized roles in cellular translation, by recognizing specific RNA structures in the 5‚Äô-untranslated regions (5‚Äô-UTRs) of target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), binding the 7-methyl-guanosine (m<sup>7</sup>G) cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lamper et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) or through interactions with <italic>N</italic>-6-methyl-adenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) post-transcriptional modifications in mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). Binding to these <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in mRNA can lead to translation activation or repression, depending on the RNA sequence and structural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de la Parra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). These non-canonical functions for eIF3 can aid cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), or allow cells to rapidly adapt to stresses such as heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). In the immune system, T cell activation requires a rapid increase in protein synthesis within the first few hours that also involves eIF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahern et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kleijn and Proud, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miyamoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ricciardi et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether eIF3 serves a general or more specific role in T cell activation is unknown.</p><p>Translation in non-activated lymphocytes is limited by the availability of translation initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahern et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mao et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wolf et al., 2020</xref>). The mRNAs for several translation initiation factors, including those for many eIF3 subunits, are repressed in resting T cells and are rapidly translated within hours of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wolf et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, nearly inactive eIF3 in quiescent T cells is activated to form translation initiation complexes in the first few hours after stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miyamoto et al., 2005</xref>). Activation of eIF3 coincides with the recruitment of subunit eIF3j to eIF3 and translation initiation complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miyamoto et al., 2005</xref>). Post-translational modifications are also thought to contribute to the early increase in translation, for example activation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kleijn and Proud, 2002</xref>). By contrast, the level of the canonical mRNA cap-binding complex eIF4F‚Äìcomposed of translation initiation factors eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A‚Äìincreases much later after T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mao et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have identified translational control of specific transcripts required for the rewiring of metabolism needed for effector T cell function. Translation of these specific transcripts involved in glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis occurs within 1‚Äì3 days of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ricciardi et al., 2018</xref>), and depends on the activity of eIF4F. Hundreds of other mRNAs translationally repressed in resting T cells are rapidly translated within hours after activation, including those encoding key transcription factors and ribosomal proteins, in addition to the translation initiation factors noted above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wolf et al., 2020</xref>). Most of these mRNAs are sensitive to mTOR inhibition, highlighting the importance of eIF4F for the translation of these specific transcripts. However, a small subset of mRNAs evade mTOR inhibition by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wolf et al., 2020</xref>). Whether eIF3 selectively regulates these or other mRNAs early in T cell activation is not known.</p><p>In the adaptive immune system, T cells are activated when a foreign antigen is recognized by the T cell receptor (TCR). However, robust T cell activation requires a second signal generated by interactions between the T cell and antigen presenting cell mediated by the co-receptor CD28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esensten et al., 2016</xref>). This two-signal mechanism enables T cells to adopt a fully active state and avoid becoming unresponsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Flies, 2013</xref>). The process of T cell activation can be mimicked in vitro using antibodies targeting both the TCR and CD28 (anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harding et al., 1992</xref>), which has greatly aided the dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying T cell activation.</p><p>Insights from these studies have also inspired efforts to engineer T cells for immunotherapy applications such as treating cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Flies, 2013</xref>). T cells can be engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that specifically target antigens on the surface of cancer cells, and signal through protein elements derived from both the TCR and CD28 or other co-stimulatory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Flies, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Globerson Levin et al., 2021</xref>). The most successful of these CAR T cells have been used to treat CD19-positive B cell malignancies, with dramatic results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kochenderfer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Qin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, CAR T cells still have a number of drawbacks, including toxicity to the patient, CAR T cell exhaustion, limited persistence and poor efficacy in solid tumors.

During TCR-dependent T cell activation, membrane proteins on the cell surface reorganize at the interface between the T cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) to form an immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huppa and Davis, 2003</xref>). TCR cluster formation is a central aspect of immune synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cochran et al., 2001</xref>).

We used the same cell populations as those used for the western blots above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), to correlate the TCRA protein levels observed in the western blots with TCR clustering. We performed immunofluorescence on SC, <italic>TCRA ŒîPAR</italic> and <italic>TCRB ŒîPAR</italic> T cell populations using anti-TCRA and anti-TCRB antibodies to detect the TCR.

Taken together, the <italic>TCRA</italic> Œî<italic>PAR</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> Œî<italic>PAR</italic> primary T cell populations exhibited multiple early and late T cell activation defects.

We first measured total TCR levels using western blots and an anti-TCRA antibody as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), at different time points after activation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies. WT Jurkat cells showed a TCR translational burst that peaked 5‚Äì8 hr after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 5A</xref>). By contrast, both <italic>TCRA</italic> Œî<italic>PAR</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> Œî<italic>PAR</italic> Jurkat cell populations expressed lower levels of the TCR proteins compared to WT cells, and failed to show a burst in TCR expression at early time points after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 5A</xref>). Importantly, <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNA levels were unaffected or even increased in the <italic>TCRA</italic> Œî<italic>PAR</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> Œî<italic>PAR</italic> Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 5B and C</xref>), similar to our observations with nanoluciferase reporters in primary T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This is consistent with TCR expression levels being regulated post-transcriptionally by eIF3 interactions with the <italic>TCRA</italic> or <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNA 3‚Äô-UTR elements. We then tested whether deleting eIF3 binding sites in both <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNA 3‚Äô-UTRs affected their interaction with eIF3. In both <italic>TCRA</italic> Œî<italic>PAR</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> Œî<italic>PAR</italic> cells, eIF3 bound to significantly lower amounts of the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNAs compared to WT cells at both the 5 hr and 8 hr time points after anti-CD3/anti-CD28 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 5D and E</xref>). This indicates deleting the eIF3 PAR-CLIP sites in the 3‚Äô-UTR disrupts eIF3 interactions with the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNAs substantially. Together with the nanoluciferase reporter experiments in primary T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), these results support the model that eIF3 binding to the 3‚Äô-UTR elements of the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNAs mediates the rapid burst in TCR translation after T cell activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNA 3‚Äô-UTRs enhance anti-CD19 CAR T cell function</title><p>T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) for cancer immunotherapy now in use clinically employ artificial 3‚Äô-UTRs in the CAR-encoding mRNA, a woodchuck hepatitis viral posttranscriptional regulatory element (<italic>WPRE</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Milone et al., 2009</xref>), or a retroviral 3‚Äô-long terminal repeat (<italic>3‚Äô-LTR</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kochenderfer et al., 2009</xref>).

At this point in time, eIF3 crosslinks to multiple mRNAs encoding proteins involved in immune cell function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3">Supplementary files 2 and 3</xref>). Interestingly, the patterns of eIF3 crosslinking, which for a number of mRNAs include interactions with the protein coding sequence and 3‚Äô-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1G and H</xref>), suggest an active role for eIF3 in promoting translation of these mRNAs. In support of this model, the two examples of pan-mRNAs we examined here (<italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic>) do not colocalize with P bodies or stress granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and binding to eIF3 includes the mRNA coding sequence on translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, this eIF3-mediated translation activation is transient, lasting only 1‚Äì2 hr in primary T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Importantly, the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNA 3‚Äô-UTR elements are necessary and sufficient to control this burst in translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that eIF3 can remain associated with translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bohlen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>), a phenomenon that seems to be enhanced for the pan-mRNAs identified here. It is possible that the 5‚Äô-UTRs and 3‚Äô-UTRs of some mRNAs are in close proximity, that is on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Christensen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christensen and Bourne, 1999</xref>), and eIF3 binding to the 3‚Äô-UTR could directly influence the efficiency of translation initiation from the 5‚Äô-UTR. Additional layers of translation regulation also contribute to T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tan et al., 2017</xref>), particularly with respect to mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miyamoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Myers et al., 2019</xref>) and carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Manfrini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ricciardi et al., 2018</xref>). The present PAR-CLIP experiments should help to elucidate additional roles for eIF3-mediated translation regulation and to map the system-wide role of translation regulation in T cell activation.</p><p>Recent experiments indicate that T cells must cross a threshold of T cell receptor signaling to commit to activation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Au-Yeung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Au-Yeung et al., 2014</xref>), setting up a ‚Äòdigital‚Äô response to antigen recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Au-Yeung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Au-Yeung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Richard et al., 2018</xref>). The response threshold involves integration of intensity and duration of TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Au-Yeung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Au-Yeung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Richard et al., 2018</xref>), and spans a wide range of TCR antigen affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Au-Yeung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Au-Yeung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Richard et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, T cell commitment to clonal expansion and differentiation can occur within as little as 1‚Äì2 hr of TCR stimulation for effector CD4+ and naive CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iezzi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Stipdonk et al., 2001</xref>). Remarkably, this time period spans the burst in TCR protein synthesis mediated by eIF3 interactions with the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNA 3‚Äô-UTR elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Naive CD4+ T cells require a longer duration of TCR signaling of ~20 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iezzi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schrum et al., 2005</xref>). Our observation of the burst in TCRA translation (and by implication TCRB translation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koning et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ohashi et al., 1985</xref>) in the first 1‚Äì2 hr of stimulation also correlates with multiple downstream events required for T cell activation and function. For example, loss of the burst in TCR protein synthesis delayed formation of TCR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that surface expression of the TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cochran et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huppa and Davis, 2003</xref>) is also impacted by the dynamics of TCRA and TCRB translation. Although we were not able to distinguish levels of TCR translation in isolated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), subsequent events in T cell activation including CD69 and CD25 expression, and IL2 and IFNŒ≥ secretion, were equally affected in CD8+ and CD4+ cells in which the <italic>TCRA</italic> or <italic>TCRB</italic> 3‚Äô-UTR PAR-CLIP sites were deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C‚ÄìF</xref>). In an immune response, CD28 engagement serves as the second signal required for T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harding et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harding and Allison, 1993</xref>) and affects the first minutes of TCR-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Green et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Green et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Michel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shahinian et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tuosto and Acuto, 1998</xref>). Here, we show CD28-mediated signaling is also needed for the burst of TCR translation on the hour timescale in primary T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that eIF3 controls <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNA translation during the first critical hours after antigen recognition that leads to subsequent T cell commitment to proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>We found the CD28-dependent burst in TCR translation requires cotranslational membrane targeting, consistent with the fact that CD28-mediated signaling occurs at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boomer and Green, 2010</xref>) and the fact that both the TCRA and TCRB subunits are integral membrane proteins. We also observed additional immune-related mRNAs in the PAR-CLIP experiment that encode membrane proteins or secreted proteins (i.e. B2M, CD28, CD3D, HLA-E, and LAT in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>, and TAP1 and TAP2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) which may be particularly sensitive to CD28 signaling. The requirement for CD28 in PD-1 mediated inhibition of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kamphorst et al., 2017</xref>) also suggests eIF3-mediated control of TCR expression may affect PD-1 checkpoint blockade-based cancer immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). It will be interesting to determine if there is a connection between PD1-mediated inhibition of the T-cell response and eIF3 binding to the 3‚Äô-UTRs of the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNAs. It will also be important to map the CD28-downstream signaling pathway to understand both the increase and subsequent decrease in TCR translation that occur during the translation burst. We found that AKT influences the rapid rise in translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E‚ÄìF</xref>), but other kinases such as Tec-kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreotti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gallagher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hallumi et al., 2021</xref>) could also impact the translation burst.</p><p>Cell immunotherapies targeting various cancers have made great strides, due to the engineering of chimeric antigen receptors that couple antigen recognition to intracellular signaling domains that activate cytotoxic T cells. However, CAR T cells often fail to eradicate cancers due to loss of activity over time, for example T cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Globerson Levin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>). Our results using nanoluciferase reporters indicated that eIF3-responsive mRNA 3‚Äô-UTR elements could be used to improve chimeric antigen receptor expression and CAR T cell responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eyquem et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Globerson Levin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>). We used this information to improve the ability of CAR T cells to kill tumor cells in vitro. With a clinically validated anti-CD19 CAR, we found that using the <italic>TCRA</italic> or <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNA 3‚Äô-UTRs dramatically shortened the lag time before the burst in CAR protein expression upon exposure to tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This short lag time correlated with improved tumor cell killing in cytotoxicity assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplements 1</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">6</xref>). Interestingly, using the <italic>TCRA</italic> or <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNA 3‚Äô-UTRs for CAR expression also improved CAR T cell propagation in the presence of target tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplements 1</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">6</xref>). Future experiments will be needed to determine the physiological basis for improved propagation of these CAR T cells in the presence of target tumor cells, and to address whether the timing of the CAR translational burst affects CAR T cell exhaustion.</p><p>There are fundamental differences between TCRs and CARs used in the clinic that may not be addressed using the modular nature of the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> 3‚Äô-UTRs. For example, CARs generally have a weaker affinity for their target ligand compared to TCRs for antigens presented on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, CARs do not elicit immune synapses as observed for TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dong et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we observed the burst in CAR protein expression using the <italic>TCRA</italic> or <italic>TCRB</italic> 3‚Äô-UTRs was still not as rapid as that of the endogenous TCR in T cells stimulated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This could be due to multiple factors, including CAR affinity for the CD19 antigen or the activity of the 4-1BB costimulatory domain used in the present CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Milone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">June et al., 2014</xref>) instead of the CD28 signaling domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kochenderfer et al., 2009</xref>). It is also possible that the 3‚Äô-UTRs of the endogenous TCR subunits, which were left intact in most of the present cytotoxicity assays, and which also responded to CAR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplement 1A</xref>), titrated cellular factors required for even shorter response times. T cell engineering to knock out the endogenous TCR 3‚Äô-UTRs or improved CAR design may shorten the lag before the burst in CAR expression and further improve CAR T cell function. Taken together, our experiments delineate the central role of eIF3 in T cell activation and highlight the importance of understanding translation regulation in immune cells to open new avenues for engineering improved cell therapies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for robust T cell activation and improved CAR T cell function mediated by eIF3 interactions with the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNAs.</title><p>Left, a T cell activated upon antigen recognition by the TCR and CD28 costimulatory signal leads to recruitment of the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNAs to translating ribosomes due to eIF3 binding to the mRNA 3‚Äô-UTRs.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dr B. Malissen as the Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor and their views concur.</p><p>The work primarily uses the Jurkat T cell line and demonstrates that eIF3 binds to TCRA and TCRB RNAs. The 3' UTR of TCRA and TCRB was responsible for eIF3 binding and this interaction resulted in a rapid burst in TCRA and TCRB translation through a mechanism dependent on CD28. Adding the TCRA or TCRB 3' UTR to a CAR-T construct improved its ability to kill tumor cells. Although the work has potential for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, it requires essential additional data to support the central claims of the paper. Each reviewer raised substantive concerns (see below) that need to be resolved experimentally. To quote a few, you should document in Jurkat and in primary T cells whether the rapid burst in TCRA and TCRB translation results in TCR up regulation on the cell surface. This would be important for the functional implications of your findings and considering that (1) CD247 is generally considered as the limiting factor in TCR surface expression, and (2) primary T-cells display a phenomenal sensitivity towards antigen, as the presence of typically only a few antigens on the APC is sufficient to trigger the full T-cell response. Along the same line the readout of T-cell activation shown in Figure 5 and 6 are rather weak. For instance, in Figure 6, gating for CD25 and CD69 is hard to see in the raw flow cytometry plots. Can this be adjusted with the biexponential axis? How were these gates set? In Figure 5, providing primary where possible will support results represented purely as graphs. Among the mechanistic issues, one particularly puzzling issue concerns the observation that the CD28-dependent burst in translation requires membrane tethering whereas the CD3-dependent increase does not. Please note that during the Reviewer discussion, it has been noted that the Western blots displayed in Figure 6D showed strikingly similar bands for donors 1 and 2 in several of the rows probed for CAR-TCR or HSP90. Even the slopes and shapes of these band seem similar. Accordingly, Reviewers have suggested to include the original blots in the revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Da Silva et al. demonstrate via biochemical and functional assays and bioinformatics that the 3'UTR of both TCRalpha and Œ≤ are targeted as part of translationally active polysomes by the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (elf3) in a fashion that depends on the activation of the costimulatory CD28 signaling pathway. They also show by means of mutagenesis of the 3'UTRs that translation of the resulting TCR mRNAs is increased under conditions where elf3 is allowed to bind. By means of nanoluciferase-based reporter assays they also provide evidence that 3'UTR-targeting by elf3 depends on membrane-proximal CD28 signaling. Furthermore, they were able to link activation-driven burst of TCR-translation levels to elf3-3'UTR binding. They present a convincing case that elf3-3'UTR binding in response to TCR-mediated stimulation promotes TCR-clustering, upregulation of CD25 and CD69 (in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells) as well as IL-2 (and to some extent IFNŒ≥) secretion. Lastly, they show that CD19-CARs equipped with either a TCRa- or a TCRb-3'UTR are earlier and more robustly translated upon CAR-T-cell activation with a B-cell lines. This behavior coincides with a somewhat increased CAR-T-cell-mediated killing activity especially at lower CAR-T-cell:target cell ratios or when CAR-T-cells are confronted with a target cell line expressing lower levels of CD19.

To what extent the binding elf3 to other parts of the mRNA effected by this pathway? Is this a general effect of one that is specific to selected 3'UTRs. How could this be addressed in future experiments? It has been reported that the PD1-PD-L1 interaction as it often occurs in the tumor microenvironment or in another setting of T-cell exhaustion affects predominantly CD28 signaling. Is the PD1-mediated inhibition of the T-cell response directly linked to a loss in elf3-3'UTR binding?</p><p>(ii) The authors show a boost in TCR and CAR translation that depends on the 3'UTR being able to bind elf3. How is TCR- and CAR- surface expression affected in the course of activation? How is activation-induced TCR- and CAR- downregulation affected? Primary T-cells feature a phenomenal sensitivity towards antigen, as the presence of typically only a few antigens on the APC is sufficient to trigger the full T-cell response. The situation with CARs is different in that they require 100x ‚Äì 1000x more antigen for stimulation. How is (CAR-)T-cell sensitivity affected by elf3-3'UTR binding? Time-lapsed flow cytometry experiments using IP26/recombinant CD19 (both commercially available) for detection and a simple titration experiment (involving plate-bound OKT3 or CD19 for stimulation) would clarify these sets of questions.</p><p>I am fond of this manuscript. because it provides an important aspect of TCR- and CAR-related physiology that appears highly relevant for T-cell-related immune protection and pathologies as well as T-cell based immunotherapies.

Experiments are very well-explained in the text and documented in the methods. They begin by using PAR-CLIP in the Jurkat T cell line and find that eIF3 binds to TCRA and TCRB, among other RNAs. They also identify a new pattern of eIF3 binding to the coding sequences of many genes, some of which are validated in primary human cells. Looking at the 3' UTR of TCRA and TCRB, the authors show that eIF3 binding to the 3' UTRs is responsible for activation-induced translational bursting, through a mechanism dependent on CD28. Finally, the authors add the TCRA or TCRB 3' UTR to a CAR-T construct and test its impact on CAR expression and cancer cell killing. Some findings in the study are better-supported than others. The finding of eIF3 controlling translational bursting of TCRA and TCRB by binding the 3' UTR is convincing.

The authors use PAR-CLIP to identify the binding patterns of eIF3 in Jurkat cells and find that regions within the 3¬¥ UTRs of TCRA and TCRB mRNAs are sufficient to increase their translation and drive T cell activation. Moreover, expression of the TCRA and TCRB 3¬¥UTRs in CAR T cells improves their ability to kill tumor cells, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of their findings.</p><p>‚Äì Figure 1: Venn diagrams should include data from non-activated Jurkat cells. The overlap between different data sets (eg.

These data should be discussed in more detail and the relevant analyses should be included in the main figures.</p><p>‚Äì The authors specify that the sites that were modified within the 3¬¥UTRs of TCRA and TCRB were identified through PAR-CLIP. However, the size of the deleted sequence is only mentioned in the context of their CRISPR/Cas9 deletion mutants (Figure 5 supplement 1A). Was the same region targeted in their reporters? Is there evidence that TCRA and TCRB mRNAs that contain these deletions in their 3¬¥UTRs are adequately exported out of the nucleus?</p><p>‚Äì The data presented in figure 2 nicely demonstrate that eIF3 is bound to the coding regions of certain mRNAs during their translation. However, it does not provide evidence that the binding of eIF3 occurs &quot;via&quot; the coding sequence as the authors claim in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p>‚Äì The lack of colocalization with stress granules and P bodies alone does not provide convincing evidence that the TCRA and TCRB are in &quot;translational hot spots.&quot; Figure 1F should be moved to the supplements as supporting information for the sucrose gradients presented in figure 2.</p><p>‚Äì In figure 3E, the authors demonstrate that the 3¬¥UTRs of TCRA and TCRB are required for the interaction between these RNAs and eIF3.

This section emerged from nowhere and greater explanation would be helpful both for the technical details and for the potential physiological importance of the membrane tethering dependency.</p><p>‚Äì De Silva et al. demonstrate that expressing the 3¬¥UTRs of TCRA and TCRB in CAR T cells leads to a faster increase in CAR protein expression. However, their data indicate that the increase in translation is transient (Figure 6D and Figure 6 supplement 1A). Therefore, the authors should comment on whether this decreased lag time in protein expression might also accelerate CAR T cell exhaustion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Robust T cell activation requires an eIF3-driven burst in T cell receptor translation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Although we did not look at surface expression of the TCR directly, we did look at TCR clustering after activation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies (Figure 5C and Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 1C), which requires TCR surface expression as a prerequisite. We saw clear delays in TCR clustering due to the mutations in the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> 3‚Äô-UTRs. We also looked at TCR levels on the cell surface by FACS after activation by PMA/Ionomycin in Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 1D-1E, again observing a decrease in cell surface TCR due to the mutations in the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> 3‚Äô-UTRs. We used PMA/Ionomycin because we could not examine TCR levels on the cell surface by FACS after anti-CD3/anti-CD28 activation, for the technical reason that the anti-CD3 antibody we used for activation in all of our assays (clone UCHT1) interfered with binding of the fluorescent antibody we used for TCR detection in FACS experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same line the readout of T-cell activation shown in Figure 5 and 6 are rather weak.

They also show by means of mutagenesis of the 3'UTRs that translation of the resulting TCR mRNAs is increased under conditions where elf3 is allowed to bind. By means of nanoluciferase-based reporter assays they also provide evidence that 3'UTR-targeting by elf3 depends on membrane-proximal CD28 signaling. Furthermore, they were able to link activation-driven burst of TCR-translation levels to elf3-3'UTR binding. They present a convincing case that elf3-3'UTR binding in response to TCR-mediated stimulation promotes TCR-clustering, upregulation of CD25 and CD69 (in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells) as well as IL-2 (and to some extent IFNŒ≥) secretion. Lastly, they show that CD19-CARs equipped with either a TCRa- or a TCRb-3'UTR are earlier and more robustly translated upon CAR-T-cell activation with a B-cell lines. This behavior coincides with a somewhat increased CAR-T-cell-mediated killing activity especially at lower CAR-T-cell:target cell ratios or when CAR-T-cells are confronted with a target cell line expressing lower levels of CD19. Overall the study highlights the importance of the 3'UTR for TCR and CAR translation in a setting of CD28-signaling with implications for (CAR-)T-cell functionality.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their overall positive comments on the manuscript.

One key point we didn‚Äôt make clearly is that, since both the TCRA and TCRB subunits are integral membrane proteins, the CD28- and membrane-dependent regulation may primarily affect the immune-related membrane proteins or secreted proteins that we identified in the PAR-CLIP data (i.e. B2M, CD28, CD3D, HLA-E, LAT in Supplementary File 5 and TAP1 and TAP2 in Supplementary File 3).

The number of <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA puncta identified using the DiAna segmentation algorithm also matches approximately the number of <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNAs we expect to find based on transcription profiling (see Supplementary file 4), and comparisons to the absolute number of mRNAs seen in activated B cells (See <sup>3</sup>). The number of <italic>TCRA</italic> transcripts is lower than <italic>GAPDH</italic>, based on our transcription profiling results (annotated for the constant region <italic>TRAC</italic> in Supplementary file 4). Thus, the ‚Äúpuncta‚Äù we originally assumed to be clusters of mRNAs are more likely than not to be individual mRNAs. We have therefore changed the wording in the main text to emphasize that the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> mRNAs do not colocalize with P bodies or stress granules, and eliminated any mention of puncta. Combined with the observation that the mRNAs exhibit the pan-mRNA crosslinking pattern with eIF3, this still supports the model that the mRNAs are being actively translated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) CAR T cell data is one representative of 2 donors, and the killing enhancement seen with TCRA or TCRB 3' UTR addition is mild. More biological replicates would be needed to convincingly show this with statistical testing.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have included additional biological replicates to address these concerns. Overall, we now report killing assays using 6 donors, with a range of CD19 CAR T designs and conditions. We think this is a good sign that the effects of the <italic>TCRA</italic> and <italic>TCRB</italic> 3‚Äô-UTRs are robust to varying experimental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors</p><p>1) It is possible to expand primary cells to 55 million, and this would enable the PAR-CLIP to be carried out on primary cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This is something we can consider for the future. We note that the use of 4-thio-U can be toxic to cells (See <sup>4</sup>). We spent considerable time optimizing concentrations of 4-thio-U for Jurkat cells that limited toxicity before carrying out the PAR-CLIP experiment. See the Materials and methods section, ‚Äú4-thiouridine optimization for PAR-CLIP experiments‚Äù. We would need to control for likely different responses in primary T cells. We also note that we may have missed the appropriate time to crosslink the cells had we not used Jurkat cells to begin with, followed by validation in primary cells. This is a bit of serendipity that we acknowledge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors conclude that eIF3 binding is specific to selected transcripts based on the fact that eIF3 cross-linking isn't correlated with mRNA abundance. Are these selected transcripts simply those that are newly transcribed? This would also explain why the eIF3-bound transcripts are highly enriched for immune processes.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting idea. We did carry out transcription profiling and have deposited those data along with the PAR-CLIP data in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. They are also quantified in Supplementary file 4. We also compared the transcription profiles to PAR-CLIP results in Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1F. Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have a time series to compare to, which could be done in the future. We have looked at Nanoluciferase reporter mRNA levels in Figure 3C and Figure 3H. We do see mRNA levels go up, but the translation levels don‚Äôt correlate directly with mRNA levels. The ‚Äúpeak‚Äù of the translation burst reaches 5x-10x (Figure 3B and Figure 3G) when mRNA levels are only up about 2x-3x. For these reporter mRNAs, even when translation drops off, mRNA levels stabilize or continue to increase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The comparison of PAR-CLIP results between HEK293T and Jurkat cells relies on ranking and thresholding. It would be preferable to do a more formal statistical comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. The PAR-CLIP experiments in Jurkat cells were done in a different way than those in HEK293T cells, complicating the direct comparison. First, the sequencing depth in the Jurkat cells was much higher, improving the signal to noise in the experiment relative to the HEK293T cells (See Supplementary files 2 and 3). This is why we used ranking and thresholding by crosslink reads per transcript in the Jurkat experiment. We also used a larger proportion of anti-EIF3B-bound beads to affinity purify the crosslinked eIF3 RNPs from Jurkat cells, again to improve the signal to noise of the experiment. We also used a different RNase (MNase in our case) compared to the HEK293T experiment, based on extensive optimization. Finally, the Venn diagram is only a proxy for eIF3-mRNA interactions, as the pattern of crosslinking differs (i.e. the presence of pan-mRNAs in Jurkat cells). We therefore think the present comparison is the best compromise, given the multiple differences in the experiments. Since the Venn diagrams may be a distraction from the key points we make in the paper, we have moved the Venn diagrams to the figure supplement and moved the GO term figure to the main figure, as suggested below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) In several places in the Methods there seem to be conflicting descriptions of Jurkat cells being used at 8 x 105 versus 8 x 106 / mL.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for catching this discrepancy. We have updated the Methods to indicate the correct number of cells (8x 10^5/mL).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Gating for CD25 and CD69 is hard to see in the raw flow cytometry plots. Can this be adjusted with the biexponential axis? How were these gates set? Many percentages on gates in Figure 5 ‚Äîfigure supplement 2a are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted for Reviewer #1, we have split off the flow images into separate figure supplements so that the resolution is not lost. Now that these are separate figures, we have added percentages that we originally left off for clarity. We also converted the axes to biexponential axes and clearly mentioned in the Materials and methods that we have used TCR KO cells (Œî<italic>TCR)</italic> to set the CD69+ and CD25+ gating, as we were able to obtain knockout editing efficiency of 95% or higher in those cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The live cell gate in Figure 6 ‚Äîfigure supplement 1b is non-conventional, at least to this reviewer. Can this be explained?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this question. We assume the confusion is that there is an empty channel in the 2-D plot, meaning that there is no signal used from the vertical axis used to select live cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>De Silva et al. 2021 present exciting results regarding the role of the eIF3 complex in T cell activation. The authors use PAR-CLIP to identify the binding patterns of eIF3 in Jurkat cells and find that regions within the 3¬¥ UTRs of TCRA and TCRB mRNAs are sufficient to increase their translation and drive T cell activation. Moreover, expression of the TCRA and TCRB 3¬¥UTRs in CAR T cells improves their ability to kill tumor cells, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their enthusiasm for our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>‚Äì Figure 1: Venn diagrams should include data from non-activated Jurkat cells. The overlap between different data sets (eg. EIF3A/C/B vs. EIF3D/L) should also be represented using a Venn diagram and included in this figure to convince the reader that the IPs against the different subunits are representative of what the entire complex is binding to. GO terms for overlapping mRNAs should be moved to the main figure and discussed in more detail in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point we now emphasize more strongly. We had noted in the main text that eIF3 crosslinked to about 75x fewer mRNAs in non-activated cells compared to activated cells. In non-activated Jurkat cells, there were very few mRNAs enriched in the PAR-CLIP experiment, to the point we can‚Äôt make Venn diagrams using the same cutoffs as for activated cells. We now note this in the Materials and methods, and the data are included in Supplementary files 2 and 3. This distinction is also captured in Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1C-1D. In terms of the IP, we used a single well-validated anti-EIF3B antibody (Lee et al., 2015) to pull down the entire eIF3 complex. See Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1B. Given complications with making these Venn diagrams as noted for Reviewer #2, we think the ones we included are sufficient, without overly interfering with the flow of the paper. As noted above, since the Venn diagrams may be a distraction from the key points we make in the paper, we have moved the Venn diagrams to the figure supplement and moved the GO term figure to the main figure, as suggested. We also discuss some of these mRNAs in the context of CD28 signaling, as noted above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>‚Äì All sequencing tracks presented in the manuscript should include a scale in order for the reader to better assess the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize, we accidently dropped these from the present version of Figure 1E.

These are also present in Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>‚Äì When discussing the PAR-CLIP data, the authors state that &quot;eIF3 crosslinking does not correlate with mRNA abundance.&quot; Was RNA-seq performed in parallel?

However, the size of the deleted sequence is only mentioned in the context of their CRISPR/Cas9 deletion mutants (Figure 5 supplement 1A). Was the same region targeted in their reporters? Is there evidence that TCRA and TCRB mRNAs that contain these deletions in their 3¬¥UTRs are adequately exported out of the nucleus?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing out this ambiguity. We did indeed remove (or reverse) the same sites in the 3‚Äô-UTRs in the reporter experiments. We did not analyze mRNA export, but it is unlikely that defects in mRNA export can explain our observations. The mRNAs with a deletion or reversal of the 3‚Äô-UTR PAR-CLIP sites are still translated (Figure 3B). Thus, if mRNA export were the only problem with these mRNAs, we would still have seen a translational burst from the mutant mRNAs. We don‚Äôt observe a burst from these mRNAs despite the fact they are translated, arguing for a direct effect of the 3‚Äô-UTR deletions/reversed sequences on translation. Additionally, we don‚Äôt see appreciable differences in mRNA levels in Figure 3C with the deletions or reversed sequences compared to WT. In fact, in the cases of <italic>TCRA ŒîPAR</italic> and <italic>TCRA</italic> R*<italic>PAR</italic> mRNA levels were actually higher than WT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>‚Äì The data presented in figure 2 nicely demonstrate that eIF3 is bound to the coding regions of certain mRNAs during their translation.

One set of experiments that we now reference in the Discussion is negative stain EM data on the ER membrane by A. Kent Christensen <italic>et al.</italic>, in which the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô ends of mRNAs are in close proximity in polysome ‚Äúcircles‚Äù or ‚Äúhairpins‚Äù.

Therefore, the authors should comment on whether this decreased lag time in protein expression might also accelerate CAR T cell exhaustion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question, and we have commented in the Discussion that future experiments will be needed to explore the effect of CAR expression on T cell exhaustion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is a small remaining concern that one of the Reviewer would like to see addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>&quot;The concern with the killing assay is that the 24 and 48h time points at which the remaining CTV-labeled target cells were measured do not take cell proliferation of T cells or targets into account. Thus, the increased differences at 48h compared to 24h could be skewed by differential cell proliferation. A control would be needed to account for this.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this question. The reviewer is right that we did not consider CAR T cell propagation in our analysis, which could have confounded are results to some extent. Importantly, we started all experiments with the same number of cells at the designated ratios at the beginning of the assay. We also note that due to the staining of the NALM6 and Jeko 1 cells with CTV, we were able to separate the B tumor cells from the CAR T cells in all conditions over time, which we now diagram in Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplement 1B. This revised panel shows the separation at 24 hrs. We also see similar separation at 48 hrs and 72 hrs. This indicates that the B tumor cells are not replicating appreciably in these conditions, and even for cells that replicate (seen at 48 hrs and 72 hrs as a drop in CTV signal for a subset of cells), we can cleanly separate B tumor cells from CAR T cells in our analysis.

First, we report the percent of NALM6 or Jeko 1 cells killed using the ratio of dead B tumor cells to total B tumor cells, as derived from the CTV staining. This analysis eliminates any confounding cell counting effects due to the presence of CAR T cells. Second, we have now added bar graphs showing the relative number of live CAR T cells in each condition. The values are normalized to the number of WPRE CAR T cells in the 1:1 effector:target conditions at each time point. We used this normalization since we are interested in CAR T cell propagation rather than the control cells. Notably, we almost invariably see that CAR T cells expressing the anti-CD19 CAR using the <italic>TCRA</italic> or <italic>TCRB</italic> 3‚Äô-UTR elements propagate better than CAR T cells using the <italic>WPRE</italic> or <italic>3‚Äô-LTR</italic> elements.
