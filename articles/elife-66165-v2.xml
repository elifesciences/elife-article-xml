(SHANK) protein family are considered as master scaffolds of the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses. Several missense mutations within the canonical SHANK3 isoform have been proposed as causative for the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, there is a surprising paucity of data linking missense mutation-induced changes in protein structure and dynamics to the occurrence of ASD-related synaptic phenotypes. In this proof-of-principle study, we focus on two ASD-associated point mutations, both located within the same domain of SHANK3 and demonstrate that both mutant proteins indeed show distinct changes in secondary and tertiary structure as well as higher conformational fluctuations. Local and distal structural disturbances result in altered synaptic targeting and changes of protein turnover at synaptic sites in rat primary hippocampal neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group

novo and inherited point mutations contribute to several neuropsychiatric disorders and are common in genes that are responsible for synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gratten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hammer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Penzes et al., 2011</xref>). Currently, very little is known about how such missense mutations alter protein structure and conformational stability in a manner that might cause disease-related synaptic phenotypes. Establishing such structure-function relationships will contribute to a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms in particular for autism spectrum disorder (ASD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stefl et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>SHANK3 is a multidomain synaptic scaffold protein most prominently expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grabrucker et al., 2011</xref>). To date, multiple splice isoforms of SHANK3 with varying domain organization have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>). The SHANK3a isoform shows highest expression in the striatum and hippocampus and consists of five distinct domains plus an additional proline-rich cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jiang and Ehlers, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>). These include the SHANK/ProSAP N-terminal (SPN) domain followed by the ankyrin repeat region (ARR), a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, the PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, and the C-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM). The SPN domain has been shown to interact with small GTPases of the Ras superfamily including R-Ras, H-Ras or Rap1, which are involved in the regulation of synaptic F-actin structure and dynamics and in postsynaptic signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lilja et al., 2017</xref>). The ARR domain binds the cytoskeletal protein α-fodrin, an adhesive junction associated protein δ-catenin, and a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex, sharpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böckers et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hassani Nia et al., 2020</xref>). While the SH3 domain directly associates with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3, the PDZ domain is involved in a direct interaction with synapse-associated protein 90/postsynaptic density-95-associated protein 1 (SAPAP1) or the GluA1 subunit of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boeckers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Uchino et al., 2006</xref>). Between the PDZ domain and the C-terminal SAM domain, SHANK3 contains a proline-rich region harboring multiple protein interaction sites including those for homer1 and cortactin, which are relevant for linking of SHANK3 to other PSD scaffolds and the regulation of spinous actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacGillavry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naisbitt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tu et al., 1999</xref>). Finally, the SAM domain facilitates oligomerization of SHANK3 within the postsynaptic density (PSD) and is required for postsynaptic targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boeckers et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, SHANK3 acts as ‘master organizer’ of the PSD via multiple protein interactions and the resulting indirect association with ionotropic glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jiang and Ehlers, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>) and is thus crucial for synaptic structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grabrucker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monteiro and Feng, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Disruption of SHANK3 function has been linked to numerous neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gauthier et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, it is one of the few proteins with a clear genetic linkage to synaptic dysfunction in conditions like the Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) and other ASDs disease states collectively coined as shankopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guilmatre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>). Pathogenic rearrangements in the <italic>SHANK3</italic> gene result in either copy-number or coding-sequence variants, which have been shown to be of high clinical relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boccuto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leblond et al., 2014</xref>). While alterations in copy-number caused by gene deletions, ring chromosomes, unbalanced translocations or interstitial deletions have been studied extensively in several <italic>SHANK3</italic> knockout mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peixoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoo et al., 2019</xref>), the impact of deleterious <italic>SHANK3</italic> coding-sequence variants on protein structure and a corresponding synaptic phenotype is much less clear. Only one study reported the generation of a <italic>SHANK3</italic> knock-in mouse line carrying the Q321R mutation identified in a human individual with ASD. Homozygous knock-in mice showed reduced levels of SHANK3a, suggesting an altered protein stability and the physiological and behavioral characterization revealed decreased neuronal excitability, repetitive and anxiety-like behavior, EEG patterns, and seizure susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoo et al., 2019</xref>). Single nucleotide deletions or insertions can lead to frameshifts, premature stop codons, or changes in splicing whereas more frequently occurring missense mutations could have an impact on the local or global protein structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hassani Nia and Kreienkamp, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure for an N-terminal SHANK3 fragment comprising the SPN and ARR domain has recently become available (PDB 5G4X; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lilja et al., 2017</xref>). Two autism-related point mutations, R12C and L68P, have been described in patients and are located within this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hassani Nia and Kreienkamp, 2018</xref>) and therefore represent an attractive target for structural analysis. In previous work, the L68P mutation has been shown to alter G-protein signaling and integrin activation as well as to result in enhanced binding to protein ligands such as α-fodrin or sharpin, whereas the R12C mutation has been reported to have moderate effects on spine formation and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Durand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lilja et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mameza et al., 2013</xref>). The R12C mutation was originally identified in an autistic patient suffering from severe mental retardation and total absence of language, who inherited the mutation from his mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand et al., 2007</xref>). The L68P mutation was transmitted by an epileptic father and was shown to result in language disorder and ASD in a female patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gauthier et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this study, using a wide range of biophysical and cellular approaches we show that the ASD-associated point mutations R12C and L68P affect different levels of protein structure. While the R12C mutation confers increased secondary structure stability and reduces synaptic residing time of SHANK3, the L68P mutation results in partial unfolding with reduced tertiary structure stability and an increased number of dendritic SHANK3 clusters. Thus, subtle mutation-induced changes in tertiary structure come along with altered conformational fluctuations that will likely cause ASD-related synaptic phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SHANK3 L68P and R12C mutants show altered folding and complex topology</title><p>We first aimed to provide structural underpinnings that might be causally linked to the pathological role of the two inherited ASD-associated missense mutations located within the SPN domain of SHANK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To that end, we examined the low-resolution structure of a larger SHANK3 fragment covering amino acids 1 to 676 including the SPN, ARR, SH3, and PDZ domains in solution by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). This method is especially powerful to analyze structural changes of large and conformationally flexible multidomain proteins in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchet and Svergun, 2013</xref>). To purify each individual SHANK3<sup>(1-676)</sup> fragment (a wild type/WT, R12C-, and L68P-mutant), we fused an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-tag to enable protein purification via Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Eluted proteins were then further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, for SAXS we did not cleave the tag in order to improve solubility and to allow for measurements over a broader concentration range. We found that both the WT and R12C mutant showed a linear dependence of the radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) on protein concentration. For the L68P mutant, R<sub>g</sub> also increased with concentration but showed no linear dependency, which might indicate increased interparticle interactions due to partial unfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, we observed an increase of the maximum particle diameter (D<sub>max</sub>) with increasing protein concentration from pair distance distribution functions (PDDFs), which were calculated from SAXS profiles measured for each His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-SHANK3<sup>(1-676)</sup> variant at indicated concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

Interestingly, we found that all three SHANK3 variants can form dimers via their SH3 and PDZ domains in a 2 × 2 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>However, the fitted curve for the dimer deviates from experimental data in the very low angular range, suggesting the existence of a monomer-dimer equilibrium. Independently, <italic>OLIGOMER</italic> analysis of SAXS data indicated a linear decrease of the monomeric SHANK3 volume fraction with increasing concentration, thereby further corroborating a dynamic concentration-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). While the R12C mutant did not show any significant changes in the dimeric protein complex topology compared to the WT, the relative orientation of the ARR domain was altered with respect to the [(SH3)-(PDZ)]<sub>2</sub> cluster for the L68P mutant. This indirectly suggests that not only the SAM domain but also the SH3 and PDZ domains might be actively involved in the formation of an oligomeric SHANK3 scaffold in the PSD. Consequently, it would be of great value to obtain detailed information about the concentration of SHANK3 at the synapse as this would allow an estimation of the contribution of SH3 and PDZ domain-mediated dimerization in the spine.</p><p>To facilitate further structural analyses, however, these interparticle effects were removed by extrapolation to infinite dilution. Since the estimated monomeric SHANK3 volume fraction at zero concentration is close or equal to unity for all variants, zero-extrapolated SAXS profiles represent the monomeric state of His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-SHANK3<sup>(1-676)</sup>. For the WT and R12C mutant, Kratky plots generated from zero-extrapolated SAXS profiles had the shape of a folded multidomain protein with a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the L68P mutant showed the characteristic shape of a partially unfolded protein. Furthermore, PDDFs revealed that both the WT and mutants exhibit monomeric D<sub>max</sub> values of ~14–15 nm, consistent with values obtained from low-concentration SAXS profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Finally, <italic>CORAL</italic> fitting of zero-extrapolated SAXS profiles without any symmetry constraint (space group P1) showed additional structural differences in the corresponding monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Interestingly, for both mutants the modeled monomeric protein structure exhibited a change in the relative position of the SH3 and PDZ domains, which are in turn separated from the ARR domain by an intrinsically disordered region of 122 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). While, in the R12C mutant, the SH3 and PDZ domains seem to be connected to the ARR domain more strongly, the L68P mutant shows a decoupling of these domains. To additionally capture potential mutation-induced disruptions of the interface between the SPN and ARR domain, we performed <italic>CORAL</italic> fits, where the linker region of the SPN-ARR fragment (PDB: 5G4X, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lilja et al., 2017</xref>) has been replaced by flexible dummy residues (DRs). Expectedly, this resulted in an improvement of fits due to the increased degrees of freedom and revealed that the SPN domain is decoupled from the ARR domain in both mutants, indeed suggesting a disruptive effect of both mutations on the domain interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Collectively, the data indicate that the ASD-associated mutations R12C and L68P result in altered protein folding (L68P) and complex topology in solution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The L68P mutation results in reduced tertiary structure stability</title><p>Since the SAXS data suggest changes in the tertiary structure of ASD-associated SHANK3 mutants, we tested this hypothesis with nano-differential scanning fluorimetry (nDSF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2014</xref>). To exclude a possible contribution of His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO to thermal transitions, we removed the tag by treatment with Sentrin-specific protease 2 (SenP2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>) and obtained individual SHANK3<sup>(1-676)</sup> variants in sufficient purity for nDSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We monitored the thermal unfolding of purified SHANK3<sup>(1-676)</sup> variants label-free using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission of the untagged protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To suppress precipitation of melted proteins, we added increasing concentrations of urea (0.25–2.0M) to the samples. Although aggregation was largely prevented by addition of 2.0M urea, protein precipitates were still visible after completing thermal denaturation runs, indicating the irreversibility of thermal unfolding, which is known for many large multidomain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Strucksberg et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we compared the thermal transitions on a qualitative level and classified the complex melting behavior into three partially overlapping thermal transition zones (T<sub>m</sub>1–T<sub>m</sub>3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>). Individual transition points have been identified by peak detection of first derivative curves, which were determined from the corresponding fluorescence ratio curves (F 350/330 nm vs. T; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Interestingly, we found only a single transition point for the R12C mutant in the absence of urea, while both the WT and L68P mutant showed multiple transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, upon titration with urea the L68P mutant clearly showed a strongly increased structural susceptibility as we observed a pronounced shift of transition zones 1 and 2 toward lower temperatures (~4–6°C in T<sub>m</sub>1 and ~8°C in T<sub>m</sub>2). This shift was essentially absent for the R12C mutant, which displayed transition temperatures very similar to the WT. To independently verify the reduced tertiary structure stability of the L68P mutant, we performed intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy measurements using His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-SHANK3<sup>(1-676)</sup> variants, which have also been used for SAXS before. Consistently, fluorescence spectra showed a marked reduction in the peak intensity of fluorescence emission between 330 and 350 nm for the L68P mutant, indicative of partial unfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, by extrinsic fluorescence emission spectroscopy we observed an approximately twofold increase in the peak fluorescence intensity of the dye 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonate (ANS) for the L68P mutant compared to WT and R12C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since ANS becomes strongly fluorescent only upon binding to a hydrophobic environment, these measurements indicate an increased surface hydrophobicity of the L68P mutant. Collectively our data reveal that the L68P, but not the R12C mutation, reduces stability and results in perturbed tertiary structure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ASD-associated SHANK3 mutations differentially affect protein tertiary structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the SHANK3<sup>(1-676)</sup> fragment, which was used for nDSF measurements.

For direct comparison, identical protein preparations were used for nDSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and CD spectroscopy experiments. We initially conducted isothermal equilibrium chemical unfolding experiments using urea as denaturant and followed induced structural changes by measuring ellipticities at 222 nm, reporting on α-helical unfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We then fitted the data to a two-state unfolding transition model using a linear extrapolation method (LEM) to obtain the free energy of unfolding (ΔG<sub>unfold</sub>) as a function of denaturant concentration. Interestingly, we found only subtle differences in the transition midpoint concentration of urea (ΔG<sub>unfold</sub> = 0 for urea concentration of 3.3 mol/L [WT], 3.4 mol/L [R12C], and 3.1 mol/L [L68P]) but observed a reduction in unfolding cooperativity of both mutants due to a reduced dependence of ΔG<sub>unfold</sub> on denaturant concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggests a mutation-induced destabilization of the SHANK3 secondary structure, which is distinct from the observed tertiary structure perturbations. It has been reported that chemically and thermally denatured protein states may differ substantially. We, therefore, next aimed to complement our chemical unfolding experiments with thermal unfolding measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Narayan et al., 2019</xref>). We observed that the presence of 2.0M urea induced a strong reduction of transition temperatures detected by nDSF but almost no change in ellipticity at 222 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). Therefore, we acquired CD melting curves of SHANK3<sup>(1-676)</sup> variants in the presence of 2.0M urea from the same sample which was used for chemical unfolding. Strikingly, CD melting temperatures differed substantially from those observed by nDSF (~62–68 vs. ~29–51°C) and showed an increase in the thermal stability of the R12C mutant by approximately 6°C compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The L68P mutant, however, did not show an altered melting temperature compared to the WT. In line with this, limited trypsin proteolysis experiments suggest a mildly decreased proteolytic cleavability of the R12C mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, we did not detect significant discrepancies between the WT and both mutants in their far-UV CD spectra, suggesting that their secondary structure content is similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Overall, we observed thermally distinguishable secondary and tertiary structure unfolding as well as differential susceptibility of both mutants to either chemical or thermal perturbations.

Therefore, we performed immunocytochemical labeling of endogenous homer and bassoon as excitatory postsynaptic and presynaptic markers, respectively, and analyzed their co-localization with endogenous SHANK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We found that approximately 70% of homer-positive excitatory synapses contained SHANK3 while SHANK3-positive synapses co-localized with homer nearly to 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, approximately 80% of SHANK3 clusters had a bassoon-positive presynaptic contact. To analyze cellular consequences induced by SHANK3 missense mutations, we overexpressed full-length GFP-tagged SHANK3a variants, which is the most abundant isoform, in primary rat hippocampal neurons for less than 24 hr to prevent protein dosage-dependent effects as higher SHANK3 expression levels directly affect spine structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roussignol et al., 2005</xref>).

However, neurons expressing the L68P mutant exhibited a significantly increased number of dendritic GFP-SHANK3 L68P clusters in the shaft compared to the WT, suggesting impaired localization to dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The R12C mutant showed the same, yet less pronounced trend. Line profile analyses of SHANK3 intensity distributions between spines and dendrites, however, revealed that spines contained on average approximately three times more GFP-SHANK3, independent of the genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We thus asked whether these dendritic SHANK3 clusters are contacted by a presynaptic terminal by performing immunostaining for homer and bassoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref>).

Perturbation or dysregulation of synaptic proteins constitutes an integral part of many neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases such as ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kleijer et al., 2014</xref>). Although attempts have been made to converge existing data to a few common ASD pathways, the complexity of these pathways remains a challenge and is far from being fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the high frequency of mutations in the synaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 (more than 1 in 50) in patients with ASD and intellectual disability, mutation screening of SHANK3 has been suggested for consideration in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leblond et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, it has been emphasized previously that more than one pathogenic pathway downstream of SHANK3 is likely to exist and individual pathogenic processes related to synaptic organization and function have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Durand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mameza et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). Therefore, it seems likely that individual ASD-associated pathogenic pathways related to SHANK3 are reflected by distinguishable structural perturbations elicited by distinct missense mutations. Hence, a precise understanding of SHANK3 missense mutation-induced structural changes as well as their associated pathogenic pathways should reveal disease-causing mechanisms but is largely missing. Bioinformatics studies suggested that functional consequences of missense mutations can be predicted based on structural features for the ASD- and cancer-associated protein phosphatase PTEN, as well as for voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heyne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2019b</xref>). However, to our knowledge, studies correlating distinguishable structural perturbations of disease-relevant protein missense variants with an altered cellular phenotype are very limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Post et al., 2020</xref>). In this work, we found that missense mutation-induced impairments of the structural integrity of SHANK3 serve as molecular starting point for higher-order pathogenic processes associated with ASD. Taken together, we demonstrate changes in synaptic turnover as exemplary consequence of ASD-associated missense mutations, indicating that structural impairments directly translate to cellular alterations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>R12C and L68P mutations result in altered conformational flexibility of SHANK3 on a nanosecond timescale</title><p>The description of the functional impact of protein missense mutation is incomplete if only a static structural picture is considered. Consequently, the evaluation of the pathogenic role of protein missense variants greatly benefits from analyses of changes in structural dynamics as a result to these point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ponzoni and Bahar, 2018</xref>). Here, we identified the SPN domain as a local hotspot of conformational dynamics and found that both ASD-associated missense mutations further increase conformational fluctuations within the SPN domain. Furthermore, we demonstrated a reduction of conformational dynamics within the ARR domain of SHANK3 due to the R12C and L68P mutation, which suggests the existence of more wide-ranging structural interactions affecting distal domains. Consistently, reconstruction of the L68P mutant His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-SHANK3<sup>(1-676)</sup> complex topology from solution scattering data revealed a rearrangement of ARR domains compared to the WT complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, local and distal structural disturbances in response to ASD-associated SHANK3 missense mutations were observed, which could explain changes in protein function not directly related to the immediate locus of amino acid substitution. Therefore, point mutations could impact overall 3D protein structure resulting in altered intra- and intermolecular interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>SHANK3 missense mutants exhibit altered localization and residing time at the synapse</title><p>As SHANK3 is critically involved in regulating synaptic structure and function, neurons are sensitive to altered gene dosage, which has been pointed out by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yi et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, albeit both mutations are located within the SPN domain, they had distinct effects on SHANK3 folding and residing time as well as localization at the synapse, suggesting that each point mutation might cause synaptic dysfunction by different mechanisms. Since autistic patients carrying the SHANK3 missense mutations studied here are heterozygous, the question arises whether these mutations render the protein dysfunctional and thereby reduce the minimum number of functional proteins that is necessary for normal synaptic transmission. A profound decrease in synaptic residing time of R12C SHANK3 mutant is likely to destabilize the synaptic SHANK3 pool and could thus elicit a haploinsufficiency-like phenotype.</p><p>Moreover, an increased synaptic turnover of the R12C mutant might also alter the localization and dynamics of some SHANK3 binding partners which can result in altered synaptic function. Interestingly, we observed that both mutants changed the recovery kinetics of cortactin, which is known to link dynamics of the PSD to rearrangements of the F-actin cytoskeleton via interaction with SHANK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacGillavry et al., 2016</xref>). Cortactin can stabilize F-actin and promote the formation of branched actin filaments, thereby directly influencing plasticity and stability of dendritic spines. Temporal dynamics and the cortactin concentration at the synapse are highly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mikhaylova et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, SHANK3-induced deviations in cortactin turnover are likely to have consequences for dendritic spine organization and functions.</p><p>Furthermore, we found an increase in the number of dendritic SHANK3 clusters for the L68P mutation. About a half of these clusters represent synapses as they were opposed by a presynaptic terminal. Notably, only approximately one third of SHANK3-positive dendritic shaft clusters co-localize with homer independent of the tested SHANK3 variant, while this co-localization is close to 100% in dendritic spines. However, we observed no differences in mutant SHANK3-homer1 interactions nor detected any SHANK3 mutation-induced changes in the mobile fraction of homer1 in FRAP experiments. This suggests that other factors might contribute to the differential recruitment of homer1 to shaft and spine synapses.</p><p>In this scenario, structurally perturbed or destabilized proteins which are not removed by cellular protein quality control mechanisms will be incorporated into the PSD and result in changes of synaptic proteostasis, protein-protein interactions and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reim et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies indicated that both gain- and loss-of-function with respect to interaction partners are likely to contribute to the pathogenicity of SHANK3 missense mutations. The L68P mutation for instance has been demonstrated to result in increased binding to ARR domain ligands such as sharpin or α-fodrin, whereas both the R12C and L68P mutation reduce binding to SPN domain ligands including the Ras superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lilja et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mameza et al., 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, the majority of <italic>SHANK3</italic>-associated mouse models used for the study of ASD are based on a full or partial knockout that will not resemble the structure-function relationships of the disease-causing mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, a corresponding R12C or L68P mutant knock-in mouse line would be of great value to study such scenarios of ASD-associated pathogenic mechanisms in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Guinea pig polyclonal Shank3</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>162304</td><td>for ICC <break/>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal Homer-1,2,3</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>160103</td><td>for ICC <break/>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Chicken polyclonal Bassoon</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>141016</td><td>for ICC <break/>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal MAP2-AF488</td><td>Merck Millipore</td><td>MAB3418X</td><td>for ICC <break/>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal GFP</td><td>Covance</td><td>MMS-118P-500</td><td>for Western Blot (1:3000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rat monoclonal RFP</td><td>Chromotek</td><td>5F8</td><td>for Western Blot (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-chicken IgY (H + L)-Cy3</td><td>Dianova</td><td>303-165-003</td><td>for ICC <break/>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)-AF568</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>A-11036</td><td>for ICC <break/>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal anti-guinea pig IgG-STAR 635P</td><td>Abberior</td><td>ST635P-1006</td><td>for ICC <break/>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal anti-rat IgG <break/>(H + L)-HRP</td><td>Jackson ImmunoResearch</td><td>112-035-062;

Following three washing steps with PBS (pH 7.4), fixed cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed again three times with PBS, and incubated with blocking solution (10% horse serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hr at RT. Blocked cells were finally washed three times with PSB (pH 7.8).</p><p>For click-labeling of the AHA-modified protein pool by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne [3 + 2] cycloaddition (CuAAC), a reaction mix containing 200 µM Tris-[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-methyl]-amine (TBTA), 500 µM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), 2 µM fluorescent alkyne tag (TAMRA-PEG4-alkyne), and 200 µM CuSO<sub>4</sub> was prepared in PBS (pH 7.8). After each addition of a reagent, the reaction mix was vortexed for several seconds. Stock solutions for each reagent except TBTA were prepared in sterile water, TBTA was dissolved in DMSO. Hippocampal primary neurons were incubated with the reaction mix in a dark, humidified box overnight at RT with gentle agitation. Cells were subsequently washed three times with FUNCAT wash buffer (0.5 mM EDTA, 1% Tween-20 in PBS, pH 7.8) followed by two additional washes with PBS (pH 7.4).</p><p>Following click-labeling, neurons were immunostained for homer as described above to allow detection of labeled and unlabeled excitatory spines. Finally, labeled and immunostained cells were mounted on microscopy slides with Mowiol and imaged with spinning-disk confocal microscopy as described above. Analysis of synaptic TAMRA intensities was done in ImageJ and data were plotted and analyzed in Origin 2019b.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Friederike Schröder for help with FUNCAT experiments, Dr. Rajeev Raman for help with fluorescence spectroscopy measurements, Dr. Maria Garcia Alai and Dr. Rob Meijers for the access to SPC facility EMBL Hamburg and for very helpful advice regarding experimental design and instruments operation.

dysfunctions, for example arising from missense mutations, is associated with neurological disorders. As often the case, the molecular principles underlying the exact role of such mutations on the structure and function of proteins, remains to be resolved experimentally. Missense mutations could impact on protein folding or stability and thus its availability, on protein structure or its dynamics, and on protein interactions, but their effects could be very subtle. The authors use an extensive set of biochemical, biophysical and cellular tools to show that two autism associated missense mutations in SHANK3 affect the structure, dynamics and its availability at the synapse in different ways and on different structural levels. These alterations modify protein folding, alter synaptic targeting and changes protein turnover at synaptic sites. This paper increases our knowledge about the relation between the molecular functional alteration in mutated SHANK3 and the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder associated with these mutations.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Autism associated SHANK3 missense point mutations impact conformational fluctuations and protein turnover at synapses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors declare that only about 70% of glutamatergic spines will be affected by the two SHANK3 missense mutations. However, this is based on the staining of endogenous Shank3 and thus is depending on the efficiency of the antibodies used that might either recognize only some Shank3 splice variants or are not sufficiently strong to recognize spines containing an amount of Shank3 lower than the antibodies threshold sensitivity. Secondly, it's unclear whether these data have a real relevance related to the general neuronal function altered in ASD, 70% of glutamatergic spines are the majority of the spines. Thus it will be important to provide stronger evidence that Shank3 is absent in some spines or to eliminate the sentence that only 70% of glutamatergic spines will be affected by the two SHANK3 missense mutations.</p><p>2. Data presented in Figure 5 suggest that the mutations lead to an increased fraction of dendritic shaft SHANK3 clusters. However, it's not clear if these are or are not synaptic clusters. How much of these clusters colocalize with presynaptic markers? Do these dendritic SHANK3 clusters colocalize with Homer?</p><p>3. The following sentence: &quot;…this study, we bridge structural data with the corresponding synaptic phenotype&quot; is not fully correct. Indeed there is no data that molecularly links the structural data with all the synaptic altered phenotype. For example non of the structural data can explain the altered turnover of mutated Shank3. Thus it will be more correct to state that the described structural data potentially correlate with the altered synaptic phenotype but they can be totally independent. Alternatively, the authors should provide more data that demonstrate the direct links between the two types of observed sets of data. But this might not be the scope of the work.</p><p>4. The data that shows the increased synaptic turnover of the R12C mutant is interesting, but t will be more interesting if the authors demonstrate that Shank3 binding partners turnover is also alerted. It is possible for example to study the turnover of synaptic WT Shank or Homer in the presence of the R12C mutant?</p><p>5. Increased synaptic turnover of the R12C mutant might or might not depend on the altered interaction of the mutant with Shank3 principal protein partners like GKAP or Homer. Thus, with a set of immunoprecipitation experiments, it might be possible to study if the mutants interact with less affinity with GKAP or Homer.</p><p>6. Possibly the SPN-ARR interface is destabilized by the L68P mutation and the interface between these two domains is disrupted due to the L68P mutation, resulting in the increased flexibility as seen in the SAXS data. This should be tested in the CORAL modelling by treating the SPN and ARR domains as two separate rigid bodies, connected by flexible linker.</p><p>7. The flexibility in the proteins, as observed in the SAXS data, should caution the authors in interpreting their static CORAL models as is now discussed (e.g. lines 126-130 and lines 317-324). Perhaps the authors can focus their interpretation more on the additional flexibility for the L68P mutant observed in the SAXS data, which is striking and solid data, and less on the static CORAL models?</p><p>8.

For example, comparing the lowest concentration data for all variants, the Dmax is largest for the wt protein, while for the extrapolated data the wt protein has the shortest Dmax. In addition, the Dmax for the extrapolated data is larger than the Dmax for the lowest concentration data. If the extrapolated data represents a fraction of dimers, how does this influence the CORAL modelling?</p><p>9. The outcome of the molecular dynamics simulation may be different if the start structure is adjusted, i.e. if the simulation is done with a start model that has the two domains separated. This should be tested to confirm that the SPN-ARR interaction is not affected by the mutations.</p><p>10. The experimental study of disease related missense mutations on protein structure and stability is not new. See for examples doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M210019200 and 10.1371/journal.pone.0186110. Also, in SHANK3 another disease related missense mutation (R536W) has been investigated structurally doi.org/10.1111/jnc.14322. I would like to suggest that lines 299 and 300 are changed or removed to reflect this better. In addition, the &quot;In a proof-of-principle study&quot; in the abstract may be misleading taking this previous work into account.</p><p>11.

As often the case, the molecular principles underlying the exact role of such mutations on the structure and function of proteins, remains to be resolved experimentally. Missense mutations could impact on protein folding or stability and thus its availability, on protein structure or its dynamics, and on protein interactions, but their effects could be very subtle. The authors use an extensive set of biochemical, biophysical and cellular tools to show that two missense mutations in SHANK3 affect the structure, dynamics and its availability at the synapse in different ways and on different structural levels.</p><p>The effect of the two mutants, R12C and L68P is investigated at different structural levels. SHANK3 is a multidomain protein in which several domains are connected by flexible linkers. This makes detailed structural studies on this protein challenging. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is very suited to obtain low-resolution structural data on such flexible proteins. The authors show that the L68P SHANK3 mutant, in the context of a construct consisting of residues 1-676 fused N-terminally to a SUMO domain, has more intrinsic flexibility, whereas the R12C mutant does not seem to be affected in its flexibility compared to wt SHANK3. By modelling, using previously reported high-resolution structural data for the individual domains SUMO, SH3 and PDZ and the combination SPN-ARR as one unit, and assuming flexible linkers between these rigid bodies, the additional flexibility in the L68P variant is attributed to the decoupling of the SH3 and PDZ domains from the ARR domain. This is surprising, as the mutation, L68P, is located in the SPN domain, near to the ARR domain but far away from the SH3 and PDZ domains in all the CORAL models. Possibly the SPN-ARR interface is destabilized by the L68P mutation and the interface between these two domains is disrupted due to the L68P mutation, resulting in the increased flexibility. While such an interpretation could perhaps also explain the data, this is not considered. In addition, the flexibility in the proteins, as observed in the SAXS data, should caution the interpretation of the static CORAL models. The increased flexibility of the L68P mutant is however striking and clear-cut from the data.</p><p>The molecular dynamics simulations using the SPN-ARR combination as a template do not reveal destabilization of this interface by the L68P mutation. However, this may be because the start model in the simulation already assumes that both domains are interacting. The outcome of the molecular dynamics simulation could be different if the start structure is adjusted, i.e. if the simulation is done with a start model that has the two domains separated. Such analysis may also help in supporting the modelling of the SAXS data.</p><p>The influence of the mutations on the thermal, chemical and proteolytic stability of the proteins is thoroughly probed by tryptophan and ANS fluorescence spectroscopy to reveal tertiary level changes, by circular dichroism to visualize secondary level changes and by limited proteolysis to reveal accessibility changes of proteolytic sites. The tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy (nDSF) shows that the L68P mutant has reduced tertiary structure stability. It is however not straightforward to interpret the data due to multiple transition events and precipitation of unfolded proteins. The authors use urea and classification of the data in three temperature transition zones to tease out some information. But is not clear how reproducible this data is. The overall conclusion that the L68P mutant has reduced tertiary structural stability, and that the R12C mutant is not affected on this level is however supported by the data and is also verified by subsequent extrinsic fluorescence emission spectroscopy. Monitoring thermal unfolding at the secondary structure paints a different picture compared to the tertiary structures and indicates that the R12C mutant is more stable compared to the L68P and wt SHANK3. Also limited proteolysis indicates the R12C mutant is a bit more stable.</p><p>While the mutations do not seem to affect protein production, i.e. equal quantities are produced compared to wt when overexpressed in hippocampal neurons, the availability of the SHANK3 variants may differ. One of the two mutants, R12C, has an increased recovery in spines associated with a reduced residing time and, thus possibly, less synaptic SHANK3. The availability of the other mutant L68P, may be decreased as it seems to cluster more in dendrites, compared to wt protein. These are interesting findings and this altered availability may explain their association with autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>Both the cellular readouts, i.e. increased diffusion of R12C and increased clustering of L68P, may be the result of altered protein interactions. However, this is not looked at further experimentally in this work but has been previously reported and is clearly described in the introduction and discussion of this manuscript. In addition, it is not clear if the cellular findings reported here are related to the differential stabilities of the proteins, i.e. L68P SHANK3 less stable and R12C SHANK3 more stable, nor to the increased flexibility of L68P SHANK3. A more thorough discussion of the cellular readout reported here and by others in the light of the results on the flexibility and stability of the mutants would strengthen the discussion of the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66165.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Indeed, considering the large number of Shank3 isoforms it is possible that the antibody does not recognize all of them. Therefore, the number might be higher than 70%. We rephrased the sentence stating that only 70% of glutamatergic spines will be affected by the two SHANK3 missense mutations and instead suggest now that it is the majority of spines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

To address this issue, we therefore performed additional experiments in rat hippocampal neurons, transfected with GFP-SHANK3<sup>FL</sup> (WT, R12C and L68P), fixed and stained for endogenous homer or bassoon as post- and presynaptic markers. We used MAP2 as a mask for the dendritic shaft and quantified the colocalization of dendritic SHANK3-clusters with homer and bassoon. Interestingly, we could see again that the L68P variant forms more clusters in the dendrite but without a difference in the fraction of synaptic clusters between genotypes. Thus, approximately 50% of clusters of both mutants and the WT were in apposition with a presynaptic terminal but only one third contained homer1, which is remarkably different as compared to spine synapses (almost 100%). However, since the L68P variant forms a higher absolute number of dendritic SHANK3clusters, an increased number of shaft synapses are present in each neuron. These data are included in Figure 5F-I (main manuscript). In the discussion we address that this analysis indirectly suggests that the composition of SHANK3-positive synapses might be different in shaft as compared to spine synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We found that the overall recovery and kinetics of homer1 was not changed upon overexpression of both mutants. However, mutations impacted the kinetics and overall synaptic turnover of cortactin, another binding partner of SHANK3 and a prominent synaptic actin-binding protein. This is a very interesting finding because it links ASD-associated SHANK3 mutations potentially to spinous actin dynamics (Macgillavry et al., 2016; Mikhaylova et al., 2018). The new data are included in Figure 7B, C, E and F (main manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments for SHANK3 mutants and major interaction partners, namely GKAP (SAPAP1), homer1 and cortactin and found no apparent differences in binding efficiency.

In this analysis we observed that the SPN-domain is decoupled from the ARR-domain in both mutants, suggesting a disruption of the domain interface (Figure 1F, main manuscript). However, we additionally performed a dedicated ensemble optimization method (EOM) to characterize protein flexibility numerically (see Author response image 1). Here we found no statistically significant differences between mutants and the WT.

We are aware that a Kratky plot provides qualitative information on protein folding and flexibility.

We think, however, in this case folding and flexibility should be interpreted separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 1C-F and Suppl. Figure 3B.

To address this question, we performed OLIGOMER-analysis of SAXS data spanning the entire measured concentration range including zero-extrapolated SAXS profiles to estimate the concentration-dependency of the monomeric SHANK3 volume fraction. We found that zero-extrapolated data indeed represents almost exclusively monomeric protein (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C). Therefore, dimers will not influence the CORAL modelling. Additionally, we repeated GNOM analysis of SAXS profiles measured at indicated concentrations to resolve the discrepancy between zeroextrapolated data and lowest measured concentrations.

Separating both domains would be an interesting way to study particular properties of the SPN-ARR interface. However, the biological significance of such a study would be very limited since the SPN- And ARR-domain are connected to each other by a linker region in nature.

However, we observed an increase of mutant RMSD values compared to the WT (Author response image 2). This effect was more pronounced for the L68P mutant, which showed a steep RMSD increase after ~100ns, potentially reflecting a mutation-induced perturbation of the SPN-ARR domain interface. The R12C mutant also exhibited increased RMSD values but showed a continuous near-linear RMSD increase rather than a spontaneous steep jump. Notably, R12C mutant RMSDs are higher than the WT only after ~500ns and are observed to be even lower than the WT before. Consistent with previous MD simulations, the SPN-domain alone showed identical RMSD patterns as the whole protein with slightly higher absolute values, confirming the SPN-domain as local hotspot of conformational dynamics (Author response image 2). We also found that both mutations were able to increase conformational dynamics also within the decoupled ARRdomain (Author response image 2). Since this increase in ARR-domain dynamics is absent for the WT, it could be that the mutation-carrying SPN-domain influences peptide backbone dynamics of the ARR-domain via non-covalent contacts.</p><p>However, we think these results are hard to interpret and should be taken with caution as they are derived from an artificially split system causing potentially non-native behavior and interactions which might not occur in the intact protein. Therefore, we suggest to exclude these results from the main manuscript to prevent confusion of readers. Apart from that, we already demonstrated by CORAL modelling of zero-extrapolated SAXS data that both ASD-associated mutations indeed disrupt the SPN-ARR interface (Figure 1C, main manuscript, see also Essential Revisions #6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The experimental study of disease related missense mutations on protein structure and stability is not new. See for examples doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M210019200 and 10.1371/journal.pone.0186110. Also, in SHANK3 another disease related missense mutation (R536W) has been investigated structurally doi.org/10.1111/jnc.14322. I would like to suggest that lines 299 and 300 are changed or removed to reflect this better. In addition, the &quot;In a proof-of-principle study&quot; in the abstract may be misleading taking this previous work into account.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this misunderstanding. Of course our claim of novelty was not to show that missense mutations affect protein structure and stability. With proof-of-principal study we meant to link structural effects of disease-associated missense mutations in synaptic proteins with protein properties in their native cellular environment. Our study illustrates the value of deep structural analysis of select missense mutations at the level of molecular dynamics. Albeit both mutations investigated here, were located within the same domain, they had distinct effects on SHANK3 folding in vitro and kinetics at the synapse, suggesting that each new mutation needs to be studied individually and data cannot be directly extrapolated or generalized. We replaced the sentence “However, to our knowledge, distinguishable structural perturbations of disease-relevant protein missense variants have not yet been shown experimentally” (lines 299 and 300) with “However, to our knowledge, studies correlating distinguishable structural perturbations of disease-relevant protein missense variants with an altered cellular phenotype are very limited (Post et al., <italic>Nature Comm.,</italic> 2020)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. It would strengthen the discussion if the authors could discuss the cellular readout reported here and by others more in the light of their results on the flexibility and stability of the mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of our new FRAP and co-IP results, we have re-written part of the discussion and included our interpretations on possible cellular outcomes of changed SHANK3 structure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
