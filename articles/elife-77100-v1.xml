IBS results in various symptoms that strongly affect the patients’ quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dean et al., 2005</xref>) and a significant socioeconomic burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peery et al., 2012</xref>). Abdominal pain is a prevalent IBS symptom, associated with changes in bowel habits (diarrhoea and/or constipation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Camilleri et al., 2012</xref>). Even though IBS pathophysiology remains not completely understood, IBS symptoms may originate from peripheral and/or central mechanisms resulting in a dysfunctional gut-brain axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fichna and Storr, 2012</xref>). Anxiety and stressful psychological life events lead to central nervous system (CNS) disorder triggering in turn gut motility dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mönnikes et al., 2001</xref>) and strengthen visceral sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greenwood-Van Meerveld et al., 2016</xref>). For a better understanding of the IBS pathophysiology, stress animal models have been developed mimicking IBS features, such as changes in visceral sensitivity and gut transit time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gué et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Related to the complex pathophysiology of IBS and the diversity of IBS patients’ profiles, the existing therapeutic strategies promote solutions usually limited to treat symptoms (motor/sensory disturbances). In addition, in several cases with psychological comorbidity, psychopharmacological drugs are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dekel et al., 2013</xref>). As an effective treatment, alternative probiotics were used to modulate visceral pain in IBS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moayyedi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hungin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Didari et al., 2015</xref>). However, no consensus results were obtained from human clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazurak et al., 2015</xref>) and mechanisms by which microbes signal from the gut lumen to the CNS, thus influencing pain perception, remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In recent years, mounting evidence has suggested that microbially produced neuroactive molecules can modulate the gut-brain axis communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cryan and O’Mahony, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lyte, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reid, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cryan and Dinan, 2012</xref>). For example, ingestion of a <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strain, i.e., <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> (<italic>JB-1</italic>) is able to regulate emotional behaviour and central γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system in mouse via vagus nerve pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bravo et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, GABA-modulating bacteria of the human gut microbiota have been associated to brain signatures related to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strandwitz et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, GABA is the main inhibitory CNS neurotransmitter in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wong et al., 2003</xref>), and several important physiological functions have been characterized, such as neurotransmission, relaxing, and tranquilizer effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayakawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Cao, 2010</xref>). GABA exerts these major functional effects <italic>via</italic> two GABA receptor subtypes, i.e., GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hyland and Cryan, 2010</xref>) doing these receptors important pharmacological targets for clinically relevant anti-anxiety agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foster and Kemp, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the human diet, glutamate constitutes up to 8–10% of amino acids; it is involved in gut protein metabolism and is the precursor of different important molecules produced within the intestinal mucosa, like GABA. GABA is synthetized by a pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD; EC 4.1.1.15) by irreversible α-decarboxylation of L-glutamate and consumption of one cytoplasmic proton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ueno, 2000</xref>). Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are able to synthesize GABA, through the decarboxylation of glutamate and genes encoding GAD are present in the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mazzoli and Pessione, 2016</xref>). Glutamate import and GABA export generally occur in bacteria simultaneously via a specific glutamate/γ-amino butyrate antiporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). The glutamate-dependent system is associated with acid resistance in many bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feehily and Karatzas, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Due to this large repertoire of beneficial effects, GABA has been classified as a health-promoting bioactive component in foods and pharmaceuticals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Cao, 2010</xref>). Among bacteria, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally recognized as safe sources to produce GABA at high levels and in an eco-friendly way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhakal et al., 2012</xref>). Numerous studies revealed that food-derived <italic>lactobacilli</italic> and gut-derived <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species are able to produce GABA <italic>in vitro (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Cao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yunes et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linares et al., 2016</xref> reported the use of a novel <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> strain for the production of a naturally GABA-enriched yogurt. However, the link between bacterial GABA production <italic>in vitro</italic> and neuromodulatory activity <italic>in vivo</italic> remains poorly investigated. To date, only the human gut commensal GABA-producing <italic>Bifidobacterium dentium</italic> was shown <italic>in vivo</italic> to modulate sensory neuron activity in a rat faecal retention model of visceral hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pokusaeva et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we focused on the transient food-borne LAB <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>. Frequently encountered in dairy products, <italic>L. lactis</italic> is one of the most ingested bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mills et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laroute et al., 2017</xref>). Although not considered as a commensal bacterium, <italic>L. lactis</italic> was found to persist transiently in the gut, depending on the strain under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Radziwill-Bienkowska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). It was also demonstrated that <italic>L. lactis</italic> may exert <italic>in vivo</italic> a potent anti-inflammatory activity attenuating colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishitani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luerce et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berlec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nomura et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>L. lactis</italic> is also able to produce GABA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nomura et al., 1999</xref>) and the well-characterized NCDO2118 strain besides its probiotic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordeiro et al., 2021</xref>), is considered as an efficient GABA producer among the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oliveira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mazzoli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laroute et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laroute et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we determined whether <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 is able to deliver GABA <italic>in vivo</italic> via glutamate decarboxylation (GAD activity) and to exert GABAergic signalling-dependent antinociceptive properties in a stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity rat model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High in vitro GABA production by <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 is related to its GAD activity</title><p>The NCDO2118 strain previously demonstrated to produce GABA in chemically defined medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laroute et al., 2016</xref>), was grown in batch bioreactor with complex medium allowing high production of biomass and GABA (see Experimental section). The biomass and GABA concentrations were measured all along the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

Indeed, the low GABA producer NCDO2727 strain and NCDO2118 <italic>ΔgadB</italic> mutant strain unable to produce GABA, fail to exert such antinociceptive effect. This effect is mediated by the metabolically active NCDO2118 which delivers GABA in the gastro-intestinal tract, that in turn influences host GABAergic host physiological system.</p><p><italic>L. lactis</italic> is a very common bacterium widely used in food industry with a GRAS status. Bacteria can metabolize, via decarboxylation mechanisms, several amino acids to synthetize active amino compounds. In particular, GAD catalyses the irreversible <italic>α</italic>-decarboxylation of glutamate into GABA. Even though genes encoding GAD are found in numerous bacteria present in different environments and ecosystems, i.e., native soil, natural landscape as well as in the gastro-intestinal tract, the ability of these bacteria to produce GABA has not systematically been evidenced. Interestingly, among <italic>L. lactis</italic> bacteria studied here, NCDO2727 was qualified as a low producer of GABA and NCDO2118 as a high producer. Although these two strains harbour similar GAD encoding <italic>gadB</italic> gene<italic>,</italic> they differed significantly at the level of their GAD activity. Because the promoters of <italic>gad</italic> genes are nearly identical in the two strains, transcriptional regulations should not explain the observed differences. The growth defect of NCDO2727 should also not be involved since higher growth of the strain in another culture medium did not restore a high GABA production. Herein, we demonstrate <italic>in vivo</italic> that only a 10-day chronic oral administration of the high producer NCDO2118 strain displaying a high GAD activity is able to reduce visceral hypersensitivity induced by stress. This effect was accompanied by an increased GABA production in the gastric compartment. Taken together, all these observations suggest that transient NCDO2118 strain is metabolically active <italic>in vivo</italic> to deliver GABA in the gastro-intestinal tract lumen. We evaluated the impact of the NCDO2118 treatment on the faecal microbiota and observed no changes in α or β diversity. This result is consistent with observations in many other studies on IBS that have shown that probiotic treatment did not shift the overall diversity of the intestinal microbiota of mice, rats, or humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cussotto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grazul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeffery et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Labus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tap et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, in ‘healthy microbiota’ the addition of a probiotic does not promptly impact the resident microbial populations but rather could have a significant impact on reshaping the microbiota in an already existing dysbiosis humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alander et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eloe-Fadrosh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). We next compared genera abundancies after treatment using non-parametric tests and found an enrichment of the <italic>Clostridium</italic> genus after <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 treatment compared to the vehicle group. This genus was shown in silico as modulating GABA (i.e. GABA producer and consumer) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strandwitz et al., 2019</xref>). An enrichment of the <italic>Escherichia</italic> genus was also observed. Interestingly, in the study on the <italic>E. coli</italic> Nissle 1917 strain, Pérez-Berezo and colleagues showed that GABA was not able to directly cross the epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pérez-Berezo et al., 2017</xref>), requiring the C12AsnGABAOH lipopeptide for functionalization and subsequent translocation. It is then possible that the enrichment of the genus <italic>Escherichia</italic> in the faecal microbiota of <italic>L. lactis-</italic>treated animals could help reduce visceral pain via a lipopeptide-mediated GABA functionalization pathway. Of note, in our study, using the same method as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pérez-Berezo et al., 2017</xref>), we were not able to detect any C12AsnGABAOH lipopeptide in <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 (results not shown). Other yet unidentified lipopeptides could be at play, with the possible contribution of other bacteria capable of producing such functional GABA. Altogether, further investigations are needed for a better understanding of the site(s) of interaction between luminal GABA delivery by <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 and the gastro-intestinal barrier and its environment.</p><p>GABA is the major inhibitory neuromediator, mainly involved in regulating physiological and psychological responses. Today, indirect evidences point out the effect of gut microbiota as well as probiotic strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cryan and Dinan, 2012</xref>) on CNS by modulating the GABAergic system. Moreover, alterations of this GABAergic system have a key role in the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schür et al., 2016</xref>). Converging evidence, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, illustrates the important role of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in anxiety disorders. Using a specific antagonist (SCH-50911), we demonstrated the involvement of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor in the visceral antinociceptive effect mediated by the delivery of GABA produced by the NCDO2118 strain. GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are strongly expressed in the gastro-intestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hyland and Cryan, 2010</xref>) and widely distributed from the stomach to the ileum in the enteric nervous system (ENS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auteri et al., 2015</xref>). In rodents, previous studies established the presence of autocrine and paracrine GABA signalling mechanisms in gastro-intestinal epithelial cells via GABA receptor activation. In rat, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors have also been identified on the mucosal gland cells of the stomach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erdo and Bowery, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erdö et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krantis et al., 1994</xref>). Actually, the GABA<sub>B</sub> metabotropic receptors in the gastro-intestinal tract are known to regulate several gut functions and gut-to-brain signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hyland and Cryan, 2010</xref>). In mice, selective stimulation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors increases gastric acid secretion both through vagal cholinergic and gastrin-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Piqueras and Martinez, 2004</xref>). These combined central and peripheral mechanisms result in an increase in the luminal acidity, which provides a supportive environment for the GAD activity of <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118. Accordingly, and despite a limited number of animals, we observed herein a significant level of GABA production measured after 10-day administration of <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 in the stomach, which was supported by an <italic>in vitro</italic> GABA production in gastric juice sampled from naive rats and supplemented with glutamate; in this way, a dynamic ‘virtuous circle’ would be generated between <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 and the host. Furthermore, vagal and splanchnic afferents of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are involved in the modulation of sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hyland and Cryan, 2010</xref>). Probiotic strains have been described to modulate brain functions via a dependent vagus activation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bravo et al., 2011</xref>). This study was the first to demonstrate the ability of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> to modify central levels of GABA through the stimulation of the vagus nerve. This central GABA release goes hand with beneficial effect on emotional behaviour impairments induced by stress. However, the primary molecular mechanisms underlying how <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> stimulated vagal afferents were not resolved. Here, we could firmly demonstrate that a neurotransmitter, i.e., GABA, directly produced by <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 into the gastro-intestinal tract lumen, exerted beneficial effect on stress-induced gut visceral hypersensitivity via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor stimulation. Even though we do not investigate the activation of the ENS or the CNS herein, our results associated with previous published data bring strengths on the table in the functional communication between bacteria, gut, and brain.</p><p>In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that, according to its ability to deliver into the gastro-intestinal tract lumen neurometabolites like GABA in significant levels, <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 could be considered as a helpful candidate in the management of functional gastro-intestinal disorders associated with stressful situations. Regarding our results, GAD activity rather than genetic organization of <italic>gad</italic> genes appears as a key determinant for in vivo antinociceptive properties of <italic>L. lactis</italic>. Therefore, this work opens perspectives for GRAS <italic>L. lactis</italic> strains as future therapeutic agents for the management of visceral pain and the anxious profile of IBS patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, medium, and culture conditions</title><p>The strains NCDO2118 and NCDO2727, two <italic>L. lactis</italic> subsp. <italic>lactis</italic> from vegetable origin, were used throughout this study. <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 Δ<italic>gadB</italic> mutant was constructed by double crossing over in the chromosome as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maguin et al., 1996</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Overall there was appreciation for your study of the neuromodulatory effects of Lactococcus lactis. However, both reviewers thought additional experiments were required to raise the manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> standards. A significantly revised manuscript that addresses the reviewers comments below and further dissects the mechanisms by which L. lactis affects the neuronal functions could be of interest to a broad audience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is original, well discussed and it touches a topic poorly explored so far which is the neuromodulatory effects of L.lactis and other lactic acid bacteria <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, as it stands, the work will need additional results to be suitable for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> (considering the journal standards). There are already reports on the neuronal effects of GABA secreted by acid lactic bacteria (such as <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and Streptococci) and Bifidobacterium. The novelty of this present study would be to dissect the mechanisms by which luminal bacteria would affect neuronal functions in the GI tract.</p><p>1) The results of GABA measurements in the fecal content clearly show that feeding glutamate alone results in GABA increase in the feces. It is possible that lactic bacteria in the gut microbiota play a role in GABA production. L.lactis NCDO2118, but not L.lactis NCDO2727, may have an impact in gut microbiota composition changing the abundance of bacteria that help the conversion of glutamate into GABA. This distinctive effect of NCDO2118 strain may be related to its high intracellular GAD activity (as compared to NCDO2727) and the role of high amounts of GABA (produced by this strain) in the expansion of other GABA-producing strains in microbiota. This would be compatible with the result obtained with the deficient-GABAB mutant strain of L.lactis NCDO2118. The role of microbiota in the effects reported by the manuscript needs to be investigated.</p><p>2) There is no data in the manuscript on the mechanisms by which GABA exerted its visceral anti-hypersensitivity effect during IBS model. Does bacteria-derived GABA access the enteric nervous system (ENS)? How GABA crosses the epithelial barrier? Is GABA binding to GABARB receptors in the neurons or the epithelia (neuroendocrine cells)? GABARB receptors have been identified in both myenteric and submucosal neurons. In the rat mucosal epithelium, positive cells for GABARB have been also detected by immunohistochemistry studies along the length of the GI tract (from the gastric mucosa to the colon), but it has been proposed that the effects of GABA in these receptors differ since neuroendocrine cells are also producers of somatotastin in the gastric epithelium, but GABAR+ positive cells in other parts of the GI tract (such as the duodenum) produced serotonin as well. The novelty of the study would be to shed some light on the mechanisms behind the antinociceptive effects of GABA secreted by luminal L. lactis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The aim of this manuscript is to demonstrate that a strain delivering GABA (L. lactis NCDO2118) in the gut is able exert to anti-nociceptive properties in a stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity rat model.

They particularly managed to established that the GAD activity from L. lactis and the subsequent GABAergic signaling is a key mechanism in the control of visceral hypersensitivity induced by a stress.

The authors should comment on this. Does such growth defect could induce a bias in the <italic>in vivo</italic> observed data using such bacteria culture? In addition, the authors should also give similar data about the NCDO2118ΔgadB strain, just to make sure that such deletion did not induce bacterial growth defect as the NCDO2727 strain.

They have first demonstrated that, among the L. lactis bacteria, only some of them are able to produce active GABA, even if the encoding genes are present in the genome. In addition, those GABA-producing bacteria are able to relieve stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity. Finally, this anti-hypersensitive effect is dependent on the bacteria-produced GABA since genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the GABA leads to a loss of its ability to relieve the stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity.</p><p>In general, the presented data are really convincing, and I would need some more controls, in particular in <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments:</p><p>1. The <italic>in vitro</italic> data presented in figure 1A nicely demonstrate the difference in the GABA production between 2 strains of L. lactis (NCDO2118 and NCDO2727). I just have a concern about the figure 1B since it seems the non GABA-producing bacteria (NCD02727) present a defect in its growth in comparison to the GABA-producing L. lactis (NCDO2118). May it be a reason why the NCDO2727 did not produce GABA (different growth stage in the bacteria culture) and consequently it loses its <italic>in vivo</italic> properties on visceral hypersensitivity?</p><p>2. The <italic>in vivo</italic> results are beautiful and really convincing to me (Figures 2 and 3). I just have the feeling some controls are missing to reinforce the results. On figure 2, I would like to see the effect of the NCDO2118 strain + glutamate in control animals to make sure it will not reduce the basal visceral hypersensitivity? On the figure 3, what happened in PRS + Vehicle + inhibitor, to make sure that the inhibitor does not affect sensitivity by itself?</p><p>Finally, I feel that the weakness of the study is in the last figures 4 and 5, since, in my point of view, it did not present as strong data as on the figures 1-3. On the Figure 4, I would appreciate if the authors could increase the n per group since we ca not really see significant differences for the GABA concentration along the GI tract, and it should be more detailed in the discussion. On the figure 5 about microbiota analysis, the authors discussed some differences that are not &quot;significant&quot; as for Escherichia genus since others are not discussed (despite the significance).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Lactococcus lactis is a probiotic bacteria that has shown to have multiple beneficial effects on the gut, including anti-inflammatory effects in models of inflammatory bowel diseases. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by visceral pain. It would be important to define ways to treat IBS and other gut-related disease using gut microbes. The authors have previously found that the L. lactis strain NCDO02118 could synthesize GABA, depending on culture conditions (Laroute et al., Microorganisms 2021; Laroute et al., Front. Microbiol 2016), but the effects <italic>in vivo</italic> in animal models of visceral pain had not been well studied. This study tested two strains of Lactococcus lactis for their ability to produce GABA, and if oral gavage of the strains could modulate visceral hypersensitivity in rats. The authors showed that the strain NCDO02118 could produce GABA <italic>in vitro</italic> and reduce visceral hypersensitivity (measured by colorectal distension) induce by restraint stress. The other strain NCDO02727 did not produce GABA <italic>in vitro</italic> and had no effect on visceral hypersensitivity. The antinociceptive effect from NCDO02118 depended on expression of GadB. Furthermore, the blockade of visceral hypersensitivity could be blocked with a GABAB receptor antagonist, indicating that this receptor mediated pain blockade. GABA levels were also measured in different segments of the gut following oral administration. NCDO02118 administration did not have major impacts on fecal microbiome composition. This study provides evidence that a probiotic delivered into GI tract can alleviate visceral pain and that this could be related to production of GABA.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study is one of the first to show that deficiency in glutamate dehydroxylase (GAD) component (GadB) in a bacterial strain regulates GABA production and that this has a physiological effect on visceral pain phenotypes in rats. The result that the NCDO02118 strain has antinociceptive properties that are dependent on the GABAB receptors are interesting and has therapeutic implications for IBS and other diseases.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors suggest that the NCDO02118 strain produces GABA <italic>in vivo</italic>, however, the data from this experiment was not significantly different when GABA levels were measured. The host mechanisms involved blockade of pain <italic>in vivo</italic> are also unclear. For example, the cell types that express GABA receptors can be better characterized and whether GABA signals in specific ways to block the perception of pain. This study could also be strengthened by characterizing why only 2118 but not 2727 or other natural L. lactis strains that can produce GABA, although both of them carry genes that are responsible for GABA metabolism.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. The authors state the NCDO2118 strain increased GABA <italic>in vivo</italic>, however the data in Figure 4 shows a significant decrease of GABA in the cecum and no significant differences along the rest of the GI tract in NCD02118+glutamate vs. vehicle groups (Figure 4A-C). The authors also state that the NDCO2118 strain has a higher concentration of GABA in the stomach in Figure 4C, but this is not a significant difference either. How does this lack of differences correlate with visceral pain blockade? Is it due to poor colonization of NCDO02118 after gavage or improper microenvironment?</p><p>2. The authors observed higher GABA in the stomach compared with cecum (Figure 4A). However, the colorectal distension assay was performed in the colon and rectum. How does local GABA upregulation in stomach contribute to the alleviation of visceral pain in the colon? Are circulating GABA levels changed?</p><p>3. The authors show that GABAB receptor antagonist blocks the beneficial effect of the NCDO02118 strain on visceral hypersensitivity, but the authors do not try to identify which cell types are involved in this mechanism. Enteric, vagal, and spinal neurons that innervate the gut all have GABA receptors and identifying which subtype is involved would strengthen the study.</p><p>4. The authors show an interesting phenotype that the NCDO02727 strain does not produce GABA even though it has the proper machinery. This study does not explore why this strain is not able to make GABA. Can the authors reveal some mechanistic insight into the differences between NCDO02727 vs. NCDO2118?</p><p>5. Do gut anti-inflammatory properties of NCDO02118 contribute to their antinociceptive effect in response to PRS? NCDO02118 admininstration induces the upregulation of IL-10 (DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2021.623920), which can block pain. Is IL-10 also induced in these mice?</p><p>6. The authors suggest that L. lactis may be a treatment option for visceral pain and anxiety associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the study does not test whether L. lactis has any effect on anxiety behavior. Can the authors test anxiety behaviors?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77100.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We found that the rate of GABA production by the NCDO2727 strain was similar to the vehicle but the rate of GABA production by the NCDO2118 strain was fourfold increased.

In the gastro-intestinal tract, GABA receptors are present on the vagal afferent fibers both at the mucosal endings that respond to touch and chemical stimuli and muscular endings that respond optimally to mechanical stretch or tension (Page <italic>et al.</italic> 2002). As discussed in our manuscript, GABAB receptors are also widely distributed from the stomach to the ileum in the enteric nervous system (ENS). In rodents, the presence of GABAB receptors has also been identified on the mucosal gland cells of the stomach. Taken together, all these data suggest complex mechanisms and pathways by which GABA delivered by NCDO2118 strain exerts visceral antinociceptive effect. Based on the literature and our own observations, at this step of our knowledge, we cannot emphasize a cell type more than another and additional investigations are needed to open this black box.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Determine why only 2118 but not 2727 other natural L. lactis strains can produce GABA.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown in the manuscript (results L153-L156 and Supplementary File 1) the very strong differences in the intracellular GAD activity in the two strains NCDO2118 and NCDO2727 explaining their major GABA production differences (and also their different antinociceptive properties).</p><p>In the manuscript, we have demonstrated by <italic>in silico</italic> analyses that these differences were not due to differences in the genetic organisation of <italic>gadCB</italic> operon and <italic>gadR</italic> gene nor to differences in GadB,C and R protein sequences (L140-L144).</p><p>To determine whether these differences in GABA production between strains might be associated to differences in the regulation of <italic>gadCB</italic> and <italic>gadR</italic> expression at the transcription level, we have now analysed the nucleotide sequences of their promoters. They were found to be almost identical and the very small number of mutations identified (2 single nucleotide polymorphisms for <italic>gadR</italic> and 1 for <italic>gadCB</italic>) seems unlikely to cause large differences in transcriptional regulation (this is described in more details in the comment 4 for the reviewer 2).</p><p>We believe that the differences between NCDO2218 and NCDO2727 strains are likely due to posttranscriptional regulations but we do not really know what are the mechanisms involved. Nothing in the literature can help us to formulate realistic hypothesis.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer 1, the growth defect of the NCDO2727 strain could participate to the lack of efficient GABA production. To check the relevance of this mechanism, we have investigated the growth and the GABA production in another culture medium enhancing the growth performances of the NCDO2727 strain. We demonstrated that the GABA production and the growth rate are not correlated (see below in the response to comments 1 and 2 of reviewer 1).</p><p>In order to study the <italic>gadCB</italic> regulation and thanks to reporter gene constructions, we are currently investigating the <italic>gadCB</italic> expression in various environments and in various strains.

The authors state the NCDO2118 strain increased GABA in vivo, however the data in Figure 4 shows a significant decrease of GABA in the cecum and no significant differences along the rest of the GI tract in NCD02118+glutamate vs. vehicle groups (Figure 4A-C). The authors also state that the NDCO2118 strain has a higher concentration of GABA in the stomach in Figure 4C, but this is not a significant difference either. How does this lack of differences correlate with visceral pain blockade? Is it due to poor colonization of NCDO02118 after gavage or improper microenvironment?</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above (see our response to comment 3 of reviewer 1), our objective was to determine in which GIT compartment GABA delivery specifically occurred for NCDO2118 strain (compared to vehicle and NCDO2727) and even though results did not reach significance, we can see in the stomach that the GABA production by <italic>L. lactis</italic> NCDO2118 is higher than that measured in vehicle or NCDO2727 strain.

Comments have been added in the Discussion section L353-L354. Concerning the detection of <italic>L. lactis</italic> in the GIT environment (from stomach to feces), a PCR-based approach would be insightful to overcome the poor suitability of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing method to low abundant bacterial populations. Interestingly, in the study of Duranti <italic>et al.</italic> in <italic>Scientific Reports</italic> in 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70986-z) on <italic>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</italic>, the authors showed that the fecal concentration of GABA in rats treated with two high GABA-producing strains, namely <italic>B. adolescentis</italic> PRL2019 and <italic>B. adolescentis</italic> HD17T2H, was not statistically different than that found in rats treated with a non-GABA producer strain B. adolescentis ATCC15703 or rats not supplemented by <italic>B. adolescentis</italic> strains (control group). Furthermore, in the study of Pokusaeva <italic>et al.</italic> in <italic>Neurogastroenterology and Motility</italic> in 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12904), demonstrating that GABA-producing <italic>Bifidobacterium dentium</italic> modulates visceral sensitivity in the intestine, the authors found that cecal GABA concentrations in the <italic>B. dentium</italic>-treated mice vs PBS-treated ones were within a similar range (10.1 ± 2.5 vs 10.3 ± 1.7 μg/g cecal content). This clearly indicates that it is not so straightforward to correlate cecal/fecal levels of GABA and <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors observed higher GABA in the stomach compared with cecum (Figure 4A). However, the colorectal distension assay was performed in the colon and rectum. How does local GABA upregulation in stomach contribute to the alleviation of visceral pain in the colon? Are circulating GABA levels changed?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for addressing these questions. Reflex among different organs along the gastrointestinal tract is well known. For example, ingestion of food into the stomach induces a response not only in the stomach but also in the small intestine and colon; distention of the rectum inhibits gastric and intestinal motility (Bampton <italic>et al.</italic> 2002; Kerlin <italic>et al.</italic> 1983; Shafik <italic>et al.</italic> 2000). Cross-talk along the gastrointestinal tract has also been observed. Gastric electrical stimulation inhibits rectal tone, an effect mediated by sympathetic pathway (Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2005).Vagal afferent fibers innervating the upper gastro-intestinal tract play a critical role in the initiation of symptoms and reflexes controlling several functions (Page and Blackshaw, 1999). Vagal afferents are comprised of mucosal endings that respond to touch and chemical stimuli and muscular endings that respond optimally to mechanical stretch or tension (Page <italic>et al.</italic> 2002). There is a clear distribution of GABA receptors and particularly of GABAB receptors along the peripheral afferent vagal fibers. In our study, even though we have to more deeply elucidate in a follow-up study the functionalization pathway of GABA released by <italic>L. lactis</italic> into the stomach, we can hypothesize a primary mucosal activation of such receptors with central vagal pathways in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and dorsal vagal nucleus activations. In response to this central GABAergic integrative stimulation, an analgesic spinal descending outcome could in turn counteract visceral hypersensitivity induced by stress in response to colorectal distension. Besides this nervous cross-talk mechanistic pathway of GABA delivered by <italic>L. lactis</italic> into the stomach, we cannot exclude an antinociceptive effect mediated by an increase of circulating GABA. However, at this stage we have no data on this hypothesis. Thanks to the referee’s input, the measurements of circulating GABA levels are now planned in our future investigations on <italic>L. lactis</italic> studies.</p><p>– Bampton PA, Dinning PG, Kennedy ML, Lubowski DZ, and Cook IJ.

The authors show that GABAB receptor antagonist blocks the beneficial effect of the NCDO02118 strain on visceral hypersensitivity, but the authors do not try to identify which cell types are involved in this mechanism. Enteric, vagal, and spinal neurons that innervate the gut all have GABA receptors and identifying which subtype is involved would strengthen the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that in this study we did not identify the cell types involved in the antinociceptive mechanism. As answered in the comment 2 of the reviewer, GABA receptors are present on the vagal afferent fibers both at the mucosal endings that respond to touch and chemical stimuli and muscular endings that respond optimally to mechanical stretch or tension (Page <italic>et al.</italic> 2002, see above). As discussed in our paper, GABAB receptors are also widely distributed from the stomach to the ileum in the enteric nervous system (ENS). In rodents, the presence of GABAB receptors has also been identified on the mucosal gland cells of the stomach. All these data suggest complex mechanisms and pathways by which GABA delivered by NCDO2118 strain exerts visceral antinociceptive effect. Based on the literature and our own observations, at this step of our knowledge, we cannot emphasize a cell type more than another and we agree that additional investigations are needed to open this black box.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors show an interesting phenotype that the NCDO02727 strain does not produce GABA even though it has the proper machinery.

In the manuscript, we have demonstrated by <italic>in silico</italic> analyses that these differences were not due to differences in the genetic organisation of <italic>gadCB</italic> operon and <italic>gadR</italic> gene nor to differences in GadB,C and R protein sequences.</p><p>In order to determine if these differences in GABA production could be associated to differences in <italic>gadCB</italic> and <italic>gadR</italic> expression regulation, we have now analysed the nucleotide sequences of their promoters.

NCDO02118 admininstration induces the upregulation of IL-10 (DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2021.623920), which can block pain. Is IL-10 also induced in these mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this relevant question. In a previous study, we have shown that PRS increased gut paracellular permeability and endotoxemia, two responses which in cascade induced elevated mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) in the PVN (Ait-Belgnaoui <italic>et al.</italic> 2012, see above). This central neuro-inflammation was prevented by a chronic daily treatment with a probiotic strain i.e. <italic>Lactobacillus farciminis</italic>. Since several probiotics have been described to be able to restore gut physical barrier damage as well as to increase anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, it would be very interesting in future investigations to evaluate gut anti-inflammatory properties of NCDO2118 in this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors suggest that L. lactis may be a treatment option for visceral pain and anxiety associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the study does not test whether L. lactis has any effect on anxiety behavior. Can the authors test anxiety behaviors?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We know that the comorbidity between IBS and anxiety disorders is elevated and that anxiety and depression contribute to inefficient therapies in IBS (Vandvik <italic>et al.</italic> 2006; Popa <italic>et al.</italic> 2015). Anxiety is a complex disorder, defined as the response to prolonged, unpredictable threat, a response which encompasses physiological, affective, and cognitive changes. To our knowledge, different animal models are developed to mimic anxiety. The Open Field Maze is one of the most commonly anxiety-like models used to characterize behaviors in rodents. However, until now, we haven’t this type of model in our lab but we are exploring the possibility of a collaborative work to investigate <italic>L. lactis</italic> ability to reduce anxiety behavior in response to stress.</p><p>Besides, even if we did not use an anxiety-like model in our study, we kindly point that PRS model is a reliable model widely used for studying the pharmacological modulation of the GABAergic system in order to prevent the anxiety-like behavior induced by acute and chronic stress (Reznikov <italic>et al.</italic> 2009; Nuss, 2015; Assad <italic>et al.</italic> 2020; Farajdokht <italic>et al.</italic> 2020).</p><p>– Assad, N., Luz, W.
