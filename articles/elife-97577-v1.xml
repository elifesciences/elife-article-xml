We employed a chemogenetic approach to discover novel cellular networks that regulate cell cycle progression. This approach uncovered functional clusters of genes that altered sensitivity of cells to inhibitors of the G1/S transition. Mutation of components of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 rescued proliferation inhibition caused by the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, but not to inhibitors of S phase or mitosis. In addition to its core catalytic subunits, mutation of the PRC2.1 accessory protein MTF2, but not the PRC2.2 protein JARID2, rendered cells resistant to palbociclib treatment. We found that PRC2.1 (MTF2), but not PRC2.2 (JARID2), was critical for promoting H3K27me3 deposition at CpG islands genome-wide and in promoters. This included the CpG islands in the promoter of the CDK4/6 cyclins CCND1 and CCND2, and loss of MTF2 lead to upregulation of both CCND1 and CCND2. Our results demonstrate a role for PRC2.1, but not PRC2.2, in antagonizing G1 progression in a diversity of cell linages, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), breast cancer, and immortalized cell lines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular biology</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>D-type cyclins</kwd><kwd>palbociclib</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toczyski</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sandler Program for Breakthroughs in Biomedical Research (PBBR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG057497</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Yin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sandler Program for Breakthroughs in Biomedical Research (PBBR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY027789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Yin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sandler Program for Breakthroughs in Biomedical Research (PBBR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1HG009402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Yin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sandler Program for Breakthroughs in Biomedical Research (PBBR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01DA052713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Yin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sandler Program for Breakthroughs in Biomedical Research (PBBR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toczyski</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An MTF2-containing subcomplex of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 promotes cell cycle progression through repression of D-type cyclin expression in certain cellular contexts.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular decisions to grow and divide are made by assessing the balance of activating and inhibitory inputs that govern the transition between cell cycle phases. Regulated progression through the cell cycle is crucial for normal cellular growth and organismal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ginzberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Massagué, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertoli et al., 2013</xref>). Progression from G1 into S phase is the most highly regulated step of the cell cycle, as initiating DNA replication commits a cell to divide and is frequently mutationally activated in tumors. Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 (CDK4) and the related CDK6 (henceforth referred to collectively as CDK4/6) play critical roles in promoting G1 progression through phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1). Phosphorylation relieves RB1-mediated transcriptional repression of E2F transcription factors, which are then competent to drive transcription of genes necessary for progression into S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rubin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bracken et al., 2004</xref>). Because of their crucial role in regulating G1 progression, specific inhibitors targeting CDK4/6 have proven to be effective therapeutics. Palbociclib was the first FDA approved CDK4/6 inhibitor and highly efficacious in the treatment of HR+/HER2− breast cancers, followed by the structurally related molecules ribociclib and abemaciclib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dickler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Morrison et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Turner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Im et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goel et al., 2022</xref>). However, this classical model of G1 regulation has recently given way to a more complex model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cappell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cappell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chung et al., 2019</xref>), underscored by the complexity of genetic alterations that lead to resistance to treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rubin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cappell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cappell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zatulovskiy et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, while G1 progression has been the focus of intense study, our understanding of its regulation remains incomplete.</p><p>The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) was initially identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a developmental regulator that represses the expression of Hox genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lewis, 1978</xref>). The PRC2 complex is conserved in throughout eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dumesic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grimaud et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kuroda et al., 2020</xref>) and catalyzes the mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of Histone 3 Lysine 27 (referred to collectively as H3K27me3, the fully methylated form of H3K27) and thereby acts as a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>). The core PRC2 complex is composed of a H3K27me3 ‘reader’ EED, a scaffold protein SUZ12, and the catalytic subunit EZH2 (or the more poorly expressed and less catalytically active paralog EZH1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Son et al., 2013</xref>). This core complex is capable of catalyzing H3K27me3 deposition and chromatin association, but how PRC2 achieves full spatiotemporal regulation of chromatin localization and catalytic activity has been an area of active investigation. Recent studies have identified additional accessory factors that modify the localization and enzymatic activity of these core components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hauri et al., 2016</xref>). The associated auxiliary factors define different PRC2 subcomplexes, which are called PRC2.1 and PRC2.2, based on the composition of the subunits associated with the core PRC2 complex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">van Mierlo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Piunti and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>). In addition to the core PRC2 subunits, PRC2.1 consists of two modules, one module containing a Polycomb-like (PCL) protein PHF1, MTF2, or PHF19 and a second module of either PALI1/2 or EPOP. The more homogenous PRC2.2 always consists of the core PRC2 subunits in complex with both JARID2 and AEBP2. The role of these complexes in different cellular processes and contexts is debated. Despite the lack of an a clear analogous sequence to the Polycomb Response Elements which promotes PRC2 chromatin association in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De et al., 2020</xref>), the presence of a DNA-binding extended homology domain in each PCL protein has been proposed to recruit PRC2.1 to unmethylated CpG islands and establish H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Perino et al., 2018</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, PRC2.2 localizes to sites utilizing pre-existing mono-ubiquitinated H2AK119 (H2AK119ub1), which is deposited by the PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbour et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cooper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kalb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Glancy et al., 2023</xref>), through a ubiquitin interaction motif contained within JARID2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cooper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kalb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kasinath et al., 2021</xref>). Regardless of their specific roles in the propagation of H3K27me3 histone marks, members of both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 have been implicated as both positive and negative regulators of stem cell maintenance, differentiation, and cancer, depending on the cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Piunti and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Su et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shirato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari and Davie, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Petracovici and Bonasio, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Loh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rothberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ngubo et al., 2023</xref>). All of the PRC2 core subunits (EZH2, SUZ12, and EED) have been shown to inhibit that transcription of both positive and negative regulators of G1/S progression, including the CDK4/6 protein inhibitor p16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bracken et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bracken et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracken et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adhikari and Davie, 2020</xref>). However, the net result of these opposing effects on cell cycle progression, and the contribution of the individual subcomplexes to this regulation, remains unclear.</p><p>To identify novel regulators of cellular proliferation, we utilized a whole-genome chemogenetic approach to identify genes that sensitized or lent resistance to inhibitors of different cell cycle stages. We uncovered novel resistance mechanisms to three known inhibitors of cell cycle progression in the human haploid cell line HAP1. This approach revealed that mutations in mitochondrial function or the Polycomb complexes rescued slow proliferation in palbociclib. We could recapitulate these positive genetic interactions pharmacologically using small molecule inhibitors of either PRC2 activity or mitochondrial respiration. Loss of core PRC2 members or PCL subunits of the PRC2.1 subcomplex, particularly MTF2, resulted in resistance to palbociclib, while loss of PRC2.2-specific subunits resulted in sensitivity. Data from CUT&amp;RUN and RNA sequencing experiments performed on clonal MTF2∆ and JARID2∆ knockout mutant cell lines suggest that PRC2.1 plays a more critical role in repressing gene expression when compared with PRC2.2 in HAP1 cells, particularly at promoters containing CpG islands. D-type cyclins are among the genes that are repressed by PRC2.1 and loss of MTF2 results in increased expression of both CCND1 and CCND2 through loss of H3K27me3 in their promoters. This increased expression resulted in an apparent increase in CDK4/6 kinase activity and S-phase entry of cells, driving resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition. Our results suggest that MTF2-containing PRC2.1 plays a strong role in G1 progression in a number of cellular contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemogenetic CRISPR–Cas9 screen utilizing cell cycle inhibitors identified novel players in the cell cycle</title><p>Recently, CRISPR–Cas9 knockout genetic screens have emerged as a powerful way in which to probe genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Horlbeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Przybyla and Gilbert, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bock et al., 2022</xref>), with the haploid human cell line HAP1 serving a popular model for these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hundley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Stok et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aregger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hundley and Toczyski, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Olbrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Llargués-Sistac et al., 2023</xref>). To identify novel genes involved in cell cycle regulation, we carried out genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 chemogenomic screens in HAP1 cells treated with each of three well-characterized inhibitors of cell cycle progression: palbociclib (a CDK4/6 and G1 progression inhibitor), colchicine (a microtubule polymerization and mitosis inhibitor), and camptothecin (a Topoisomerase I and S/G2 inhibitor). We used a concentration for each inhibitor that reduced cellular proliferation by 30–50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hundley et al., 2021</xref>) and confirmed their effects on cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The molecular target of camptothecin, TOP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hsiang et al., 1985</xref>), is the most resistant gene in the camptothecin screen, as are proteins involved in p53 transcriptional regulation, such as TP53BP1 and STAGA members TAF2, TAF4, TAF5, TAF11, and TAF13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similarly, colchicine sensitized cells to the mutation of genes encoding proteins involved in mitotic spindle assembly, nuclear division and cytoskeletal assembly, such as CLASP1, DLGAP5, and KNTC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Interestingly, inactivation of genes involved in the adaptive immune system, such as BIRC6, UBA5, and USP14, also resulted in sensitivity to colchicine. This observation is intriguing, as colchicine is used clinically as an immunomodulator in the treatment of gout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dalbeth et al., 2014</xref>). CCNE1, CDK6, CDK2, CCND2, and CCND1, all of which are integral to promoting the G1/S phase transition, ranked as the 2nd, 24th, 27th, 29th, and 46th most important genes for palbociclib sensitivity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>). CCND1 and CCND2 bind either CDK4 or CDK6, the molecular targets of palbociclib, whereas CDK2 and CCNE1 form a related CDK kinase that promotes the G1/S transition. Similarly, cells with sgRNAs targeting RB1, whose phosphorylation by CDK4/6 is a critical step in G1 progression, displayed substantial resistance to palbociclib.

To probe these interactions, we analyzed genes that significantly altered response to our three compounds using the gene annotation and analysis portal Metascape and the protein–protein interaction network analysis STRING. In addition to DDR genes, Metascape and STRING analysis of the results of our camptothecin treatment revealed de-enrichment for sgRNAs targeting genes encoding members of the KICSTOR complex (KPTN, SZT2, ITFG2, and KICS2), which negatively regulates the mTOR pathway. In contrast, sgRNAs targeting of genes involved in RNA metabolism and chromatin organization increased resistance to this drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). It has been suggested that mTOR is involved in attenuating the DDR response through phosphorylation of RNF168, leading to its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Xie et al., 2018</xref>), which could provide one explanation of the observed sensitivity. The loss of genes involved in chromatin structure and the metabolism of RNA conferred resistance to camptothecin is unexpected, given that both these processes have been implicated in DNA repair after damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bader et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Stadler and Richly, 2017</xref>). Genes whose inactivation enhanced sensitivity to colchicine included those involved in the amino acid starvation response (DEPDC5 TSC1, SZT2, and NPRL2) and mRNA splicing (SNRPB2, SF3B2, PPIL1, RBM22, and DHX35), while mutation of genes that control vesicle trafficking (VPS16, VPS18, VPS29, VPS41, VPS51, and VPS52) or encode members of the Mediator complex (CCNC, CDK8, and MED26, MED1, MED7, MED12, MED18, and MED11) attenuated the cellular response to the drug. Unexpectedly, inactivation of genes encoding members of the TP53 signaling pathway (TFDP1 and HIPK2), SAGA H3 acetylation complex components (KAT2A, TRRAP, TADA3, TAF5L, TADA2B, SGF29, and TADA1), and the Fanconi Anemia complex (FANCA, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FAAP100), all implicated in DDR, resulted in resistance to colchicine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). Sensitivity to palbociclib was enhanced in cells expressing sgRNAs targeting H4 acetylation, positive regulators of Pol II transcription and regulators of DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>), although this sensitivity was much weaker than that seen with DNA damaging agents. This observation is consistent with long-term treatment with palbociclib inducing DNA damage, as has been suggested by a number of recent publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Crozier et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Crozier et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wilson et al., 2023</xref>). Unexpectedly, Metascape analysis of our palbociclib chemogenetic screen revealed that sensitivity to palbociclib was enhanced when genes involved in chromatin organization were targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Inactivation of members of the SIN3 histone deacetylase (SIN3B, SINHCAF, and ARID4B), the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (ING3, DMAP1, MORF4L2, YEATS4, and VPS73), the STAGA histone acetyltransferase (KAT2A, TADA1, TADA2B, TAF5L, and SUPT20H), and the Mediator (MED13, MED25, MED10, MED15, TAF7, TAG13, and CCNC) complexes all resulted in palbociclib sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>).

Metascape analysis of genes whose loss conferred palbociclib resistance was highly enriched for splicing factors, oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial translation, in addition to chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). STRING analysis of the high-confidence, physical interactions of proteins important for palbociclib sensitivity revealed multiple highly connected interaction networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Strikingly, almost 25% (170 out of the 689) of the genes whose mutation conferred unique resistance to palbociclib have terms associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly, ATP synthesis, or mitochondrial gene expression. Specifically, we see many components implicated in assembly of Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Complex I and IV, as well as core mitochondrial ribosome and mitochondrial translation initiation and termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). To confirm this positive genetic interaction between mitochondrial homeostasis and resistance to palbociclib, and to dissect whether specific electron transport chain steps might be implicated in this resistance, we asked whether chemical inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation could rescue sensitivity to palbociclib. To target different stages of the oxidative phosphorylation, we employed rotenone, TTFA, and oligomycin, which inhibit Complex I, Complex II, and ATP synthase, respectively. Cells were grown in the presence of palbociclib alone or in combination with each drug for 48 hr and viability was determined by PrestoBlue assay. Cells exposed to rotenone, TTFA, and oligomycin displayed dose-dependent, positive proliferation interactions when treated in combination with palbociclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), indicating that combined inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and CDK4/6 activity mutually rescue the proliferation defect imposed by agents targeting the other process. While alternative explanations could explain the observed novel chemical–genetic interactions we uncovered here, such as either changes in phenotypic lag rates due to alterations in protein stability or more general screen variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rahman et al., 2021</xref>), these results suggest a connection between mitochondrial gene function and CDK4/6 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Polycomb repressive complex components display differing responses to palbociclib treatment</title><p>Intriguingly, inactivation of EZH2, SUZ12, and EED, the three core members of the PRC2 complex, resulted in profound resistance to palbociclib, being the eighth, fourth, and third strongest resistance hits out of the 18,053 genes examined when ranked by the score of differential effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Satisfyingly, inactivation of RING1, RNF2, and PCGF6, which are members of PRC1, also displayed resistance to palbociclib. The PRC1 complex contains a ubiquitin ligase that works in concert with PRC2 through H2AK119ub1 deposition, a histone mark that influences both PRC2 chromatin localization and catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbour et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kalb et al., 2014</xref>). As expected, PRC1 and PRC2 components identified in our palbociclib chemogenetic screen formed a highly interconnected STRING physical interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that loss of either H3K27me3 or H2AK119ub1 reduced sensitivity to this drug. In contrast, inactivation of genes encoding OGT, ASXL1, and HAT1, which are members of the H2AK119ub1 deubiquitinase complex that opposes PRC2-mediated gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chittock et al., 2017</xref>), resulted in sensitivity to palbociclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, no component of any PRC1 or PRC2 core complex displayed significant resistance or sensitivity to camptothecin and colchicine in our chemogenetic screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), implicating PRC2 in the regulation of G1 specifically, and not to other phases of the cell cycle or the DNA damage response pathway.

Mutation of the PRC2.1 complex members PHF1, MTF2, PHF19, and EPOP/C17orf96 all display significant resistance to palbociclib, with MTF2 being the strongest of these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, C</xref>). Conversely, targeting the genes encoding the PRC2.2-specific accessory proteins AEBP2 or JARID2 resulted in enhanced or neutral palbociclib sensitivity, respectively. These data suggest that PRC2.1 plays a previously uncharacterized role in promoting G1 progression, while PRC2.2 antagonizes it. To confirm the results from our palbociclib chemogenetic screen, we generated polyclonal knockout mutant pools of the individual core and accessory proteins of PRC2. We generated these populations by independently infecting three distinct sgRNAs targeting genes for each PRC2 complex member, or positive and negative control genes, in GFP-positive and doxycycline-inducible Cas9 cells and induced DNA cleavage for 3 days (henceforth referred to as pooled knockouts). We performed western blots to confirm reduction in protein levels for the genes targeted by the sgRNAs used to generate our pooled knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). After confirming reduction in the targeted proteins, we carried out a competitive proliferation assay using these pooled knockouts (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> or see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hundley et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, GFP-positive pooled knockouts were mixed with GFP-negative wild-type cells and propagated in the presence or absence of palbociclib. The ratio of GFP-positive to GFP-negative cells was recorded every 3 days by flow cytometry for 18 days. Pools containing sgRNAs against EZH2, SUZ12, EED, and MTF2 all displayed resistance to palbociclib, similar to the level observed with sgRNAs targeting RB1, our positive control for palbociclib-induced proliferation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Conversely, compared with the dramatic reduction seen in pools transduced with CCNE1 sgRNAs, our positive control for enhanced palbociclib sensitivity CCNE1, sgRNAs targeting PRC2.2 components showed a slight, but statistically signification reduction in proliferation in palbociclib over the 18-day assay (AEBP2: p-value = 0.002 and JARID2: p-value = 0.0148, unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test). Thus, we confirmed the results of our chemogenetic screen that MTF2-containing PRC2.1 inhibits G1 progression, while PRC2.2 could promote it.</p><p>To further interrogate the role of PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 in the regulation of G1 progression, we generated SUZ12, MTF2, and JARID2-null monoclonal cell lines (which we will refer to as SUZ12∆, MTF2∆, and JARID2∆). We chose to mutate MTF2 to probe the function of PRC2.1, as it has been shown to be the most highly expressed and predominant PCL subunit associated with the PRC2 core complex in a variety of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Oliviero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Smits et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, we selected SUZ12 for inactivation out of the core PRC2 complex members, and not the catalytic subunit EZH2, because the presence of the EZH2 paralog EZH1 might compensate for loss of EZH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jadhav et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, SUZ12 has a critical role in bridging accessory proteins with the catalytic core in all known PRC2 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Petracovici and Bonasio, 2021</xref>). MTF2∆ cells displayed resistance to palbociclib when compared with wild-type cells in a 9-day quantitative Crystal Violet assay (MTF2∆ IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.033 µM, wild-type IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.3936 µM) while JARID2∆ cells were slightly more sensitive than wild-type (JARID2∆ IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.2216 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In addition to showing sensitivity to palbociclib, MTF2∆ cells also displayed resistance to, ribociclib and abemaciclib, two CDK4/6 inhibitors that are structurally related to palbociclib, in a competitive proliferation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results confirmed our screen results that mutation of MTF2 leads in CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance with verified clonal mutants.</p><p>Palbociclib exerts its chemotherapeutic effects by inducing a G1 arrest and senescence in tumor cells with a functional RB-E2F pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhu et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schoninger and Blain, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dean et al., 2010</xref>). However, a recent report demonstrates that palbociclib treatment induces both G1 arrest and apoptosis through the increase in DNA damage in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), introducing the possibility that PRC2.1 could be altering regulators of the DDR pathway, resulting in the observed palbociclib resistance. To determine if inactivation of PRC2.1 or PRC2.2 altered cell cycle progression, we examined how wild-type, SUZ12∆, MTF2∆, and JARID2∆ cells responded to palbociclib-induced G1 arrest. To assess this directly, we performed a BrdU incorporation assay by growing each mutant for 24 hr in palbociclib, pulsed the cells with BrdU for 1 hr prior to harvest and then measured BrdU incorporation by flow cytometry. Each of the four cell lines had similar levels of BrdU incorporation in the absence of drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, MTF2∆ and SUZ12∆ mutants displayed significantly more cells entering S-phase in the presence of palbociclib, while palbociclib treatment resulted in significantly fewer JARID2∆ mutants cells in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To rule out the possibility that cellular viability was not compromised in our monoclonal knockout cell lines, we used western blotting to monitor changes in PARP cleavage or increased BCL2L11/BIM expression, which both serve as apoptosis indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sionov et al., 2015</xref>). There was no detectible basal increase in markers of apoptosis in the monoclonal knockout mutant cell lines or when cells were treated with palbociclib for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), supporting the conclusion that the resistance to palbociclib observed in the MTF2∆ and SUZ12∆ cells was due to the repressive and promoting role the MTF2-containing PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 complexes play, respectively, in the canonical CDK4/6-RB1-E2F pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 mutants display altered H3K27me3 and transcriptional landscapes</title><p>To determine why the mutation of PRC2 subcomplex components altered the cellular response to palbociclib, we sought to see how H3K27me3 levels and gene expression changed in MTF2∆ and JARID2∆ cells. western blotting of total H3K27me3 levels in three independently generated clones indicated that there was no change in the bulk levels of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that any change of phenotype observed in the mutants was due to a change in the localization of this mark and not due to an overall reduction in its abundance. This is in contrast to SUZ12∆ cells, which displayed a significant reduction in the H3K27me3 mark (unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, p-value = 0.0104). To probe the changes in transcription and H3K27me3 distribution genome-wide, we generated CUT&amp;RUN libraries with an anti-H3K27me3 antibody and RNA-Seq libraries from total RNA isolated from our MTF2∆ and JARID2∆ cell lines, grown either in the presence or absence of palbociclib for 24 hr. Changes in H3K27me3 levels and mRNA expression were determined by comparing the enrichment of reads in the MTF2∆ and JARID2∆ libraries to the wild-type cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Because cancer cells have been known to adapt to palbociclib treatment partially through changes to histone marks, chromatin structure and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Watt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pancholi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guarducci et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Turner et al., 2019</xref>), we also investigated how both transcript levels and H3K27me3 distribution responded to treatment with palbociclib in our clonal knockout cell lines. Primary component analysis (PCA) of our called, reproducible H3K27me3 peaks and transcript abundance from our CUT&amp;RUN and RNA-Seq data, respectively, showed a high percentage of variance between each of the genotypes tested, along with good clustering of repeats of the same genotype and treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting a shift in the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes when either MTF2 or JARID2 are absent. PCA analysis of our RNA-Seq experiment revealed substantial shifts in variance between palbociclib- and Mock-treated samples for each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, bottom), suggesting that exposure to palbociclib resulted in changes in gene expression, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ferguson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lanceta et al., 2021</xref>). However, the PCA of our CUT&amp;RUN experiment did not reveal large differences in H3K27me3 distribution between palbociclib-treated and untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> – top). In line with this observation, when we analyzed the change in distribution of H3K27me3 peaks between palbociclib- and Mock-treated cells using DESeq2, we found no significant changes in the location of H3K27me3 reproducible peaks in the presence or absence of palbociclib (data not shown). This suggests that MTF2∆ mutants are not resistant to palbociclib because MTF2 is required for a transcriptional adaptation to the drug, but instead because MTF2 alters expression of genes important for G1/S progression, even in unperturbed cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Polycomb 2.1 and PRC2.2 are differentially recruited to promoters with CpG islands.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left</italic> – Western blots of wild-type, SUZ12∆, MTF2∆, and JARID2∆ cell extracts probed with the indicated antibodies.<italic>Right</italic> – Quantification of H3K27me3 signal intensity, normalized to H3, ±StDev. *p-value &lt;0.05, n.s.: not significant, two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test.

We defined promoters as 4 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream of all annotated transcription start sites, and calculated the total number of reads within each of these regions. Our parameters led to ~61,000 genomic regions being designated as promoters. In addition to annotated protein-coding genes, this included the promoters of non-coding transcribable units such as rRNA, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and pseudogenes. We observed a greater number of promoters with significantly decreased H3K27me3 (log<sub>2</sub> fold-change [LFC] ±1, adjusted p-value &lt;0.1) in the MTF2∆ compared to JARID2∆ cell lines (5808 vs 1034 promoters, respectively). Of these, 5149 promoters displayed MTF2-dependent H3K27me3, 392 were JARID2-dependent, and 629 were co-dependent on MTF2 and JARID2 for wild-type levels of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, D</xref>). Consistent with the greater change in H3K27me3 signal at promoters in MTF2∆ cells, 733 versus 114 transcripts were significantly upregulated upon MTF2 versus JARID2 inactivation, respectively, with 666 transcripts that were exclusively MTF2-dependent, 47 transcripts that were exclusively JARID2-dependent, and 67 transcripts displaying co-dependence on both MTF2 and JARID2. These results indicate that the MTF2-containing PRC2.1 complexes affect the deposition of H3K27me3 in the promoter regions of more genes than the JARID2-containing PRC2.2, and therefore, are more important for transcriptional repression in HAP1 cells.</p><p>Given the diverse regulatory roles of PRC2 in different biological contexts, and the limited information on PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 outside of stem cells, we were curious to see what classes of genes were being differentially regulated in the MTF2∆ and JARID2∆ cell lines. Only ~30–40% of the promoters with significantly changed levels of H3K27me3 were upstream of protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), while ~80–90% of the significantly differentially expressed transcripts encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, we focused a Metascape analysis on the promoters and mRNAs of protein-coding genes with differential H3K27me3 and transcript levels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Analysis of the promoters of genes with decreased H3K27me3 and increased transcript levels in both MTF2∆ and JARID2∆ lines were terms associated with embryonic morphogenesis, cell-fate commitment, and developmental growth, all processes previously been shown to be regulated, at least in part, by PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">German and Ellis, 2022</xref>). Intriguingly, terms for genes that specifically displayed decreased promoters H3K27me3 and upregulated mRNA in MTF2∆ cells included the pro-growth pathways cGMP and ERBB4 signaling. Conversely, terms for genes which displayed increased promoter H3K27me3 signal and decreased transcript levels in JARID2∆ cells contained pathways that could reduce cellular proliferation and viability, such as positive transcriptional regulation of RUNX1 and positive regulators of program cell death. We also saw terms that had opposite effects on H3K27me3 and transcript levels in MTF2∆ compared to JARID2∆ cells, such as secretion by the cell and regulation of cellular component biogenesis, which could potentially exacerbate palbociclib-induced proliferation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Uzhachenko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Franco et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these data support the notion that MTF2 antagonizes cell proliferation in normal cellular conditions, while JARID2 promotes it.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 mutants display differential H3K27me3 modification in promoters in cell cycle related genes with CpG islands</title><p>MTF2-containing PRC2.1 have been previously shown to localize to chromatin using a winged helix in its extended homology domain that has affinity for CG-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Perino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Li et al., 2017</xref>), whereas PRC2.2 localization is dependent on chromatin context, specifically H2AK119ub1 deposited by PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cooper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kalb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Glancy et al., 2023</xref>). To determine whether CpG island targeting by PRC2.1 could help explain the palbociclib resistance we observed in the absence of MTF2, we identified and plotted 1877 peaks that overlapped with CpG islands in wild-type cells and had the greatest H3K27me3 signal in a 10-kb window surrounding the CpG islands. We then plotted the H3K27me3 signal observed in the MTF2∆ and JARID2∆ cells for these same loci. We observed a complete loss of H3K27me3 signal intensity at CpG islands in the MTF2∆ mutants, but only a partial loss at these loci in JARID2∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). When we expanded our findings genome-wide, we found a significant loss of H3K27me3 peaks at CpG islands in MTF2∆ cells (Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio = 20.4, p-value 2.2 × 10<sup>−308</sup>), compared with JARID2∆, where this loss was much more modest (Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio = 9.8, p-value = 6.5 × 10<sup>−7</sup>). This result is consistent with the interpretation that the MTF2-containing PRC2.1 is required for all H3K27me3 deposition at CpG islands, whereas JARID2-containing PRC2.2 is only required to achieve full wild-type H3K27me3 levels at these sites.</p><p>CpG islands are a very common feature of mammalian promoters, with 50–70% human promoters estimated to contain at least one CpG island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>).

Consistent with the result seen at CpG islands genome-wide, we observed a complete loss of high signal intensity in the MTF2∆ cells, but only a slight loss in JARID2∆ cells. When we averaged the H3K27me3 signal intensity over all 25,124 promoters that contain CpG islands, we observed a pattern of MTF2∆ cells having greatly decreased H3K27me3 levels in these regions, particularly surrounding the transcription start site while JARID2∆ cells were widely similar to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) in line with what was seen at CpG islands genome-wide.

In fact, while CCND1 and CCND2 were both among the most upregulated statistically significant transcripts within the MTF2∆ cell line, their transcription and promoter H3K27 methylation were unaltered in JARID2∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Given that increased CCND1 levels are sufficient to drive increased CDK4/6 kinase activity, upregulation of these D-type cyclins is likely to be a significant contributor to the palbociclib resistance in MTF2∆ cells. DESeq2 analysis of H3K27me3 density in MTF2∆ cells displayed a statistically significant 4.3 and 2.7 log<sub>2</sub> fold-decrease in H3K27me3 signal in the promoter region of CCND1 and CCND2, respectively, when compared to wild-type H3K27me3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), whereas changes in H3K27me3 levels in the CCND3 promoter were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Given our observation that H3K27me3 signal is lost at CpG islands in MTF2∆ cells, we inspected the D-type cyclin promoters for CpG islands. Indeed, the regions upstream of all three D-type cyclins contained CpG islands, but CCND1 and CCND2 had regions of GC density about seven times larger (7460 and 6003 bp, respectively) than CCND3 (996 bp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Furthermore, the promoter of CCND1 contained about twice as many CpG repeats than did CCND2 (575 vs 379) and about six times as many CpG repeats as CCND3 (575 vs 95). These results suggest that the levels of CCND1 and CCND2 mRNA transcripts, but not CCND3, were regulated by MTF2 in a CpG island-dependent manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>CCND1 and CCND2 expression is increased in MTF2∆ mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatterplot of genes whose log<sub>2</sub> fold-changes for MTF2∆/wild-type ratio of mRNA expression (<italic>x</italic>-axis) versus promoter H3K27me3 signal (<italic>y</italic>-axis) had an adjusted p-value of &lt;0.05 and an adjusted p-value &lt;0.1 where plotted.

We generated pooled knockouts of MTF2, JARID2, and the core PRC2 components SUZ12, EZH2, and EED using three independent sgRNAs. In pooled knockouts of MTF2, EZH2, EED, and SUZ12, we observed an increase in both CCND1 and CCND2 protein levels by western blot, but not for CCND3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with the results from our CUT&amp;RUN and RNA-Seq datasets, we did not observe a significant change in either CCND1 or CCND2 levels in JARID2 pooled knockouts. We next examined mRNA and protein levels of the D-type cyclins in MTF2∆ and JARID2∆ clones by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Again clonal knockouts of SUZ12∆ and MTF2∆, but not JARID2∆ lines, had increased mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>) for both CCND1 and CCND2, but not CCND3. To determine whether other genes involved in the canonical CDK4/6-RB-E2F pathway were also altered, we examined mRNA and protein levels of known cell cycle regulators in our knockout cell lines. In contrast to CCND1 and CCND2, none of the E-type cyclins, CIP/KIP CDK inhibitors, RB1 or E2F proteins displayed significantly altered mRNA transcript abundance in our RNA-Seq experiment in either MTF2∆ or JARID2∆ lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To confirm that protein stability of these factors was not altered in our knockout lines, we also examined protein levels of a panel of known G1 regulators by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Similarly, we did not observe an increase in levels of any of the tested proteins, confirming that CCND1 and CCND2 were the only upregulated canonical CDK4/6-RB-E2F pathway regulators in MTF2∆ cells.</p><p>Proper regulation of D-type cyclin expression is necessary to promote G1 progression, cellular fate specification, and organismal development, while dysregulation is seen in many cancers. Given the clear role of MTF2-dependent regulation of CCND1 and CCND2 in HAP1 cells, we sought to determine whether MTF2-containing PRC2.1 regulates the expression of D-type cyclins in other cell types in addition to HAP1. To probe this question, we determined levels of CCND1 by western blot in a panel of cell lines from a diversity of cell lineages treated with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 for 6 days. As expected, treatment of cells for 6 days with GSK126 resulted in a profound reduction in H3K27me3 levels in all cell lines tested and increased CCND1 expression in HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, in the non-adherent, haploid CML cell line KBM7, from which HAP1 was derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carette et al., 2011</xref>), we also observed a dramatic increase in CCND1 levels. This suggests that the regulation of D-type cyclin by PRC2 observed in HAP1 was not the results of artifacts introduced during the initial isolation of this cell line. Additionally, we observed that GSK126 treatment resulted in increased levels of CCND1 in the breast cancer line MDA-MB-231 and the SV40-immortalized monkey kidney fibroblast cell line COS7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that PRC2 activity can repress CCND1 expression in multiple mammalian cell lineages and species. In agreement with the context-dependent nature of PRC2 regulation of developmentally important loci, increased levels of CCND1 was not observed in the prostate adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP and the immortalized mouse embryonic cell line NR-6, illustrating that regulation of CCND1 expression by PRC2 is not observed in all cellular lineages. To specifically probe the roles of PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 in the cell lines that displayed upregulation of CCND1 when all PRC2 activity was inhibited, we transduced COS7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with shRNAs targeting SUZ12, MTF2, and JARID2 and propagated cells for 2 weeks post selection. Consistent with results from propagation of these cell lines in GSK126, depletion of either SUZ12 and MTF2 in both COS7 and MDA-MB-231 resulted in significantly increased CCND1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that MTF2-containing PRC2.1 represses this loci in diverse cell types in addition to HAP1.</p><p>While D-type cyclins are necessary to promote the kinase activity of CDK4/6, they have also been shown to play roles outside of the RB1-E2F pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jirawatnotai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shimura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aggarwal et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we sought to test if the increases in D-type cyclins seen in MTF2∆ cells lead to increased CDK4/6 activity, driving resistance to palbociclib treatment. First, we introduced alleles of CCND1 or CCND2 under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter into wild-type HAP1 cells. We then performed a competitive proliferation assay in the presence of palbociclib and monitored the advantage conferred by overexpression of D-type cyclins. Consistent with the interpretation that the increased levels of D-type cyclins resulted in palbociclib resistance observed in MTF2∆ cells, overexpression of either CCND1 or CCND2 was sufficient to induce resistance to palbociclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Critically, as elevated cellular levels of D-type cyclins alone would be insufficient to drive palbociclib resistance, we tested to see if the increased expression of D-type cyclins in PRC2.1 mutant cell lines drove CDK4/6 association. To test this, we introduced a FLAG epitope-tagged copy of CDK6 into our knockout mutant cell lines, immunoprecipitated CDK6 and blotted for CCND1. We observed increased association of CCND1 with FLAG-tagged CDK6 in both SUZ12∆ and MTF2∆, but not JARID2∆, knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>), suggesting that elevated levels of D-type cyclins indeed drive the formation of active CDK4/6 complexes. Finally, if the increased cellular levels of CCND1 and CCND2 seen in the MTF2∆ cell lines enhanced CDK4/6 kinase activity. To probe this question, we determined the extent of RB1 phosphorylation at S807 and S811, two well-characterized CDK4/6 targeted residues that are common markers of proliferation and which are recognized by a single antibody. To do this, we titrated wild-type, MTF2∆, and JARID2∆ cells with increasing amounts of palbociclib and determined the levels of total RB1 and phosphorylated RB1 levels to calculate the ratio at each concentration. In each of our cell lines, higher concentrations of palbociclib resulted in decreased levels of phosphorylated RB1, as expected. However, compared to WT or JARID2∆ cells, MTF2∆ mutant cells maintained a higher ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated RB1 at each concentration of palbociclib tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This result suggests that the increased levels of CCND1 and CCND2 in MTF2∆ cells increases CDK4/6 kinase activity, driving cells into S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In total, our results suggest that MTF2-contiaing PRC2.1 antagonizes G1 progression by repressing expression of the D-type cyclins CCND1 and CCND2 in certain cellular contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Regulated progression through cell cycle phases is critical to normal cellular function and viability, while disordered progression is the hallmark of many disease states. Although the cell cycle has been an area of active research for decades, our understanding of its regulation remains incomplete. Using a chemogenetic approach, we found that inactivation of members of PRC2.1, but not factors specific to PRC2.2, resulted in profound resistance to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Loss of PRC2.1 complex members led to upregulation of the D-type cyclins CCND1 and CCND2, resulting in increased RB1 phosphorylation and S-phase entry in palbociclib-treated cells. We propose that PRC2.1, but not PRC2.2, meditates H3K27me3 deposition in the promoters CCND1 and CCND2 through the recognition of the CpG islands. These results tie PRC2.1 directly to the regulation of G1 progression.</p><p>In the chemogenomic screens reported here, we recovered genes in a diverse array of biological pathways that resulted in sensitivity or resistance to well-characterized cell cycle inhibitors. In addition, we observed that inactivation of genes involved in mitochondrial homeostasis resulted in resistance to palbociclib. Small molecule inhibitors of EZH2 or the electron transport chain co-administered with palbociclib resulted in enhanced cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>), supporting the observed chemical–genetic interaction seen in our screen. However, genes identified in genetic screens should be interpreted with caution. Reproducible, and sometimes robust interactions can sometimes result from complicated changes in doubling time or alterations to the physiologic state of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rahman et al., 2021</xref>). It was recently demonstrated that genes encoding members of the electron transport chain are over-represented in DepMap co-dependency data, due to the remarkable stability of these protein complexes, which results in phenotypic lag that can vary in different backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rahman et al., 2021</xref>). While mitochondrial complex assembly factors as enriched in Metascape analysis of our camptothecin screen as well as in palbociclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the enrichment was greater than 1600-fold more significant in palbociclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, a number of reports have found increased oxygen consumption and ROS production due to greater number and size of mitochondria in cells treated palbociclib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Uzhachenko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Franco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Santiappillai et al., 2021</xref>). This is consistent with a direct effect of CDK4/6 activity on mitochondrial function. Thus, in the case of both the PRC2 and the mitochondrial gene cluster, our data and that of others suggest that these results represent a direct link between these pathways and CDK4/6 biology.</p><p>Recently, PRC2 subcomplex accessory proteins have been implicated in an increasing number of processes that define cellular identity, including stem cell maintenance, differentiation, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rothberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ngubo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Parreno et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the importance of controlled cellular division to each one of these processes, few reports have interrogated the roles of the different subcomplexes outside of stem cell model systems or specifically on their role in cell cycle regulation. Here, we show that in cells that lose either MTF2 or SUZ12 continue to proliferate despite palbociclib blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, G</xref>). These mutants show no apparent change in the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis and display a greater proportion of cells entering S-phase in the presence of palbociclib, compared to wild-type or JARID2∆ cells. This increase is consistent with our findings that in MTF2∆ cell lines treated with palbociclib, a higher percentage of RB1 remains phosphorylated, while a similar increase is not seen in JARID2∆ cells. Consistently, the increased expression of CCND1 observed in PRC2.1 mutant cell results in increased the amounts of CCND1 associated with FLAG-tagged CDK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>) and overexpression of either CCND1 or CCND2 was sufficient to drive palbociclib resistance in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We surmise that the upregulation of CCND1 and CCND2 expression observed in cells lacking MTF2 results in increased CDK4/6 kinase activity that is sufficient to overcome palbociclib-mediated inhibition. Critically, we did not observe any significant changes in expression of other classic regulators of the CDK4/6-RB1-E2F pathway in either our CUT&amp;RUN or RNA-Seq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). While we cannot exclude the possibility that MTF2 inactivation alters the expression of other factors that influence G1 progression, we propose CCND1 and CCND2 represent major targets of PRC2.1 repression restraining G1 progression in HAP1 cells. Our results that MTF2 represses CCND1 expression in MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) may help explain the recent reports that low MTF2 expression leads to increased chemotherapeutic resistance in leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Maganti et al., 2018</xref>) and downregulation of MTF2 was correlated with poorer clinical outcomes in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). However, more work is needed to determine whether D-type cyclins are critical PRC2.1 targets in tumors.</p><p>Work over the past decade has implicated accessory proteins as critical for proper genomic localization of the PRC2 enzymatic core. However, reports differ on in what chromatin and cellular contexts these subcomplexes act. Data from both mouse and human ES cells have suggested that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 have overlapping genomic occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Healy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Youmans et al., 2021</xref>), and that either subcomplex alone is capable of maintaining pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Healy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Youmans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Højfeldt et al., 2019</xref>). However, recent reports have found differing dependencies on these subcomplexes for proper distribution of H3K27me3 in cellular models of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Glancy et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Petracovici and Bonasio, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Walker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Landeira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pasini et al., 2010</xref>). For example, a recent study in a model of induced differentiation suggested that MTF2 is involved in the maintenance of repression of PRC2 genes, whereas JARID2 is important for de novo deposition of H3K27me3 critical for gene silencing through genes ‘pre-marked’ with H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Petracovici and Bonasio, 2021</xref>) Conversely, PRC2.1 was shown to be required for the majority of H3K27me3 deposition during induced cell-fate transitions in mESCs, whereas PRC2.2 was not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Glancy et al., 2023</xref>). This study generated a triple knockout of all three PCL proteins (PHF1, MTF2, and PHF19), resulting in complete ablation of all PRC2.1 activity and did not probe the contribution of each accessory protein individually. Furthermore, MTF2 transcript levels are downregulated upon differentiation, whereas PHF1 and PHF19 levels increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kloet et al., 2016</xref>). These data suggest that the subunit composition of PRC2.1 changes during this process. In our experiments, MTF2 is the only PCL subunit important for D-type cyclin repression. These data, along with our results using the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), are consistent with cell type-specific contributions of this class of proteins.</p><p>Using mutants of genes encoding subunits specific to either PRC2.1 or PRC2.2, we investigated the role of each subcomplex in cell cycle progression in HAP1 cells. In contrast to what has been demonstrated for ES cell lines where the two subcomplexes work synergically at the majority of sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Healy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Youmans et al., 2021</xref>), we show that MTF2 is required for the majority of H3K27me3 deposition at CpG islands genome-wide and JARID2 was only partially required for H3K27me3 at these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Importantly, the presence of MTF2 is more critical than JARID2 for the accumulation of H3K27me3 directly upstream of annotated transcription start sites in CpG islands-containing promoters in HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Concordant with the patterns in H3K27me3 in promoters, we found that MTF2 loss resulted in a greater number of upregulated transcripts than JARID2 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, MTF2∆ cells displayed a stronger correlation between genes with decreased promoter H3K27me3 levels and increased transcription than did JARID2∆ lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that AEBP2 plays a larger role in the activity of PRC2.2 than does JARID2 in these cells, as we identified AEBP2 as significantly, albeit modestly, increasing sensitivity to palbociclib in pooled knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, E</xref>). As H3K27me3 peak distribution was altered in the JARID2∆ cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), loss of JARID2 could alter H3K27me3 sites distal to promoters to change chromosome architecture or enhancer–promoter interactions. Alternatively, genes upregulated by loss of either MTF2 or JARID2 which did not have a significant alteration in promoter H3K27 methylation could be indirect effects. A recent report found that while PRC2.2 activity was not required for establishment of H3K27me3 during differentiation, but was instead required for recruitment of a PRC1 complex required for higher level chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Glancy et al., 2023</xref>). Future studies will be necessary to fully understand the coordination between these complexes.</p><p>The efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of HR+/HER2− breast cancer demonstrates the success of applying basic knowledge of cell cycle regulation to the generation of clinically relevant drugs. However, despite this success in the treatment of breast cancer, the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibition is variable, with 10–20% of tumors primarily resistant and an additional 40% becoming resistant to these drugs within the first 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Johnston et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hortobagyi et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, CDK4/6 inhibitors are currently being explored for other tumor types, and these are each likely to have novel resistance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Parreno et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Klein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Knudsen and Witkiewicz, 2017</xref>). Thus, understanding perturbations in molecular pathways that can result in resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition could lead to improved patient responses and outcomes. In this study, we found that mutation of the PRC2.1 accessory protein MTF2 results in the development of resistance to palbociclib-induced proliferation reduction. Previously, EZH2, SUZ12, EED, MTF2, and JARID2 have all been suggested to not only act as oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Béguelin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McCabe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), but also to have tumor suppressor activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Su et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jadhav et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Maganti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ntziachristos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mieczkowska et al., 2021</xref>), depending on the type of cancer.

These observations not only underscore the context-dependent ramifications of mutation of these PRC2 complex members, but also may help inform the context in which CDK4/6 inhibitors are most efficacious. Clinical trials using CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with other therapeutics are underway and the mutational status and expression levels of PRC2 subunits might serve as predictors of efficacy.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Lead contact and materials availability</title><p>Requests for further information and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, David Toczyski (dpt4darwin@gmail.com).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Cas9-expressing HAP1 and KBM7 cells were cultured in IMDM (Gibco) supplemented with 4 mM glutamine (Gibco), 10% Tetracycline-free FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and either 1× Antibiotic, Antimycotic (Invitrogen) or 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich).

Ninety million HAP1 cells stably expressing Cas9 were seeded into 15 cm dishes and infected with TKOv3 lentivirus at a multiplicity of infection of roughly 0.3, such that every sgRNA is represented in approximately 200–300 cells after selection (&gt;200-fold coverage).

Using a CRISPR-Cas9 library in HAP1 cells and an assay that scores cell fitness, the authors identify genes that sensitize or desensitize cells to the presence of palbociclib, colchicine, and camptothecin. The results suggest that these three drugs inhibit proliferation through different mechanisms, and with each treatment, expected and unexpected pathways were found to affect drug sensitivity. The authors focus the rest of the experiments and analysis on the polycomb complex PRC2, as deletion of several of its subunits in the screen conferred palbociclib resistance. The authors find that PRC2, specifically a complex dependent on the MTF2 subunit, methylates histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) in promoters of genes associated with various processes including cell-cycle control. Further experiments demonstrate that Cyclin D expression increases upon loss of PRC2 subunits, providing a potential mechanism for palbociclib resistance.</p><p>The strengths of the paper are the design and execution of the chemogenetic screen, which provides a wealth of potentially useful information. The data convincingly demonstrate in the HAP1 cell line that the MTF2-PRC2 complex sustains the effects of palbociclib (Fig. 4), methylates H3K27 in CpG-rich promoters (Fig. 5), and represses Cyclin D expression (Fig. 6). The correlation between MTF2-PRC2 inhibition and increased Cyclin D levels is shown in multiple cell lines using both genetic and chemical approaches. These results could be of great interest to those studying cell-cycle control, resistance mechanisms to therapeutic cell-cycle inhibitors, and chromatin regulation and gene expression.</p><p>There are a few weaknesses that somewhat temper the overall quality and potential impact of the study. First, the results from the colchicine and camptothecin screens (Fig. 1 and 2) are not experimentally validated, which lessens the rigor of those data and conclusions. Second, some experiments validating and further exploring results from the palbociclib screen (Figs. 4 and 5) are restricted to the Hap1 cell line, so the generality of some conclusions is not established. Third, conclusions drawn from data in Fig. 4D are not fully supported by proper use of biological replicates and analysis of the results.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>Proper statistical analysis considering biological replicates is still not applied to determine whether differences in palbociclib IC50 values at different GSK126 concentrations are significant.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The study by Longhurst et al. investigates the mechanisms of chemoresistance and chemosensitivity towards three compounds that inhibit cell cycle progression: camptothecin, colchicine, and palbociclib. Genome-wide genetic screens were conducted using the HAP1 Cas9 cell line, revealing compound-specific and shared pathways of resistance and sensitivity.

Genetic and pharmacological disruption of PRC2.1 function, but not related PRC2.2, leads to resistance to palbociclib. The researchers then show that disruption of PRC2.1 function (for example, by MTF2 deletion), results in locus-specific changes in H3K27 methylation and increases in D-type cyclin expression. It is suggested that increased expression of D-type cyclins results in palbociclib resistance.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The results of this study are interesting and contribute insights into the molecular mechanisms of CDK4/6 inhibitors.

It is also important to understand the clinical implications of the results presented. The inclusion of these data would significantly improve the paper. However, besides some presentation issues and typos as described below, it is my opinion that the results are robust and of broad interest.</p><p>Major questions:</p><p>(1) Is the resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition conferred by mutation of MTF2 mediated by Rb?</p><p>(2) Are mutations in PRC2.1 found in genetic analyses of tumour samples in patients with acquired resistance?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their editing and experimental suggestions, and have integrated their responses into our re-submitted manuscript.</p><p>We also agree that understanding the role of RB1 in mediating palbociclib resistance to the proposed resistance mechanism is of particular interest. However, as there are three RB proteins expressed in human cells, this is a technically difficult question to probe genetically. Despite this technical challenge, we have provided multiple lines of evidence in our resubmitted manuscript that the resistance to palbociclib observed in our PRC2.1-deficent cells is mediated through the canonical CDK4/6-RB1 pathway. First, disruption of RB1 in HAP1 cells results in palbociclib resistance to a level comparable level to PRC2.1 disruption (Fig. 4E). Second, inactivation of SUZ12 or MTF2 increases the number of cells entering S-phase in palbociclib treatment (Fig. 4G) with no increase in basal rates of apoptosis (Fig. S2D), suggesting that any proliferation advantage observed in PRC2.1-defective cells is due to resistance to palbociclib-induced cell cycle arrest. Third, we show that over expression of CCND1 and CCND2 is sufficient to drive resistance to palbociclib in wild-type HAP1 cells (Fig. S5F). And finally, increased levels of CCND1 and CCND2 observed in cells lacking PRC2.1 activity results in higher CDK4/6 activity as measured by RB1 phosphorylation, despite palbociclib blockade (Fig. 6F). All these lines of evidence strongly suggest that MTF2-containing PRC2.1 regulates G1 progression in through the canonical CDK4/6RB1 pathway by repressing CCND1 and CCND2 expression.</p><p>Whether or not MTF2 deletion leads to palbociclib resistance in clinical samples is also of a question of particular interest. Currently, we are unaware of any reports that specifically mention MTF2 deletion as leading to palbociclib resistance, and we were unable to find another example in our own cancer database review. However, we have included references to other examples of MTF2 mutation resulting in chemotherapeutic resistance in our discussion. Additionally, although MTF2 is rarely observed to be mutated in cancers (Ngubo et al. 2023), it is highly differentially expressed and investigating decreased MTF2 transcription in palbociclib resistant tumors, though challenging, might prove fruitful. However, as mechanisms of palbociclib resistance is an area of active investigation, we speculate that future studies might uncover additional examples of MTF2 mediating resistance to this clinically important chemotherapeutic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Longhurst et al. assessed cell cycle regulators using a chemogenetic CRISPR-Cas9 screen in haploid human cell line HAP1.

We have now shown through shRNA knockdown that MTF2 represses CCND1 in two additional cell lines, the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and immortalized monkey COS7 cell line (Fig. 6E). However, it is important to note that MTF2 did not control CCND1 expression in every cell line tested (Fig. 6D), underscoring the context-dependent nature of this regulation. Future studies will illuminate what cell or tumor types in which this regulation is observed.</p><p>Additionally, while MTF2 has previously been shown to exert a greater effect on H3K27me3 levels in some circumstances (Loh et al. 2021, Rothberg et al. 2018), a number of notable reports in ES cell lines have concluded that PRC2 localization and H3K27me3 at the majority of genomic sites are dependent on both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 activity (Healy et al. 2019, Højfeldt et al. 2019, Perino et al. 2020, Oksuz et al. 2018). Therefore, we think it is important to highlight the greater dependence on MTF2 for promoter proximal H3K27me3 levels in our transformed cell line context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This study begins with a chemogenetic screen to discover previously unrecognized regulators of the cell cycle. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 library in HAP1 cells and an assay that scores cell fitness, the authors identify genes that sensitize or desensitize cells to the presence of palbociclib, colchicine, and camptothecin. These three drugs inhibit proliferation through different mechanisms, and with each treatment, expected and unexpected pathways were found to affect drug sensitivity. The authors focus the rest of the experiments and analysis on the polycomb complex PRC2, as the deletion of several of its subunits in the screen conferred palbociclib resistance. The authors find that PRC2, specifically a complex dependent on the MTF2 subunit, methylates histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) in promoters of genes associated with various processes including cell-cycle control. Further experiments demonstrate that Cyclin D expression increases upon loss of PRC2 subunits, providing a potential mechanism for palbociclib resistance.</p><p>The strengths of the paper are the design and execution of the chemogenetic screen, which provides a wealth of potentially useful information. The data convincingly demonstrate in the HAP1 cell line that the MTF2-PRC2 complex sustains the effects of palbociclib (Figure 4), methylates H3K27 in CpG-rich promoters (Figure 5), and represses Cyclin D expression (Figure 6). These results could be of great interest to those studying cell-cycle control, resistance mechanisms to therapeutic cell-cycle inhibitors, and chromatin regulation and gene expression.</p><p>There are several weaknesses that limit the overall quality and potential impact of the study. First, none of the results from the colchicine and camptothecin screens (Figures 1 and 2) are experimentally validated, which lessens the rigor of those data and conclusions. Second, all experiments validating and further exploring results from the palbociclib screen are restricted to the Hap1 cell line, so the reproducibility and generality of the results are not established. While it is reasonable to perform the initial screen to generate hypotheses in the Hap1 line, other cancer and non-transformed lines should be used to test further the validity of conclusions from data in Figures 4-6. Third, conclusions drawn from data in Figures 3D and 4D are not fully supported by the experimental design or results. Finally, there have been other similar chemogenetic screens performed with palbociclib, most notably the study described by Chaikovsky et al. (PMID: 33854239). Results here should be compared and contrasted to other similar studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestions regarding our manuscript. While the genes recovered as mediating cellular responses to camptothecin and colchicine was never confirmed following our chemogenetic screens, we felt our primary findings were in the area of palbociclib resistance and decided focus our follow-up investigations on genes. We included the results camptothecin and colchicine chemogenetic screens as confirmation of the specificity of PRC2 mutation resulting in resistance to palbociclib (Fig. 4C) and for others in the community to use as a resource for future investigations. We have also clarified our results for Figure 3D and 4D in our revised manuscript, as well as included additional plots of these results (Fig. S1DS1F). And, with our resubmitted manuscript, we believe we have addressed their concern of the generality of our results by demonstrating our primary finding that MTF2 regulates D-type cyclins in additional cell lines other than HAP1. We feel these results indicate that while not “general”, there are additional cellular contexts that our main result holds true. In line with this, and to address how our chemogenetic screens fits into the landscape of previous studies, including Chaikosvsky et al., we have included the following lines to our discussion: “Additionally, other chemogenetic screens utilizing palbociclib and have not identified that inactivation of PRC2 components as either enhancing or reducing palbociclib-induced proliferation defects, suggesting that PRC2 mutation is neutral in the cell lines studied. These observations not only underscore the context-dependent ramifications of mutation of these PRC2 complex members, but also may help inform the context in which CDK4/6 inhibitors are most efficacious.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) &quot;We found that only thirteen and twenty genes resulted in sensitivity or resistance, respectively, in every conditions tested and were deemed non-specific and excluded from any further analysis (see Table S2).&quot; It's unclear to me why these genes were deemed 'nonspecific'. Are these genes functionally important for the general exclusion of xenobiotic molecules?</p></disp-quote><p>By this, we simply meant that these effects were not specific to one condition. Such genes could affect drug half-life or a general stress response, but are less likely to have functions directly tied to the pathway targeted by a drug than are genes whose loss affects only one condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) &quot;Given that increased CCND1 levels is sufficient to drive increased CDK4/6 kinase activity, upregulation of these D-type cyclins is likely to be a significant contributor to the palbociclib resistance in MTF2∆ cells.&quot; It's unclear to me what is the basis for this statement. This is only true if there is free CDK4/6. If CDK4/6 is already fully occupied by D-type cyclins, then increased CCND1 levels would not be expected to have an effect.</p></disp-quote><p>While we anticipated that increased levels of CCND1 would result in more CDK4/6-Dtype association, we now demonstrate in the new Figure S5F that there is more CCND1 in complex with CDK6 in both SUZ12∆ and MTF2∆ cell lines. Furthermore, we able to show in Figure S5G that overexpression of D-type cyclins results in resistant to palbociclib-induced proliferation defects in HAP1 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The description of the results is very confusing in places, especially regarding &quot;resistance&quot; versus &quot;sensitivity&quot; genes. For example: &quot;CCNE1, CDK6, CDK2, CCND2 and CCND1, all of which are integral to promoting the G1/S phase transition, ranked as the 2nd, 24th, 27th, 29th and 46th most important genes for palbociclib resistance, respectively (Figures 1F and 1G). CCND1 and CCND2 bind either CDK4 or CDK6, the molecular targets of palbociclib, whereas CDK2 and CCNE1 form a related CDK kinase that promotes the G1/S transition.</p><p>Similarly, cells with sgRNAs targeting RB1, whose phosphorylation by CDK4/6 is a critical step in G1 progression, displayed substantial resistance to palbociclib.&quot; My reading of this paragraph suggests that disruption of the CDK6 locus is associated with palbociclib resistance - surely this is a typo and instead should have been sensitivity? Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have corrected this typo</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Sensitivity to palbociclib was enhanced in cells expressing sgRNAs targeting H4 acetylation, positive regulators of Pol II transcription, and regulators of the DNA Damage Response pathway (Figures 3A and 3B), although this sensitivity was much weaker than that seen with DNA damaging agents. This observation is consistent with long-term treatment with palbociclib inducing DNA damage, as has been suggested by a number of recent publications 65,66.&quot; This is also consistent with recent work on Cdk7 inhibitors (Wilson et al. Mol Cell 2023), as Cdk7 inhibition is expected to affect both CDK1/2/4/6 activities and Pol II transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this observation to our attention and we have added this citation to this passage in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 3D - would it not make sense to plot the data such that palbo concentration is on the x-axis? It is also difficult to interpret since the data are normalized to starting &quot;% proliferation&quot; at the indicated palbo treatment, when it is likely that % proliferation changes significantly with palbo concentration. Indeed, this is the graphing format used for a later figure (Figure 4D). The data with rotenone suggests palbo antagonizes rotenone-mediated reduction in proliferation. But it's unclear to me whether the graph shows the converse - that rotenone treatment modulates palbo-induced cell cycle arrest.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer is correct about the fact that increasing doses of palbociclib in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation do indeed have an effect on proliferation. However, it is helpful to normalize proliferation values to each initial dose of palbociclib and then compare this to the different oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors treatment combinations. To illustrate that the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors do indeed antagonize palbociclib-induced proliferation defects, we have now included the data graphed as each oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor vs palbociclib as Supplemental Figures S1D-S1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The highest concentration of GSK126 tested (5µM) does not appear to confer resistance, but perhaps this is due to off-target effects or cytotoxicity?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that at the highest doses of dose of GSK126, low doses of palbociclib do not confer resistance to palbociclib. However, higher doses do appear to have this effect. We have included a statement in our results section to address this reviewer’s observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Disruption of Emi1 leads to resistance (Figure 1F, FZR1), yet overexpression induces resistance (Mouery et al. bioRxiv 2023).

I would suggest testing the resistance to Palbociclib in several additional cell lines, where MTF2 and JARID2 are deleted. If the conclusion can be generalized, one would expect that the differential role of MTF2 versus JARID2 can be confirmed in more cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>While the PRC2.1-dependent repression of D-type cyclins does not appear to be general, we have now demonstrated in Figures 5SE and 6F that there are multiple different cellular contexts in which our observations are consistent. Specifically, we demonstrate that GSK126 causes upregulation of CCND1 in both immortalized nontumor cells (COS7 cells) and in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Moreover, in both cases we showed that this effect is PRC2.1-dependent, as shRNA knockdown of MTF2 increases expression of CCND1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In addition, it may be attractive to make use of publicly available RNA-seq data of MTF2 and JARID2 knockout/down cells, to investigate the generality of the finding that PRC2.1 regulates CCND1 and CCND2.</p></disp-quote><p>While it would be useful to address this issue, Figure S5E demonstrates that the repression of D-type cyclin expression by PRC2.1 is context dependent. Furthermore, prior to identifying the lines shown in Figure 6F and 5SE, we were not aware of which lines to focus our investigations on. However, we have now demonstrated a few cellular contexts in which either chemical inhibition of PRC2 or knockdown of MTF2 results in de-repression of CCND1 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) At a bare minimum the authors should strongly discuss the limitations of the study, and tone down the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We would agree with this based upon the data in the original submitted manuscript, however, now that we have shown that this effect is more general, this is less critical.

In several places, the scientific logic motivating an experiment is confusing, and there are several hypotheses and conclusions that seem opposite from what the data are suggesting. Some aspects of the figures were also unclear. Specific examples include the following:</p><p>(1) Last sentence of abstract : &quot;Our results demonstrate a role for PRC2.1, but not PRC2.2, in promoting G1 progression.&quot; Data show that knockout of PRC2.1 components promotes G1 progression through upregulation of CycD, so the conclusion here is the opposite.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this error. We have now changed this to “in antagonizing G1 progression”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the second paragraph of the results, CCNE1, CDK2, etc are described as scoring high for palbociclib resistance, but those genes scored as sensitizing. Also, in that paragraph, it is described that a drug is sensitizing cells to loss of a gene, which seems like incorrect logic. It should be clarified that knock-out of a gene either sensitizes or desensitizes cells to the drug.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this error. We have now corrected it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the motivation for the experiment in Figure 3D, it is written: &quot;we asked whether chemical inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation could rescue sensitivity to palbociclib&quot;. Considering that knock-out of genes that mediate oxidative phosphorylation confer resistance to palbociclib, it is confusing why it was expected that chemical inhibitors would restore sensitivity.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry if the original wording was confusing. We have now changed this to “combined inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and CDK4/6 activity mutually rescue the proliferation defect imposed by agents targeting the other process”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) If the intention of Figure 3D is to test the hypothesis that chemical inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation modulates sensitivity to palbociclib, the clarity of Figure 3D would be improved if data were shown such that palbociclib concentration is on the x-axis and the different curves are different drug concentrations.</p></disp-quote><p>It appears that there is some mutual suppression, which inhibition of each process rescues cells partly from inhibition of the other.

There is little evidence supporting this claim that is broadly applicable. For example, data in Figure 4G show small and not demonstrable significant differences in G1 and S phase populations in the mock experiments. Also, experiments in other cells are needed to support the rigor and generality of the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Our chemogenetic screen and competitive proliferation assay data in Figure 4A, 4C and 4E support the conclusion that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 play opposing roles in G1 progression. Furthermore, we have repeated the initial BrdU incorporation experiments shown in Figure 4G and have been able to demonstrate that JARID2∆ cells do indeed display a significant decrease of cells entering into S-phase when treated with palbociclib. Most importantly, in the Figures 6D and 6E we show additional cell lines where this is the case.
