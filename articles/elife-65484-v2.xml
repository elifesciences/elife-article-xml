ribosomes. Therefore, it is important to understand whether failures in the mitochondrial uptake of these nuclear-encoded proteins can cause proteotoxic stress and identify response mechanisms that may counteract it. Here, we report that upon impairments in mitochondrial protein import, high-risk precursor and immature forms of mitochondrial proteins form aberrant deposits in the cytosol. These deposits then cause further cytosolic accumulation and consequently aggregation of other mitochondrial proteins and disease-related proteins, including α-synuclein and amyloid β. This aggregation triggers a cytosolic protein homeostasis imbalance that is accompanied by specific molecular chaperone responses at both the transcriptomic and protein levels. Altogether, our results provide evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction, specifically protein import defects, contributes to impairments in protein homeostasis, thus revealing a possible molecular mechanism by which mitochondria are involved in neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd><kwd>chaperones</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>metastable proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001870</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Polish Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Research Agendas programme &quot;Regenerative Mechanisms for Health&quot;

The majority of mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and need to be actively transported to mitochondria, a process that occurs via a sophisticated system that involves protein translocases and sorting machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calvo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morgenstern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pfanner et al., 2019</xref>). The consequences of mitochondrial protein import defects on cellular proteostasis can be severe, and currently some response mechanisms are identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Izawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martensson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Priesnitz and Becker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poveda-Huertes et al., 2020</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction is closely associated with neurodegenerative disorders, and such mitochondrial defects as aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, increases in reactive oxygen species, electron transport chain inhibition, and impairments in endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria tethering are well-described pathological markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabral-Costa and Kowaltowski, 2020</xref>). Still unknown, however, is whether mitochondrial defects appear as a consequence of neurodegeneration, whether they contribute to it, or whether both processes occur. Disease-related proteins can interfere with mitochondrial import and the further processing of imported proteins within mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cenini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Maio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mossmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vicario et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, aggregated proteins can be imported into mitochondria where they can be either cleared or sequestered in specific deposit sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruderek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sorrentino et al., 2017</xref>). However, the reverse aspect of the way in which mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondrial import defects, contributes to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases remains elusive. One possible mechanism may occur through alterations of cellular homeostasis as mitochondrial dysfunction can affect it through multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreasson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun and Westermann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escobar-Henriques et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Impairments in mitochondrial protein import and mitochondrial import machinery overload result in the accumulation of mitochondria-targeted proteins in the cytosol and stimulation of mitoprotein-induced stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). These findings raise the issue of whether the accumulation of mistargeted mitochondrial proteins contributes to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, unknown are whether mitoprotein-induced stress is a general response to precursor proteins that globally accumulate in the cytosol and whether a subset of mitochondrial precursor proteins pose particularly difficult challenges to the protein homeostasis system and consequently contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mohanraj et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of a transcriptional signature of Alzheimer’s disease supports the notion that there is a subset of mitochondrial proteins that is more dangerous than others for the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciryam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kundra et al., 2017</xref>). These studies have shown that specific mitochondrial proteins that are functionally related to oxidative phosphorylation are transcriptionally downregulated in Alzheimer’s disease. In the present study, we investigated why these proteins are downregulated. We hypothesized that this need arises from the potential supersaturation of these proteins, which makes them prone to aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciryam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kundra et al., 2017</xref>). Our results showed that when some of these mitochondrial proteins remain in the cytosol because of mitochondrial protein import insufficiency, they formed insoluble aggregates that disrupted protein homeostasis. These proteins triggered a prompt-specific molecular chaperone response that aimed to minimize the consequences of protein aggregation. However, when this rescue mechanism was insufficient, these aggregates stimulated the cytosolic aggregation of other mitochondrial proteins and led to the downstream aggregation of non-mitochondrial proteins. Our findings indicate that metastable mitochondrial proteins can be transcriptionally downregulated during neurodegeneration to minimize cellular protein homeostasis imbalance that is caused by their mistargeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Metastable mitochondrial precursor proteins can aggregate in the cytosol</title><p>The analysis of a transcriptomic signature of Alzheimer’s disease identified oxidative phosphorylation as a pathway that is metastable and downregulated in the human central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciryam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kundra et al., 2017</xref>). This observation suggests that a group of mitochondrial proteins might be dangerous for cellular protein homeostasis because of their poor supersaturation and hence solubility at cellular concentrations. From the list of genes that were simultaneously downregulated and metastable in Alzheimer’s disease patients, we selected all genes that encode mitochondrial proteins. Next, we identified genes that encode proteins that have homologs in yeast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Based on the yeast homolog sequence, we generated FLAG-tagged constructs that were expressed under control of the copper-inducible promoter (CUP1). We then established a multi-centrifugation step assay to assess whether these proteins exceed their critical concentrations and become supersaturated when overproduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vecchi et al., 2020</xref>), thereby acquiring the ability to aggregate during their trafficking to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We followed a FLAG peptide signal to determine whether the protein was present in the soluble (S<sub>125k</sub>) or insoluble (P<sub>125k</sub>) fraction. We found that the β and g subunits of mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase (Atp2 and Atp20, respectively) were present in the insoluble fraction, indicating that they formed high-molecular-weight deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We made a similar observation for Rieske iron-sulfur ubiquinol-cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase (Rip1). Rip1 and subunit VIII of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase complex IV (Cox8) had entirely insoluble precursor (p) forms, whereas the mature (m) forms were partially insoluble (the p form of the protein is larger and migrates on the gel above the m form; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the mature forms of subunit VIII of ubiquinol cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase complex III (Qcr8), core subunit of the ubiquinol-cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase complex (Cor1), and subunit β of the mitochondrial processing protease (MPP; Mas1) were partially insoluble. Only subunit VIb of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (Cox12) and subunit 6 of ubiquinol cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase complex (Qcr6) were mainly present in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, the tendency to aggregate and its harmful consequences correlated well with growth defects of yeast transformants that overexpressed mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We observed that the higher amount of an overproduced protein in the insoluble fraction correlated with a greater increase in lethality. This difference was still present under heat shock conditions of 37°C, indicating that the general molecular chaperone response that was associated with an increase in temperature did not compensate for the observed changes for Atp2, Cox8, or pRip1 and could only partially compensate for Cox12 and Atp20.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Supersaturated nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins aggregate in the cytosol.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SDS-PAGE analysis of aggregation assay fractions of WT yeast cells that overexpressed Atp2<sub>FLAG</sub>, Atp20<sub>FLAG</sub>, Cox8<sub>FLAG</sub>, pRip1<sub>FLAG</sub>, Qcr8<sub>FLAG</sub>, Cor1<sub>FLAG</sub>, Mas1<sub>FLAG</sub>, Cox12<sub>FLAG</sub>, and Qcr6<sub>FLAG</sub> for 3 hr when 2% galactose with 0.1% glucose was used as the carbon source.

Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>), cells that were treated with the chemical uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP) had a compromised mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) electrochemical potential and protein import failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Laan et al., 2010</xref>). To observe import defects without prompting negative consequences of CCCP (e.g., autophagy), the treatment time was limited to 30 min. Perturbations of IM potential resulted in the accumulation of p forms of Rip1 (pRip1), similar to when the full precursor form of Rip1 was overproduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We also extended the analysis of p forms of other proteins for which antibodies were available and allowed p form detection, namely mitochondrial matrix superoxide dismutase (Sod2) and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 1 (Mdh1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The accumulation of pRip1, the p form of Sod2 (pSod2), and the p form of Mdh1 (pMdh1) increased as CCCP concentrations increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Next, an aggregation assay was performed to assess the fate of precursor mitochondrial proteins under conditions of chemical impairments in mitochondrial import. pRip, pSod2, and pMdh1 were present in the pellet fractions, demonstrating that even without overproduction they formed insoluble aggregates in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

For that purpose, we analyzed the effect of heat shock individually on wild-type <italic>pam16</italic> (referred to as <italic>WT</italic>) and the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant. For WT, the increase in temperature resulted in a consistent drop in the amount of up- and downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). For the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant, the number of up- and downregulated genes was nearly constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting an unchanging need for adaptation. To determine the function of genes whose expression changed in response to the temperature shift, we performed KEGG enrichment analysis for WT and the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant. In both cases, we observed the upregulation of genes that are associated with ribosomes and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Unsurprisingly, the longer exposure of <italic>pam16-3</italic> yeast cells to 37°C also affected metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we studied effects of <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutations alone. For each heat shock time, <italic>pam16-3</italic> was compared with WT at the same time of exposure to 37°C. With regard to mitochondrial defects, the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutation had a stronger effect on the transcriptome than the effect of pRip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on the KEGG analysis and as expected, oxidative phosphorylation-, metabolic pathway-, and citrate cycle-related genes were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). More than half of the genes that were affected encode mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morgenstern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also tested whether any groups of genes had related functions but were not enriched in the KEGG analysis. We analyzed all genes that passed a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off and were non-mitochondrial. From this list, we selected genes for which we could identify at least 10 that shared similar functions. Based on this analysis, we noticed that a group of genes that encode molecular chaperones was upregulated in the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We observed the upregulation of <italic>HSP82</italic> and <italic>SSA4</italic>, which were also upregulated in the case of pRip1 overexpression. We also observed the upregulation of other molecular chaperone genes, including <italic>SNO4</italic>, <italic>HSP26</italic>, <italic>HSP42</italic>, <italic>SSE2</italic>, <italic>HSP12</italic>, <italic>HSP32</italic>, <italic>HSP104</italic>, and <italic>HSP33</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The effect of the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant could be both direct and indirect when considering the various pathways in which these molecular chaperones are involved. We used the temperature-sensitive <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant; therefore, we investigated the degree to which mitochondrial dysfunction exceeded the change that was attributable to heat shock treatment alone for each of these molecular chaperones. We compared changes in WT samples at both 19 and 37°C and matched them to corresponding changes that were attributable to the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutation (normalized to WT at the same heat shock time) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Our analysis showed that the molecular chaperone response in <italic>pam16-3</italic> went beyond the changes that were expected solely for the high-temperature treatment. The most pronounced changes were observed for <italic>SSE2</italic>, <italic>SIS1</italic>, <italic>HSP42</italic>, and <italic>HSP104</italic> at 4 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>, black arrows). These findings suggest that impairments in mitochondrial protein import that originate from defects of translocases had to some extent similar, but not identical, consequences as clogging the import sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boos et al., 2019</xref>). To compare the pRip1 data with the effects of the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutation, we investigated whether ABC transporter genes would also be upregulated. The analysis of significantly altered genes showed that as the heat shock time was extended, <italic>PDR5</italic> gene levels changed, as well as other ABC transporter genes, including <italic>PDR15</italic> and <italic>SNQ2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). <italic>PDR5</italic> is controlled by PDR3 transcription factor, the levels of which also increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gulshan et al., 2008</xref>). All of these genes were shown to be involved in the mitochondrial compromised protein import response, mitoCPR response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>). When we extended our analysis to other mitoCPR-related genes, we observed their upregulation beginning at 4 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Effects of the Hsp42 and Hsp104 chaperone response to mitochondrial import failure at the protein level</title><p>Next, we assessed whether the observed molecular chaperone upregulation would also be observed at the protein level. We used CCCP to stimulate mitochondrial dysfunction to avoid the temperature factor at initial screening. We monitored changes in protein levels for all molecular chaperones against which we had antibodies available at the time of the studies, including Hsp104, Ssa1, Ssb1, Ssc1, Hsp60, and Edg1. No changes were observed for most of them, but a significant response was observed for Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Notably, Hsp104 upregulation at the protein level was observed already after 15 min of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then tested whether Hsp104 was upregulated in response to mitochondrial import defects that were caused by the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutation, along with the established <italic>pam16-1</italic> and <italic>pam18-1</italic> mutants and mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly (MIA) import pathway mutations <italic>mia40-4int</italic> and <italic>mia40-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). For all of the mutants under permissive conditions (19°C; i.e., when only a mild protein import induction phenotype occurs), we observed the upregulation of Hsp104 at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This effect was still present at the restrictive temperature of 37°C, but the differences were less evident because of the activation of heat shock responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also tested whether Hsp42 would be upregulated at the protein level because its upregulation was one of the most prominent, based on transcriptomic data for the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant. Because of the lack of an antibody against Hsp42, we used a yeast strain with <italic>hsp42</italic> that was tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) that allowed us to follow Hsp42 levels by monitoring the GFP signal. We could only test the consequences of impairments in mitochondrial import that were caused by CCCP treatment in this experimental setup. Consistent with the transcriptomic <italic>pam16-3</italic> data, we observed an increase in the abundance of Hsp42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). After identifying Hsp42 and Hsp104 as two molecular chaperones that change significantly when mitochondrial import is impaired, we further examined their expression levels when metastable mitochondrial proteins were overproduced. Hsp104 levels were significantly upregulated upon such protein overproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Hsp42 levels were again analyzed in the background of the <italic>hsp42-GFP</italic> strain. Here, we also observed an increase in the abundance of Hsp42 for all metastable proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). In the case of pRip1, this response was not observed at the transcriptome level but was significant at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Thus, the upregulation of specific molecular chaperones in response to cytosolic mitochondrial protein aggregation could be achieved both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. In the case of <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant, the transcriptomic response involved a number of chaperone genes, whereas on the protein level we observed a significant response of the aggregate-related chaperones, Hsp42 and Hsp104. Interestingly, in the case of pRip1 overproduction, Hsp42 and Hsp104 were increased without any transcriptional stimulation, meaning that in the case of mitochondrial precursor aggregates the post-transcriptional response can be uncoupled from transcription.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cytosolic mitochondrial protein aggregation elicits a molecular chaperone response to restore cellular homeostasis.</title><p>( A-D) Hsp104 and Hsp42 are upregulated in response to impairment in mitochondrial protein import.

Both Hsp42 and Hsp104 are molecular chaperones that are involved in aggregate handling in inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balchin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mogk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mogk et al., 2019</xref>). To assess whether Hsp42 and Hsp104 upregulation is associated with a response to protein aggregation, we tested whether they can recognize metastable mitochondrial protein aggregates. We labeled FLAG-tagged metastable proteins with the Alexa568 fluorophore and followed its co-localization with Hsp42-GFP by confocal microscopy. We observed the strong accumulation of pRip1 in the form of inclusion body-like large deposits in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). These deposits co-localized with the GFP signals, indicating that Hsp42 sequestered pRip1 aggregates. Next, we reasoned that if these specific molecular chaperones were responsible for preventing the aggregation of metastable proteins, then we should observe a change in the amount of accumulated proteins when they are not present in the cell. In cells with <italic>hsp104</italic> deletion, we observed an increase in the accumulation of pRip1 upon CCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Thus, Hsp104 function was essential for limiting aggregates of mitochondrial precursors. Based on the aggregation assay, we detected Hsp104 in the pellet fraction at higher amounts than without CCCP treatment, suggesting that an additional amount of Hsp104 associated with aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). The lack of Hsp42 did not result in the upregulation of pRip1, pSod2, or pMdh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). However, the <italic>Δhsp42</italic> strain exhibited the significant upregulation of Hsp104, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that diminishes negative consequences of Hsp42 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L and M</xref>). Next, we tested whether the overexpression of Hsp104 and Hsp42 exerts beneficial effects when mitochondrial import defects are stimulated. Hsp104 overproduction resulted in lower levels of pRip1, pSod2, and pMdh1 upon CCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In this case, we again observed a link between Hsp42 and Hsp104 levels, in which higher levels of Hsp104 were associated with lower levels of Hsp42 in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The overexpression of Hsp42 did not have such an effect on pRip1, pSod2, or pMdh1, in which levels of p forms did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>). Finally, we tested whether higher amounts of Hsp42 or Hsp104 exert positive effects on cells that overproduce metastable proteins. Despite the beneficial effect of Hsp104 on precursor aggregate levels, we did not observe the rescue of growth defects that were observed for strains that expressed Atp2, Cox8, Cox12, pRip1, or Atp20 when either Hsp104 or Hsp42 was overproduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Altogether, our results show that the aggregate-related chaperone response is activated in the cell to handle consequences of cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial precursor proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mitochondrial protein import failure impairs cellular protein homeostasis</title><p>We next investigated whether the presence of metastable and aggregation-prone mitochondrial precursors initiates the accumulation of p forms of other mitochondrial proteins. We verified that this was the case for some of the metastable proteins. The overproduction of Atp2 and Cox8 resulted in the concurrent accumulation of other mitochondrial proteins, pRip1 and pSod2, in the total cell fractions, without any other stimulation beyond just the overexpression of metastable proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Atp20 overproduction also stimulated a significant increase in pSod2 but not pRip1 in the total cell fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). We hypothesized that differences in pRip1 and pSod2 accumulation for analyzed metastable proteins may reflect the differences: in the mitochondria import rates of these metastable proteins, in their relative cytosolic abundance, and in the protein sequence affecting their aggregation dynamics. Nevertheless, Rip1, Sod2, and Mdh1 co-aggregated with Atp2 and Cox8 metastable proteins in the insoluble fraction, based on the aggregation assay analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the greater abundance of aggregation-prone mitochondrial precursors resulted in the progression of mitochondrial protein import defect and consequently the larger cytosolic aggregation of mitochondrial precursors. This observation may justify why Atp2, Cox8, and Atp20 exhibited the most pronounced viability decrease, demonstrated by the drop-test results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, this process was partially counteracted by proteasome-mediated degradation. MG132-mediated protein inhibition led to an increase in the accumulation and aggregation of mitochondrial precursor proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial protein import dysfunction enhances impairment in cellular homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Metastable proteins cause the accumulation and aggregation of other mitochondrial precursor proteins.

We took advantage of α-synuclein (α-Syn), a model protein of neurodegenerative disorders. α-Syn WT and two of its mutations, A30P and A53T, are implicated in Parkinson’s disease. α-Syn WT and A53T, but not A30P, share a similar cellular distribution when they are expressed, which allows monitoring the formation of their aggregates in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Outeiro and Lindquist, 2003</xref>). Therefore, we used these two model systems that were tagged with GFP in our studies. Confocal microscopy was used to monitor changes in the average number of α-Syn WT and A53T aggregates per cell by following the signal of the GFP tag in response to impairments in mitochondrial import. Here, mitochondrial defects were stimulated by the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant. The average number of α-Syn aggregates per cell increased for <italic>pam16-3</italic> at a permissive temperature of 19°C for both α-Syn WT-GFP and A53T-GFP compared with WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1a</xref>). The increase in the average number of aggregates continued to grow for α-Syn WT-GFP at the restrictive temperature of 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The average number of α-Syn A53T-GFP aggregates was higher at 37°C than at the permissive temperature and did not significantly increase upon the mitochondrial import defect in the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This observation might be justified by the different morphology of WT and A53T α-Syn aggregates. The A53T mutation of α-Syn resulted in larger aggregates compared with α-Syn WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Outeiro and Lindquist, 2003</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we investigated the size of aggregates of α-Syn WT and A53T. We did not observe any difference in the average size of aggregates for α-Syn WT at 19 and 37°C for both WT and <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). In the case of α-Syn A53T, puncta were larger and better resolved than α-Syn WT puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) in both strains. We observed an increase in the average α-Syn A53T aggregate size for WT and the <italic>pam16-3</italic> mutant at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) when compared to 19°C. These findings suggest that for α-Syn A53T at 37°C the average number of aggregates did not significantly change after reaching a threshold and instead they were becoming larger as the aggregation progressed. Finally, we observed the higher accumulation of pRip at combined conditions of a <italic>pam16-3</italic>-stimulated mitochondrial import defect and α-Syn aggregation at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).

We used an RNA interference (RNAi) approach to silence <italic>dnj-21</italic> (a homolog of yeast Pam18) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The depletion of DNJ-21 stimulates the mitochondrial import defect similarly to the defect that is observed in yeast for <italic>pam16-3</italic>. We first monitored the aggregation of two model proteins in cytosol, red fluorescent protein (RFP) and GFP, in the transgenic strain that expressed RFP and GFP in the body wall muscle to assess whether the RNAi silencing of <italic>dnj-21</italic> in early adulthood in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is sufficient to stimulate their aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

Depending on how mitochondrial precursor protein aggregation is stimulated, the Hsp42 and Hsp104 upregulation is modulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, with a possibility of post-transcriptional stimulation being a dominant component. Thus, our findings of modulated aggregate-related chaperones upregulation further contribute to the transcriptomic response mechanisms involving chaperones due to mitochondrial import machinery overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boos et al., 2019</xref>), and mechanism of proteasomal protein degradation machinery upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). We show that stress responses that are induced by mitochondrial proteins, such as the response that was identified herein, mitigate the danger that is related to the aberrant formation of aggregates by metastable mitochondrial precursor proteins.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that mitochondrial import defects, triggered either chemically or by mutations of the TIM23 translocase, resulted in the accumulation and aggregation of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Consistent with the experiments that utilized the overproduction of metastable mitochondrial proteins, an Hsp42- and Hsp104-specific molecular chaperone response was also triggered in the cell with mitochondrial import defects. Additionally, the ubiquitin-proteasome system could mitigate this process to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The unresolved aggregation of mistargeted metastable mitochondrial precursor proteins eventually resulted in a chain reaction that led to the accumulation of deposits that were formed by other non-mitochondrial proteins. The collapse of cellular homeostasis resulted in an increase in pRip1 and α-Syn aggregation when mitochondrial import was impaired. More generally, we found that an increase in the aggregation of proteins linked to age-related degenerations under conditions of mitochondrial protein import dysfunction was a conserved cellular mechanism that was observed in both yeast and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found that the aggregation of α-Syn and Aβ increased because of mitochondrial dysfunction at the organismal level, accompanied by a decrease in worm fitness.</p><p>Several stress response pathways have recently been identified that counteract defects of mitochondrial protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Izawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martensson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Priesnitz and Becker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poveda-Huertes et al., 2020</xref>). Unknown, however, is whether they act independently or whether concurrent actions of all of them are required to secure balanced cellular protein homeostasis. The cytosolic responses, which are aiming to clear clogged translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the precursor proteins prior to their import through proteasomal activity, are accompanied by the aggregate-specific molecular chaperone response identified in the present study. In addition, recent findings suggest that some precursor proteins can accumulate within mitochondria to form insoluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poveda-Huertes et al., 2020</xref>). We postulate that when these defense mechanisms may not be sufficient to prevent mitochondrial precursor proteins aggregation in the cytosol, this aggregation will lead to the snowball effect, where aggregation of mitochondrial proteins stimulates further cytosolic aggregation of other proteins. These findings also indicate that precursor protein-induced stress responses are orchestrated to complement each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mohanraj et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest a model in which a cascade of events that is triggered by the cytosolic aggregation of specific metastable mitochondrial proteins contributes to the collapse of cellular protein homeostasis accelerating the aggregation of other proteins, including some that are hallmarks of age-related degeneration. Consequently, defects in mitochondrial function, which are commonly observed during aging and in neurodegeneration, trigger a vicious cycle of protein aggregation. This notion is essential for understanding cellular events that contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative processes. Overall, our results illustrate an important aspect of the interdependence of mitochondrial fitness and cellular protein homeostasis systems, with direct relevance to common neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial function. Our findings may suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions to cure or prevent diseases that are linked to protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cytosolic aggregation of mitochondrial proteins disrupts cellular homeostasis by stimulating other proteins aggregation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Chris Meisinger (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>– Section II results – The authors use a temperature sensitive allele so the results must FIRST be normalized to temperature shift alone and no results should be discussed in this section without this normalization.</p><p>– In the aggregation assays the authors also find mature, i.e. processed mitochondrial proteins in the pellet fraction (e.g. Figure 1A). These proteins seem to be derived from mitochondria (because this processing occurs only within the organelle). Is there an explanation for their presence in the pellet? Why should mature proteins aggregate? How efficient were mitochondria lysed before the spin in the aggregation assay? Could there still be intact mitochondria present, which would also pellet? A further important control here would be to use isolated mitochondria from the overexpressing strains and validate that the precursors do indeed not reside within the organelle. A separation of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions would also be helpful to clarify this.</p><p>Did the authors analyze also cells without overexpression of the precursor proteins to investigate the behavior of the endogenous proteins?</p><p>– Figure 1B: can overexpression of Hsp104 and/or Hsp42 rescue the phenotype here? Figure 3J. pRip aggregates increase in the absence of Hsp104. Then what about the effect of the absence of Hsp42? Overexpression of Hsp104 and Hsp42, in turn, suppresses pRip1 aggregate?</p><p>– A loading control is required in Figure 5E and in the suppl. of Figure 5 D-E. Also please explain how was Abeta quantified here.</p><p>Textual Changes</p><p>– Results section I – Define precursor as (p) once and then use consistently.</p><p>– Results section II – Pot1 is not a mitochondrial but rather a peroxisomal protein.</p><p>– Define MIA in line 210.</p><p>– Hsp42 and Hsp104, the only chaperones upregulated at the protein level, are specific for inclusion bodies – this warrants some mention/discussion. Also they have clearly been implicated in inclusion body and not in aggregate physiology and the correct terminology should be used (for example at later parts Line 327).</p><p>– Results section III – &quot;showed the most severe drop in lethality as presented&quot; I am assuming the authors meant drop in viability.</p><p>– The results in <italic>C. elegans</italic> should be moved into their own section. In this section it is not clear what GFP and RFP are fused to or whether they are simply soluble cytosolic molecules (Line 303).</p><p>– All Figures: Molecular Weights should be shown for all gels and in the figure legends please state clearly how many independent times each gel was repeated.</p><p>– Figure 1 – &quot;We selected these mitochondrial genes from KEGG 97 analysis&quot; - The reason for choosing these mitochondrial genes should be more clearly explained in the main text.</p><p>– Fig, 1B – &quot; The tendency to aggregate and its harmful consequences correlated well with growth defects of yeast strains under oxidative conditions when galactose was used as a carbon source.&quot; -- Growth conditions for each multi-step centrifugation step assay should be shown.

Building on previous publications that in Alzheimer's disease patients there is a transcriptional down regulation of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, they use the yeast homologues of these proteins to show the consequences of their cytosolic accumulation.</p><p>Specifically, they find at upon mitochondrial import defects (genetic or chemical) or upon overexpression, a subset of mitochondrial precursors, accumulate in the cytosol where they form insoluble aggregates. These, in turn, both trigger a cytosolic chaperone response as well as stimulate the cytosolic aggregation of other mitochondrial proteins. This also then causes the downstream aggregation of non-mitochondrial proteins including model substrates known to play a role in neurodegeneration. This had a drastic impact on cytosolic proteostasis. Nicely, they show that this is conserved to worms and employ two disease relevant models of aggregation – α synuclein and Abeta aggregation.</p><p>The topic of this manuscript is extremely important and the findings are interesting.

When it is compromised, precursor forms of mitochondrial proteins will accumulate in the cytosol as well as at the level of mitochondrial import channels. Previous studies including those from the authors' laboratory showed that, since accumulated mitochondrial protein precursors may form toxic aggregates, cells have a mechanism to respond to and cope with them properly. In this manuscript, Nowicka et al. analyzed the effects of compromised mitochondrial import in yeast and <italic>C. elegans</italic> by using mutations in import machineries, overexpression of mitochondrial proteins, and CCCP dissipating the mitochondrial membrane potential. They found that compromised mitochondrial protein import caused global changes in transcriptome and protein levels of especially, chaperones including Hsp104 and Hsp42, ABC transporters, and mitochondrial proteins, which may lead to growth defects (yeast) and decreased motility (<italic>C. elegans</italic>). The obtained results could offer a basis for future investigation and idea on the entire picture of the mitochondrial import defect response.</p><p>My impression is that the work, as it stands, is rich in interesting data and hints, yet it remains descriptive and therefore premature.</p><p>1) The authors used three different ways to impair mitochondrial protein import, which led to precursor accumulation. However, of course, the compromised level of protein import differs for the different methods, and therefore it is not easy to compare the effects among these three methods properly and to delineate the essence of the effects common to these three methods. Indeed the observed changes caused by different methods to impair mitochondrial protein import are not the same, which is at the moment, difficult to reconcile. Besides, the import defects caused by the temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations could pause the effects of temperature changes, as well, and there are some import defects even at permissive temperature, so that interpretation of the results is complicated, as the authors noted.</p><p>2) The authors analyzed the changes in transcriptome and protein levels, but the way to analyze them are not consistent with each other. The former analysis handles the entire transcriptome, but the latter analysis assesses a limited number of selected proteins. The changes in transcript levels are sometimes not so large, although statistically being significant. How to pick up &quot;the affected genes&quot; is not clearly described. The protein-level changes are not analyzed in a non-biased manner due to lack of available antibodies, which is understandable, but at least the reason for choosing some proteins should be clearly described. Besides, if the authors analyze only a limited number of proteins, I would like to see more detailed analyses of the proteins of interest. For example, 'the post-transcriptional changes' of some genes are presumably ascribed to the changes in degradation, but then this should be directly tested by cycloheximide chase experiments. The conditions to impair protein import are not the same between the transcriptome analyses and protein level analyses, which hampers the direct comparison between the two classes of analyses.</p><p>3) The most serious problem in this kind of analysis would be that it is not clear if the observed changes in transcriptome and protein levels are direct consequences of accumulated precursor protein aggregates or indirect effects. For example, the effects on e.g. ER chaperones like Jem1 should be indirect.</p><p>4) The apparent involvement of Hsp104 and Hsp42 in the response to accumulated precursor protein aggregates could be interesting, but no clue to the mechanisms of their induction and their specific (?) association with aggregates is obtained.</p><p>5) The logic of the text flow is sometimes hard to follow and the presentation of the figure panels is often not reader-friendly.</p><p>Specific points.</p><p>Figure 1 – &quot;We selected these mitochondrial genes from KEGG 97 analysis&quot; --The reason for choosing these mitochondrial genes should be more clearly explained in the main text.</p><p>Fig, 1B – &quot; The tendency to aggregate and its harmful consequences correlated well with growth defects of yeast strains under oxidative conditions when galactose was used as a carbon source.&quot; -- Growth conditions for each multi-step centrifugation step assay should be shown.

The only exceptions are experiments with overexpression of metastable proteins, and aggregation assay followed by MG132 treatment, where 2% galactose with 0.1% glucose and 2% galactose was used, respectively. Furthermore, based on these results, whenever the carbon source used allows for precursor forms observation their tendencies to form aggregates is similar, as observed for pRip1 in Figure 1B (2% galactose with 0.1% glucose) vs. Figure 1D (2% sucrose).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>pRip1 levels for the different sources of carbon used for growth conditions.</title><p>YPG – glycerol based, YPS – sucrose based, YPGal – galactose based, YPGal + 0.1% Glucose – galactose based with addition of glucose.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65484-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The growth conditions have been described in the Materials and methods section, and as suggested by the Reviewers, the carbon source type was added in the figure legend for each aggregation assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1B – &quot;When glucose was used as a carbon source, a gain of stress resistance was observed upon the overproduction of Atp20, suggesting protective mechanism stimulation&quot;.</p><p>– Can the authors state this only based on Figure 1B?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that results of this experiment are not sufficient to make such a statement.

Next, we identified groups of non-mitochondrial genes (&gt;= 10) that share a similar function/role in the cell based on UniProt, SGD and manual literature searches. We identified mitoCPR associated genes and genes coding for chaperones. The mitoCPR pathways were described in a paper Weidberg and Amon, Science 2018, thus we have focused on the genes coding for chaperones. This aspect was also particularly interesting in the context of our finding, showing that mitochondrial precursor proteins can form aggregates. We wanted to study the effects on protein levels of as many molecular chaperones as possible; however due to limited availability of antibodies, we could only focus on selected ones. In this group, the protein level changes were observed for Hsp42 and Hsp104. Therefore, we focused on these two molecular chaperones in the subsequent studies. We improved the description of the protein selection process in the text, including the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Since it is not clear if the observed changes in transcriptome and protein levels are direct consequences of accumulated precursor protein aggregates or indirect effects (For example, the effects on e.g. ER chaperones like Jem1 should be indirect) please word this more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>To be clearer about such a possibility we added the following statement: “The effect of the pam16-3 mutant could be both direct and indirect when considering the various pathways in which these molecular chaperones are involved.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3K-&quot;Hsp104 protein came in the pellet fraction in higher amount than when compared to the soluble fraction in our aggregation assay, suggesting that Hsp104 bound present their aggregates&quot; - However, Hsp104 can be found in pellet not in sup fractions even in the absence of CCCP.
