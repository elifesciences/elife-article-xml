A premier example is the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> H3K36 methyltransferase MES-4, which is essential for germline survival and development in offspring. How maternal MES-4 protects the germline is not well understood, but its role in H3K36 methylation hinted that it may regulate gene expression in primordial germ cells (PGCs). We tested this hypothesis by profiling transcripts from nascent germlines (PGCs and their descendants) dissected from wild-type and <italic>mes-4</italic> mutant (lacking maternal and zygotic MES-4) larvae. <italic>mes-4</italic> nascent germlines displayed downregulation of some germline genes, upregulation of some somatic genes, and dramatic upregulation of hundreds of genes on the X chromosome. We demonstrated that upregulation of one or more genes on the X is the cause of germline death by generating and analyzing <italic>mes-4</italic> mutants that inherited different endowments of X chromosome(s). Intriguingly, removal of the THAP transcription factor LIN-15B from <italic>mes-4</italic> mutants reduced X misexpression and prevented germline death. <italic>lin-15B</italic> is X-linked and misexpressed in <italic>mes-4</italic> PGCs, identifying it as a critical target for MES-4 repression. The above findings extend to the H3K27 methyltransferase MES-2/3/6, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> version of polycomb repressive complex 2. We propose that maternal MES-4 and PRC2 cooperate to protect germline survival by preventing synthesis of germline-toxic products encoded by genes on the X chromosome, including the key transcription factor LIN-15B.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>maternal effect</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cockrum</surname><given-names>Chad Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31GM125305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cockrum</surname><given-names>Chad Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM34059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strome</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The H3K36 and H3K27 histone methyltransferases MES-4 and PRC2 protect survival of the nascent germline in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> by repressing expression of X-linked genes, including the key transcription factor LIN-15B.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many critical events during early development are orchestrated by maternally synthesized gene products. Mutations in genes that encode such products in the mother can cause ‘maternal-effect’ phenotypes in offspring. These phenotypes are usually severe developmental defects. Maternal-effect lethal genes, which cause maternal-effect death of offspring, encode products that guide crucial events in early embryo development, such as pattern formation and embryonic genome activation (e.g., the PAR proteins in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, BICOID in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and Mater in mouse) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nüsslein-Volhard et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kemphues et al., 1988</xref>). Maternal-effect sterile genes encode products needed for fertility of the offspring. A few genes in this category encode proteins in germ granules (e.g., PGL-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and VASA in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nüsslein-Volhard et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rongo and Lehmann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kawasaki et al., 1998</xref>). Another fascinating set of genes in this category encode chromatin regulators, which are the focus of this article.</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> MES proteins were identified in genetic screens for maternal-effect sterile mutants, hence their name (MES for maternal-effect sterile) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capowski et al., 1991</xref>). MES-2, MES-3, and MES-6 assemble into a trimeric complex that is the <italic>C. elegans</italic> version of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2004</xref>). PRC2 is a histone methyltransferase (HMT) that methylates Lys 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me) to repress genes that are packaged by those methylated nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ketel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pengelly et al., 2013</xref>). MES-4 is an HMT that methylates Lys 36 on H3 (H3K36me), which marks actively transcribed genes and has context-dependent roles in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furuhashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rechtsteiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kreher et al., 2018</xref>). Although PRC2 and MES-4 catalyze opposing flavors of histone marking, the loss of either causes nearly identical mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capowski et al., 1991</xref>). Worms that inherit a maternal load of gene product but cannot synthesize zygotic product (referred to as <italic>mes</italic> M+Z- mutants) are fertile. Worms that do not inherit a maternal load or produce zygotic gene product (<italic>mes</italic> M-Z- mutants) are sterile due to death of nascent germ cells in early- to mid-stage larvae. In <italic>mes</italic> M-Z+ mutants, zygotically synthesized product does not rescue fertility, highlighting the critical importance of maternal product. PRC2’s roles in transcriptional repression and development have been intensively studied and are well defined across species, including roles in <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gaydos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaneshiro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delaney et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, how MES-4 ensures the survival of nascent germ cells is unknown and particularly puzzling.</p><p>One possibility for MES-4 function is that maternal MES-4 promotes expression in offspring of genes required for germline development. Support for this comes from analyses of mutants that ectopically express germline genes in their soma (e.g., <italic>mep-1, lin-15B, lin-35,</italic> and <italic>spr-5; met-2</italic> mutants), and as a result have developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Unhavaithaya et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cui et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petrella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carpenter et al., 2021</xref>). Concomitant loss of MES-4 from these mutants prevents ectopic expression of germline genes and restores worm health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cui et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petrella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carpenter et al., 2021</xref>). In wild-type (wt) early embryos, MES-4 and methylated H3K36 associate with genes that were transcribed in the maternal germline, regardless of whether they are transcribed in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furuhashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rechtsteiner et al., 2010</xref>). Focusing on H3K36me3, genetic tests showed that MES-4 strictly maintains pre-existing patterns of H3K36me3 and is unable to catalyze de novo H3K36me3 marking of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furuhashi et al., 2010</xref>); the other H3K36 HMT in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, MET-1, like H3K36 HMTs in other systems, catalyzes de novo H3K36me3 on genes in response to transcriptional turn-on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kizer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furuhashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kreher et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggested the appealing model that in embryos maternal MES-4 maintains H3K36me3 marking of germline-expressed genes and in that way transmits an epigenetic ‘memory of germline,’ a developmental blueprint, to the primordial germ cells (PGCs) of offspring.</p><p>Two findings challenge the model that MES-4 somehow promotes expression of germline genes. First, among <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- mutants, hermaphrodites (with two X chromosomes) are always sterile, while males (with one X chromosome) can be fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garvin et al., 1998</xref>). This suggested that the dosage of X-linked genes matters for the Mes-4 mutant phenotype. Second, profiling transcripts in the germlines of fertile <italic>mes-4</italic> M+Z- mutant hermaphrodites revealed that the most dramatic effect of losing zygotic MES-4 is upregulation of genes on the X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaydos et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the X chromosomes are normally kept globally repressed during all stages of germline development in males and during most stages of germline development in hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kelly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reinke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arico et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Strome et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tzur et al., 2018</xref>), and likely as a consequence, most germline-expressed genes are located on the autosomes. These findings focused attention on the X chromosome and raised the question – what role does maternal MES-4 serve to ensure that PGCs survive and develop into a full and healthy germline?</p><p>To investigate the role of MES-4 in nascent germlines, which critically rely on maternal MES-4 for survival, and to formally test the model that MES-4 activates a germline transcription program, we performed transcript profiling in dissected single pairs of PGCs and in dissected single sets of their descendants (which we term ‘early germ cells’ [EGCs]) from <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- mutant versus wt larvae. We asked whether the absence of maternal MES-4 causes nascent germlines to (1) fail to express germline genes, (2) inappropriately express somatic genes, and/or (3) inappropriately express X genes. We found evidence of all three of those effects in <italic>mes-4</italic> nascent germlines, the most striking of which was upregulation of many X genes. Our genetic analysis of <italic>mes-4</italic> mutants with different X-chromosome endowments from the oocyte and sperm demonstrated that upregulation of one or more X genes is the cause of germline death in <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- mutant larvae. This finding clarifies that MES-4’s role in promoting expression of some germline genes is not its essential role in germline development and focused our analysis on the X. We identified the transcription factor LIN-15B, an X-linked gene upregulated in <italic>mes-4</italic> mutants, as a major cause of X misexpression and germline death in <italic>mes-4</italic> mutants. Our analysis also revealed that the X genes misexpressed in <italic>mes-4</italic> nascent germlines are oogenesis genes, suggesting that MES-4 ensures survival and proliferation of nascent germlines by repressing a toxic oogenesis program. Performing similar tests of PRC2 (<italic>mes-3</italic>) M-Z- mutant larvae revealed that their nascent germlines upregulate many X-linked genes in common with <italic>mes-4</italic> nascent germlines, and that removal of LIN-15B restores the health of their germline, as it does for <italic>mes-4</italic> mutants. This study revealed that maternal MES-4 and PRC2 cooperate to ensure germline survival and health in offspring by antagonizing a key X-encoded transcription factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MES-4 promotes the expression of some germline genes in EGCs</title><p>MES-4 propagates an epigenetic ‘memory’ of a germline gene expression program during embryogenesis by maintaining H3K36me3 on genes that were previously transcribed in parental germlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rechtsteiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furuhashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kreher et al., 2018</xref>). A popular model predicts that delivery of this memory to offspring PGCs instructs them to launch a gene expression program that promotes germline proliferation and development. To test this model, we performed RNA-sequencing to determine whether PGCs from <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- (<italic>M</italic>aternal MES-4 minus and <italic>Z</italic>ygotic MES-4 minus) mutant larvae, which completely lack MES-4, fail to express a germline program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We developed a hand-dissection strategy to isolate single sets of two PGCs from L1 larvae within 30 min for RNA-seq library preparation. We identified PGCs using a specifically and highly expressed germline marker (GLH-1::GFP).

GPR-1 is a microtubule force regulator, whose overexpression in a newly fertilized embryo causes excess microtubule pulling forces on the egg and sperm pronuclei, which can prevent those pronuclei from fusing, in turn causing premature segregation of the maternal and paternal sets of chromosomes. In the two-cell embryo, the AB blastomere inherits chromosomes from one parent and the P1 (germline blastomere) inherits chromosomes from the other parent. Since the egg and sperm genomes each replicate in the one-cell embryo, all cells inherit two full genomes derived entirely from one gamete.

We hypothesized that maternally loaded MES-4’s role in transmitting H3K36me3 patterns from parents to offspring is essential for X repression and offspring germline development. If so, then transmission of parental chromosomes lacking H3K36me3 to offspring should cause their germline to die even if they received maternal MES-4. To test our hypothesis, we used the <italic>gpr-1</italic> genetic tool and the GLH-1::GFP germline marker to generate F1 adult offspring whose PGCs inherited two H3K36me3(-) genomes from the sperm and either did or did not inherit maternal MES-4. To completely remove H3K36me3 from sperm chromosomes, we used <italic>met-1; mes-4</italic> (M+Z-) double null mutant P0 fathers, which lack the activities of both H3K36me HMTs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, MET-1 and MES-4. We found that over half (57%) of F1 adult offspring had a full germline if their PGCs inherited two H3K36me3(-) genomes from the sperm and maternal MES-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, 0% of F1 adult offspring had a full germline if their PGCs inherited two H3K36me3(-) genomes from the sperm and did not inherit maternal MES-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This result shows that maternally loaded MES-4 is critical for offspring germline development, but that its critical role is not to transmit H3K36me3 patterns from parents to offspring.</p><p>Our finding that F1 offspring can be fertile if their germline inherited two H3K36me3(-) genomes and maternal MES-4 encouraged us to further test the role of H3K36me3 marking in germline development. One explanation for our F1 finding is that maternally loaded H3K36 HMTs can newly establish sufficient levels of H3K36me3 marking on inherited H3K36me3(-) chromosomes to repress X genes and promote germline development. If so, F1 offspring whose germline inherited two H3K36me3(-) genomes and cannot generate new H3K36me3 marking should be sterile. MES-4 cannot catalyze de novo H3K36me3 marking on H3K36me3(-) chromosomes, but the other H3K36 HMT, MET-1, can do so in response to transcriptional turn-on, like H3K36 HMTs in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furuhashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kreher et al., 2018</xref>). We tested whether F1 offspring whose PGCs inherited two H3K36me3(-) genomes from sperm and maternal MES-4, but not maternal MET-1, and therefore lacked the ability to catalyze de novo H3K36me3, can make a healthy germline. We found that removal of maternal MET-1 caused almost all F1 offspring whose PGCs inherited two H3K36me3(-) genomes from sperm to lack a germline. Therefore, maternal loads of both H3K36 HMTs are required for F1 offspring whose PGCs inherited two H3K36me3(-) genomes from sperm to make a germline. These findings suggest that newly established H3K36me3 marking of H3K36me3(-) chromosomes by maternal MET-1 and maintenance of that marking by maternal MES-4 are sufficient to maintain X repression in PGCs and promote germline survival. We speculate that de novo H3K36me3 marking of autosomes maintains X repression since most X genes normally do not turn on in the embryonic germline and therefore would not get marked de novo by MET-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spencer et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>LIN-15B causes X misexpression in the germline of <italic>mes-4</italic> M+Z- adults</title><p>MES-4 levels are low on the X chromosome(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rechtsteiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furuhashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaydos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kreher et al., 2018</xref>).

Several lines of evidence made the THAP transcription factor LIN-15B a strong candidate for causing X misexpression in germlines that lack MES-4. First, our analysis of publicly available LIN-15B ChIP data from whole embryos and larvae found that LIN-15B targets the promoter of many X genes that are repressed by MES-4 in PGCs and/or EGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Third, LIN-15B has been reported to promote expression of X genes in PGCs and adult germlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Robert et al., 2020</xref>).

The chromodomain protein MRG-1 is a candidate reader and effector of H3K36me3, and like MES-4 and PRC2, promotes germline development by repressing X genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujita et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takasaki et al., 2007</xref>). To test whether MRG-1 represses the same set of X genes as MES-4 and PRC2, we profiled transcripts from PGCs hand-dissected from <italic>mrg-1</italic> M-Z- L1 larvae. We found that <italic>mrg-1</italic> PGCs misexpressed 440 X genes, 225 of which were also misexpressed in <italic>mes-4</italic> and <italic>mes-3</italic> PGCs and/or EGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Our extended transcriptome analysis adds MRG-1 to the team of maternal regulators that ensure PGC survival and health by repressing the X.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated how a maternally supplied chromatin regulator protects germline survival and promotes germline health. We found that nascent <italic>C. elegans</italic> germlines (PGCs and EGCs) that completely lack maternal MES-4 misexpress over 1000 genes, most of which are on the X chromosome. We further demonstrated that X misexpression is the cause of germline death in <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- mutants. Removal of a single transcription factor, LIN-15B, reduced X misexpression in the germline of <italic>mes-4</italic> mutant mothers (<italic>mes-4</italic> M+Z-) and was sufficient to allow most of their offspring (<italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z-) to develop full-sized germlines. Intriguingly, <italic>lin-15B</italic> is itself X-linked and misexpressed in nascent germlines that lack MES-4, highlighting <italic>lin-15B</italic> as a key target for MES-4 repression. We favor a model where maternal MES-4 promotes offspring germline development by preventing LIN-15B from activating a germline-toxic program of gene expression from the X chromosome, a program that is normally activated during oogenesis in hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This work underscores how maternally supplied factors can guide development of specific tissues in offspring by protecting their transcriptome.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A new strategy to isolate small numbers of cells for transcript profiling</title><p>We developed a hand-dissection strategy to isolate in under 30 min pure samples of PGCs and EGCs from synchronous <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- mutants that completely lack MES-4 for transcript profiling. We identified PGCs and EGCs during dissection using the highly and specifically expressed germline reporter GLH-1::GFP. This strategy offers numerous advantages over the popular cell isolation strategy, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), because FACS often (1) does not yield pure samples, (2) takes several hours to perform, during which time sample integrity may decline, and (3) requires large numbers of worms, which may be hard to obtain for some mutants, like <italic>mes-4</italic> mutants. Due to the high variation of transcript abundance measurements between biological replicates generated from ultra-low quantities of RNA (e.g., single pairs of PGCs and single sets of two EGCs), we acquired and analyzed a high number of biological replicates (at least 11) for each genotype. Even so, our differential expression analyses between PGCs or EGCs still had limited power to detect misregulated genes. This encouraged us to use smFISH as an independent test of differential expression. Our smFISH findings matched our transcriptome findings for all genes tested, including two germline genes that were found to be expressed normally in <italic>mes-4</italic> PGCs, confirming that MES-4 does not regulate the expression of some germline genes. In sum, our hand-dissection strategy enabled us to significantly advance our understanding of MES-4’s role in the germline. We envision that it may be a useful method for other <italic>C. elegans</italic> transcriptomics projects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MES-4’s role in regulating germline gene expression</title><p>Our goal was to determine how complete loss of MES-4 impacts the transcriptome of PGCs as they begin to launch their germline program and before the germline exhibits declining health and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capowski et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garvin et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, we chose to profile PGCs from recently hatched <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- L1 larvae that were fed for 30 min. Because PGCs do not fully turn on their germline program until after L1 larvae have fed for ~1.5 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butuči et al., 2015</xref>), we also profiled EGCs from <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- L2 larvae that had fed for 20 hr. Thus, our samples flanked the major wave of zygotic genome activation in germ cells and enabled us to determine how loss of MES-4 impacts the transcriptome of nascent germlines. Maternal MES-4 binds to ~4100 protein-coding genes in embryos, most of which were previously expressed in the maternal germline and need to be expressed in offspring germlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rechtsteiner et al., 2010</xref>). Yet surprisingly, our transcriptome analysis found that lack of MES-4 did not impact the expression of many germline genes in PGCs and EGCs.

Maternal MES-4’s role in propagating gamete-inherited H3K36me3 patterns through embryogenesis is a clear example of epigenetic inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rechtsteiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kreher et al., 2018</xref>). By taking advantage of the <italic>gpr-1</italic> genetic tool, we demonstrated that inheritance of H3K36me3 patterns from parents is not required for offspring germline development.</p><p>Although the germline can survive without having inherited H3K36me3 marking from parents, it cannot tolerate additional loss of either maternal MES-4 or maternal MET-1 (the two H3K36 HMTs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>). We speculate that maternal MES-4 and maternal MET-1 perform cooperative, but distinct, roles to restore sufficient levels and proper patterns of H3K36me3 marking to chromosomes inherited lacking H3K36me3, to allow germline development. In this scenario, we envision that maternal MET-1 first catalyzes new H3K36me3 marking on genes co-transcriptionally during the first wave of zygotic genome activation in embryonic PGCs, after which maternal MES-4 maintains MET-1-generated patterns of H3K36me3 through early germline development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furuhashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kreher et al., 2018</xref>) to repress X genes and prevent germline death. De novo H3K36me3 marking on autosomes likely indirectly causes X repression in PGCs since most X genes are not transcribed in PGCs and therefore do not get de novo marked with H3K36me3. The importance of H3K36me3 marking is also highlighted by our finding that loss of the candidate H3K36me3 ‘reader’ MRG-1 (homolog of yeast Eaf-3, fly MSL3, and human MRG15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gorman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eisen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertram and Pereira-Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Joshi and Struhl, 2005</xref>) causes PGCs to misexpress a set of X genes similar to that caused by loss MES-4 and also causes death of the nascent germline. Our findings reveal the importance of H3K36me3 marking during early germline development, although that marking does not need to be inherited from parents.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The distinct roles of MES-4 and MET-1 in germline development</title><p>Unlike MES-4, MET-1 does not have an essential role in germline development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen and Horvitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kreher et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>met-1</italic> M-Z- worms are fertile when reared at standard 20°C growth temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen and Horvitz, 2007</xref>), and <italic>met-1</italic> M-Z- PGCs misexpress very few genes (this study). One explanation is that in <italic>met-1</italic> mutant embryos maternal MES-4 can propagate patterns of pre-existing H3K36me3 inherited from parents to PGCs. This predicts that maternal MET-1’s role in de novo H3K36me3 marking in response to transcriptional turn-on is not required so long as genes were pre-marked with H3K36me3 in parents. If so, maternal MET-1’s role would be essential only if PGCs did not inherit pre-existing H3K36me3. Indeed, we found that maternal MET-1 was essential for germline development when PGCs inherited chromosomes lacking pre-existing H3K36me3 marking for maternal MES-4 to propagate. This scenario raises the fascinating possibility that in the absence of MET-1 function, maternal MES-4 may be able to faithfully transmit pre-existing patterns of H3K36me3 across generations and through development indefinitely.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>MES-4 likely represses X genes indirectly by catalyzing H3K36me3 on autosomes</title><p>Since MES-4 binding and its HMT activity are very low across almost the entire X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rechtsteiner et al., 2010</xref>), it is likely that MES-4 regulates expression of X genes indirectly in PGCs. One possible mechanism for indirect regulation is that MES-4 generates H3K36me3 on autosomes to repel and concentrate a transcriptional repressor on the X chromosome(s). An attractive candidate repressor is the H3K27 HMT PRC2: in germlines, PRC2 activity is concentrated on the X chromosome(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2004</xref>), PRC2 represses a highly similar set of X genes as MES-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaydos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; this study), and loss of PRC2 causes maternal-effect sterility, like loss of MES-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capowski et al., 1991</xref>). H3K36me3’s role in antagonizing methylation of H3K27 is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schmitges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yuan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaydos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Evans et al., 2016</xref>). An alternative possibility is that H3K36me3 in germlines sequesters a transcriptional activator on autosomes and away from the X chromosome(s) as it does to the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) CBP-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cabianca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Georgescu et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>The X-linked transcription factor LIN-15B is a major cause of germline death in <italic>mes-4</italic> mutants</title><p>We identified the THAP transcription factor LIN-15B as a cause of X misexpression in fertile germlines that lack MES-4 (<italic>mes-4</italic> M+Z- mutant mothers) and a major driver of germline death in their <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- mutant offspring. Interestingly, <italic>lin-15B</italic> is itself an X-linked gene that is upregulated in <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- mutant PGCs and EGCs. This suggests that <italic>lin-15B</italic> is a critical target of MES-4 repression of the X, to allow germline survival. There are likely additional targets as removal of LIN-15B does not allow all <italic>mes-4</italic> M-Z- mutants to make full germlines. We tested whether RNAi depletion of 20 candidate transcription factors and HATs improves germline health in <italic>mes-4</italic> mutants; we found no hits other than LIN-15B. Recent studies found that upregulation of <italic>lin-15B</italic> also causes sterility in <italic>nanos</italic> mutants and <italic>set-2</italic> (H3K4 HMT) mutants and leads to upregulation of other X genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Robert et al., 2020</xref>). Those findings coupled with ours suggest that excessive LIN-15B activity causes germline-toxic levels of X-chromosome expression and that the germline uses multiple protective mechanisms to antagonize LIN-15B.</p><p>How LIN-15B causes X misexpression in germlines that lack MES-4 is unclear. Several studies have focused on LIN-15B’s role as a repressor of germline genes in somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petrella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, LIN-15B was shown to promote repressive H3K9me2 marking in the promoter of germline-specific genes in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rechtsteiner et al., 2019</xref>). In germlines, LIN-15B may activate expression of X genes indirectly, for example, by downregulating or antagonizing a repressor of X genes. Alternatively, LIN-15B may have context-dependent roles in gene expression, a well-known feature of many transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fry and Farnham, 1999</xref>), and may directly activate expression of X genes. In support of this model, our analysis of LIN-15B ChIP data from whole embryos and larvae found that LIN-15B is associated with the promoter of many X genes that are upregulated in <italic>mes-4</italic> nascent germlines. Clarification of LIN-15B’s mode of action in germlines requires analysis of patterns of LIN-15B binding in germlines, biochemical experiments, and identification of LIN-15B’s functional partners.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>MES-4 and PRC2 regulation of X gene expression in nascent germlines</title><p>Since the focus of MES-4 and PRC2 regulation in nascent germlines is X repression, we wondered whether MES-4 and PRC2 (1) perform the germline’s version of X-dosage compensation or (2) silence an oogenesis program, which is enriched for X-linked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ortiz et al., 2014</xref>). The goal of X-dosage compensation is to equalize X gene expression in animals with one X (males) vs. two Xs (hermaphrodites). The mechanism of X-dosage compensation in somatic cells of worms is well understood (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer, 2022</xref>). The mechanism in germ cells is currently not understood but is distinct from the mechanism used in somatic cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Strome et al., 2014</xref>). X-dosage compensation typically acts in either the 1X or 2X sex. Notably, the fertility of <italic>mes-4</italic> mutant worms is less dependent on the absolute number of X chromosomes in the germline than on whether the X(s) was inherited from the oocyte or sperm: 1X germlines with an X<sup>oo</sup> are typically sterile while 1X germlines with an X<sup>sp</sup> are typically fertile, and 2X germlines with one or two X<sup>oo</sup> are sterile while 2X germlines with two X<sup>sp</sup> can be fertile. Instead of MES-4 and PRC2 performing X-dosage compensation, we favor the view that they prevent misexpression of an oogenesis program, which is enriched for genes on the X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ortiz et al., 2014</xref>). First, 60% of X genes upregulated in mutant PGCs and/or EGCs are oogenesis genes. Second, LIN-15B, a key X target of MES-4 and PRC2 repression, is an oogenesis gene and binds to the promoters of many other X-linked oogenesis genes. Third, upregulation of LIN-15B in <italic>nanos</italic> mutant germlines causes misexpression of oogenesis genes and death of nascent germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Since the oocyte-inherited X chromosome has a history of expression of oogenesis genes, it may be prone to turning those genes on in, and thereby causing death of, nascent germ cells in offspring that lack MES-4 or PRC2. In support of this, offspring germ cells that lack MES-4 or PRC2 can develop into full-sized germlines if they inherit only X chromosomes from sperm, which were not turned on for oogenesis and have a history of repression. Together, our findings support a model where MES-4 and PRC2 protect germline survival and proliferation by silencing an X-linked oogenesis program that may interfere with the developmental fate of nascent germ cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>If MES-4 does not launch a germline program, what does?</title><p>An outstanding question is what launches the germline program in <italic>C. elegans</italic> PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Strome and Updike, 2015</xref>). MES-4 has been a prime candidate since it transmits H3K36me marking of germline genes from parent germ cells to offspring germ cells and so has been invoked as passing a ‘memory of germline’ across generations. Our findings argue against MES-4 being essential to launch a germline program since <italic>mes-4</italic> mutant PGCs can undergo normal germline development if they inherit X chromosomes with a history of repression. However, MES-4 does promote the expression of at least some germline genes in PGCs and their descendants. Other attractive contenders for specifying the germline fate of PGCs have been germ granules and small RNAs. Several studies demonstrated that <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ granules (aka P granules) protect germline fate but are not needed to specify it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gallo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Updike et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Knutson et al., 2017</xref>).

Much of the MATLAB code and strategy was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Raj et al., 2008</xref> to create our pipeline. A Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter was used to enhance the signal-to-noise contrast in smFISH images. Those filtered 3D images were thresholded by signal intensity to produce binary images. The ‘imregionalmax’ function from the Imaging Processing Toolbox in MATLAB was used to find and count regional maxima (transcript foci) in those binary images. To choose an appropriate signal intensity threshold for a 3D smFISH image, the number of detected regional maxima across 100 increasingly stringent thresholds applied to the image was plotted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Raj et al., 2008</xref>). In that plot, a range of thresholds that produced similar numbers of detected regional maxima was identified, and a threshold within that range was selected. Since threshold values were similar for all images within an image set (the collection of images acquired on the same day and for one probe set), an averaged threshold (across five images) was calculated and applied to all images in the set. Notably, threshold values were similar across different image sets. Manual counting of dots in a few smFISH images gave similar values as our semi-automated pipeline. To count regional maxima (transcripts) specifically in PGCs, we segmented PGCs in our smFISH images using Fiji. A 2D binary image mask of the PGCs was generated from a maximum-intensity Z-projection of the GLH-1::GFP image channel and applied to all Z-slices in the 3D smFISH images. The 2D binary image mask was made by first blurring the Z-projection using a large Gaussian kernel and then detecting edges in the blurred image. The number of PGC-specific transcripts was counted as regional maxima located within the segmented PGCs. Mann–Whitney tests were performed to compare transcript abundance between <italic>mes-4</italic> and wild-type PGCs. Numbers of analyzed PGCs per probe set per genotype (biological replicates) are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>.

Adult germlines were classified into one of three categories: (1) ‘full’ if its size was similar to that of a wild-type adult germline, (2) ‘partial’ if it had at least ~15 GLH-1::GFP(+) germ cells but was not large enough to be classified as ‘full’, and (3) ‘absent/tiny’ if it had &lt;15 GLH-1::GFP(+) germ cells. In rare ambiguous cases where a germline’s size was intermediate between categories, the germline was assigned to the category of the smaller size. To classify germline size for hermaphrodites, which have two gonad arms, only the size of the larger gonad arm was considered; in most cases, both gonad arms were similar in size. Two-tailed Fisher’s exact tests were performed to test whether the proportion of worms with a full germline is higher or lower in one genotype vs. another genotype.

RNAi constructs were streaked onto LB agar plates containing 100 µg/mL carbenicillin and 10 µg/mL tetracycline. Single clones were cultured overnight (14–17 hr) at 37°C in LB and carbenicillin (100 µg/mL). The following day, RNAi cultures were spotted onto 6 cm NGM plates containing 1 mM IPTG and 100 µg/mL carbenicillin (both added by top spreading), and then left to dry for 2 days at room temperature in the dark. To deplete both maternal load and embryo-synthesized gene product, we placed L4-stage larval mothers onto RNAi plates, grew them 1 day to reach adulthood, then moved those adults to new RNAi plates to lay offspring. RNAi was done at 20°C. Germline size was scored in first day adult offspring as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Spinning-disk confocal microscopy</title><p>All images were acquired using a spinning-disk confocal microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 confocal scanner unit, Nikon TE2000-E inverted stand, Hamamatsu ImageEM X2-CCD camera, solid state 405, 488, 561, 640  nm laser lines, 460/50, 525/50, 593/40, 700/75 nm (EM/BP) fluorescence filters, DIC, Nikon Plan Apo VC ×20/0.5 air objective, Nikon Plan Apo ×100/1.40 oil objective, and Micro-Manager software (1.4.20).

Whereas the upregulation of X-linked genes as the major cause of PGC death is well supported, it is less well supported that mes-4 and the Polycomb complex genes are not needed for turn on of germline gene expression or repression of somatic gene expression. Indeed the data suggests that these genes are needed for appropriate germline gene turn on and soma gene repression as defects in turn on and repression are clear in EGCs. Germline genes appear to be expressed in mutants, but levels for a significant number were observed to be reduced in mutants. The lower level of defects observed in PGCs may be due to profiling before the zygotic genome is fully activated. One might argue that the number of genes found to be downregulated is much smaller than the number of genes normally expressed in the germline, suggesting that most genes turned on normally. However, profiling gene expression in a very small number of cells may only have enough power to detect downregulation in genes that have relatively high expression. The authors could determine this computationally. More simply, looking at the wild-type expression level of the genes downregulated in mutants would be informative – i.e., are they predominantly in the top brackets of germline gene expression? If so, the author could gain power to detect downregulation of lower expression genes by binning genes by expression level (e.g, 10 levels) and then comparing expression in wt and mutants. The current analyses in this paper are not sufficient to conclude that mes-4 and the Pc genes are not needed for turn on of germline gene expression and repression of somatic gene expression. A bit further digging into their data might provide such evidence. If these analyses are not possible, the authors can edit the text to weaken the conclusion surrounding mes-4/Pc being not required for turning on germline genes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 358 – The text needs more explanation of how the gpr-1 &quot;genetic tool&quot; works.

The final sentence needs to mention the X explicitly or clarify what is going on regarding activation of autosomal genes as well. What is confusing is that the focus is initially on the X, but when the mes-4 and met-1 relationship is being studied in Figure 3b, it is not stated explicitly that the X does not have much H3K36me3 in wild type germ cells (at least until oogenesis is initiated in adults). So does the requirement for met-1 and mes-4 have to do with autosomal genes? Indeed, perhaps the model in figure 5 needs to specify the effect on autosomal genes and a role for MET-1 as well as for the X and MES-4 and LIN-15B. Even better would be to analyze gene expression in dissected EGCs from met- 1 and maybe also met-1;mes-4 mutants.</p><p>Line 488 – This sentence is hard to follow – needs re-writing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments</p><p>1. The authors clearly demonstrated that a major defect of mes-4 mutants (and polycomb mutants) is the upregulation of X-linked gene expression, and that this contributes strongly to their sterility. It is striking that reducing X chromosome dosage in the mutants rescues germline development and fertility (though not fully). This raises an obvious question, not mentioned by the authors, as to whether the mes-4/Polycomb system plays a role in X chromosome dosage compensation in the germline. It would be helpful for the authors to discuss this possibility.</p><p>2. A second conclusion made by the authors is mes-4 mutant PGCs and EGCs have normal turn on of most germline genes and normal repression of somatic genes. This conclusion is not convincing and needs further support. The PGC profiling in L1s appears to have been done at a time when the zygotic genome is not fully activated, which would have limited the ability to assess turn-on of germline gene expression. The zygotic genome of PGCs is predominantly quiescent in embryos and undergoes major activation in L1 PGCs after feeding. The timing of full activation is not known, but Butuci et al. 2015 showed that RNAP ser2 phosphorylation, a marker of activation, has not reached a full level by 1 hour post-feeding. Here the authors collected L1 PGCs 30 minutes after feeding, a time when zygotic genome is apparently not fully activated. It is also possible that some fraction of the RNAs detected at this time point are not zygotic transcripts, but rather are maternally inherited RNAs associated with P granules. Consistent with the possibility that low zygotic transcription at 30' post-feeding L1 PGCs may prevented the ability to detect defects in turn on of gene expression, the authors' profiling of L2 EGCs found many more changes than in early L1s, and indeed in Figure 1 figure supplement 1 they show a significant enrichment of germline-enriched genes among those downregulated in mes-4 (panel G) and a weaker but significant enrichment of the (autosomal) soma-specific genes among the upregulated genes (panel I). On face value, these results are in line with a role for MES-4 in promoting germline gene expression and inhibiting soma gene expression in early germ cells, in addition to the demonstrated role in repressing X chromosome gene expression. The authors should address these issues.</p><p>a) The timing of PGC transcriptional turn on and consequent ability to robustly detect mRNAs in wild-type needs to be determined to fully interpret the PGC and EGC profiling experiments. If a gene hasn't strongly turned on yet in wt, then it wouldn't be able to be scored as being down regulated in mutants. To address this, the authors could assess germline expressed genes by FISH, comparing signals in late embryos, 30' fed L1s, and EGCs. In addition to germline-specific or germline-enriched genes, the timing of germline expressed genes with non-enriched expression should be assayed, which should include ubiquitously expressed genes.</p><p>b) The striking high X-linked gene expression in early L1 PGCs and the later observed downregulation of germline genes and upregulation of soma genes in L2 EGCs suggests the possibility that these two regulatory processes may be independent and occur at different times. That is, the upregulation in X-linked gene expression in PGCs might have occurred in embryos, before the major turn on of gene expression in fed L1s, and subsequently there may be a defect in the normal turn on of germline gene expression and repression of somatic gene expression in larvae. The authors should conduct FISH experiments to determine the timing of the different defects.</p><p>c) The germline and soma gene sets used in this paper are small in number and limit the strength of the conclusions and ability to conclude whether most germline genes turn on normally in mes-4 mutants. The rationale for only assessing a minority of germline expressed genes and for limiting assays to germline genes with germline-specific (n=168) or germline-enriched (n=2178) expression was not clear. To better assess whether PGCs and EGCs have normal turn on of most germline genes and normal repression of somatic genes, the authors should analyse more comprehensive gene lists. To address whether germline genes are turned on normally or not, the authors should assess most germline-expressed genes, including ubiquitously expressed genes. Germline expressed genes in L2 EGCs can be obtained from Cao et al. 2017, from adult germlines in Serizay et al., 2021 and other sources. Genes expressed only in soma can also be found in these and other publications. It should also be tested computationally whether the potential sparseness of the profiling data has limited the ability to observe downregulation of individual germline genes to those with relatively high expression in wild-type. To gain power, the authors could bin germline genes of different expression levels and ask whether expression of the group is lower in mutants.</p><p>3.

Whereas the upregulation of X-linked genes as the major cause of PGC death is well supported, it is less well supported that mes-4 and the Polycomb complex genes are not needed for turn on of germline gene expression or repression of somatic gene expression. Indeed the data suggests that these genes are needed for appropriate germline gene turn on and soma gene repression as defects in turn on and repression are clear in EGCs. Germline genes appear to be expressed in mutants, but levels for a significant number were observed to be reduced in mutants.

We changed the wording in that section to be easier for readers to follow and added a new section to Discussion. Although MET-1 is not needed to generate a fertile germline, we thought it important to include it in our analysis of germlines that inherit H3K36me3(-) chromosomes, since MET-1 is the only other known H3K36 HMT in worms besides MES-4. As noted in Point #5 above, we discussed in more detail in our revised paper the relative roles of MES-4 and MET-1 in embryos: in embryos MET-1 can generate H3K36me3 de novo; MES-4 maintains H3K36me3 but cannot generate it de novo (Furuhashi et al., 2010). We speculate that in PGCs that inherit H3K36me3(-) chromosomes, when some transcription is initiated during embryogenesis (e.g. Kawasaki et al., 1998; Subramaniam and Seydoux, 1999; Spencer et al., 2011), MET-1 de novo generates H3K36me3 in a transcription-coupled manner, and MES-4 maintains new H3K36me3. Our results show that maternal provision of both activities is needed to rescue the health of <italic>met-1; mes-4</italic> mutant germlines that inherit H3K36me3(-) chromosomes. As mentioned above, we think that the important take-aways are that inherited H3K36me3 marking is not critical for germline development and that re-establishment of marking is important and requires both enzymes. Re-established marking may resemble the marking that is usually inherited and maintained by MES-4. Our model (Figure 7F) already discusses 2 indirect models of how H3K36me3 marking on autosomes may impact transcription of genes on the X. We modified our model panel to focus on oogenesis genes and to include those on the autosomes as well as on the X.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 488 – This sentence is hard to follow – needs re-writing.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>1.

Based on staining PGCs for elongating RNA Pol II, the exact timing of ZGA is probably by 1.5 hours of feeding and before the PGCs start proliferating (Schaner et al., 2003; Butuci et al., 2015). Before that major wave of ZGA, numerous papers have demonstrated that some transcription commences in PGCs during embryogenesis (e.g. Kawasaki et al., 1998; Subramaniam et al., 1999; Furuhashi et al., 2010; Spencer et al., 2011). We profiled PGCs isolated from 30’ fed L1s within 30-60 min after hatching and EGCs isolated from L2s after ~20 hrs of feeding. Our PGC samples likely precede the major wave of ZGA in germ cells, while EGCs likely follow it, so we essentially did the suggested “flank the ZGA” experiment. We observed upregulation of X-linked gene expression in both PGCs and EGCs from mutants (see Figures 1 and 2). We also observed that EGCs displayed reduced expression of some germline genes and increased expression of some somatic genes, which we now point out and discuss in the paper, as noted in Point #2 above and our expanded response to the Editor’s Essential Revisions (see Figure 2).</p><p>Our smFISH was done in L1s after 5 hours of feeding (but before PGC divisions commenced), so likely post-ZGA. The smFISH analysis of germline genes corroborated RNA-seq and showed that 2 genes that were well expressed in wt PGCs were similarly well expressed in <italic>mes-4</italic> PGCs (see Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The suggestion to perform time-course smFISH (in late embryos, 30’ fed L1s, and EGCs) would be incredibly labor-intensive, would only sample 1 gene at a time, and is beyond the scope of this study. Furthermore, it is known that some germline genes turn on in PGCs during embryogenesis (e.g. Kawasaki et al., 1998; Subramaniam et al., 1999; Spencer et al., 2011), so the timing of germline gene turn-on spans from embryogenesis to ZGA in PGCs.

To address whether germline genes are turned on normally or not, the authors should assess most germline-expressed genes, including ubiquitously expressed genes. Germline expressed genes in L2 EGCs can be obtained from Cao et al. 2017, from adult germlines in Serizay et al., 2021 and other sources. Genes expressed only in soma can also be found in these and other publications. It should also be tested computationally whether the potential sparseness of the profiling data has limited the ability to observe downregulation of individual germline genes to those with relatively high expression in wild-type.

For both PGCs and EGCs, we binned genes by their expression level in wild-type germ cells into deciles and compared gene expression levels between <italic>mes-4</italic> mutant and wild-type germ cells in each decile (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Indeed, downregulation was most pronounced in the top decides. This suggests that we lacked sufficient statistical power to call some genes that are low-expressed and have small fold changes down-regulated in <italic>mes-4</italic> PGCs or EGCs. We added a paragraph to the Discussion that speaks to our limited statistical power in identifying down-regulated genes and our application of smFISH as an independent test of differential expression for a few genes. For all genes tested, our smFISH findings corroborated our transcript profiling findings (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>To determine whether MES-4 promotes the expression of germline genes, we tested whether the numbers of germline-specific genes and germline-enriched genes in our set of DOWN genes in <italic>mes-4</italic> are higher than expected by chance<italic>.</italic> We chose those sets because they define genes whose products are likely more important to the germline than the soma. We added a more inclusive germline gene set to our analysis: “MES-4-bound genes”, which defines 4132 genes that are bound by MES-4 in embryos, most of which are germline-expressed (Rechtsteiner et al., 2010). Our findings for this gene set are similar to the findings for the germline-specific and germline-enriched sets (see Figures 1 and 2). We do not think it is useful to analyze the enrichment of germline-expressed genes (including housekeeping genes) in our set of DOWN genes in <italic>mes-4</italic>, because every DOWN gene qualifies as a germline-expressed gene (i.e. they are expressed in wild-type PGCs and/or EGCs). To test whether a somatic program is mis-expressed in <italic>mes-4</italic>, we aimed to analyze genes that are expressed in somatic cells and lowly or not expressed in germ cells. We evaluated whether genes in our soma-specific set and in 2 more inclusive “soma” gene sets (Gaydos et al., 2012 and Lee et al., 2017) are not expressed in germ cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We found that few genes in our set are expressed above background levels in PGCs or EGCs. However, many genes in the 2 more inclusive soma sets have high expression levels in our pure samples of dissected PGCs and EGCs. Therefore, while our soma-specific set has fewer genes than the other 2 sets, it more accurately defines soma-specific genes, and we prefer a more accurate than inclusive set for our analysis.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of the specificity of our soma-specific gene set and 2 other “soma” gene sets.</title><p>(A,B,C,) MA plots showing log2(average expression) versus log2(fold change) of transcript abundance for 20,258 protein-coding genes (circles) between mes-4 and wt PGCs.
