essential and major component of the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. They form a stable yet dynamic filamentous network extending from the nucleus to the cell periphery, which provides resistance to mechanical stresses. Mutations in keratin genes are related to a variety of epithelial tissue diseases. Despite their importance, the molecular structure of keratin filaments remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the structure of keratin 5/keratin 14 filaments within ghost mouse keratinocytes by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. By averaging a large number of keratin segments, we have gained insights into the helical architecture of the filaments. Two-dimensional classification revealed profound variations in the diameter of keratin filaments and their subunit organization. Computational reconstitution of filaments of substantial length uncovered a high degree of internal heterogeneity along single filaments, which can contain regions of helical symmetry, regions with less symmetry and regions with significant diameter fluctuations. Cross-section views of filaments revealed that keratins form hollow cylinders consisting of multiple protofilaments, with an electron dense core located in the center of the filament. These findings shed light on the complex and remarkable heterogenic architecture of keratin filaments, suggesting that they are highly flexible, dynamic cytoskeletal structures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>keratin filaments</kwd><kwd>intermediate filaments</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron tomography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_179418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medalia</surname><given-names>Ohad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5PO1 GM096971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Robert D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM140108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Robert D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Keratins assemble into tubular filaments with a central density and exhibit structural heterogeneity, which is reflected in alterations of the helical arrangement.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Keratin Intermediate Filaments (KIFs) are an essential component of the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells. KIFs are classified as type I and type II Intermediate Filament (IF) proteins, according to their sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Szeverenyi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bragulla and Homberger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Toivola et al., 2015</xref>). Keratins form a highly flexible and dynamic filamentous network in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Etienne-Manneville, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pora et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kölsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Robert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Windoffer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yoon et al., 2001</xref>). Their main known function is to protect the cell from external stresses by providing mechanical stability and ensuring the integrity of tissues through cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. Point mutations in keratin genes are associated with cell and tissue instabilities and severe diseases, termed keratinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Toivola et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haines and Lane, 2012</xref>). For example, the skin blistering disease Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS) is caused by point mutations in the Keratin 5 (K5) and 14 (K14) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jacob et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coulombe et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coulombe and Lee, 2012</xref>). A key to understanding the function of KIFs in both normal and diseased cells is to unveil the structural organization of the filaments.</p><p>Keratin proteins are composed of three domains: a highly conserved α-helical central rod domain, known to facilitate filament assembly, and intrinsically disordered head and tail domains. The latter are highly post-translationally modified and are regarded as essential for regulatory functions and filament stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wilson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parry and Steinert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chernyatina et al., 2015</xref>). Keratins are obligatory heterodimers, formed by the parallel and in-register assembly of an acidic type I and a basic type II keratin protein. Two dimers assemble into antiparallel tetramers, which can further align laterally and longitudinally to build mature keratin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steinert et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>). Longitudinally elongated tandem arrays of tetrameric subunits are termed protofilaments.</p><p>Although KIFs have been studied intensely for many years, details of their molecular architecture remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eldirany et al., 2021</xref>). On the level of keratin monomers and dimers, crystallographic studies have provided high-resolution insights into the organization of small regions of the central rod domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunick and Milstone, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eldirany et al., 2019</xref>) and molecular dynamics simulations have presented a 3D model of a complete K1/K10 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray et al., 2015</xref>). Four different modes of tetramer assembly have been identified by cross-linking studies, describing how higher order oligomers form during filament assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steinert et al., 1993</xref>). It is expected that filament assembly starts by the formation of A<sub>11</sub> tetramers, where the 1B domains of the rod of two adjacent dimers interact in a half-staggered, antiparallel arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>). Tetramers can elongate longitudinally by formation of A<sub>22</sub> interactions, where the 2B domains of adjacent rods overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>). Laterally, neighboring tetramers interact via A<sub>12</sub> bindings to form 10 nm wide filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>). However, little is known about the 3D high-resolution structure of mature keratin filaments. It is generally accepted that keratin filaments are helical assemblies consisting of multiple protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astbury, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crick, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crick, 1953</xref>), which form a cylindrical tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parry and Steinert, 1999</xref>). However, the exact number of protofilaments per filament and therefore the number of keratin monomers per cross section is still debated and may vary with respect to the specific type I/type II keratin pairs expressed. Mass-Per-unit-Length (MPL) measurements of recombinant in vitro assembled K8/K18 filaments have suggested that they are built from 16 to 25 monomeric protein chains in cross section, depending on the ionic strength of the buffer and the assembly time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrmann et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, MPL measurements of KIFs assembled in vitro from keratins extracted from human epidermis have revealed that the majority of them contain 13–16 polypeptides in cross section, with fewer numbers of KIF comprised of either 20–26 or 28–35 polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 1985</xref>). These variations have been attributed to structural polymorphism of KIFs and apparently occur by varying the number of protofilaments along and among keratin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 1985</xref>). In addition, there is a lack of consensus as to whether KIFs are hollow or filled tubes and whether they contain an internal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parry and Steinert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruce Fraser et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fraser and Parry, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Watts et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herrmann and Aebi, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here, we studied the structure of native cellular K5/K14 filaments by Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) and Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weber et al., 2019</xref>). Since the expression of keratin isoforms is variable and complex in cultured cells, we prepared a cell line expressing filaments composed of K5/K14 only and studied their architecture within cells that were grown and lysed on EM grids, that is ghost cells. This process avoids potential structural artifacts due to in vitro assembly of KIFs. Our cryo-EM analysis revealed the remarkably heterogenic nature of keratin filaments and uncovered changes in the diameter and the helical pattern propagating along the filament. Cryo-ET and analysis of filament cross-sections revealed that the K5/K14 filaments are composed of a hollow cylinder with an internal electron dense core. The wall of the cylinder is constructed of a ring of six protofilaments. Our results quantify the flexibility of keratin filaments and uncover the immense structural heterogeneity of individual K5/K14 filaments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of mouse keratinocytes expressing only K5/K14 filaments</title><p>Heterogeneity is a challenging problem that hampers structural determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheres, 2016</xref>). Thus, the occurrence of multiple keratin pairs in most epithelial cells hinders the structural analysis of keratin filaments in their native environment, due to intrinsic structural heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moll et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we set to gain insights into the architecture of cellular K5/K14 filaments. Therefore, we utilized the murine keratinocyte cell line KtyI KO K14, which expresses the K5, K6 and K14 proteins as their only keratin isoforms, and the only IF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Homberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). To reduce the keratin expression to K5 and K14 only, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to knock out the <italic>Krt6a</italic> and the <italic>Krt6b</italic> gene, which share 92.6% sequence identity (Materials and methods section). Although a small amount of wild-type <italic>Krt6b</italic> DNA was retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), immunostaining revealed that no filaments containing K6 assemble in the resulting K5/14_1 cell line, and therefore do not affect the structural analysis carried out in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We therefore conclude that the keratin filaments in this cell line consist only of K5/K14 protein pairs. A careful analysis of the KIF network after the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout procedure by confocal fluorescence microscopy indicated no obvious impact on the K5/K14 filament network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cellular K5/K14 filaments as revealed by light and cryo-electron microscopy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The murine keratinocyte cell line K5/K14_1 expressing only K5 and K14 filaments forms a complex KIF meshwork, as revealed by confocal immunofluorescence.

Additionally, highly bent keratin filaments are frequently detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We traced 65 of these highly bent filaments in cryo-EM micrographs and determined their minimal apparent persistence length (contour length upon 90° turn, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Keratin 5/14 filaments are able to undergo a 90° turn within 118.4 ± 39.2 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), similar to distances observed for nuclear lamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turgay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tenga and Medalia, 2020</xref>). These measurements were conducted only on the sub-population of highly bent filaments and not on the full range of shapes detected (e.g. straight filaments), as their varying behavior prohibited us to describe all of them with a single measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Block et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, some filaments undertake even 180° turns within a few hundred nanometers without breaking and change directions multiple times within the inspected field of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In agreement with previous in vitro assembled keratin analyses, the remarkable flexibility of keratin filaments supports their ability to maintain filament integrity even under extreme conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coulombe and Fuchs, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herrmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Köster et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Heterogeneity in filament diameter and helical pattern</title><p>To obtain deeper insights into the architecture of keratin filaments, we extracted 55 nm long straight keratin segments picked along filaments in ~1700 cryo-EM micrographs and subjected them to structural averaging by single particle data processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scheres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He and Scheres, 2017</xref>). A helical pattern that spirals along the long filament axis can be detected in several class averaged structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While several structural classes show a clear helical pattern, others reveal elongated, rather straight sub-structures without an apparent helical symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Transition regions between the two distinguished patterns can also be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, arrows). The mean diameter of keratin filaments, as determined by direct measurement of intensity line-profiles through the class averages, is 10.1 ± 0.5 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>). A mean intensity line-profile through a lateral average of the most populated classes defined the edges of the filaments as well as a central density peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The outer boundaries of the filaments show the highest electron density values and therefore are their most pronounced structural features (i.e. the filament diameter), while a central density peak with slightly lower intensity is also apparent. This analysis further revealed a subset of structural classes with a much larger diameter than the majority of filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Intensity line profiles of a thicker class (black asterisk) and a more frequently detected class (blue asterisk) indicate a 30% difference in filament diameter, 13.2 nm vs 10.1 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, the internal structure of the thicker classes diverges from the classes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Specifically, some classes reveal two distinct linear electron densities within the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, arrowheads), indicating a less dense packing of the individual protofilaments as compared to the compact classes. Others capture transitions between a thinner and a thicker region along an individual filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, arrows).

Using this approach, the helical pitch can be determined, which is an intrinsic parameter of helical assemblies and reflects a 360° rotation of the helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diaz et al., 2010</xref>). We found that the pitch of the helical pattern varies dramatically among different classes, ranging from ~132 Å to ~163 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Between these two extremes numerous distinct values for the pitch of the helical pattern can also be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). There are two possible scenarios that can explain a varying pitch distance: Either, a variable pitch is an intrinsic property of keratin filaments, which would add to the structural heterogeneity observed throughout this study, or the diverging pitch originates from filaments that lay tilted and not flat in the ice layer. Since keratin filaments are very flexible and form a 3D network in cells, we exploited the possibility that the different pitch lengths reflect filaments that are oriented out of plane. The projection of a tilted filament in our cryo-EM micrographs would therefore yield classes with an apparent shorter repeating pattern. In this case, the class with the longest pitch length would reflect the untilted filament, while all other repeating patterns would originate from different degrees of tilting. Based upon this reasoning, we tilted and projected the class with a pitch of 163 Å in silico and retrieved similar pitch lengths as seen in the real classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). A tilt of up to ~34° can induce shortening of the pitch length from 163 Å to 132 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). Therefore, tilting between 0° - 34° would explain the variations that were detected in the repeating pattern of the keratin classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). With ice thicknesses of up to ~300 nm and a minimal apparent persistence length of ~118 nm, this amount of tilting can be expected, and further analysis by cryo-ET revealed that even higher degrees of tilting are possible (see below). A helical pitch of ~163 Å agrees well with previous studies that suggested a pitch of ~162 Å for keratin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aebi et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parry et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Computationally reconstituting keratin filaments from the class averages</title><p>The 2D class averages allowed us to identify structural differences in 55 nm long keratin segments. To understand how these structural features are organized at the level of long keratin filaments, it was important to determine how the class averages are arranged along keratin filaments which are up to several hundreds of nanometers in length. For this purpose, we utilized a back-mapping strategy that permits the computational reconstitution of the original filament out of 2D class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kronenberg-Tenga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martins et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, every segment was represented by its corresponding 2D class image, which was inversely transformed, so that it matched the original orientation of the raw segment. Then it was plotted at the original coordinate position, where the raw segment was selected from the electron micrographs. In this fashion, we assembled the original keratin filaments made out of the respective 2D class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which were subsequently extracted and straightened. Since these computationally reconstituted filaments are assembled from class averages, their signal-to-noise ratio is drastically improved compared to the raw filaments.

Overall, they consist of patches of helical regions with clear repetitive patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, red, E), which are frequently interrupted by straight patterned stretches with less defined features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, yellow, E). The helical as well as the straight-line stretches are variable in length and frequency. While some filaments consist of mostly helical stretches, others are mixed or exhibit a mostly straight-line appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, the diameter fluctuates along a single filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>). For example, KIFs have regions of increased width up to 13.2 nm that often allow the identification of individual sub-chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref>), as well as thinner regions with widths down to 9.2 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>).

This indicates that individual filaments changed their tilt angle along the course of the filament and ran through different z-heights of the ghost cell volume. Helical patterns with different pitches, indicating different tilt angles, lie in close proximity along KIFs, where they appear to transition smoothly into each other.

This behavior is quite remarkable, as it was never seen in tomograms (n = 225) of cellular vimentin intermediate filaments, imaged within detergent extracted mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eibauer et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Analysis of cross-sections from cryo-EM micrographs and cryo-tomograms revealed that keratin filaments are cylindrical tubes, in which an internal electron dense core is found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). This finding agrees with previous studies, which predicted that keratins contain internal mass, but less than anticipated for a completely filled filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parry and Steinert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruce Fraser et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fraser and Parry, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herrmann and Aebi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Watts, 2002</xref>) and was previously reported for keratin filaments of the living layers of human epidermis and the stratum corneum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Norlén and Al-Amoudi, 2004</xref>). Moreover, we could identify individual sub-filaments, which form a hexameric ring structure in cross-section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Based on this geometry and previous literature, it is likely that the sub-structures represent tetrameric protofilaments and therefore the mature filament would be composed of ~six protofilaments to yield ~24 polypeptides in cross-section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parry and Steinert, 1999</xref>). This agrees with previous mass-per-unit-length analyses of epidermal keratins and keratins from simple epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 1985</xref>). To study this phenomenon in more detail, we analyzed the cross-sectional views detected in cryo-tomograms. We found that depending on the individual filament and tomographic slice, the number of visible protofilaments varies, which might indicate polymorphism, that is a variable number of protofilaments building the KIF. However, it might also be an imaging artifact originating from the low signal-to-noise ratio of individual sections, that aggravates the identification of the thin protofilaments. Nevertheless, the tomographic slices yielded some unique insights into filament arrangement. When following a filament in cross section through the tomographic volume, in certain slices densities of neighboring protofilaments seem to merge into one continuous structure, indicating that there are positions along the filament where the protofilaments are interacting so tightly that they could not be resolved individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Other positions reveal more than six protofilaments, which may reflect overlap regions between tetramers along the keratin filaments, yielding the impression of more strains, or filament regions containing additional protofilaments. To study the position of the central density within the keratin tube, we extracted a cross-sectional filament (labeled with E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and rotated it precisely into 90° cross-section. Projection of 4.2-nm-thick slices along the filament revealed that the central density is not always found in the exact center of the filament, but is sometimes detected closer to the filament walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>).

In addition, this preparation circumvents the need for denaturing and renaturing the keratin proteins prior to in vitro assembly, a step which likely increases structural polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parry and Steinert, 1999</xref>).

Individual filaments were found to be very flexible, which agrees with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coulombe and Fuchs, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herrmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Köster et al., 2015</xref>), and showed a high degree of bending within a few hundred nanometers. We determined the minimal apparent persistence length of highly bent KIFs to be 118.4 ± 39.2 nm, indicating that intact keratin filaments can undergo a 90° turn within a distance of 2–3 dimer lengths (dimer length ~44 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quinlan et al., 1984</xref>). This value is slightly lower than the persistence length determined for K8/K18 filaments (300–650 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Block et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lichtenstern et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pawelzyk et al., 2014</xref>), which can be attributed to the fact that the K5/K14 filaments were still embedded into the cellular filament network.</p><p>The high flexibility and modulation of keratin filament orientation is also apparent as filaments can span through the entire thickness of the ice on a cryo-EM grid. The filaments often do not lie flat on the grid, but are frequently tilted out of the <italic>xy</italic> plane and form a wavy network in all three dimensions. Cryo-tomograms of ghost cells allowed us to follow individual filaments through different heights of the cell and show that the filaments can undergo 90° turns within a thickness of &lt;300 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, other IFs such as vimentin seem to be fluctuating less through the different heights of the ghost cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>The bending ability of keratin filaments has enabled us to analyze perpendicular cross-section views and therefore directly reveal that they are built from six sub-filaments surrounding an electron dense core. A hexameric filament arrangement accompanied by a central core has been previously observed in keratin filaments of the human stratum corneum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Norlén and Al-Amoudi, 2004</xref>). This supports a structure comprised of six tetrameric protofilaments, yielding 24 polypeptides in cross section. In support of this finding, mass-per-unit-length studies identified 21–25 polypeptides per cross-section of reassembled epidermal keratin extracts and in recombinant K8/K18 IFs prepared in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 1985</xref>). It is unlikely that the identified sub-filaments represent protofibrils, that is octameric assemblies, as this would yield 48 polypeptides in cross section, which does not agree with the MPL studies. The proposed model of a ‘universal IF’, consisting of 32 polypeptides in cross section, is not supported by our data. While this model agrees well with previous studies of other IFs, for example vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steven et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kooijman et al., 1997</xref>), it does not fit with studies of keratin filaments. Therefore, we conclude that different members of the IF superfamily show substantial diversity with respect to their structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldie et al., 2007</xref>). Although MPL studies reveal that a small number of keratin filaments may contain ~32 polypeptides in cross-section, both MPL and cryo-EM studies including our own show that the majority of KIFs contain ~24 polypeptides in cross-section, organized into ~six protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Norlén and Al-Amoudi, 2004</xref>). Early studies of Aebi et al proposed a model of KIFs consisting of 8 protofilaments, arranged in four protofibrils, based on EM studies of unraveled filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aebi et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that keratin filaments are not completely filled, but possess a distinct density in the center that is separated from the protofilaments forming the filament tube A central core in KIF cross-sections has also been reported in the viable cell layers and stratum corneum of human epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Norlén and Al-Amoudi, 2004</xref>). As the viable cell layers of the epidermis express mostly K5/K14 filaments, this lends further support that the central core is a canonical structure of K5/K14 IFs. An internal core has also been identified in trichocyte keratins found in wool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruce Fraser et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rogers, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kadir et al., 2017</xref>). Previous cryo-ET studies of in vitro assembled vimentin filaments indicated no central core subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldie et al., 2007</xref>), however, a recent cryo-ET analysis of cellular assembled vimentin filaments also identified a frequently occurring central density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eibauer et al., 2021</xref>). The central density described in the present study may correspond to an additional tetrameric protofilament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruce Fraser et al., 2003</xref>) or another cellular component. Interestingly, this density is not fixed to the exact center of the keratin tube, but small changes in its position were identified along the keratin filaments.</p><p>The 2D class averaging of keratin segments revealed structural variations that can be divided into multiple unique phenotypes. This is a remarkable property, that becomes even more apparent when comparing keratins to other cytoskeletal elements: While all analyzed actin class averages highly resemble each other, for example, showing the same helical pattern, filament organization and diameter, each keratin class average seems to be unique and to reflect a different structural arrangement of keratin filaments. The most pronounced feature is the helical repeating pattern in some 2D classes, while other classes show no apparent helical symmetry. Computational reconstitution of long keratin filaments revealed that these regions alternate along the same filaments, indicating that both patterns are crucial components of the keratin structure. This finding demonstrates that the heterogeneity and potential polymorphism does not lie between filaments, but within filaments. 2D classification and computational filament reconstitution additionally revealed large heterogeneities in the filament thickness. Although the most prevalent diameter detected in keratin filaments is 10.1 nm, the diameter can fluctuate between 9.2 and 13.2 nm. This type of heterogeneity has been previously described for several types of IFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Steven et al., 1983</xref>) and is thought to reflect a varying number of subunits per cross-section. However, our results show that regions of increased diameter frequently yield insights into the subunit organization of the filament, indicating that the individual protofilaments are more loosely packed. The increased widths may therefore also reflect regions that are in a state of assembly or subunit exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Çolakoğlu and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ngai et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vikstrom et al., 1989</xref>). Further, they might reflect areas of local post-translational modifications or regions where filaments were locally damaged. Interestingly, these regions are not restricted to the edges of filaments, but can occur in the mid regions of already assembled filaments.</p><p>Filament stretches with diameters smaller than 10 nm might reflect either supercoiling or regions that have experienced a greater degree of localized mechanical stress. Previous studies showed that upon stretching beyond 200%, keratins adopt a plastic behavior that is accompanied by strain hardening and a significant reduction in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Block et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kreplak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fudge et al., 2003</xref>), which is thought to be mainly a result of α-helix to β-sheet transitions of the coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kreplak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fudge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pinto et al., 2014</xref>). Our experiments were conducted in ghost cells after forces were relaxed, therefore, only irreversible unfolding can be detected. Thus, thinner regions in keratin filaments may reflect local domains where extensive forces were applied to the filament network and the filaments adapted by irreversibly unfolding their coiled-coil domains, leading to a reduction in diameter.</p><p>Overall, our results demonstrate that structural polymorphism is an intrinsic property of keratin filaments that were assembled within epithelial cells, and not only occurs in filaments that were assembled in vitro. When compared to the other components of the cytoskeleton, microtubules and actin filaments, which adapt a highly uniform arrangement, the structural heterogeneity of keratin filaments is clearly exceptional. Structural flexibility and changes in helical packing of the filament may provide structural support for the elastic nature of the keratin network and would help to explain their high resistance to breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Etienne-Manneville, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Block et al., 2015</xref>). This feature of keratin filaments would coincide with their task to adapt to different mechanical stresses while maintaining a stable network.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate the importance of determining a high-resolution structure of keratin filaments in order to understand the details of their assembly states and the functional significance of their heterogeneity in cells. Analyzing in vivo assembled filaments provides an approach to study the structure of keratins in their native state with their original post-translational modifications. Understanding the high-resolution structure of keratin filaments would also provide a foundation for determining how keratin mutations affect their structure and how they interact with binding partners. However, with reference to the findings of the current study, we want to emphasize that it is likely that there is not a single 3D structure that can describe keratin filaments in their entirety. In contrast, it is more likely that the conformational range needs to be described by a multitude of structures. Cryo-EM and cryo-ET are the methods of choice for unravelling the complexities of the 3D structure of mature keratin filaments, as the coordinated use of these techniques can resolve both their flexibility and heterogeneity. Given the rapid advances in cryo-EM imaging, sample preparation and image processing, we anticipate that the structural analysis of keratin intermediate filaments will continue to provide new insights into their cellular structure and functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Krt6a</italic></td><td/><td>UniProtKB - P50446</td><td>Targeted by CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Krt6b</italic></td><td/><td>UniProtKB - Q9Z331</td><td>Targeted by CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>DH5α</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# 18265017</td><td>Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>KtyI KO K14</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Homberg et al., 2015</xref>.

Frame-based motion correction and dose-weighting were performed using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). The contrast transfer function was estimated using CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Low-quality micrographs showing high defocus, high astigmatism or low resolution (assessed by CTF estimation, information below 7.5 Å) were excluded, resulting in 1763 high-quality micrographs used for further processing steps. Keratin filaments were either picked manually or automatically using the RELION helical toolbox. To generate a template for autopicking, 55,073 keratin particles were picked manually as start-to-end helices, extracted with a box size of 250 pixels (~55 nm) and 2D classified twice to create classes with straight keratin segments. These classes served as a reference for automated picking of 505,211 particles. For manual picking, 298,056 particles were selected as start-to-end helices. Particles were extracted in boxes of 250 pixels, corresponding to ~55 nm, or 164 pix, corresponding to ~36 nm, with an inter-box distance of 50 Å. Iterative 2D classification procedures were performed, using a spherical mask of 500 Å or 356 Å, respectively.</p><p>Keratin filament segments, 55 nm in length, were classified to yield 305,495 particles in straight classes. Autocorrelation spectra were calculated with MATLAB (2019a, MathWorks). The filament diameter was measured by plotting vertical intensity line-profiles of all classes using MATLAB and measuring the area where the intensity lies above zero.</p><p>Intensity line-profiles of each class were generated by averaging all lateral sections through the segment. OriginPro 2018 software (OriginLab Corporation) was used to plot the diameter distribution. Instead of plotting the number of classes, which was set to a fixed value, the number of particles in each class was plotted, as it reflects how many particles with a certain diameter are present in the dataset. A mean intensity line-profile for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> was generated by averaging all classes from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p>Segments with a box size of 36 nm were used for computational filament reconstitution. Filament reconstitution was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kronenberg-Tenga et al., 2021</xref>) and described below with classes of automatically, as well as manually, picked particles.</p><p>Actin filaments were processed identically to keratin filaments to guarantee comparability. To generate a template for autopicking, 22,228 actin particles were picked manually as start-to-end helices, extracted with a box size of 164 pixels (~36 nm) and 2D classified twice to create classes with straight actin segments. These classes served as a reference for automated picking of 693,903 particles. Particles were extracted in boxes of 164 pixels, corresponding to ~36 nm, with an inter-box distance of 50 Å. Multiple rounds of 2D classification were performed, using a spherical mask of 356 Å. A total of 405,044 particles from the highest resolved 2D classes were used for 3D classification into five classes. The highest resolved 3D class, containing 174,954 particles, was subjected to 3D refinement.</p><p>The final unmasked map showed a resolution of 7.38 Å, based on the gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143 criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scheres, 2012</xref>). The structure was sharpened to 6.13 Å using an isotropic B-factor of −276 Å<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cryo-ET data processing</title><p>Tilt series were processed using the IMOD workflow, including contrast transfer function (CTF) correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). For visualization purposes, a SIRT-like filter according to 10 iterations was applied during tomogram reconstruction. Cellular structures present in the tomograms were manually segmented and visualized using the Amira 5.6.0 software package (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tomogram movies were created using Amira 5.6.0 and Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). 710 cross section views of keratin filaments were picked in 21 tomograms and reconstructed as sub-tomograms using IMOD. Central 2D slices were extracted from the sub-tomograms and utilized for 2D classification in RELION. To assess the position of the central density within the keratin filament for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>, the filament labeled with E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> was extracted in silico and rotated into precise 90° cross section. Afterwards, 4.2 nm thick slices were projected along the length of the filament. The resulting cross-sectional views were filtered with a gaussian blur using Fiji and analyzed for the position of the central density within the filament tube. Positions were represented by circles using Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Computational reconstitution of keratin filaments</title><p>To generate computationally reconstituted filaments a back-mapping strategy was pursued in MATLAB, using the ~36 nm long keratin segments which were used for 2D classification. First, all particles belonging to the same filament were grouped. Filament assignments were made based on the helical tube ID defined by RELION for every particle. Next, all particles belonging to the same filament were sorted in ascending order based on their picking coordinates. Then, their corresponding 2D class images were inversely transformed, so that their orientation matches the original orientation of the raw segments in the cryo-EM micrographs. Next, the 2D class images were plotted at the original coordinates of the particles. To remove background noise, the classes were masked in the y-direction and only the central 132 Å were plotted. Since particles were picked with inter-box distances of 50 Å, while 2D classes have a box size of 360 Å, neighboring segments would strongly overlap. To avoid this, classes were cropped to not extend into neighboring particle positions, and only a small amount of overlap of &lt;four classes with soft edges was allowed to avoid cropped edges in slightly bent filaments. Reconstituted filaments were normalized to equal intensity. Next, a straightening procedure was applied as previously described to extract, align and straighten the reconstituted filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steinert et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kocsis et al., 1991</xref>). Validity of this approach was ensured by using high-resolution actin classes as a control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analyzing helical and straight-line patterns in individual filaments</title><p>Plots representing the order of helical and straight segments along individual filaments, represented by colored circles, were generated in MATLAB as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martins et al., 2021</xref>). 2D classes were grouped into helical or straight clusters based on their appearance. Next, each particle within a filament was represented by red or blue circles, depending on whether its corresponding 2D class belonged to the helical or straight cluster. In the analysis seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, segments that originate from the same filament are plotted as columns of circles. Segments are sorted in ascending order based on their coordinates along the filament.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>3D reconstruction of a keratin filament</title><p>305,495 uniform keratin segments from 55 nm boxes were selected by 2D classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and used for 3D reconstruction. To generate a low-resolution 3D filament model, the rotation angle along the filament axis of all particles was randomized to prevent preferred orientations. Next, a filament was reconstructed using relion_reconstruct. The 3D model was visualized using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis at the University of Zurich for providing support and equipment.

To limit compositional heterogeneity the authors generate a cell line which contains only K5/K14 filaments. They show the KIFs vary in diameter and protofilament helicity. The authors also use cryo-electron tomography to show that KIFs contain density in their center. In some cases, six protofilaments are clearly visible in the cross sections but there also appears to be heterogeneity in their number. This data is a first in the field of keratin research, and provides a much needed framework to understand the structure, properties, and roles of keratin filaments.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural heterogeneity of cellular K5/K14 filaments as revealed by cryo- electron microscopy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Helen Foster (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers agreed that the work is an important step forward for the keratin field and is well executed. They suggest only textual revisions. Please see their full reviews below.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) The discussion of the variable length repeating patterns is not currently clear. In the results (p. 9 and 12), the authors conclude that the observed variability is due to change in Z-height of filament and associated tilt of the filament along its axis. However, the differences in helical pattern are included as a feature of protofilament heterogeneity in the discussion (line 382). Based on the current data, the differences detected could be due to changes in Z-height or true variation in protofilament arrangement. Ideally this should be clarified through classification of 3D sub volumes of the cryo-ET data but this will be technically challenging. I suggest the authors conclude both options are possible in the results and limit the discussion of protofilament arrangement to differences in straight vs. twisted, which are clear in the data.</p><p>2) How rigorous are the biochemical analyses that were conducted to establish that K5 is the only type II keratin expressed in the recombinant mouse keratinocytes? Also, have the authors effectively ruled out that other IFs, e.g., vimentin (nestin?), could be expressed in some of the keratinocytes analyzed?</p><p>3) How many keratinocytes have been sampled to constitute the bank of images subjected to processing and analysis? What criteria were considered when opting to include/exclude cells from the analysis?</p><p>4) Figure 1 relates that the sampling of filaments for analysis was taken at the periphery of the cell, as expected. This is where keratin filament assembly takes place, certainly in cultured cells, as originally shown by Rudolf Leube in 2004 (MBoC) and confirmed for additional cell types including mouse skin keratinocytes in primary culture (Feng et al., J Cell Biol 2015). Therefore, it may be that the heterogeneity in filament structure reflect, to a degree, an immature or yet to be completed assembly state for the fibers. Another potential determinant of the hypervariable structure of the fibers may stem from the use of detergents to prepare cell ghosts. Yet another contributing factor may be that individual/isolated cells were included in the study, whereas keratinocytes are naturally occurring as multicellular assemblies. Surprisingly, these potential factors are not discussed in the manuscript – at least, not as much as they should.</p><p>5) Aside from the role of tilting adeptly described by the authors, could there be a relationship between the size of the repeat distance of the axial helical pattern and filament diameter? Related to this, could the filaments or filament segments showing a longer repeat distance be &quot;stretched&quot;, or those with a shorter repeat distance be &quot;compressed&quot;? This is a very interesting aspect of the study.</p><p>6) The authors should relate the caveats and/or assumptions associated with the approach they used to &quot;reconstitute&quot; the filaments (lines 227-240). I thought that as actually reconstituted filaments from purified K5 and K14 proteins – including that reference would have been very exciting.</p><p>7) The variable sub-architecture of filaments may be a key determinant that underlies the property of self-organization of keratin filaments – the latter has been best characterized, biochemically, in a 2002 MBoC paper by Yamada et al. 2009 J Cell Biol paper by Lee and Coulombe. Upon a modest shift in pH (along physiological lines; see Matsui et al., PNAS 2021), K5-K14 undergo bundling to a remarkable degree, a property the significantly enhances their micromechanical properties (cf. Ma et al., Nat Cel Biol 2001; Yamada et al. MBoC 2002). Please consider discussing.</p><p>8) Lines 351-352. Given all the biases that have gone into selection of individual fibers for analysis, I question the rationale for spending so much time discussing persistence length, given that in this regard this current study contributes little to what was already known in that regard.</p><p>9) The observation of a &quot;central core&quot;, if this is real, is a game changer in the field. Could the core density be &quot;just another protofilament&quot; that happens the be centrally located in cross-section? Does this core show a helical pattern along the main axis of the fiber? Is the core present whether the filament are comprised of protofilaments showing a heliocal pattern, or only in filaments for which the protofilaments are &quot;straight? Finally, could the core be related to the end domains? (unlikely, but…) Here, it is important to recognize that Lars Norlen (J Invest Dermatol 2004) has reported on such a central core in native keratin filaments in cross-section when analyzing terminally differentiated keratinocytes of epidermis using cryoEM analysis of sections prepared from flash-frozen, vitrified skin tissue. His findings should be discussed.</p><p>10) What about the unstructured end domains at the N- and C-termini of K5 and K14? Any insight about where they may be located? The head domains, in particular, are as &quot;large&quot; in primary structure as are subdomain 1B and coil 2.</p><p>11) Please comment on how this work compares to two earlier reports in the literature. I.e. the cryo-EM of vimentin filaments (Goldie et al. JSB 2007), that shows an octameric, i.e. protofibrillar organization of IF, in agreement with the keratin work published by Ueli Aebi (JCB 1983). In the latter paper, a four-stranded helical arrangement of protofibrils is shown. Also, the assembly process via unit-length filaments gives a symmetry of filaments according to their repeat-length of 43 nm, etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Main issues to consider</p><p>How rigorous are the biochemical analyses that were conducted to establish that K5 is the only type II keratin expressed in the recombinant mouse keratinocytes? Also, have the authors effectively ruled out that other IFs, e.g., vimentin (nestin?), could be expressed in some of the keratinocytes analyzed?

Indeed, the variations detected in the repeating pattern could be attributed both to filament tilting or/and to variations in protofilament arrangement. In the revised manuscript, we emphasize this point in the results and Discussion sections, where we focus on the obvious heterogeneity of keratin filaments, i.e., variability in diameter, alternating helical and straight filament patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How rigorous are the biochemical analyses that were conducted to establish that K5 is the only type II keratin expressed in the recombinant mouse keratinocytes? Also, have the authors effectively ruled out that other IFs, e.g., vimentin (nestin?), could be expressed in some of the keratinocytes analyzed?</p></disp-quote><p>The cell line we used for the Krt6a and Krt6b knockout is a well-characterized and authenticated cell line, generated in the Magin lab, termed KtyI KO K14 cell line. The KtyI KO keratinocytes were extracted from knockout mice lacking the entire type I keratin cluster. After lentiviral transduction of the Krt14 gene, these KtyI KO K14 keratinocytes were able to re-form a keratin cytoskeleton meshwork, consisting of K5/K14 filaments and K6/K14 filaments. Expression of non-keratin IFs, e.g. vimentin, was excluded by analyses performed in the Magin lab. In the KtyI deficient embryos, vimentin expression was excluded by RT-PCR, in keratinocytes, illumina arrays were performed that excluded the expression of non-keratin IFs (References: Kumar et al., 2016, J Allergy Clin Immunol; Kumar et al., 2015, J Cell Biol). These references are included and we have now clarified this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p>These analyses showed that K5, K6a, K6b and K14 are the only intermediate filaments expressed in KtyI KO K14 cells. After the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the Krt6a and Krt6b gene, the knockout was verified by genomic DNA analysis of the Krt6a and Krt6b genes, which revealed frame-shift mutations (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B). This produces a homogenous K6a and a heterogenous K6b knockout. However, immunostaining revealed that no K6b/K14 filaments are assembled (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). We could not rule out that non-filamentous K6b protein is present in the K5/K14_1 cells, but it does not assemble into filaments and therefore does not interfere with our analysis. Furthermore, non-filamentous soluble keratin proteins would be removed during the cell permeabilization step and are therefore not present in the ghost cells. It can be concluded that K5/K14 filaments are the only IFs present in the sample analyzed for this study. We highlighted this in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How many keratinocytes have been sampled to constitute the bank of images subjected to processing and analysis? What criteria were considered when opting to include/exclude cells from the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>For the different datasets, micrographs were collected on a total of ~ 60 ghost cells. The dataset at 22,655x, which was used for most experiments including 2D classifications and computational reconstitution of long keratin filaments was acquired on ~ 20 ghost cells.</p><p>No cell that was used for data collection was excluded at any later stage of analysis. Data were recorded at positions where the thickness of the ghost cells allowed cryo-EM analysis. Overview images of entire ghost cells were acquired prior to data acquisition, in which the filaments were identified. Individual micrographs were excluded if they contained no keratin filaments or if the cellular environment was so densely packed that no individual keratin filaments could be identified. Additionally, only high-quality images were used, assessed by CTF estimation (CTF information exceeds 7.5 Å).</p><p>We included the information above in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1 relates that the sampling of filaments for analysis was taken at the periphery of the cell, as expected. This is where keratin filament assembly takes place, certainly in cultured cells, as originally shown by Rudolf Leube in 2004 (MBoC) and confirmed for additional cell types including mouse skin keratinocytes in primary culture (Feng et al., J Cell Biol 2015). Therefore, it may be that the heterogeneity in filament structure reflect, to a degree, an immature or yet to be completed assembly state for the fibers. Another potential determinant of the hypervariable structure of the fibers may stem from the use of detergents to prepare cell ghosts. Yet another contributing factor may be that individual/isolated cells were included in the study, whereas keratinocytes are naturally occurring as multicellular assemblies. Surprisingly, these potential factors are not discussed in the manuscript – at least, not as much as they should.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment.</p><p>Although much of the data was acquired close to the cell periphery, most images were acquired several microns into the cells, while other micrographs were collected deeper within the cell; sometimes in close proximity to the nucleus. Thus, our data was not only acquired close to the plasma membrane, but reflects keratin filaments from most parts of the cell. Further, filaments with obvious ends were excluded from our analysis. This is now clarified in the Discussion section.</p><p>We showed that the structure of long, single filaments is modulated along their long axis, and the observed heterogeneity occurred not only between, but especially within individual filaments. It is unlikely that all of the 4,460 filaments that we reconstituted in silico (Figure 3 and Figure 3 supplement 1) are not fully assembled, especially since some were found close to the cell nucleus.</p><p>Therefore, we believe that the changes in structure reflect an intrinsic property of keratin IFs throughout the cell. However, it may be that our structural analysis includes a subset of filaments in different states of assembly, but we did not detect a unique structural motif that stood out in any subcellular location. However, in light of this comment, we discuss this possibility in the Discussion section.</p><p>Traditionally, structural biology relies on successful purification which involves multiple steps, some of which may include detergents or other chemicals. Here we have minimized this procedure down to a matter of minutes in order to reduce the risk of structural changes. The diluted detergent (0.1 % Triton X-100) was used for 15-20 seconds, to prepare ghost cells which contained typical keratin filament networks. To assess the effect of the detergent treatment on protein structures we analyzed actin filaments from the same dataset and could show that the actin structure is unaltered and can be resolved to 6.1 Å (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Moreover, previous studies on lamins, a type V intermediate filament, showed, that the structure of lamin filaments is not altered after a similar detergent treatment when compared to cryo-FIB milling and tomography of unextracted cells (Kronenberg-Tenga et al., 2021). Therefore, we have concluded that it is unlikely that the detergent treatment alters the keratin IF structure significantly. In line with this reviewer’s comment, we elaborate on this in the Discussion section.</p><p>In our experiments, cells were not studied in isolation. Keratinocytes require close associations with neighboring cells, so they were always cultured at high densities (minimum of 50%) on EM grids. Typically, in our preparations cells are directly attached to other cells (for example, a neighboring cell can be seen in Figure 1B). Nevertheless, it may be possible that the KIF network organization in the cultured keratinocytes is different than in keratinocytes which are grown in denser monolayers or in tissues. Therefore we do not draw conclusions about the keratin IF network organization. With this approach it is unlikely that the structure of individual keratin IF themselves is altered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Aside from the role of tilting adeptly described by the authors, could there be a relationship between the size of the repeat distance of the axial helical pattern and filament diameter? Related to this, could the filaments or filament segments showing a longer repeat distance be &quot;stretched&quot;, or those with a shorter repeat distance be &quot;compressed&quot;? This is a very interesting aspect of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. We re-analyzed our data and compared the diameters of 2D classes with differences in the repeating pattern, but we could not find a correlation between the diameter and the length of the repeating pattern. Actually, the 2D classes which show a helical repeating pattern are all ~ 10 nm in diameter. The very wide (~13 nm) or very thin (~9.2 nm) classes do not show a clear repeating pattern, so the comparison is not straightforward.</p><p>It is still possible that the filament segments with longer repeat distances are “stretched” and those with shorter repeat distances are “compressed”. However, we believe that this is unlikely, since we studied the keratin IFs after releasing the cellular tension that was applied to the filaments (cells were lysed). Thus, it seems likely that only irreversible stretching should be retained in our analysis. Irreversible stretching could be induced by extensive stretching of filaments above 200%, which would result in α-helix to β-sheet transitions of the coiled-coil domains (Kreplak et al., 2005). The 2D classes with very thin diameters and a straight appearance might reflect such irreversible stretched filaments. Since these classes are frequently found in the cellular assembled keratins, this may be physiologically relevant.</p><p>Tilting seems to be the most likely explanation for the differences in the repeating distance, because we already see in the tomograms that tilted filaments are present in the sample.</p><p>We added the above to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should relate the caveats and/or assumptions associated with the approach they used to &quot;reconstitute&quot; the filaments (lines 227-240). I thought that as actually reconstituted filaments from purified K5 and K14 proteins – including that reference would have been very exciting.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the misunderstanding. In this study, we only used a computational in silico reconstitution. Namely, we used the 2D class averaging and mapped the classes back to the original position from which the segments originated along the filaments. This approach was developed in Martins et al., 2021. Throughout the entire study we used only cellular assembled K5/K14 filaments and studied them only within ghost cells. We revised the explanation and changed the term into ‘computational reconstitution’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The variable sub-architecture of filaments may be a key determinant that underlies the property of self-organization of keratin filaments – the latter has been best characterized, biochemically, in a 2002 MBoC paper by Yamada et al. 2009 J Cell Biol paper by Lee and Coulombe. Upon a modest shift in pH (along physiological lines; see Matsui et al., PNAS 2021), K5-K14 undergo bundling to a remarkable degree, a property the significantly enhances their micromechanical properties (cf. Ma et al., Nat Cel Biol 2001; Yamada et al. MBoC 2002). Please consider discussing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point. To our knowledge, Lee and Coulombe, 2009 and Yamada et al., 2002, focused on the bundling properties of keratin filaments and the regions involved in inter-filament interactions. This is very interesting and their studies yielded fascinating insights into the self-organizing properties of K5/K14 filaments. In our analysis, we focused on single individual filaments, non-bundled filaments, and applied single particle image processing procedures. Furthermore, the sample preparation procedure involved the removal of soluble parts of the cytoplasm and therefore some changes in the keratin IF network may occur. Since we cannot guarantee that the network organization we observe in our ghost cells is the same as it was in intact cells, we only focused on individual keratin IFs. We have now referred to these articles in the context of keratin meshworks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Lines 351-352. Given all the biases that have gone into selection of individual fibers for analysis, I question the rationale for spending so much time discussing persistence length, given that in this regard this current study contributes little to what was already known in that regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment and agree that the discussion about the persistence length is very long. We have shortened this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The observation of a &quot;central core&quot;, if this is real, is a game changer in the field. Could the core density be &quot;just another protofilament&quot; that happens the be centrally located in cross-section? Does this core show a helical pattern along the main axis of the fiber? Is the core present whether the filament are comprised of protofilaments showing a heliocal pattern, or only in filaments for which the protofilaments are &quot;straight? Finally, could the core be related to the end domains? (unlikely, but…) Here, it is important to recognize that Lars Norlen (J Invest Dermatol 2004) has reported on such a central core in native keratin filaments in cross-section when analyzing terminally differentiated keratinocytes of epidermis using cryoEM analysis of sections prepared from flash-frozen, vitrified skin tissue. His findings should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The central core density may represent an additional protofilament that is located in the center of the filament. It was found in all the keratin IFs analyzed in this study, regardless of whether they show a straight or a helical pattern. As a control, we calculated a rotationally averaged structure as seen in Figure 4G separately from only helical and only straight 2D classes and both showed a central density. Furthermore, no cross-sectional view could be detected where the filament central core was missing. In the revised manuscript we further analyzed filaments seen in cryo-tomograms (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E), it showed a continuous density within the luminal space. It further supports the idea that the density is of structured domains, rather than the unstructured head or tail domains.</p><p>Moreover, we recently identified a central luminal density in vimentin filaments, and verified that it cannot be the head or the tail of vimentin (Eibauer et al., 2021 BioRxiv). Although major structural differences between keratin and vimentin IFs are apparent, they share some common structural properties.</p><p>Whether the central density follows a helical symmetry remains unknown. However, due to steric restriction, it is unlikely that it would exhibit the same helical parameters as the tubular keratin scaffold. In the additional analysis that was added to the revised manuscript, we show that the central density is not always located in the exact center of the filament, but can move within the filament tube (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). These results are presented and discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We thank the Reviewers for pointing out the studies by Norlen et al. Their findings agree very well with our findings and are discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) What about the unstructured end domains at the N- and C-termini of K5 and K14? Any insight about where they may be located? The head domains, in particular, are as &quot;large&quot; in primary structure as are subdomain 1B and coil 2.</p></disp-quote><p>The flexible head and tail domains were predicted to be intrinsically unstructured. Therefore, it is likely that they would not have a substantial contribution to the densities of the averaged KIF structure. A high-resolution 3D structural analysis would be necessary to answer these questions. Unfortunately, we are not sure we can deduce that information from our vimentin IF structural analysis since they clearly assemble differently and a minor rotation of keratin protofilaments may result in different directions of the N- and C- termini.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please comment on how this work compares to two earlier reports in the literature. I.e. the cryo-EM of vimentin filaments (Goldie et al., JSB 2007), that shows an octameric, i.e. protofibrillar organization of IF, in agreement with the keratin work published by Ueli Aebi (JCB 1983). In the latter paper, a four-stranded helical arrangement of protofibrils is shown. Also, the assembly process via unit-length filaments gives a symmetry of filaments according to their repeat-length of 43 nm, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment and have now added a paragraph in the discussion regarding these references.</p><p>As mentioned above, we see major structural differences between vimentin and keratin IFs. Although some literature proposed the idea of universal 32-mer IFs, which would be the basic building block of all cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, this model never agreed with the experimental evidence. Keratin IFs contain much less mass per length (Engel et al., 1985) than vimentin (Herrmann et al., 1996) and therefore fewer monomers in cross-section. Therefore, at this stage we are not confident that vimentin and keratin filaments are similar.</p><p>Our study supports the notion that IFs do not adhere to a common building plan, but show substantial diversity among the different types (Goldie et al., 2007).</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that the ‘repeat distance’ and of a helix should be clarified, as it might cause confusion with the ‘repeating length’ of a helix, which is not the parameter we measured here. In helical parameter terms, our ‘repeat distance’ refers to the ‘pitch’ of a helix, describing the distance required to complete a 360° helix turn. To clarify the helical parameter we determined with the autocorrelation analysis, we renamed the repeat distance to ‘pitch’, as this represents the correct nomenclature. Our measurements therefore describe different structural features than the 43 nm repeat length of an ULF. It agrees with the helical pitch shown in Aebi et al., 1983, measured by Power spectrum analysis of negatively stained keratin filaments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
