high-quality nuclei and RNA, persistently hindering its applications. Here, we present a robust technique for isolating nuclei across various tissue types, remarkably enhancing snRNA-seq data quality. Employing this approach, we comprehensively characterize the depot-dependent cellular dynamics of various cell types underlying mouse adipose tissue remodeling during obesity. By integrating bulk nuclear RNA-seq from adipocyte nuclei of different sizes, we identify distinct adipocyte subpopulations categorized by size and functionality. These subpopulations follow two divergent trajectories, adaptive and pathological, with their prevalence varying by depot. Specifically, we identify a key molecular feature of dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocytes, a global shutdown in gene expression, along with elevated stress and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, our differential gene expression analysis reveals distinct contributions of adipocyte subpopulations to the overall pathophysiology of adipose tissue. Our study establishes a robust snRNA-seq method, providing novel insights into the biological processes involved in adipose tissue remodeling during obesity, with broader applicability across diverse biological systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>snRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>adipocytes</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK129289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roh</surname><given-names>Hyun Cheol</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000041</institution-id><institution>American Diabetes Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7-21-JDF-056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roh</surname><given-names>Hyun Cheol</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Significant technical improvement in single-nucleus RNA-seq reveals distinct adipocyte subpopulations that respond differently to obesity, including those undergoing adaptive healthy expansion and others displaying severe dysfunction.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized various fields of biology by enabling high-resolution profiling of single-cell heterogeneity within complex tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tang et al., 2009</xref>). It has not only facilitated the identification of new cell types and subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shaffer et al., 2017</xref>), but also uncovered alterations in cellular composition and gene expression across diverse biological contexts during development, disease progression and responses to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shalek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petropoulos et al., 2016</xref>). However, experimental methods for scRNA-seq still present limitations and challenges. First, these methods require the use of fresh tissues, which can be difficult to obtain and thus lead to logistic complexities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lafzi et al., 2018</xref>). Even when fresh tissues are available, the process of obtaining single-cell suspension through enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation can introduce unwanted artifacts. Different types of cells can be digested to varying degrees and rates, resulting in biased cell recovery. Also, the tissue dissociation process can cause cellular stress, leading to reduced cell viability and altered transcriptional profiles. Lastly, certain cell types are unsuitable for scRNA-seq due to their unique cellular properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grindberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). Adipocytes are one example; their large size and excess lipid content render them incompatible with the microfluidic platforms used in the majority of scRNA-seq technologies.</p><p>To overcome these issues, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has been developed as an alternative strategy. While generating transcriptional profiles with high similarity to those by scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grindberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Habib et al., 2017</xref>), snRNA-seq offers advantages. First, this method utilizes nuclei that are promptly released from tissues during homogenization, obviating the need for an extended digestion process and thereby minimizing cell type biases and artifactual transcriptional alteration. Second, its compatibility with cryopreserved samples allows for greater flexibility in experimental designs and enables the utilization of samples stored in biobanks. Furthermore, snRNA-seq can be employed to study cell types that are less amenable to scRNA-seq, such as adipocytes and cardiomyocytes, as isolated nuclei no longer retain limiting cellular characteristics and can be loaded on to various platforms. Nevertheless, snRNA-seq also poses challenges to be considered. Once released from cells, nuclei are highly fragile and susceptible to mechanical stress, resulting in leakage or aggregation. Moreover, their enclosed RNA becomes increasingly vulnerable to RNases, leading to rapid RNA degradation. Nuclei isolated from in vivo tissues are typically more delicate than those from cells cultured in vitro, with potential variation depending on cell type. Hence, meticulous preparation of high-quality nuclei is crucial for successful snRNA-seq experiments.</p><p>Adipose tissue plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism, serving as a dynamic energy reservoir within the body. It exhibits remarkable plasticity in response to nutritional fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>). In obesity, adipose tissue undergoes a significant remodeling process, expanding substantially to enhance its storage capacity. This process is orchestrated through coordinated actions among diverse cell types, including adipocytes, preadipocytes, endothelial cells, and various immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corvera, 2021</xref>). However, prolonged obesity leads to pathological changes and dysfunction in adipose tissue, characterized by disrupted lipid metabolism, impaired insulin signaling, inflammation, and cell death. These changes are critical precursors to the onset of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Longo et al., 2019</xref>). The distribution of body fat in obesity is closely correlated with metabolic health. The expansion of visceral fat depots increases risks for metabolic disorders, whereas subcutaneous fat depots pose lesser risks or can even offer protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vishvanath and Gupta, 2019</xref>). This is likely due to varying responses of different adipose tissue depots to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pellegrinelli et al., 2016</xref>). In obesity, visceral adipose tissues display enlarged hypertrophic adipocytes, along with hypoxia, elevated fibrosis and inflammation from increased immune cell infiltration. In contrast, subcutaneous adipose tissues have smaller adipocytes with lower levels of inflammation and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Longo et al., 2019</xref>). scRNA-seq has been used to characterize the dynamics of cell populations underlying adipose tissue remodeling, with a focus on the cell types within stromal vascular fractions, particularly preadipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schwalie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hepler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merrick et al., 2019</xref>). Yet adipocytes have been excluded from these studies due to technical limitations. More recently, snRNA-seq has been employed, revealing evidence of the cellular heterogeneity within adipocyte populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sárvári et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emont et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holman et al., 2023</xref>). Despite this progress, acquiring high-quality snRNA-seq data from adipose tissues remains highly challenging. Technical difficulties have posed a major hurdle to achieving accuracy, sensitivity, and efficacy in understanding adipose tissue remodeling, especially regarding mature adipocyte populations during obesity.</p><p>Here, we present a robust method for isolating nuclei for snRNA-seq, which enhances the quality of nuclear RNA and preserves nucleus integrity across various tissue types. Using this method, we have generated snRNA-seq data of superior quality compared to existing datasets, offering novel and precise insights into the specific changes within cell populations across different fat depots in response to obesity. By integrating bulk nuclear RNA-seq with adipocyte nuclei of different sizes, we have identified multiple subpopulations of adipocytes primarily categorized by size and functionality, which are influenced by obesity. Specifically, we have characterized dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocytes prevalent in visceral adipose tissues during obesity, exhibiting hallmark features of cellular stress and inflammation. All these adipocyte subpopulations contributed differentially to a range of biological pathways involved in the pathophysiology of adipose tissue during obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Robust nucleus isolation protocols protect RNA quality and nucleus integrity</title><p>To systemically address the issue of nuclear RNA degradation, we first assessed RNA quality in isolated nuclei from a range of mouse tissues. During nucleus isolation, no RNase inhibitors were added to evaluate intrinsic RNase activity in each tissue type. We observed a wide spectrum of RNA quality among the tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The brain exhibited highly intact RNA, followed by the heart showing relatively good RNA quality. The liver displayed moderate RNA degradation. Among the adipose tissues, including brown adipose tissue, subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), and visceral epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), significant RNA degradation was detected, with eWAT showing the highest level of degradation. RNA was completely degraded in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results indicate significant variation in the quality of RNA extracted from nuclei depending on tissue types. To limit RNA degradation, we incorporated recombinant RNase inhibitors during nucleus isolation and examined additional tissue types, including the spleen, the lung, and the kidney. Surprisingly, the addition of recombinant RNase inhibitors at a concentration of 0.4 U/µl had no discernible effect on RNA quality of any of those tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Even when the concentration of RNase inhibitors was increased to 4 U/µl, it failed to yield any substantial enhancement in RNA quality (data not shown). Therefore, we screened various conditions and molecules known for their ability to inhibit RNase activity. Among these, the vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (VRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lienhard et al., 1972</xref>) was identified as having a significant impact on RNA quality. High-quality RNA with minimal degradation was obtained in all the tested tissues except for the pancreas and its connecting tissue, the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, we optimized the protocol by combining VRC with recombinant RNase inhibitors for further improvements, albeit to a modest extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition to RNA quality, achieving a single-nucleus suspension is an important requirement for snRNA-seq sample preparation. Using VRC, the optimized protocol successfully retrieved a well-dispersed nucleus population without clumps in all tissue types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Further analysis of nucleus morphology at a higher resolution revealed a smoother membrane surface and larger nucleus size when using the optimized protocol, as compared to the standard protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Consistent with the preservative function of VRC proven in maintaining tissue morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shieh et al., 2018</xref>), these findings show that our nucleus isolation protocol effectively maintains nucleus structure without shrinkage. Given that current snRNA-seq methods require prompt sample processing due to the rapid degradation of RNA in isolated nuclei, we further tested the temporal stability of RNA in nuclei isolated using our optimized protocol. After isolating nuclei from eWAT, we stored them at 4°C for different durations (2, 6, and 24 hr) before RNA extraction and quality analysis. In the standard protocol, nuclear RNA exhibited severe degradation within 2 hr post-homogenization, worsening over 24 hr. In contrast, nuclear RNA isolated using the optimized protocol remained intact at 2 and 6 hr, maintaining good quality even after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To determine whether RNA could remain intact with additional handling procedures, we conducted the same time-course RNA extraction with nuclei sorted through flow cytometry. The RNA remained stable, comparable to that of unsorted nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, our optimized protocol, employing both VRC and recombinant RNase inhibitors, yields high-quality nuclei while preserving RNA integrity and nuclear structure for extended procedures up to 24 hr.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNA quality and nucleus integrity are preserved by robust nucleus isolation protocols.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Analysis of RNA quality in isolated nuclei using Agilent Bioanalyzer.

By utilizing the Nuclear tagging and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (NuTRAP) mice designed to label nuclei from specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roh et al., 2017</xref>), we sorted nuclei from adipocytes and non-adipocytes to conduct a comparative analysis of their gene expression profiles through cDNA synthesis followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We observed strong PCR amplification and highly specific expression of adipocyte markers in adipocyte nuclei and immune/endothelial cell markers in non-adipocyte nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results indicate that the use of VRC during nucleus isolation does not pose an issue in gene expression profiling.</p><p>Subsequently, we applied the optimized nucleus isolation protocol for snRNA-seq of mouse adipose tissues using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ Gene Expression system. We employed a two-step tissue homogenization process involving pulverization and Dounce homogenizers to ensure complete liberation of nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, we included a fluorescence-activated nucleus sorting (FANS) step in the workflow to eliminate tissue debris and ambient RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). From eWAT and iWAT samples collected from mice fed either a chow or high fat diet (HFD), we generated high-quality cDNA with long fragment sizes and constructed robust sequencing libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). To evaluate our data quality, we benchmarked them against two published snRNA-seq datasets from mouse adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sárvári et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emont et al., 2022</xref>), based on the quality metrics determined by the standard Cell Ranger pipeline. With comparable sequencing depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), our datasets displayed significantly higher counts of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and genes per nucleus, exceeding counts from the other datasets by almost twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Also, the proportions of mitochondrial reads in our datasets represented less than 1% (mean 0.37%), which was significantly lower than in the other datasets (mean 38.7 and 2.31%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Importantly, our method produced substantially higher fractions of reads in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting low ambient RNA contamination. This was consistent with the barcode rank plot for our data, which exhibited a sudden drop of UMI counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating a clear distinction between intact nuclei and background barcodes during cell calling. Analysis using CellBender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fleming et al., 2023</xref>) also contrasted the minimal number of cells in the narrow transition zone in our datasets with the greater number of cells within the broader transition zone observed in the published samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results indicate that our method reduces the contribution of ambient RNA to the expression profiles of single cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that our optimized protocol produces high-quality snRNA-seq data that outperforms other existing methods.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A single-nucleus atlas of white adipose tissue from lean and obese mouse generated by the optimized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) protocol.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the workflow for the optimized protocol for snRNA-seq of mouse frozen tissue samples.

Blood EC included venous (VenEC), arterial (ArtEC), and capillary endothelial cells (CapEC). CapEC was further divided into arterial capillary endothelial cells (AcapEC) and venous capillary endothelial cells (VcapEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>), with the latter being the largest vascular cell type in adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). We additionally recognized angiogenic endothelial cells (AngEC), comprising migratory tip cells expressing extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, and proliferative stalk cells with elevated expression of cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Furthermore, we discovered an endothelial cell type characterized by high expression of lipid metabolism genes (LipEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Following HFD feeding, a relative expansion of AngEC and LipEC was observed in both fat depots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>), suggesting increased vascularization and lipid transport during obesity-induced adipose tissue expansion. Intriguingly, we noted a drastic decrease in the proportion of the VcapEC population specifically within eWAT during HFD feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>), indicating impaired metabolite transport into the venous circulation, which may potentially contribute to the pathology of visceral adipose tissue.</p><p>In mural cells, PC and SMC were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>), with the PC population notably larger than that of SMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>), consistent with their respective association with capillaries and larger vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rhodin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamazaki and Mukouyama, 2018</xref>).

Thus, we questioned whether the classification of adipocyte subpopulations aligns with the spectrum of adipocytes during HFD-induced expansion, particularly regarding their size. To address this question, we sought to compare gene expression profiles between large and small adipocytes. Interestingly, we observed enlarged nuclei in hypertrophic adipocytes isolated from HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which correlated positively with adipocyte cell size in both fat depots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Profiling adipocyte nuclei labeled with GFP and mCherry from NuTRAP mice fed on chow or HFD showed a strong positive correlation between nuclear GFP intensity and adipocyte nucleus size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Based on these findings, we analyzed the size distribution of adipocyte nuclei in each fat depot under chow or HFD conditions using flow cytometry. eWAT and iWAT from chow-fed mice primarily displayed smaller adipocyte nuclei. In HFD-fed mice, eWAT predominantly contained larger adipocyte nuclei, while iWAT showed a heterogeneous size range from small to large nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, G</xref>). Next, we sorted and separately collected adipocyte nuclei by size from the same iWAT of HFD-fed mice for RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>) to define the genuine gene expression signature associated with cell/nucleus size, minimizing potential confounding factors such as diet or depot dependency. Differential gene expression analysis followed by gene ontology analysis revealed that large adipocytes promote processes involved in insulin response, vascularization and DNA repair, while inhibiting processes related to cell migration, metabolism and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). We also identified adipocyte hypertrophy signature genes enriched in large adipocyte nuclei compared to smaller adipocyte nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). They also exhibited higher overall expression levels in adipocyte nuclei in iWAT from HFD-fed mice compared to those from chow-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). When overlaying the expression of these hypertrophy signature genes across adipocyte subpopulations, we observed high expression in Ad3–Ad4 and Ad5–Ad6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), suggesting that they may represent hypertrophic adipocytes. However, certain genes differentiated between Ad3–Ad4 and Ad5–Ad6. For example, <italic>Hdac9</italic> was more enriched in Ad3, while <italic>Pde2a</italic> was in more enriched in Ad5–Ad6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Importantly, there were marked distinctions in the expression of insulin signaling- and lipid metabolism-related genes between Ad3 and Ad6, with Ad6 having substantially lower gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This implies that Ad3 represents ‘metabolically healthy hypertrophic (MHH)’ adipocytes, while Ad6 represents ‘metabolically unhealthy hypertrophic (MUH)’ adipocytes.</p><p>To further discern the obesity-driven dynamics of adipocyte subpopulations, we performed pseudotime trajectory analysis, starting with the Ad1–Ad2 subpopulations that were prevalent under chow conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Two divergent trajectories were revealed: One trajectory moves toward Ad3 and Ad4, which may depict an ‘adaptive healthy transition’. Conversely, the alternate trajectory progresses toward Ad5 and ultimately to Ad6, indicating a potential ‘maladaptive dysfunctional transition’. In addition, the farthest position of Ad6 along the pseudotime scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) indicates prolonged pathological conditions. Importantly, eWAT and iWAT displayed contrasting preferences in adipocyte trajectories during HFD feeding: the dysfunctional trajectory leading to Ad6 was dominant in eWAT while the adaptive trajectory toward Ad3 remained more prevalent in iWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Subsequently, we classified these genes into four clusters based on their pattern of HFD-induced changes across adipocyte subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Gene cluster 1 represented a group of genes generally upregulated by HFD across all subpopulations, with the most significant induction observed in Ad3, followed by Ad4 and Ad2 to a lesser extent. The genes associated with cell junctions, ECM and the cytoskeleton included in this cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) may describe biological responses during HFD-induced adipose tissue remodeling, which were featured in the aforementioned adaptive transition, among Ad2-Ad4 subpopulations. On the other hand, Gene clusters 2 and 3 comprised genes up- and down-regulated, respectively, with changes most pronounced in Ad6 and to a lesser extent in Ad5, during HFD feeding. The induction of genes in cluster 2, as well as the repression of genes in cluster 3, reflect stress response, inflammation, and cell death in adipose tissues, along with impaired machinery regulating gene expression (e.g., chromatin remodeling and mRNA metabolic process) during HFD-induced adipose pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Genes in cluster 4, commonly down-regulated by HFD across all adipocyte subpopulations, had enriched metabolic processes such as lipid metabolism, thermogenesis, and insulin phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating a general decline in metabolic activity and insulin sensitivity across the entire adipocyte population rather than specific subpopulations. Collectively, these results suggest that tissue-level biological changes in adipose tissues during obesity result from a combination of alterations within specific subpopulations and throughout the entire adipocyte population.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Distinct biological pathways enriched in different adipocyte subpopulations during obesity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap illustrating <italic>Z</italic>-scored expression of high fat diet (HFD)-induced genes in either epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) or inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) within each adipocyte subpopulation.

This subpopulation represented a dysfunctional state of adipocytes, characterized by elevated expression of stress response and inflammation genes, coupled with the loss of metabolic genes. Using the identified profile as a basis, we sought to confirm the presence of the Ad6 adipocyte subpopulation at the tissue level through adipocyte or whole-mount immunostaining. We first visualized reactive oxygen species (ROS) within adipocytes isolated from adipose tissues of chow- or HFD-fed mice using the chemical ROS reporter H2DCFDA. Under HFD conditions, we observed markedly higher H2DCFDA fluorescence intensity in eWAT and a modest increase in iWAT, resulting in a significantly larger fraction of H2DCFDA-positive adipocytes, especially in eWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). This provides evidence of Ad6 adipocytes experiencing oxidative stress. Next, we inspected Ad6 adipocytes by employing whole-mount immunostaining of adipose tissues for beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), a marker highly enriched in this subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The Ad6 subpopulation represents the pathological state of adipocytes during obesity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative immunofluorescence microscopy images of adipocytes isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of chow- and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice stained with Hoechst and the chemical reactive oxygen species (ROS) reporter, H2DCFDA.

B2M was particularly found within crown-like structures (CLS), as well as in the cytoplasm of adipocytes neighboring these CLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). As dead adipocytes are detected within CLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murano et al., 2008</xref>), this result suggests Ad6 as stressed and dying cells due to inflammation, both within and outside the CLS. Another hallmark of Ad6 adipocytes was the depletion of genes crucial for lipid metabolism, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To mitigate the potential for artifacts derived from ambient RNA, we directly visualized PPARγ proteins within adipocytes in adipose tissues through whole-mount immunostaining utilizing NuTRAP mice. While most GFP-labeled adipocyte nuclei robustly expressed PPARγ proteins under typical conditions, a significant proportion of adipocyte nuclei from eWAT in HFD-fed mice lacked PPARγ proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F</xref>), confirming the presence of PPARγ-deficient Ad6 adipocytes in eWAT during obesity. We did not detect significant expression of APC markers such as <italic>Pdgfra</italic> in Ad6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>), indicating that Ad6 does not represent dedifferentiating adipocytes. Instead, the substantially fewer transcripts, represented by UMIs or genes, detected in the Ad6 subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), suggests Ad6 adipocytes undergo a global loss of gene expression. In the integration of our data with previous datasets, we observed a comparable adipocyte population identified in the previous study (mAd3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emont et al., 2022</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emont et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with similar marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and lower transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, the population size of mAd3 was much smaller than Ad6 in our data and did not show consistent population changes during obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to different technical robustness; the dysfunctional cellular state of this population, with severely compromised RNA contents, may have made it difficult to accurately capture using standard protocols in the previous study, while our protocol enabled robust and precise detection. Taken together, Ad6 represents a subpopulation of stressed and dying adipocytes with transcriptional shutdown that arise during obesity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>snRNA-seq has emerged as an alternative approach to overcome the limitations of scRNA-seq. Nevertheless, technical challenges in obtaining high-quality nuclei and RNA have remained as significant hurdles in the standard protocol. In this study, we present a robust protocol for nucleus isolation that effectively addresses these issues across various tissue types. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we applied it to characterize one of the most challenging tissue types to investigate, adipose tissue. Our snRNA-seq data demonstrate its superior quality compared to previously published datasets, as well as provides novel insights into the biological processes underlying mouse adipose tissue remodeling during obesity.</p><p>We observed that significant variations in RNase abundance among various tissue types affect the quality of RNA obtained from isolated nuclei using standard protocols. Notably, brain tissue, which has been primarily used in prior snRNA-seq studies, exhibited the lowest RNase activity. This implies that the standard nucleus isolation protocols employed in those studies may not readily translate to other tissues, particularly those with high RNase activities. Recombinant RNase inhibitor proteins are commonly used to control RNA quality during nucleus isolation. However, these inhibitors marginally improved RNA quality, likely due to their specific targeting of certain RNase types, such as RNase A, 1, and T1. Instead, through experiments, we discovered that VRC, a potent inhibitor capable of targeting a wide range of RNases, significantly enhanced RNA quality in isolated nuclei. VRC functions as a transition state analog, binding to the active sites of RNases and inhibiting their enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gray, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger and Birkenmeier, 1979</xref>). Despite its demonstrated versatility in RNA experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gray, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger and Birkenmeier, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Egberts et al., 1977</xref>), the application of VRC in gene expression studies has been limited due to its inhibitory effects on other RNA enzymes, including reverse transcriptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger and Birkenmeier, 1979</xref>). Our method addressed this issue by reducing VRC from nucleus isolation buffer prior to loading onto microfluidic devices, as confirmed by the robust qRT-PCR and snRNA-seq results we obtained. Recently, we encountered a few protocols that have been introduced to enhance RNA quality by employing VRC or acidic buffers during nucleus isolation for snRNA-seq, particularly for kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soccio et al., 2014</xref>) and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tosti et al., 2021</xref>) samples. However, their applicability to other tissue types remains untested. In contrast, our optimized protocol successfully preserved not only nuclear RNA quality in various tissue types, but also the integrity of the nuclear structure. We noted that VRC has preservative effects on isolated nuclei, resulting in smoother and more intact membranes in larger nuclei when compared to standard protocols not using VRC. This observation aligns with a recent study that demonstrated the preservative properties of VRC, protecting tissue morphology, as well as RNA, protein, and genomic DNA quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shieh et al., 2018</xref>). More importantly, we demonstrated the capability of our protocol to retain nuclear RNA quality for up to 24 hr post-tissue processing, even after undergoing additional steps such as FANS. This advancement holds the potential to greatly improve experimental logistics. Considering that snRNA-seq experiments typically require completion of nucleus isolation and loading onto microfluidic devices (e.g., 10x Genomics Chromium controller) within a narrow time window on the same day, our protocol offers greater flexibility for these critical steps, allowing them to be performed on different days if necessary. This adaptability has the potential to unlock a wide array of applications for snRNA-seq techniques. In the clinical setting, for example, this will enable patient biopsies to be collected for diagnostic tests and then be analyzed via snRNA-seq at a different facility.</p><p>Our single-nucleus atlas of mouse white adipose tissues generally aligns with previous studies while offering deeper insights into depot specificity and cellular composition dynamics during obesity. An important advancement in our dataset was the improved recovery of vascular cell populations, which were underrepresented in prior studies, likely due to our protocol’s effective tissue homogenization and the high quality of RNA preserved in isolated nuclei. This enabled precise characterization of diverse endothelial and related vascular cell types. We observed a marked decrease in the proportion of capillary endothelial cells in eWAT specifically during HFD feeding, consistent with the previously documented capillary rarefaction and elevated hypoxia associated with adipose tissue expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pasarica et al., 2009</xref>). We further noticed that the VcapEC population, which is responsible for transporting metabolites into the venous circulation, was primarily affected. Additionally, we observed an HFD-induced decline in the LEC population, which plays a role in removing fluid and macromolecules from the interstitial space. These findings suggest that defective drainage of metabolites and molecules into the venous circulation may be another key feature of dysfunctional adipose tissue in obesity, warranting further investigation.</p><p>Another noteworthy discovery from our snRNA-seq data was gaining deep insights into the spectrum of adipocyte subpopulations and their dynamics during obesity. Based on our observation of a strong correlation between adipocyte cell size and nucleus size, we developed a novel approach to profile the size distribution of adipocyte subpopulations using nuclei as surrogates, which yielded intriguing findings. Adipocyte cell size appeared small and relatively uniform under chow conditions in both eWAT and iWAT. During HFD feeding, adipocytes notably enlarged, particularly in eWAT, whereas iWAT exhibited a broader distribution with a mixture of small and large adipocytes. Therefore, by isolating adipocyte nuclei of various sizes from iWAT, we identified gene signatures that determine adipocyte hypertrophy. Overlaying this data with snRNA-seq data revealed that cell size is a key determinant of adipocyte clustering in mice. This finding contrasts with the heterogeneity of human adipocytes, where insulin sensitivity is shown to be a primary factor in adipocyte classification rather than cell size, as demonstrated by spatial transcriptomics mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Massier et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, ex vivo differentiated human adipocytes derived from various donors displayed distinct cellular phenotypes, consistent with the heterogeneity in adipocyte subpopulations identified by snRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emont et al., 2022</xref>). This suggests that the significant genetic variation among humans, potentially serving as a major driver of adipocyte clustering, overrides the size-dependent differences found in inbred mouse strains with homogeneous genetic backgrounds. Nevertheless, our findings integrate various characteristics of adipocytes reported from diverse biological contexts, broadening our understanding of distinct adipocyte subpopulations. For instance, despite both Ad1 and Ad2 subpopulations having small cell size and abundance under chow conditions, they exhibited distinct expression levels of lipid metabolism genes. This finding may be consistent with previous studies demonstrating mosaic lipid transport activity among small white adipocytes from <italic>Rhesus Macaques</italic> monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varlamov et al., 2015</xref>). Also, the unique enrichment of genes involved in calcium transport and ossification in hypertrophic Ad4 adipocytes may account for the frequent occurrence of calcium deposits observed in obese adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We further noted two distinct types of hypertrophic adipocytes developed by HFD feeding: MHH adipocytes (Ad3) abundant in iWAT, and MUH adipocytes (Ad6) prevalent in eWAT. We not only validated the presence of MUH adipocytes, primarily around CLS in obese eWAT with oxidative stress and inflammation markers, but also discovered their potential association with prolonged obesity through pseudotime analysis. Interestingly, MUH adipocytes showed deficient expression of the master transcriptional regulator PPARγ as well as a substantial decline in metabolic gene expression. This aligns with our earlier findings, which demonstrated the failure of adipocytes to maintain their identity during obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roh et al., 2020</xref>). However, MUH adipocytes did not show significant expression of marker genes for APC, indicating that they are not in a state of dedifferentiation. The significant decrease in transcript counts in Ad6 suggests that these cells may represent stressed or dying cells, akin to the ‘stressed lipid-scavenging’ adipocytes described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sárvári et al., 2021</xref>. Our data integration analysis found that Ad6 adipocytes are comparable to mAd3 adipocytes identified in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emont et al., 2022</xref>. However, we observed significant discrepancies in the size and changes of this population during obesity, likely due to differences in technical robustness. We did not find any human adipocyte subclusters that clearly resembled our mouse Ad6 adipocytes. Notably, human adipocyte heterogeneity does not correspond well to that of mouse adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Massier et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, human adipocyte data show poor reproducibility between different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Massier et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, this inconsistency is unique to adipocytes, as other cell types in adipose tissues display consistent sub cell types across species and studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Massier et al., 2023</xref>). Our findings indicate that adipocytes may exhibit a unique pathological cellular state with significantly reduced RNA content, which may contribute to the poor consistency in adipocyte heterogeneity in prior studies with suboptimal RNA quality. Therefore, using a robust method to effectively preserve RNA quality may be critical for accurately characterizing adipocyte populations, especially in disease states. It remains to be tested in the future studies whether our snRNA-seq protocol can identify consistent heterogeneity in adipocyte populations across different species, studies, and individual human subjects. Also, examining short- and mid-term obesity conditions could help clarify cell population dynamics and identify early markers involved in the transition from healthy to pathological adipose tissue.</p><p>Lastly, we elucidated the contribution of distinct adipocyte subpopulations to various established signatures of obese adipose tissue. For instance, Ad2–Ad4 adipocytes appeared to undergo tissue remodeling for enhanced adipose functionality, such as storage capacity. In contrast, the traditional features of dysfunctional adipose tissue, including inflammation, cell death, and stress response, were predominantly derived from Ad5–Ad6 adipocytes. They were also responsible for chromatin alterations and defective gene expression. On the other hand, the core functions of adipocytes, including lipid metabolism and insulin signaling, were generally impaired in all adipocyte subpopulations. The distinctions between obesity-induced features occurring in the entire adipocyte population versus specific adipocyte subpopulations may explain the outstanding effectiveness of PPARγ agonists, such as thiazolidinediones, in improving adipose function and glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soccio et al., 2014</xref>), surpassing the effects of other anti-inflammatory or anti-stress reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kraakman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">da Cruz Nascimento et al., 2022</xref>). Our discovery emphasizes the need to tailor therapeutic approaches based on the specific biological processes to be targeted to improve adipose tissue function during obesity.</p><p>In conclusion, this study introduces a robust nucleus isolation method for snRNA-seq, leading to enhanced data quality. This advancement has enabled the discovery of novel insights into the dynamics of adipose tissue remodeling during obesity. In addition, this method holds great promise for widespread applications across various research fields and clinical diagnoses, involving numerous types of biological samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p>All animal experiments were performed according to a protocol approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p><p>The mice were housed under a 12-hr light–dark cycle at 22°C with free access to food and water.</p><p>To label adipocyte nuclei, NuTRAP mice (Jackson Laboratory, 029899) were crossed with Adipoq-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory, 010803).

CellBender v0.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fleming et al., 2023</xref>) was applied to remove counts from ambient/background RNA. The CellBender output files (.h5 format) were read into R (version 4.3.1) using Seurat 4.3.0, and each sample was further filtered prior to downstream analyses based on the number of UMIs (≥500) and genes (≥250), mitochondrial ratio (&lt;15%), and the number of genes detected per UMI (&gt;0.8). At the gene level, genes detected less than 10 nuclei and mitochondrial genes were filtered. To identify and remove doublets, we employed DoubletFinder v2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McGinnis et al., 2019</xref>) using an estimated multiplet rate derived from the total number of recovered nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Integration, clustering, annotation, and subclustering</title><p>Gene counts were first normalized using <italic>SCTransform</italic>, and regressed on mitochondrial read ratio and cell cycle score by Seurat. For data integration among samples, we performed canonical correlation analysis to identify shared sources of variation among samples, focusing on 3000 genes. Next, we employed the <italic>FindIntegrationAnchors</italic> function to determine mutual nearest neighbors, commonly referred to as anchors. Then, utilizing the identified anchors, the datasets were integrated using the <italic>IntegrateData</italic> function. For graph-based clustering, we visualized the integrated data using dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis and uniform manifold approximation and projection, and clustered the nuclei with a resolution of 0.6. As a result, clusters were annotated as adipocytes, APC, mesothelial cells, endothelial cells, PC/SMC, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, T cells, and B cells using their marker genes. For further investigation, the integrated data were subdivided into separate objects by cell type and re-clustered to achieve higher resolutions, with minimal additional filtering applied to potential doublets. To understand distinct functionality of subclusters, if needed pathway analysis was performed on the marker genes using clusterProfiler v4.8.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). For visualization of gene expression levels within the specific cells, we used the R package called scCustomize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marsh, 2023</xref>) which generates plots where cells expressing the gene of interest can be superimposed on top of the negative cells with the argument of ‘order=TRUE’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Pseudobulk differential expression analysis and downstream analyses</title><p>To identify genes differentially expressed between chow and HFD conditions within particular cell types, we aggregated the counts and metadata to the sample level and compared the counts between conditions using edgeR v.3.42.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>).

The authors provide evidence that modifications to the existing protocols result in better RNA quality and nuclei integrity than previously observed, with ultimately greater coverage of the transcriptome upon sequencing. Using the modified protocol, the authors compare the cellular landscape of murine inguinal and perigonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) depots harvested from animals fed a standard chow diet (lean mice) or those fed a high-fat diet (mice with obesity).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written, and the data are clearly presented. The strengths of the manuscript rest in the description of an improved protocol for snRNA-seq analysis. This should be valuable for the growing number of investigators in the field of adipose tissue biology that are utilizing snRNA-seq technology, as well as those other fields attempting similar experiments with tissues possessing high levels of RNAse activity.</p><p>Moreover, the study makes some notable observations that provide the foundation for future investigation. One observation is the correlation between nuclei size and cell size, allowing for the transcriptomes of relatively hypertrophic adipocytes in perigonadal WAT to be examined.

The authors provide evidence that modifications to the existing protocols result in better RNA quality and nuclei integrity than previously observed, with ultimately greater coverage of the transcriptome upon sequencing. Using the modified protocol, the authors compare the cellular landscape of murine inguinal and perigonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) depots harvested from animals fed a standard chow diet (lean mice) or those fed a high-fat diet (mice with obesity).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well-written, and the data are clearly presented. The strengths of the manuscript rest in the description of an improved protocol for snRNA-seq analysis. This should be valuable for the growing number of investigators in the field of adipose tissue biology that are utilizing snRNA-seq technology, as well as those other fields attempting similar experiments with tissues possessing high levels of RNAse activity.</p><p>Moreover, the study makes some notable observations that provide the foundation for future investigation. One observation is the correlation between nuclei size and cell size, allowing for the transcriptomes of relatively hypertrophic adipocytes in perigonadal WAT to be examined. Another notable observation is the identification of an adipocyte subcluster (Ad6) that appears &quot;stressed&quot; or dysfunctional and likely localizes to crown-like inflammatory structures where proinflammatory immune cells reside.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Analogous studies have been reported in the literature, including a notable study from Savari et al. (Cell Metabolism). This somewhat diminishes the novelty of some of the biological findings presented here. Moreover, a direct comparison of the transcriptomic data derived from the new vs. existing protocols (i.e. fully executed side by side) was not presented. As such, the true benefit of the protocol modifications cannot be fully understood.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment on the limitations of our study. Following the reviewer's suggestion, we performed a new analysis by integrating our data with those from the study by Emont et al. Please refer to the Recommendation for authors section below for further details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the present manuscript So et al utilize single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize cell populations in lean and obese adipose tissues.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors utilize a modified nuclear isolation protocol incorporating VRC that results in higherquality sequencing reads compared with previous studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The use of VRC to enhance snRNA-seq has been previously published in other tissues.

These cell populations have been extensively characterized by cytoplasmic scRNA-seq which can achieve sufficient sequencing depth, and thus this study does not contribute meaningful additional insight into these cell types. The authors note an increase in the number of rare endothelial cell types recovered, however this is not translated into any kind of functional analysis of these populations.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer's comments on the limitations of our study, particularly the lack of extension of our snRNA-seq data into functional studies of new biological processes. However, this manuscript has been submitted as a Tools and Resources article. As an article of this type, we provide detailed information on our snRNA-seq methods and present a valuable resource of high-quality mouse adipose tissue snRNA-seq data. In addition, we demonstrate that our improved method offers novel biological insights, including the identification of subpopulations of adipocytes categorized by size and functionality. We believe this study offers powerful tools and significant value to the research community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: The authors did not provide any evidence that the relative fluorescent brightness of GFP and mCherry is a direct measure of the nuclear size, and the nuclear size is only a moderate correlation with the cell size. Thus sorting the nuclei based on GFP/mCherry brightness is not a great proxy for adipocyte diameter. Furthermore, no meaningful insights are provided about the functional significance of the reported transcriptional differences between small and large adipocyte nuclei.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer's point, we analyzed the Pearson correlation coefficient for nucleus size vs. adipocyte size and found R = 0.85, indicating a strong positive correlation. In addition, we performed a new experiment to determine the correlation between nuclear GFP intensity and adipocyte nucleus size, finding a strong correlation with R = 0.91. These results suggest that nuclear GFP intensity can be a strong proxy for adipocyte size. Furthermore, we performed gene ontology analysis on genes differentially regulated between large and small adipocyte nuclei. We found that large adipocytes promote processes involved in insulin response, vascularization and DNA repair, while inhibiting processes related to cell migration, metabolism and the cytoskeleton. We have added these new data as Figure 4E, Figure 4-figure supplement 1E, G, and H (page 11)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5-6: The Ad6 population is highly transcriptionally analogous to the mAd3 population from Emont et al, and is thus not a novel finding. Furthermore, in the present data set, the authors conclude that Ad6 are likely stressed/dying hypertrophic adipocytes with a global loss of gene expression, which is a well-documented finding in eWAT &gt; iWAT, for which the snRNA-seq reported in the present manuscript does not provide any novel scientific insight.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, a new analysis integrating our data with the previous study found that Ad3 from our study is comparable to mAd3 from Emont et al. in gene expression profiles. However, significant discrepancies in population size and changes in response to obesity were observed, likely due to differences in technical robustness. The dysfunctional cellular state of this population, with compromised RNA content, may have hindered accurate capture in the previous study, while our protocol enabled precise detection. This underscores the importance of our improved snRNA-seq protocol for accurately understanding adipocyte population dynamics. We have revised the manuscript to include new data in Figure 6-figure supplement 1 (page 14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aimed to improve single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to address current limitations and challenges with nuclei and RNA isolation quality.

We attempted to identify human adipocyte subclusters that resemble the metabolically unhealthy Ad6 adipocytes found in mice in our study; however, we did not find any similar adipocyte types. It has been reported that human adipocyte heterogeneity does not correspond well to that of mouse adipocytes (Emont et al. 2022). In addition, the heterogeneity of human adipocyte populations is not reproducible between different studies (Massier et al. 2023). Interestingly, this inconsistency is unique to adipocytes, as other cell types in adipose tissues display reproducible sub cell types across species and studies (Massier et al. 2023). Our findings indicate that adipocytes may exhibit a unique pathological cellular state with significantly reduced RNA content, which may contribute to the poor consistency in adipocyte heterogeneity in prior studies with suboptimal RNA quality. Therefore, using a robust method to effectively preserve RNA quality may be critical for accurately characterizing adipocyte populations, especially in disease states. It may be important to test in future studies whether our snRNA-seq protocol can identify consistent heterogeneity in adipocyte populations across different species, studies, and individual human subjects. We have revised the manuscript to include this new discussion (page 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Suggested points to address:</p><p>(1) The authors suggest that their improved protocol for maintaining RNA/nucleus integrity results in a more comprehensive analysis of adipose tissue heterogeneity. The authors compare the quality of their snRNA-seq data to those generated in prior studies (e.g., Savari et al.). What is not clear is whether additional heterogeneity/clusters can be observed due directly to the protocol modifications. A direct head-to-head comparison of the protocols executed in parallel would of course be ideal; however, integrating their new dataset with the corresponding data from Savari et al. could help address this question and help readers understand the benefits of this new protocol vs. existing protocols.</p></disp-quote><p>The data from Savari et al. are of significantly lower quality, likely because they were generated using earlier versions of the 10X Genomics system, and this study lacks iWAT data. To address the reviewer’s point, we instead integrated our data with those from the other study by Emont et al. (2022), which used comparable tissue types and experimental systems. The integrated analysis confirmed the improved representation of all cell types present in adipose tissues in our study, with higher quality metrics such as increased Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) and the number of genes per nucleus. These results indicate that our protocol offers significant advantages in generating a more accurate representation of each cell type and their gene expression profiles. New data are included in Figure 2-figure supplement 2 (page 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The exact frequency of the Ad6 population in eWAT of mice maintained on HFD is a little unclear. From the snRNA-seq data, it appears that roughly 47% of the adipocytes are in this &quot;stressed state.&quot; In Figure 6, it appears that greater than 75% of the adipocytes express B2M (Ad6 marker) and greater than 75% of adipocytes are suggested to be devoid of measurable PPARg expression. The latter seems quite high as PPARg expression is essential to maintain the adipocyte phenotype. Is there evidence of de-differentiation amongst them (i.e. acquisition of progenitor cell markers)? Presenting separate UMAPs for the chow vs. HFD state may help visualize the frequency of each adipocyte population in the two states. Inclusion of the stromal/progenitor cells in the visualization may help understand if cells are de-differentiating in obesity as previously postulated by the authors. Related to Point # 1 above, is this population observed in prior studies and at a similar frequency?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s point, we analyzed the expression of adipocyte progenitor cell (APC) markers, such as Pdgfra, in the Ad6 population. We did not detect significant expression of APC markers, suggesting that Ad6 does not represent dedifferentiating adipocytes. Instead, they are likely stressed and dying cells characterized by an aberrant state of transcription with a global decline.</p><p>When integrating our data with the datasets by Emont et al., we observed an adipocyte population in the previous study, mAd3, comparable to Ad6 in our study, with similar marker gene expression and lower transcript abundance. However, the population size of mAd3 was much smaller than that of Ad6 in our data and did not show consistent population changes during obesity. This discrepancy may be due to different technical robustness; the dysfunctional cellular state of this population, with its severely compromised RNA contents, may have made it difficult to accurately capture using standard protocols in the previous study, while our protocol enabled robust and precise detection. We added new data in Figure 4-figure supplement 1I and Figure 6-figure supplement 17 (page 14) and revised the Discussion (page 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional points</p><p>(1) The authors should be cautious in describing subpopulations as &quot;increasing&quot; or &quot;decreasing&quot; in obesity as the data are presented as proportions of a parent population. A given cell population may be &quot;relatively increased.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer's point, we revised the manuscript to clarify the &quot;relative&quot; changes in cell populations during obesity in the relevant sections (pages 8, 9, 10, 11, and 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should also be cautious in ascribing &quot;function&quot; to adipocyte populations based solely on their expression signatures. Statements such as those in the abstract, &quot;...providing novel insights into the mechanisms orchestrating adipose tissue remodeling during obesity...&quot; should probably be toned down as no such mechanism is truly demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer's point, we revised the manuscript by removing or replacing the indicated terms or phrases with more suitable wording in the appropriate sections (page 2, 10, 12, 14)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors might consider expanding a discussion on the potential implications of their findings, especially the newly identified adipocyte subpopulations and depot-specific differences for human studies.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s point, we attempted to identify human adipocyte subclusters that resembled our dysfunctional Ad6 adipocytes in mice; however, we did not find any similar adipocyte types.
