homes, as SARS-CoV-2 is readily transmitted and causes disproportionately severe disease in older people. Here, 1167 residents from 337 care homes were identified from a dataset of 6600 COVID-19 cases from the East of England. Older age and being a care home resident were associated with increased mortality. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available for 700 residents from 292 care homes. By integrating genomic and temporal data, 409 viral clusters within the 292 homes were identified, indicating two different patterns – outbreaks among care home residents and independent introductions with limited onward transmission. Approximately 70% of residents in the genomic analysis were admitted to hospital during the study, providing extensive opportunities for transmission between care homes and hospitals. Limiting viral transmission within care homes should be a key target for infection control to reduce COVID-19 mortality in this population.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COG-UK MC-PC-19027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peacock</surname><given-names>Sharon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COG-UK MC-PC-19027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peacock</surname><given-names>Sharon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COG-UK MC-PC-19027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peacock</surname><given-names>Sharon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Fellowship 207498/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodfellow</surname><given-names>Ian G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000691</institution-id><institution>Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Clinician Scientist Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torok</surname><given-names>M Estee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000724</institution-id><institution>Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Clinician Scientist Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torok</surname><given-names>M Estee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamilton</surname><given-names>William L</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Emily R</given-names></name><name><surname>Warne</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name><name><surname>Torok</surname><given-names>M Estee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collabrative grant 204870/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houldcroft</surname><given-names>Charlotte J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SARS-CoV-2 can spread efficiently within care homes causing outbreaks among residents, who are at increased risk of severe disease, emphasising the importance of stringent infection control in this population.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Care homes are at high risk of experiencing outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 is associated with higher mortality in older people and those with comorbidities including cardiovascular and respiratory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>), making the care home population especially vulnerable. As of week ending 30th June 2020, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that 30.2% of all deaths due to COVID-19 (13,417 deaths) in England occurred in care homes, and 63.9% (28,390 deaths) occurred in hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Office for National Statistics, 2020a</xref>). Most of the COVID-19 deaths in hospital were in persons aged 65 years and over (86.1%). Deaths due to confirmed COVID-19 from this period may be underestimates due to limitations on diagnostic testing; the ONS estimates that from 28 December 2019 to 12 June 2020, there were 29,393 excess deaths in care homes compared to the expected number based on previous years, of which only two thirds are explained by recorded COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Office for National Statistics, 2020b</xref>). To date, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in care homes has not been systematically studied with linkage of epidemiological and genomic data on a large scale.</p><p>Care homes are defined by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the independent regulator of adult health and social care in England, as ‘places where personal care and accommodation are provided together’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Care Quality Commission, 2020a</xref>). In 2011, 291,000 people aged 65 or older were living in care homes in England and Wales, representing 3.2% of the total population at this age; 82.5% of the care home population was aged 65 years or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Office for National Statistics, 2014</xref>). Care homes are known to be high-risk settings for infectious diseases, owing to a combination of the underlying vulnerability of residents who are often frail and elderly with multiple comorbidities, the shared living environment with multiple communal spaces, and the high number of interpersonal contacts between residents, staff, and visitors in an enclosed space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curran, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lansbury et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strausbaugh et al., 2003</xref>). Understanding the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within care homes is therefore an urgent public health priority.</p><p>Rapid SARS-CoV-2 sequencing combined with detailed epidemiological analysis has been used to trace viral transmission networks in hospital and community-based healthcare settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>). This study was based in Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH), a secondary care provider and tertiary referral centre in the East of England, UK. The study focused on identifying hospital-acquired and healthcare-associated infections by integrating genomic and epidemiological data with hospital Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) systems. While clusters involving care home residents and healthcare workers were observed, the study was not intended to analyse care home transmission specifically and focused on samples tested at CUH to provide information for IPC on potentially hospital-acquired infections. Previous epidemiological studies of COVID-19 specifically in care homes have been limited in population size, temporal scale and/or the amount of genomic data included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kemenesi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quicke et al., 2020</xref>). Here, genomic epidemiology is used to investigate viral transmission dynamics in care home residents across the East of England (EoE), the fourth largest of the nine official regions in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Office for National Statistics, 2011</xref>). Several key questions of public health concern are addressed: What is the burden of care-home-associated COVID-19 tested in the region? What are the outcomes for care home residents admitted to hospital with COVID-19? Does SARS-CoV-2 spread between care home residents from the same care home via a single introduction and subsequent transmission, or through multiple independent acquisitions of the virus among residents? Finally, is there evidence of viral transmission between care homes and hospitals?</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>COVID-19 case numbers from care home and non-care home residents included in the study</title><p>A total of 7,406 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from 6600 individuals were identified in the study period (26th February to 10th May 2020) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and care home residency status was determined in 6413 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) – the remaining 187 cases had missing address data and care home status could not be determined. The samples were tested at the Public Health England (PHE) Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory (CMPHL) in Cambridge, which receives samples from across the East of England (EoE). Positive cases came from 37 submitting organisations including regional hospital laboratories and community-based testing services (Supplementary Materials). The proportion of samples coming from different sources changed over the study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This likely reflects a combination of regional hospitals establishing their own testing facilities, increasing availability of community testing in the UK, and the implementation of national policies that increased the scope of care home testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Overall, the study population included almost half of the COVID-19 cases diagnosed in the EoE at this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Public Health England, 2020a</xref>), with the remainder being tested at other laboratory sites.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study flow diagram Out of 6600 patients testing positive in the Cambridge Microbiology Public Health Laboratory (CMPHL) during the study period, 1167 were identified as being care home residents from 337 care homes.</title><p>(The methodology for assigning care home status is described in main text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The resulting list was manually inspected and every care home included in the study was linked to a registered CQC care home. CQC coding of whether the care home had nursing care available was used (referred to as ‘nursing homes’ if nursing care was available and ‘residential homes’ if not). If the address information was incomplete (no postcode and/or no address line) then the case was excluded as impossible to determine whether or not the patient was from a care home, unless the person was known to be a healthcare worker (HCW), in which case it was assumed they were not a care home resident. This process yielded the final result of 1167 care home residents from 337 care homes; 5246 individuals that were not care home residents, and 187 individuals that were indeterminable.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64618-fig1-figsupp1-v3.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Breakdown of main organisations submitting samples to Cambridge PHE Laboratory over study period per week.</title><p>Only showing sites that submitted samples from &gt;50 people with positive test results over study period, otherwise counted as ‘Other’. To maintain patient anonymity, per time interval only showing sites that submitted samples from &gt;5 people with positive test results (otherwise counted as ‘Other’).

Without genomic data (or access to more detailed epidemiology such as accommodation sub-structuring within care homes), clustering can only be based on temporal differences between cases. For example, if two groups of COVID-19 cases occur several months apart within a care home they could be inferred to have resulted from (at least) two separate introductions. However, this method cannot account for multiple introductions occurring around the same time, as may happen when community transmission is high. To quantify the impact made by adding genomic data, which can distinguish between genetically dissimilar viruses introduced at similar times, the <italic>transcluster</italic> algorithm was repeated using the same parameters as for the main analysis but assuming all genomes were identical. This yielded 316 clusters – 23% fewer than the 409 clusters yielded when incorporating genomics. This suggests that genomics makes a significant contribution to defining viral clusters; without genomic data, cluster sizes may be over-estimated and the number of separate viral introductions under-estimated. This is illustrated by care home CARE0263, in which all 12 residents tested positive within 3 days of each-other, but these are divided into three separate clusters by the <italic>transcluster</italic> algorithm (one dominant cluster of nine cases, one cluster of two cases and a single separate case (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>)); this is consistent with the phylogeny shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, with samples split into three branches along the tree. Without genomic data, the three clusters in CARE0263 would have been impossible to distinguish.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Links between care homes and hospitals</title><p>Links between care homes and hospitals were investigated for the 700 care home residents with genomic data available.

This analysis comprised 54 care home residents tested at CUH and 76 HCW with genomic data available. Clusters were defined using the same method as for the care home resident analysis (described above), but allowing HCW to belong to clusters from multiple care homes, so residents from several care homes could be linked to the same HCW. 38/54 (70.4%) care home residents had possible links with HCW using this relaxed threshold. However, on review of the medical records we could only identify strong epidemiological links for 14/54 (26.0%) residents from two care home clusters, CARE0063 and CARE0114. The CARE0063 cluster has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>) and includes care home residents, a carer from that same care home and another from an unknown care home, paramedics and people living with the above. The CARE0114 cluster comprises several care home residents and acute medical staff working at CUH who cared for at least one of the residents. The <italic>transcluster</italic> method does not assign probabilities for directionality of transmission and cannot determine precise person-to-person transmission chains. While all residents from a care home cluster may link to a given HCW, in reality the resident-HCW transmission event may have only involved one of the residents from that cluster, so the proportion of residents with links to HCW may be inflated. Nonetheless, these data show that two care home clusters involved HCW, one based mainly in the community and the other with hospital-based staff at CUH.</p><p>Residents from a third care home, CARE0273, also had strong transmission links to the paramedics and carers involved in the CARE0063 cluster. These two care homes are within 1 km of each-other and the cases cluster together on the phylogenetic tree, raising the possibility of shared transmission between them. A plausible transmission network connecting the residents at these two care homes and the shared HCWs could be made with at most zero SNPs and 3 days between sampled cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>); these links are in the top 1.1% of all pairwise transmission probabilities inferred using the <italic>transcluster</italic> algorithm. However, without confirmatory epidemiological data this interpretation remains speculative.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in care homes in the East of England was investigated. Care home residents comprised a large fraction of COVID-19 diagnoses in the ‘first wave’ of the pandemic in this region: up to a quarter of patients in the peak weeks of late March and early April tested at CUH were admitted from care homes. Older age and being from a care home were correlated with each other and were both associated with significantly increased odds of mortality within 30 days of diagnosis. Care home residents thus bore a high burden of COVID-19 infections and mortality.</p><p>A smaller proportion of care home residents were admitted to ICU compared with people who were not from care homes. What treatments a patient receives, including the invasive treatments provided in intensive care, are complex and individualised decisions based on risk-benefit assessments involving patients, their families and carers, and healthcare professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">ICS, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">NICE, 2020</xref>). Of note, non-invasive respiratory support (such as continuous positive airway pressure, high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation) are routinely provided outside ICU in many UK centres. Despite care home residents being at higher risk of severe COVID-19, and being under-represented in ICU, admission to ICU was still correlated with significantly increased mortality. This is likely because patients admitted to ICU have more severe disease, typically requiring more intensive treatments such as organ support.</p><p>Viral clusters were defined within each care home by integrating temporal and genetic differences between cases. This provides a ‘high resolution’ picture of viral transmission; without genomic data, separate introductions of the virus occurring around the same time are impossible to distinguish. Care homes frequently experienced ‘outbreaks’ of multiple cases within clusters (the largest of which had &gt;10 residents), consistent with substantial person-to-person transmission taking place within care homes. Care homes also frequently had multiple distinct clusters (up to 4), consistent with independent acquisitions of COVID-19 among residents – however, a single dominant cluster usually comprised the majority of samples within each care home. The majority of care home residents in the genomic analysis did not acquire COVID-19 in hospital. In the context of a national lockdown, the most likely location they acquired their infection was the care home. The high frequency of care home outbreaks may reflect the underlying vulnerability of this population to COVID-19 and the challenges of infection control in care homes. In contrast, the UK as a whole had an average of 2.37 people per household in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Office for National Statistics, 2019a</xref> and in the East region only 2.2% of households were made up of two or more unrelated adults (6.2% in London) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Office for National Statistics, 2019b</xref>).</p><p>These findings emphasise the importance of limiting viral transmission within care homes in order to prevent outbreaks. Given there is increasing evidence for asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2020</xref>), isolating residents or staff when they develop symptoms is not sufficient to prevent within-care home spread once the virus has entered the care home. Certain measures may be required on an ongoing basis within care homes when there is sustained community transmission, even when no outbreak is suspected (at least until the morbidity and mortality of the virus in older people has been reduced substantially through vaccination or treatments). These may include use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for staff and visitors (including visiting healthcare professionals and friends and family), rigorous hand hygiene, social distancing, and making use of larger, well-ventilated rooms for social interactions or socialising outdoors, providing that this is practical and safe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2020b</xref>). This is consistent with current national guidance for care homes in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Public Health England, 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">UK government, 2020b</xref>). Face coverings for residents themselves when interacting socially in communal indoor areas could be considered, if acceptable to residents.</p><p>The majority of residents had hospital contact during the study period, indicating substantial opportunity for infections to pass between care homes and hospitals in either direction. A third of patients were discharged from hospital within 7 days of their first positive test, and thus were potentially infectious at discharge. We identified transmission clusters that would be consistent with COVID-19 spread between care home residents and HCW, based both in the community and in hospitals. A previous study found that working across different homes was associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 positivity among staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ladhani et al., 2020</xref>). Limiting the spread of COVID-19 between care home residents, HCW and hospitals is a therefore another key target for infection control and prevention.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. First, not all of the COVID-19 cases from the East of England have been included. Serology data suggest that 10.5% of all residents in care homes for people aged 65 and older in England had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by early June, the majority of whom were asymptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">UK government, 2020c</xref>). The Cambridge CMPHL did not receive all the samples tested from the region; national data indicate around half of the COVID-19 cases reported from EoE during the study were included. Viral sequence data were not available for 40% of care home residents, as a result of missing samples, mismatches between sequences and metadata, genomes not passing quality control filtering using a stringent threshold (&lt;10% missing calls), or sequences being unavailable at the time of data extraction. Viral cluster sizes may therefore be underestimated.</p><p>Second, the nature of diagnostic testing sites changed during the study period as regional hospitals developed their own in-house testing capacity and community testing laboratories were set up. ‘Pillar 2’ testing in the UK was outsourced to high-throughput laboratories during April 2020 and performed an increasing proportion of community testing. It is possible that some care home residents from the same care home could have been tested through different routes, with symptomatic cases more likely to be tested in ‘Pillar 1’ via the CMPHL (and included in this dataset), and asymptomatic screening occurring more via the Pillar two laboratories. However, most care homes in EoE only began systematic screening after the end of our study following the introduction of the UK care home testing portal on 11th May 2020. Moreover, the <italic>transcluster</italic> algorithm allows for ‘missing links’ within a cluster (the threshold used assumed a <underline>&gt; </underline>15% probability of infections being linked within <underline>&lt;</underline>2 intermediate hosts), reducing the impact of missing care home cases on defined clusters. The changing profile of COVID-19 testing in the UK between March and May 2020 should therefore be factored into all interpretations of COVID-19 epidemiology from that period.</p><p>Third, defining who is a care home resident from large electronic healthcare records is challenging and, despite substantial efforts (described in Materials and methods), some care home residents may have been missed. Using pre-defined coding such as care home CQC registration numbers when patients are booked into hospital systems, rather than free-text data entry, would help considerably with care home surveillance. Multiple rounds of electronic searches and manual inspection were undertaken to identify as many care home residents as possible, and every care home resident included was cross-referenced against a CQC database of registered care homes in England. The care homes included for analysis should therefore be accurate.</p><p>Fourth, low viral sequence diversity limits the power of genomics to infer transmission clusters. Between-care home transmission was not investigated specifically because, unlike within-care home cases, opportunities for transfer of SARS-CoV-2 between care homes cannot be assumed or inferred from the data. This could be assessed in a dedicated prospective study gathering epidemiological data on between-care home contacts. Even within care homes, it is possible some genetically similar viruses are from unconnected introduction events. However, incorporating genomic data is more accurate for excluding linked transmission than if only temporal data are available. Genomics can thus be used to ‘rule out’ cases as being part of a linked cluster if the genetic difference is greater than would be expected given the viral mutation rate. This could be practically informative for care homes (along with other organisations at risk of COVID-19 outbreaks like factories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Middleton et al., 2020</xref>), with implications for infection control procedures. Directionality of person-to-person transmission cannot be inferred from the <italic>transcluster</italic> algorithm. Inferring the likelihood of transmission direction between pairs of individuals requires integration with multiple forms of epidemiological data, yielding a probabilistic estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Illingworth et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, care homes represent a major burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, with transmission events introducing SARS-CoV-2 into care homes and subsequent transmission within them. Genomic data can be used in outbreak investigations to define viral clusters; this is critically dependent on integration with epidemiological data. The cut-offs we used for defining care home clusters were pragmatic but plausible given current understanding of the biology and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Such cut-offs can be helpful for producing understandable outputs for biological and public health interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacFadden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stimson et al., 2019</xref>), and for focusing investigations with limited public health resources. Future work will need to prospectively integrate genomic and epidemiological data to rapidly identify viral clusters, thus enabling deployment of infection control and public health interventions in real time.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study overview</title><p>Data were collected on SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from the East of England, tested at the PHE CMPHL in Cambridge, between 26th February and 10th May 2020. The CMPHL is a PHE diagnostic laboratory that receives samples from across the East of England. The East of England is one of nine official regions in England. In the 2011 census, it had a population of 5,847,000, one of the fastest growing populations in England and Wales and the fourth largest population of the nine official regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Office for National Statistics, 2011</xref>). The most populous cities include Luton, Norwich, Southend-on-Sea, and Peterborough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">City Population, 2020</xref>). The 10th May was selected as a study end-date because it encompassed the bulk of the ‘first wave’ of the epidemic in the East of England. Furthermore, prior to the 11th May 2020, systematic screening of all residents within care homes was much less common and testing primarily occurred where there was a suspicion of an outbreak. The UK government launched a national care home testing portal on 11th May 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">UK government, 2020d</xref>), in which all care home staff and residents were eligible for testing with priority for homes caring for people aged 65 years or older. Ending the study on 10th May reduces the risk of bias which may be introduced by uneven systematic screening, for example when comparing the population genetics of care home and non-care home samples, if care homes undergo screening while non-care home settings do not. During the study period, the scope of testing in hospital, community, and care home settings changed several times, as eligibility criteria were modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). When interpreting trends in COVID-19 cases in the UK during this period it is essential to consider the changing capacity and policies surrounding testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Diagnostic testing, metadata collection, and genome sequencing</title><p>For details on diagnostic testing, patient metadata collection, and nanopore genome sequencing see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>.

Samples that generated a Ct value <underline>&lt;</underline>36 were considered positive. The study aimed to sequence all samples which tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive at the CMPHL during the study period. Sequencing of every positive diagnostic sample could not be performed, however, for the following reasons: (i) sample unavailability (e.g. diagnostic samples being lost or discarded before they could be collected by the sequencing team); (ii) labelling errors when assigning sequencing codes (which resulted in specimens being discarded); or (iii) metadata mismatches (if the sample did not match to a metadata record downloaded from the hospital electronic patient records system). Samples were either sequenced on site using Oxford Nanopore Technologies or transported to the Wellcome Sanger Institute for Illumina sequencing.</p><p>Samples from Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) and a selection of East of England (EoE) samples were sequenced on site to provide rapid information on hospital-acquired infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>). Nanopore sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) took place in the Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, following the ARTICnetwork V3 protocol and assembled using the ARTICnetwork assembly pipeline. The sequencing workflow involved a directional sample flow as used in a diagnostic laboratory which includes separated pre- and post-PCR areas, with dedicated equipment for each stage of the process. All steps were performed in PCR cabinets which were cleaned using DNA removal solutions and a UV decontamination cycle run after each batch. All sequencing batches included at least one water negative control carried over from the reverse-transcription step. Mapped reads were assessed in real-time during sequencing with RAMPART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hadfield, 2020</xref>) and all data from batches containing a contaminated negative control were discarded before sequence assembly. The remaining EoE samples, where available, were sent to the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI) for sequencing.</p><p>Sequencing at WSI used Illumina technology. cDNA was generated from SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid extracts and subsequently amplified to produce 400nt amplicons tiling the viral genome using V3 nCov-2019 primers (ARTIC). This was followed by Illumina library generation using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs Inc, Cat. No. E7645L). Libraries were amplified with KAPA HiFi Ready Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Cat. No. 07958927001) and uniquely indexed with a 100 µM i5 and i7 primer mix (50 µM each) (Integrated DNA Technologies) to allow multiplexing of up to 384 SARS-CoV-2 viral extracts into one sequencing pool. The PCR products were pooled in equal volume and purified with an AMPure XP workflow (Beckman Coulter, Cat. No. A63880). The purified pool was quantified by qPCR (Illumina Library Quantitation Complete kit, Cat.

Sequencing read counts are considered after a clipping and minimum alignment length filtering step (corresponding to data which is used to create consensus sequence or variant calls). Such read counts for the samples analysed in this study were typically in the millions (median: 4,497,543). If such read counts for the corresponding negative controls are &gt;100 then the samples are currently failed. This QC procedure was introduced for samples analysed on or after the 18th of April. Of the 1007 samples analysed in this study sequenced at WSI (503 care home residents and 504 non-care home residents), 749 were sequenced once this workflow was established, 242 were sequenced before this but had a negative control and 16 did not have a negative control. If we apply the current criteria then 38 of these earlier samples would have failed (38/1400 = 2.7% of the analysed samples). Of these 38 samples, 26 are non-care home samples and 12 are from care homes. Of the 12 care home samples (12/700 = 1.7% total care home genomes analysed), one belongs to one of the ‘top 10’ care homes with the largest number of genomes, care home CARE0063, which comprises a single cluster of 12 genomes using the <italic>transcluster</italic> algorithm, described in main text. Thus, the main result of our genomic cluster analysis (that multiple introductions are often observed in care homes, but typically a single dominant cluster causes most of the cases) would not be altered by the small number of early genomes included that would now be excluded by current criteria.</p><p>Sequences were available from both Illumina and Nanopore platforms for eight care home residents included in the study (in all cases the Illumina data were used for the study analysis).

In one case, there were two SNP differences between the consensus fasta sequences: C1884T and C16351T; for both SNPs, the Illumina sequence matched the reference genome (C) and the nanopore sequence had the alt call (T).

There are several reasons why pairwise comparisons between different sequences from the same individual may not be identical, even if both sequences are produced using the same technology. When the cycle threshold (Ct) of a sample is near the limit of detection sensitivity, and/or RNA is degraded (e.g. due to delays between sampling and sequencing at room temperature), it is likely that amplicons that are not as efficiently amplified by the multiplex PCR may have low read coverage, or could be more sensitive to amplification bias. In this case, the samples both had high Ct values: CAMB-1AE7C2 (sequenced by Illumina at WSI) had Ct value of 30 and CAMB-1AC269 (nanopore sequenced in Cambridge) had a Ct value of 31. Median Ct value for the 700 care home residents with genomes analysed was 24 (interquartile range: 20–27) (data displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). If an individual is infected with more than one clone at significant frequency, it is also possible for stochastic variation in read counts for the two variants to yield different consensus calls at the variant locus. However, larger studies have systematically evaluated sequencing quality for SARS-CoV-2 between Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) and Illumina, and demonstrated highly accurate consensus-level sequence determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bull et al., 2020</xref>). Given this degree of consensus sequence accuracy, and because <italic>transcluster</italic> uses a transmission probability cut-off based on integrating pairwise SNP and temporal differences (rather than relying solely on a strict SNP cut-off), limited sequencing noise is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the clusters identified.</p><p>COG-UK IDs and GISAID accession numbers for genomes analysed in this study are included in Supplementary Materials, along with a complete author list for the COG-UK consortium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sample selection</title><p>As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>, patient metadata were downloaded daily from the electronic medical record system (Epic Systems, Verona, WI, USA) and metadata manipulations were performed in R (v 3.6.2) using the <italic>tidyverse</italic> packages (v 1.3.0) installed on CUH computers.

To capture these facilities, we used the publicly available database of care homes registered to the CQC, the independent regulator of health and adult social care in England. All organisations providing accommodation for persons who require nursing or personal care must be registered with the CQC, including care homes with or without nursing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Care Quality Commission, 2020b</xref>). Details of the CQC registration scope can be found in 'The scope of registration (Registration under the Health and Social Care Act 2008)', March 2015, available at this link as of 24th June 2020: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Care Quality Commission, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The file ‘CQC care directory – with filters (1 June 2020)’ was accessed on 23rd June 2020 from the CQC website: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Care Quality Commission, 2020c</xref>), and the following filters were applied:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Total facilities in CQC database: N = 49,516,516</p></list-item><list-item><p>Carehome?’ column filtered to ‘Y’: N = 15,507*</p></list-item><list-item><p>Only care homes for which the ‘Location Postal Code’ column matched at least one postcode from the dataset of 6600 patients were included, yielding N = 444 care homes.**</p></list-item><list-item><p>Following manual review and consistifying postcodes with the sample metadata, a set of 469 CQC registered care homes were included.***</p></list-item></list><p>*Filtering using the ‘carehome?’ column was based on advice given after correspondence with the CQC.</p><p>** Requiring CQC registered care homes to match postcodes from the patient dataset minimised the number of ‘false positives’ – patients whose address name matched a CQC registered care home name by coincidence.</p><p>*** 25 CQC registered care homes were added following manual review of the identified putative care home residents, who had a different postcode documented in the electronic healthcare records for the same care home, yielding the final ‘CQC EoE care home search set’ of 469 care homes.</p><p>We then used the values from the ‘Location name’ column of the filtered CQC dataset (i.e. the care home facility names) as search phrases for address line one in the patient database. Any patients with exactly matching phrases were labelled as care home residents. This increased the number of care home residents identified by a further 382–1147, that is, around one third of care home residents were identified using CQC facility names and would have been missed by relying on generic care home-related search phrases alone.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Step 3: manual inspection and data clean up</title><p>Address lines for the non-care home patients were manually inspected; this identified a further 89 care home residents. Most of these had not been detected in steps 1 and 2 due to spelling or formatting issues with the patient addresses (e.g. short-hand abbreviations used for care home names, or inclusion of extra details like flat number meaning the string did not match a CQC care home name exactly).</p><p>Next, address lines for the care home residents were manually inspected and 14 were deemed not to be care home residents. Most of these were due to unrelated locations sharing the same address name as a CQC registered care home. The manual filtering steps thus yielded a care home resident count of 1147 + 89–14 = 1222. Address line 1 for all 1222 care home residents was manually inspected and formatted to ensure residents from the same care home had matching terms in this column. This was necessary due to discrepant address entrance formats for identical care homes; without this step, residents from the same care home would be incorrectly assigned to different anonymised care home codes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Step 4: linking care home addresses to CQC registered care homes</title><p>First line of patient address and postcodes were matched to care home names and postcodes from the CQC EoE care home search set (described above). Any discrepancies (care homes not matching the CQC data) were manually inspected and in the majority of cases the discrepancy could be reconciled (e.g. alternative name or postcode used for the same care home). In 55 cases, a ‘care home’ was reclassified to non-care home, either because the address was independent housing with a matching name to a care home by coincidence, or because a care facility was determined by CQC definitions to not be a care home – for example several mental health community hospitals, drug rehabilitation centres, and supported living environments were excluded. This yielded the final analysis set of 1222–55 = 1167 care home residents, from 337 care homes. All 337 care homes included were therefore linked to CQC data; in two cases, the care home had been previously registered but had since been ‘archived’, and the most recent CQC data for defining whether residential or nursing care was being provided was used.</p><p>Care home location IDs assigned by the CQC were turned into anonymised codes (format: CARE followed by a four-digit numeric code). Care homes were classified as ‘residential homes’ or ‘nursing homes’ using the CQC data column ‘Service type - Care home service with nursing’ filtered to ‘Y’ for care homes with nursing, and column ‘Service type - Care home service without nursing’ = ‘Y’ for care homes without nursing (‘residential homes’). If both fields were ‘Y’ then the care home was coded as being a nursing home.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Linking care home data to CUH acute medical testing data</title><p>The dataset of 7407 PCR-positive samples with metadata were collected prospectively as part of the COG-UK study in Cambridge.

Of 23, 21 of these were tested on the SAMBA platform at CUH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collier et al., 2020</xref>), which is not PCR-based; sequencing was not possible for these samples owing to rapid RNA degradation. For technical reasons, SAMBA results were not included in the data collected prospectively in the Cambridge COG-UK study. The remaining two discrepancies were not captured in the electronic patient record downloads, which likely reflects periods where the download processes and coding methods were being established. Of the 23 missing samples, 20 were community-onset community-associated, two were hospital-onset indeterminate healthcare-associated, and one was a healthcare worker. These are counted as such and depicted with the above categorisations in the CUH epidemic curve shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.

Days between first positive sampling date for pairs of individuals was used as a proxy for generation time. As above, where collection date was missing, the date the sample was received in the Cambridge PHE laboratory was used. The resulting pairwise transmission probabilities were used to generate a pairwise distance matrix and clustering was performed using single linkage hierarchical clustering with the R <italic>hclust</italic> function. Links were only considered if they involved residents from the same care home; thus, the largest theoretical number of clusters in this analysis would be 700 (every individual is their own distinct cluster), and the smallest would be 292 (one cluster for each care home).</p><p>The relationship between the probability of infections being linked by <underline>&lt;</underline>2 intermediate hosts and the resulting number of care home clusters was explored. A higher threshold leads to more care home clusters, with greater likelihood of linked transmission within each cluster than when using a lower threshold. A pragmatic cut-off of <underline>&lt;</underline>15% probability was selected, yielding 409 clusters. The majority of pairwise comparisons within clusters were zero or 1 SNP different and &lt;14 days apart.</p><p>For 16/700 (2.3%) genomes, the sample that produced the analysed sequence was not the first positive test for that individual in the dataset. This could have occurred if the first positive test was not sequenced, or the sequencing failed or did not pass QC filters. This could theoretically lead to different clustering outcomes, if two cases were counted as further apart temporally than they really were from the date of first positive swab. To ensure this had not biased our findings, the <italic>transcluster</italic> analysis was re-run with identical thresholds using the date of first positive test for each individual (keeping the same genomes). There was no change in the number of clusters identified (n = 409).</p><p>To maintain study participant anonymity, care home residency status cannot be released publicly linked to their COG-UK genome codes.

Of these, 74 were from the CUH HCW screening programme (which includes symptomatic, asymptomatic and household contact arms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rivett et al., 2020</xref>) and 17 had presented acutely to CUH medical services, and been identified as HCW during their initial medical clerking and subsequent note reviews. Of the 91 HCW, 76 had genomes available for analysis (breakdown: 56 samples identified through the CUH HCW screening programme, 9 CUH HCW who presented to acute medical services at CUH, and 11 HCW from community settings (paramedics and care home workers) that had been flagged as HCW through admission clerkings). Of 464 CUH cases in the study period, 72 were care home residents (described above) and 54 of these had available genomes for analysis. The total combined analysis set of CUH HCW and care home residents was therefore 76+54 = 130.</p><p>The 130 genomes were aligned using MAFFT and underwent the same cluster analysis using the <italic>transcluster</italic> algorithm as described above. Transmission links between care homes were excluded as were links between HCWs. HCWs could belong to multiple clusters from different care homes to allow for the possibility of a HCW seeding multiple care home infections. Twenty-one clusters involving both care home residents and HCWs were identified. Of the 54 care home residents, 38 had links with HCWs within the 0.15 probability threshold. Medical notes for potential care home resident-HCW transmission pairs were reviewed by author WLH as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>, with cases being categorised as strongly linked epidemiologically (e.g. the HCW documented in the care home residents’ medical notes); possibly linked (e.g. both working in the hospital at the same time but not in the same wards); or no evidence of an epidemiological link.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge the invaluable contributions of all members of the Wellcome Sanger Institute Covid-19 Surveillance Team (www.sanger.ac.uk/covid-team) who have supported this project.

Additionally, a randomised selection of 700 genomes from non-care home residents was used for comparing lineage composition, and genomes from 76 healthcare workers tested at CUH were included for the analysis of care home resident-HCW transmission. Consensus fasta sequences for the 1,476 genomes are publicly accessible through the COG-UK website data section (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/">https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/</ext-link>). COG-UK also regularly deposits data into public databases such as GISAID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org/">https://www.gisaid.org/</ext-link>). COG-UK sequence codes, GISAID accession IDs and virus names for the 1,476 analysed genomes are included in Supplementary file 1. Sequences generated through the COG-UK consortium have associated public metadata (available via the COG-UK website or GISAID), including patient age, sex, collection date (if available), and location to the level of UK county. COG-UK samples are sequenced under statutory powers granted to the UK Public Health Agencies. Matched patient data is securely released to the COG-UK consortium under a data sharing framework which strictly controls the handling of patient data. The status of individuals living in a care home and groups of such care home patients are both on the consortium restricted data list. This means that this data cannot be publicly released linked to their sequencing identifiers (eg. COG-UK sequence codes). This is because of the risk of deductive disclosure, potentially compromising study participant anonymity. However, code to fully reproduce the transcluster transmission analysis using anonymised metadata is available via GitHub at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gtonkinhill/SC2-care-homes-anonymised">https://github.com/gtonkinhill/SC2-care-homes-anonymised</ext-link> (v0.1.0). The genomes are the same as those used in the study, but sample names in the genetic distance matrix and corresponding metadata have been changed from COG-UK sequence codes to anonymised sample codes. The metadata (sampling dates) has been altered from the original patient data but in a way that preserves the date-differences between samples within care homes, thus yielding an identical transcluster analysis. If a researcher requires access to restricted metadata (including care home residency status) linked to the COG-UK sequence codes, then this will require a formal data sharing agreement with the COG-UK Consortium. Access to patient outcome information for patients treated at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) requires a data sharing agreement with CUH. Data will only be shared for public health and research purposes, not for commercial enterprise, and only to individuals working at reputable research and public health institutions for which data security can be assured. Should this be required researchers should contact the study corresponding authors in the first instance.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation

individuals, understanding how transmission is occurring within and between these facilities is of key epidemiological importance. Further integrating genomic with epidemiological information can provide novel insight into transmission patterns that would otherwise be nearly to disentangle. This manuscript is able to leverage a wealth of information to add important insight into transmission cluster that can illuminate important factors dictating the epidemiological dynamics.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genomic epidemiology of COVID-19 in care homes in the East of England&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Additional background needed: transcluster method, Meredith paper, Figure 6.</p><p>Sequencing discrepancy:</p><p>This manuscript combines sequencing and epidemiological analysis to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission in care home settings. The authors aim to answer questions related to the burden of care home-associated cases, outcomes for care home residents, and the transmission dynamics of the virus within care homes. These questions are laid out very clearly in this well-written manuscript, and the results are thoughtful and informative. The authors also do a nice job of outlining the limitations of their method in the Discussion.</p><p>1) While Figure 5 compares the viral lineages observed in care and non-care home individuals, I did not see non-care home sequences on the phylogenetic tree in Figure 6. Why is this? Incorporating additional sequences from individuals not in care homes from the same region (from both this study and other previously published studies, if available) could reinforce that there were transmission clusters within care homes (i.e., if all care home sequences were more closely related to each other than any other sequences). It appears that there are sequences from both and showing the relationship between care homes and non-care homes would help make sense of their results and ensure that the clustering conclusions are not artifacts of the sampling method. Why were only a few of the 10 care homes further discussed in the paper. Also, minor point but panel A is not further discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>2) Did the sequencing include the use of negative controls to detect possible contamination? Contamination is a common issue when using the ARTIC primers due to the many cycles of PCR amplification, and I have a hard time accepting sequencing data produced using this method without explicit description of the contamination controls or clean lab practices used. This information would be very helpful to see in the Materials and methods and would help promote careful validation of sequencing data.</p><p>3) Similarly, did the authors investigate the ONT/Illumina sequence pair that had two SNPs between the sequences? There is evidence that ONT sequencing in particular has biases at particular areas within the SARS-CoV-2 genome (e.g., https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174136v2), and it would be interesting to know if this discrepancy occurs at one of these regions, which would allow the authors to explain and possibly even correct the error. If the error cannot be easily explained, the authors should comment on why they don't think their analysis, which is based heavily on single-SNP differences between sequences, could be affected by whatever might be causing this discrepancy.</p><p>4) Overall the manuscript is fairly dense with a substantial amount of results and information provided in the text which would be better summarized as tables. For example, the authors state that 7,406 samples from 6,600 individuals were identified, but only 18% are from care homes? If so, is the 18% that was primarily analyzed in the manuscript? Or is this 18% only residents (and if so, are the care givers omitted?). Further, there are many values without percentages presented and it is difficult to follow which samples were considered in each section. For example, in the next section they report that 7% are from a hospital, but are these a subset of the first section? In general, it is difficult to follow how the samples/information in each section relate (or do not relate) to subsequent sections and exactly which samples (including the numbers and percentages) were analyzed.</p><p>5) The cluster results should provide more background and clarification. For example, it appears that only 60% of the data was analyzed in this section however it is not clear how this was decided. The authors should provide more information about the transcluster method since it is a newer method. This can help put the results in context, because currently is it not clear if the analysis considers all of the clusters together or only within cluster transmission. In addition, the authors state that 8 SNPs separate each care home, however they do not provide any indication if this suggest very close transmission amongst care homes. Additional lineage information (including statistics) would be helpful to put the data into context. Further, for outbreaks identified, information should be provided on the time these samples were collected.</p><p>Further, the sentence &quot;We investigated the role of genomics in defining care home clusters by repeating the transcluster algorithm using the same parameters as for the main analysis but assuming all genomes were identical &quot; is not clear enough. What authors mean by &quot;the role of genomics?&quot;. Finally, a figure/table with SNPs, days separating and number of individuals per cluster would helpful since there is currently limited investigation provided. There is limited depth provided when exploring these clusters – for example the authors discuss a paramedic in cluster CARE0063 but they do not provide information of relatedness (SNP distance), how this sample related to the other samples in time, or any other information. In addition, if directionality cannot be inferred, this should be addressed within the limitations in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genomic epidemiology of COVID-19 in care homes in the East of England&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by the previous reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Based on the revision, we believe there are still a few areas that require revision and additional detail prior to acceptance. We recognize the importance of the ethical and IRB process, however it is not clear why some information about the date samples were collected could not be provided. Oftentimes IRBs will allow the time between samples or more aggregated dates to be provided. Given that the method used is highly reliant on the timing of the samples, this information is needed to evaluate the work.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Timing of samples: Information is needed to put the timing of samples into context – given that the method is highly reliant on this information. For example, were distinct samples taken a substantial period of time apart could possibly be part of the same transmission chain if not all cases were sampled? For example, dates by epi week or month/year are often allowed by IRBs. Or perhaps the authors could add some summary statistics to Table 6, e.g. span of time between samples in the care home and mean/spread of days between samples? This would be aggregate and could not be connected to a specific sample. Without additional information, the work is not transparent to the level that it can be properly evaluated. Additionally, we may have missed it but we don't think the authors specified the generation time they are using when running transcluster? Details on this and the uncertainty around this estimate would help, especially when compared to even relative/aggregate timing information (and a few more details on sampling). For example, we would be quite convinced that two samples taken 1-2 months apart could be ruled out to be separate introductions if there were no confirmed cases between them and the generation time was a few days with a small confidence interval.</p><p>2) Sampling bias: The revision does not adequate address the issues of sampling bias. For example, what was the depth of sampling in each care home? Were all positive cases sequenced? Only a proportion? What sampling bias (and subsequent impact on the results) may arise from the sampling strategies used? For example, the text states that: there is genomic information for &quot;for 700 / 1,167 (60.0%) care home residents from 292 care homes&quot; but only only 10 of these care homes were analyzed (102/700 total samples). It is not clear why all of the samples were not included and should be justified or these additional samples should be included in the analysis. This was included in the original reviews, however was not adequately addressed in the revision.</p><p>3) Provide additional detail on the phylogeny: Additional information is needed in the text to ensure that the conclusions based on SNP differences are supported by the phylogeny. For example, seeing the tree Figure 6A in more detail (e.g. a zoom in panel), would allow the reader to see if non-care home sequences fall within the colored clusters or not. This would also help address the issues of sampling bias (care and non-care home individuals) and the subsequent implications. For example, the authors say &quot;Samples from the ten care homes with the 1180 largest number of genomes are highlighted by coloured circles on branch tips.&quot; : if I look at the first colored circle in cyan corresponding to CARE0151, based on Table 6 I would expect to see 7 samples, but I only count 5. It is overall difficult to deciphering the tree. The addition of more information in the figure legend would also be beneficial and avoid the reader from searching the information in the text. Nonetheless, it is surprising that the transcluster method, that defines clusters based in genetic information but also date of collection, identifies clusters with sequences that are scattered all over the tree like in the case of clusters CARE0151, CARE0277, CARE0061 or CARE0032. The fact that the clusters are heterogeneous is reflected in the pairwise SNP difference plot, and very clearly for CARE0277 that seems to have two sub-populations, but does not appear to be the case for CARE0151. These might need more in depth explanation despite the observation reported in “By contrast, several care homes were “polyphyletic”, with cases distributed across the phylogenetic tree and higher pairwise SNP difference counts between samples, consistent with multiple independent introductions of the virus among residents.”, for example.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Genomic epidemiology of COVID-19 in care homes in the East of England&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Miles Davenport (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Unfortunately the Editors and Reviewers felt that the manuscript is not acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic> as it has not reached the level of clarity needed to allow for the key conclusions to be evaluated and for someone else to replicate these results. In particular, the key piece of information that is missing is the amount of time between samples and clusters within the same care home that are needed to understand how the genetic data is being used to determine the clusters. While Table 6 is helpful, it still does not provide enough detail about the timing of infections – in particular the time between clusters within a care home and the mean time/distribution of time between samples within and between the care homes. These data are needed to interpret the results. Given limitations to protect the privacy of participants, information by care home – including clusters identified, dates associated with these clusters, and sampling timeframes – is acceptable as an alternative to including the care home information per sample.</p><p>Further, since the authors make a point to distinguish between monophyletic and polyphyletic cluster, a full tree should be included in the supplementary information (while the added zoom is a nice addition, it is lacking since it is just about one cluster).</p><p>Finally, the data sharing agreement does not meet the standards required for <italic>eLife</italic>. That is, simply stating that others may &quot;discuss the process of signing a data sharing agreement&quot; appears particularly subjective. The authors need to have a full data package available to anyone who requests it – or any limitations on providing the full data need to be specified. Eg: if it is limited to academic (non-commercial) study / people in a particular geographical jurisdiction / a confidentiality agreement is required – a draft of this agreement should be provided and a clear statement on what reasons for declining would be. These raw data need to be accessible to allow attempts at replication as an important part of the scientific process.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64618.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional background needed: transcluster method, Meredith paper, Figure 6</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided further background on the <italic>transcluster</italic> method and the Meredith <italic>et al.</italic> paper, provided further detail on viral clustering in care homes, produced a new version of Figure 6 allowing for additional conclusions, and added tables to present more of the data succinctly, as described further below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sequencing discrepancy:</p><p>This manuscript combines sequencing and epidemiological analysis to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission in care home settings.

This new figure demonstrates that care home infections are intermixed across the phylogenetic tree with non-care home infections. This is consistent with the virus passing between care home and non-care home settings, rather than all the care home sequences being more closely related to each other than to other sequences. We have added this point to the figure legend and to the results:</p><p>“Consistent with this, care home and non-care home samples were intermixed across the phylogenetic tree (Figure 6A), suggesting viral transmission could pass between care homes and non-care home settings.”</p><p>The above sentence also means Figure 6 panel A is now discussed further in the manuscript than it was previously.</p><p>We have added a new table (Table 6) providing more detailed epidemiology on the COVID-19 outbreaks for the 10 care homes with the largest number of cases. These data indicate that, “while care homes frequently had more than one introduction of the virus among residents (i.e. &gt;1 cluster), there was typically a single dominant cluster responsible for the majority of cases within each care home,” now in the Results section. The same trend is seen across all care homes with &gt;3 samples. This is an interesting observation, and we thank the reviewers for prompting us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Did the sequencing include the use of negative controls to detect possible contamination? Contamination is a common issue when using the ARTIC primers due to the many cycles of PCR amplification, and I have a hard time accepting sequencing data produced using this method without explicit description of the contamination controls or clean lab practices used. This information would be very helpful to see in the Materials and methods and would help promote careful validation of sequencing data.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s comment that, “contamination is a common issue when using the ARTIC primers due to the many cycles of PCR amplification…” is not entirely correct – any process that requires PCR is potentially sensitive to contamination, this is not a unique problem with “ARTIC primers”.</p><p>The workflow for nanopore sequencing performed in the Goodfellow lab at the University of Cambridge has been developed following years of field testing and validation. It relies on a directional sample flow as used in a diagnostic laboratory which includes separated pre- and post-PCR areas, with dedicated equipment for each stage of the process. All steps are performed in PCR cabinets which are cleaned using DNA removal solutions and a UV decontamination cycle run after each batch. All sequencing batches included at least one water negative control carried over from the reverse-transcription step. Mapped reads were assessed in real-time during sequencing with RAMPART (https://github.com/artic-network/rampart) and all data from batches containing a contaminated negative control were discarded before sequence assembly. This information is now included in Materials and methods.</p><p>The WSI sequencing workflow also uses negative controls and the pass rate to date related to negative controls is 90%. Sequencing read counts are considered after a clipping and minimum alignment length filtering step (corresponding to data which is used to create consensus sequence or variant calls). Such read counts for the samples analysed in this study were typically in the millions (median: 4,497,543). If such read counts for the corresponding negative controls are &gt;100 then the samples are currently failed. This QC procedure was introduced for samples analysed on or after the 18th of April. Of the 1,007 samples analysed in this study sequenced at WSI (503 care home residents and 504 non-care home residents), 749 were sequenced once this workflow was established, 242 were sequenced before this but had a negative control and 16 did not have a negative control. If we apply the current criteria then 38 of these earlier samples would have failed (38/1400 = 2.7% of the analysed samples). 26 of these 38 samples are non-care home samples and 12 are from care homes. Of the 12 care home samples (12/700 = 1.7% total care home genomes analysed), 1 belongs to one of the &quot;top 10&quot; care homes with the largest number of genomes, care home CARE0063, which comprises a single cluster of 12 genomes using the <italic>transcluster</italic> algorithm, described in main text. Thus, the main result of our genomic cluster analysis (that multiple introductions are often observed in care homes, but typically a single dominant cluster causes most of the cases) would not be altered by the small number of early genomes included that would now be excluded by current criteria. This information has been added to the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Similarly, did the authors investigate the ONT/Illumina sequence pair that had two SNPs between the sequences? There is evidence that ONT sequencing in particular has biases at particular areas within the SARS-CoV-2 genome (e.g., https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174136v2), and it would be interesting to know if this discrepancy occurs at one of these regions, which would allow the authors to explain and possibly even correct the error. If the error cannot be easily explained, the authors should comment on why they don't think their analysis, which is based heavily on single-SNP differences between sequences, could be affected by whatever might be causing this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We have looked into this pair of samples further. The two SNPs are identified as C1884T and C16351T. Neither of these are included in the list of problematic sites included in the virological article mentioned by the reviewer (sites that are described as highly homoplasic and have no phylogenetic signal and/or low prevalence), and we state this in the manuscript with this reference. In our previous study (Meredith et al., 2020), out of 14 sample pairs sequenced both by Illumina at WSI and nanopore in the University of Cambridge, there were zero SNP differences at positions where both sequences made a call.</p><p>We have a new paragraph in the Materials and methods outlining reasons why pairs of sequences from the same patient may have SNP differences, and link to a formal comparison of Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) vs Illumina sequencing which demonstrated highly accurate SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.236893v1.full). We conclude, “Given this degree of consensus sequence accuracy, and because transcluster uses a transmission probability cut-off based on integrating pairwise SNP and temporal differences (rather than relying solely on a strict SNP cut-off), limited sequencing noise is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the clusters identified.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Overall the manuscript is fairly dense with a substantial amount of results and information provided in the text which would be better summarized as tables.

Of these, care home residency status could be established for 6,413 (97.2%). 1,167/6,413 (18.2%) individuals were identified as being care home residents, of which 700/1,167 (60.0%) had genomic data available that passed quality control filtering and were used for identifying care home clusters using the transcluster algorithm (described in Materials and methods and main text). The subset of individuals (464/6,600, 7.03%) that were tested at Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) had richer metadata available and were used for analysing intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and 30-day mortality after first positive test, shown here…”</p><p>When referring to “care home residents” from the study without qualification, we are referring to the 1,167 care home residents identified in the study. Of these, 700 individuals had genomic data available and these are generally referred to as, “care home residents with genomic data”, unless it is obvious from the context. We have ensured each paragraph of the Results section includes a description of what sample set is being used for that analysis, e.g. the subset of samples tested at Cambridge University Hospitals is clearly sign-posted:</p><p>“464 / 6,600 (7%) individuals with positive COVID-19 tests were patients tested at Cambridge University Hospitals. We had access to richer metadata for this subset of patients via the hospital electronic records system.”</p><p>The 464 individuals tested at Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) are a subset of the total 6,600 individuals in the study.</p><p>Other examples:</p><p>“Genome sequence data were available for 700 / 1,167 (60.0%) care home residents from 292 care homes (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).

For example, it appears that only 60% of the data was analyzed in this section however it is not clear how this was decided. The authors should provide more information about the transcluster method since it is a newer method. This can help put the results in context, because currently is it not clear if the analysis considers all of the clusters together or only within cluster transmission. In addition, the authors state that 8 SNPs separate each care home, however they do not provide any indication if this suggest very close transmission amongst care homes. Additional lineage information (including statistics) would be helpful to put the data into context.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added substantially to the background of <italic>transcluster</italic> in Materials and methods, beginning with paragraph:</p><p>“Clusters were produced using an implementation of the transcluster algorithm (Stimson et al., 2019; Tonkin-Hill, 2020). Instead of targeting the number of SNPs separating two genomes, the transcluster algorithm proposes a probabilistic alternative which estimates the number of intermediate transmission events separating two sampled genomes. The method takes into account both genetic SNP distance as well as the time at which each sample was taken. The approach models both the SNP distance and the number of intermediate hosts as a Poisson process. Using a predefined evolutionary rate as well as an estimate of the generation time (the time between transmission events), the method infers the distribution of the number of intermediate hosts separating two samples.”</p><p>We go on to describe the mathematics of <italic>transcluster</italic> in further detail.</p><p>Re: the selection of 700 genomes; this was all care home residents with genomic data available for the analysis. We have clarified in the legend to Table 1 and at the start of each Results section exactly which samples were used for each analysis. In this case:</p><p>“Genome sequence data were available for 700 / 1,167 (60.0%) care home residents from 292 care homes (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 has low overall genetic diversity, so a median of 8 SNPs separating pairwise comparisons in a geographically contained area is quite typical and does not suggest care home genomes overall were especially low in diversity when compared against each-other. We put this into the context of the East of England region as a whole:</p><p>“There was a median of 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) separating care home genomes, compared to 9 for randomly selected non-care home samples (P=0.95, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), similar to the EoE region described previously (Meredith et al., 2020).”</p><p>We provide as much additional information on lineages as can be inferred from the available data:</p><p>“With ongoing viral evolution, descendent lineages of B.1 and B.1.1 also rose in frequency and were commonly found in England during the relevant time period. This suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in care homes were similar to those found across the EoE outside of care homes… No new viral lineages from outside the UK were observed, which may reflect the success of travel restrictions in limiting introductions of new lineages into the general population.”</p><p>The main points we wish to make here are that the lineages inside and outside of care homes were similar, and similar to the East of England (and indeed Europe) as a whole. There were not specific “care home lineages” circulating separately from the non-care home wider community. We have added a new table (Table 5), which explicitly compared the frequency of lineage B.1.1 in early vs late time periods, for care home vs non-care home samples. We have not elaborated on other lineages (which would be complex to appreciate in a table and statistically challenging to compare) as we do not make strong claims on changes in particular lineage frequencies. We provide regional context in the references e.g. see Figure 2 of Elm et al. demonstrating the rise in frequency of lineage B.1.1 across Europe over the same time period (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7427299/).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, for outbreaks identified, information should be provided on the time these samples were collected.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not disclose the dates that care home outbreaks occurred/ samples were collected because of the risk of deductive disclosure: i.e. the risk that the combination of different anonymised data (e.g. number of cases for the care home, dates of sampling, age profile of residents etc) could be used to de-anonymise individuals. This concern is highlighted in the supplementary table of COG-UK IDs for the analysed genomes. If the reviewer is referring to the time of day the samples were collected, we do not have access to those data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the sentence &quot;We investigated the role of genomics in defining care home clusters by repeating the transcluster algorithm using the same parameters as for the main analysis but assuming all genomes were identical &quot; is not clear enough. What authors mean by &quot;the role of genomics?&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explained this further in the same paragraph:</p><p>“The contribution made by genomic data in defining care home clusters was quantified. Without genomic data (or access to more detailed epidemiology such as accommodation sub-structuring within care homes), clustering can only be based on temporal differences between cases. For example, if two groups of COVID-19 cases occur several months apart within a care home they could be inferred to have resulted from (at least) two separate introductions. However, this method cannot account for multiple introductions occurring around the same time, as may happen when community transmission is high. To quantify the impact made by adding genomic data, which can distinguish between genetically dissimilar viruses introduced at similar times, the transcluster algorithm was repeated using the same parameters as for the main analysis but assuming all genomes were identical.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, a figure/table with SNPs, days separating and number of individuals per cluster would helpful since there is currently limited investigation provided. There is limited depth provided when exploring these clusters – for example the authors discuss a paramedic in cluster CARE0063 but they do not provide information of relatedness (SNP distance), how this sample related to the other samples in time, or any other information. In addition, if directionality cannot be inferred, this should be addressed within the limitations in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new table (Table 6) that shows a breakdown of epidemiological information for each of the 10 care homes with the largest number of genome samples.

Inferring the likelihood of transmission direction between pairs of individuals requires integration with multiple forms of epidemiological data, yielding a probabilistic estimate (Illingworth et al., 2020).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Timing of samples: Information is needed to put the timing of samples into context – given that the method is highly reliant on this information. For example, were distinct samples taken a substantial period of time apart could possibly be part of the same transmission chain if not all cases were sampled? For example, dates by epi week or month/year are often allowed by IRBs. Or perhaps the authors could add some summary statistics to Table 6, e.g. span of time between samples in the care home and mean/spread of days between samples? This would be aggregate and could not be connected to a specific sample. Without additional information, the work is not transparent to the level that it can be properly evaluated. Additionally, we may have missed it but we don't think the authors specified the generation time they are using when running transcluster? Details on this and the uncertainty around this estimate would help, especially when compared to even relative/aggregate timing information (and a few more details on sampling).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added 2 columns detailing date information to Table 6. These columns show the date range in days (i.e. days from first sample to last sample date) for each care home and for each cluster within each care home. The date range for each care home is typically larger than the date range for clusters within care homes, except for single-cluster care homes like CARE0314 where the date range is already small for the care home as a whole. This is consistent with <italic>transcluster</italic> identifying groups of cases occurring closer together in time. It is also interesting to note cases like CARE0263, in which all 12 residents tested positive within 3 days of each-other, but these were in fact three separate clusters (one dominant cluster of 9 cases, one cluster of 2 cases and a single separate case), consistent with the three clusters that can be seen in the phylogeny shown in Figure 6A, i.e. <italic>transcluster</italic> is yielding both temporally linked cases and genetically linked cases, as expected. Without the genomic data, the three clusters in CARE0263 would have been impossible to distinguish. We have included this as an illustrative case in the Results.</p><p>The reviewer asks for aggregate data on time difference between samples within each cluster. A histogram of pairwise date differences between samples within each cluster is shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 5. We also describe these data in Results:</p><p>“Within each cluster, 673 / 775 (86.8%) of pairwise links had zero or 1 pairwise SNP differences (maximum 4), and 756 / 775 (97.5%) were sampled &lt;14 days apart (maximum 22 days) (Figure 7—figure supplements 4-5).”</p><p>We have added Figure 7—figure supplement 6, which shows the median and interquartile range for pairwise date differences between all samples within each cluster, arranged from lowest to highest median date difference.</p><p>In addition, we have added an analysis of differences between sampling dates from first to last case for care homes versus clusters across the dataset:</p><p>“Clusters had a tighter distribution of sampling dates than for the total cases within each care home, as expected. For the 170 care homes with 2 or more cases with genomic data, there was a median of 9 (IQR: 4 – 15) days from the first case to the last case within each care home, compared with a median of zero (IQR 0-5) days from the first case to the last case of each cluster (P &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test).”</p><p>Lastly, we have added sampling date to the list of COG-UK and GISAID IDs for samples analysed in the study to the supplementary materials.</p><p>Re: Generation time – we approximated the generation time by the serial interval, as is common in transmission studies (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.20197210v1), but recognise this was not clear in the Materials and methods. Alternative strategies for estimating the generation time have also led to similar estimates (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.17.2000257). We have updated the corresponding sentences to read:</p><p>“The implementation of transcluster assumed a viral mutation rate of 1e-3 substitutions/site/year (Fauver et al., 2020) and generation time of five days, approximated by previous estimates of the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 (He et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Days between first positive sampling date for pairs of individuals was used as a proxy for generation time.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, we would be quite convinced that two samples taken 1-2 months apart could be ruled out to be separate introductions if there were no confirmed cases between them and the generation time was a few days with a small confidence interval.</p></disp-quote><p>We presume that the reviewer meant to say, “we would be quite convinced that two samples taken 1-2 months apart could be inferred to be separate introductions if there were no confirmed cases between them.”? If so, we agree that cases that occurred this far apart in time with no cases in between could be assumed to be separate introductions. The pairwise date difference between samples within each cluster is shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 5; most cases within each cluster are &lt;14 days apart, with a maximum dispersion of up to 22 days. The distributions of differences in pairwise sampling dates between samples within each cluster are also shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 6. The <italic>transcluster</italic> clustering method is consistent with the reviewer’s intuitions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Sampling bias: The revision does not adequate address the issues of sampling bias. For example, what was the depth of sampling in each care home? Were all positive cases sequenced? Only a proportion? What sampling bias (and subsequent impact on the results) may arise from the sampling strategies used? For example, the text states that: there is genomic information for &quot;for 700 / 1,167 (60.0%) care home residents from 292 care homes&quot; but only only 10 of these care homes were analyzed (102/700 total samples). It is not clear why all of the samples were not included and should be justified or these additional samples should be included in the analysis. This was included in the original reviews, however was not adequately addressed in the revision.</p></disp-quote><p>Every sample with an available genome at the time the analysis was run that passed sequencing quality control measures was included in the analysis. There were no exclusion criteria for genomic analysis other than the sequence quality control criteria described in Materials and methods. We attempted to sequence every sample tested in the Cambridge PHE diagnostic laboratory. The fact that genomic data were not available for 40% of care home residents is a limitation described in the Discussion, with reasons listed:</p><p>“Viral sequence data were not available for 40% of care home residents, as a result of missing samples, mismatches between sequences and metadata, genomes not passing quality control filtering using a stringent threshold (&lt;10% missing calls), or sequences being unavailable at the time of data extraction.”</p><p>We have added to the Materials and methods stating the aim was to sequence all positive samples from the diagnostic laboratory, and list reasons why genomic sampling was incomplete:</p><p>“The study aimed to sequence all samples which tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive at the CMPHL during the study period. Sequencing of every positive diagnostic sample could not be performed, however, for the following reasons: (i) sample unavailability (e.g. diagnostic samples being lost or discarded before they could be collected by the sequencing team); (ii) labelling errors when assigning sequencing codes (which resulted in specimens being discarded); or (iii) metadata mismatches (if the sample did not match to a metadata record downloaded from the hospital electronic patient records system).”</p><p>There is no reason to believe that these factors were biased in any particular way. Moreover, 60% SARS-CoV-2 genomic coverage for all care home residents tested in our diagnostic laboratory is one of the highest rates of sequencing coverage for care home residents anywhere in the world.</p><p>We have re-written the caption for Figure 1 (the study flow diagram) to explicitly state how many samples were sequenced by nanopore and Illumina technologies:</p><p>“Out of 1,297 samples from 1,167 care home residents, 286 samples were assigned for nanopore sequencing on site and 833 samples for sequencing at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). Of these, 258 and 533 sequences were available and downloaded from the MRC-CLIMB server at the time of running the analysis, respectively. Of these available genomes, 224 and 522 passed sequencing quality control thresholds (described in Materials and methods), respectively. This yielded the final analysis set of 700 high-coverage genomes from care home residents (representing 292 care homes): 197 genomes sequenced on site by nanopore and 503 sequences at WSI by Illumina.”</p><p>All 700 genomes passing QC from care home residents were analysed in the <italic>transcluster</italic> analysis used to define care home clusters – none were excluded. We chose to visualise the “top 10” care homes with the largest number of genomes available in Figure 7 because we thought that displaying transmission networks for hundreds of care homes in a single, large figure would be difficult for a reader to appreciate. However, we have now added Figure 7—figure supplement 1, which shows the same network diagrams for every care home in the study with 2 or more genomes available. Care homes with only 1 genome available in the dataset are not displayed as the transmission network would consist of a single point.</p><p>One important finding of the cluster analysis is that care homes may have had multiple introductions among residents, but frequently a single cluster was responsible for the majority of cases (consistent with a substantial role of within-care home transmission driving the majority of care home cases). This is described for both the “top 10” care homes and aggregated for the entire dataset, quoting the relevant section of the previous manuscript version below:</p><p>“Of the 90 / 292 (30.8%) care homes with three or more residents with genomic data (comprising 418 / 700 (59.7%) care home residents with genomic data), 74 / 90 (82.2%) had a dominant cluster responsible for &gt;50% of all cases in the care home.”</p><p>This analysis was limited to care homes with 3 or more cases with genomic data because 3 is the minimum number in which 2 clusters could be present and one be “dominant” (i.e. represent 2/3 cases). This still includes the majority (59.7%) of care home residents with genomic data. If the analysis is repeated for all care homes with 2 or more cases we still find the majority of care homes have one cluster comprising &gt;50% of samples: Of the 170 / 292 (58.2%) care homes with 2 or more residents with genomic data available (comprising 578 / 700 (82.6%) care home residents with genomic data), 111 / 170 (65.3%) had a dominant cluster responsible for &gt;50% of all cases in the care home. We have now added both numbers to the main text for transparency.</p><p>Regarding “sampling bias” from the point of sample collection (as opposed to which samples were sequenced/ analysed after testing positive), we agree that opportunistic sampling for genomic epidemiology carries a risk of sampling bias, and studies such as this must pay careful attention to this and consider how/whether it could affect their main conclusions. We describe this in the Discussion:</p><p>“…the nature of diagnostic testing sites changed during the study period as regional hospitals developed their own in-house testing capacity and community testing laboratories were set up. “Pillar 2” testing in the UK was outsourced to high-throughput laboratories during April 2020 and performed an increasing proportion of community testing. It is possible that some care home residents from the same care home could have been tested through different routes, with symptomatic cases more likely to be tested in “Pillar 1” via the CMPHL (and included in this dataset), and asymptomatic screening occurring more via the Pillar 2 laboratories.”</p><p>However, we feel this issue does not detract from our fundamental conclusions on clustering within care homes:</p><p>“…most care homes in EoE only began systematic screening after the end of our study following the introduction of the UK care home testing portal on 11th May 2020. Moreover, the transcluster algorithm allows for “missing links” within a cluster (the threshold used assumed a &gt;15% probability of infections being linked within &lt;2 intermediate hosts), reducing the impact of missing care home cases on defined clusters.”</p><p>And finally, we warn that:</p><p>“The changing profile of COVID-19 testing in the UK between March and May 2020 should therefore be factored into all interpretations of COVID-19 epidemiology from that period.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide additional detail on the phylogeny: Additional information is needed in the text to ensure that the conclusions based on SNP differences are supported by the phylogeny. For example, seeing the tree Figure 6A in more detail (e.g. a zoom in panel), would allow the reader to see if non-care home sequences fall within the colored clusters or not. This would also help address the issues of sampling bias (care and non-care home individuals) and the subsequent implications. For example, the authors say &quot;Samples from the ten care homes with the 1180 largest number of genomes are highlighted by coloured circles on branch tips.&quot; : if I look at the first colored circle in cyan corresponding to CARE0151, based on Table 6 I would expect to see 7 samples, but I only count 5. It is overall difficult to deciphering the tree. The addition of more information in the figure legend would also be beneficial and avoid the reader from searching the information in the text. Nonetheless, it is surprising that the transcluster method, that defines clusters based in genetic information but also date of collection, identifies clusters with sequences that are scattered all over the tree like in the case of clusters CARE0151, CARE0277, CARE0061 or CARE0032. The fact that the clusters are heterogeneous is reflected in the pairwise SNP difference plot, and very clearly for CARE0277 that seems to have two sub-populations, but does not appear to be the case for CARE0151. These might need more in depth explanation despite the observation reported in “By contrast, several care homes were “polyphyletic”, with cases distributed across the phylogenetic tree and higher pairwise SNP difference counts between samples, consistent with multiple independent introductions of the virus among residents.”, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a magnified subtree for one branch of the phylogeny in Figure 6A, focusing on the monophyletic branch for care home CARE0314. This demonstrates these genomes are identical or 1-SNP different (consistent with the box plot in panel 6B). Two non-care home genomes are also present in this clade. We have stated that care home and non-care home genomes are intermixed in the tree, consistent with viral transmission occurring between care home and non-care home settings, which is expected.</p><p>Re: The number of coloured tips on the tree, some samples close together on the tree have coloured tips “on top of each other” so the number of circles visualised may be fewer than the total plotted. We have checked and this applies to CARE0151.</p><p>Re: “heterogeneous clusters”. To be clear, Figure 6B shows pairwise SNP differences for the 10 care homes with the largest number of samples, not pairwise SNP differences within clusters defined by transcluster. Some care homes, such as CARE0314, are “monophyletic”, with low pairwise SNP difference count across all samples from that care home, and CARE0314 is identified as having a single cluster by <italic>transcluster</italic>. Other care homes, such as CARE0151, are “polyphyletic” and have higher pairwise SNP differences between all samples from that care home, and <italic>transcluster</italic> accordingly divides this care home into multiple clusters as shown in Figure 7A. ie. Figure 7 shows the clusters defined by <italic>transcluster</italic>, Figure 6 is showing a phylogenetic tree and pairwise SNP differences within care homes, not clusters. We have made this clearer in the legend to Figure 6:</p><p>“Clusters within each care home were defined using integrated genomic and temporal data using the transcluster algorithm and are shown in Figure 7.”</p><p>The pairwise SNP difference between samples within each cluster is shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 4, and is also summarised in main text:</p><p>“Within each cluster, 673 / 775 (86.8%) of pairwise links had zero or 1 pairwise SNP differences (maximum 4), and 756 / 775 (97.5%) were sampled &lt;14 days apart (maximum 22 days) (Figure 7—figure supplements 4-5).”</p><p>The phylogenetic tree and pairwise SNP difference plot shown in Figure 6 illustrate the general principle of the distinction between polyphyletic and monophyletic care home cases and demonstrate that care home genomes are phylogenetically intermixed with non-care home genomes. The paper goes on to define care home clusters formally using <italic>transcluster</italic>, integrating the genomic data with temporal data. All conclusions drawn on clustering within care homes are based on the <italic>transcluster</italic> analysis, which is described at length in the two paragraphs detailed in Materials and methods and visualised in Figure 7.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately the Editors and Reviewers felt that the manuscript is not acceptable for eLife as it has not reached the level of clarity needed to allow for the key conclusions to be evaluated and for someone else to replicate these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognise the importance of reproducibility in the scientific method. However, this must be balanced against the ethical requirement for study participant confidentiality in line with the approved ethics for the study. COG-UK has ethical approval to publicly release limited sample metadata including the person’s age, sex and county of residence and the date of sample collection. Releasing additional metadata linked to COG-UK IDs, such as whether the person was a care home resident and their relationship to other individuals via anonymised care home codes, would risk deductive disclosure. For example, it may be possible to work out who individuals are based on knowing 3 people from the same care home in Cambridgeshire who tested positive on particular dates, and knowing their age and sex.

If not all tests are available, this would be a severe limitation. The first implication that this may be the case appears in the Results section, as percentage of all cases compared to those in the whole of the East. But that doesn't discuss care homes specifically (which is of course hard to do without doing the research for those other cases, but in the context of consistent submissions by care homes, it is an important point).</p></disp-quote><p>We capture around half of all COVID-19 cases that occurred in the East of England over the study period, the remaining positive cases being sampled at other sites. We have expanded our description of where the samples included in the study derive from in the Results:</p><p>“The samples were tested at the Public Health England (PHE) Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory (CMPHL) in Cambridge, which receives samples from across the East of England. Positive cases came from 37 submitting organisations including regional hospital laboratories and community-based testing services (Supplementary file 1). The proportion of samples coming from different sources changed over the study period (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). This likely reflects a combination of regional hospitals establishing their own testing facilities, increasing availability of community testing in the UK, and the implementation of national policies that increased the scope of care home testing (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Overall, the study population included almost half of the COVID-19 cases diagnosed in the EoE at this time (Public Health England, 2020a), with the remainder being tested at other laboratory sites.”</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary file 1 provide breakdowns of which sites submitted samples and were included in the study.</p><p>Specifically addressing the reviewer’s question of whether one care home could have submitted some samples to the Cambridge CMPHL (getting included in this dataset) and other samples to different testing sites (not included in this dataset), the answer is yes this is possible. As community testing expanded, more “screening” samples were sent to “Lighthouse Laboratories” (in the UK “Pillar 2”), while symptomatic cases were more likely to have been tested via Pillar 1 (the CMPHL). However, we do not believe this limitation is as “severe” as the reviewer suggests, as the <italic>transcluster</italic> algorithm we have used for defining clusters does allow for “missing links” connecting a transmission chain within a threshold number of intermediate hosts, based on the expected serial interval and mutation rate of the virus. We now address this issue explicitly as a limitation in our Discussion:</p><p>“We acknowledge several limitations to this study. First, we have not captured all of the COVID-19 cases from the East of England. Serology data indicate that 10.5% of all residents in care homes for people aged 65 and older in England had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by early June, the majority of whom were asymptomatic (UK government, 2020c). […] The changing profile of COVID-19 testing in the UK between March and May 2020 should therefore be factored into all interpretations of COVID-19 epidemiology from that period.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is no clear justification for the selected time period. It is because of convenience becaue the data are available? Why not use the national portal data as well? Was it because it was the first outbreak within that time period? Anyway, some justification is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The time period used spanned from the first positive case received in our laboratory (26<sup>th</sup> February), to the 10<sup>th</sup> May. This end-date was chosen because: (1) it captured the majority of the “first wave” of the epidemic in the East of England (as shown in the epidemic curves included); (2) Due to some delays in sequencing and genomic data becoming accessible after sample collection, the availability of genomes at the time data was pulled for analysis declined after that date; and (3) the national care home testing portal opened on 11<sup>th</sup> May 2020, and this potentially could have introduced bias in population analyses as care homes may have undergone systematic screening. As described above, the distribution of testing was complexifying over April and May such that once systematic care home screening became more common, and the Lighthouse Laboratories were running, it becomes more likely that different samples from the same care home could be tested at different sites, making the picture from the Cambridge CMPHL less complete. We have made this more explicit in the Materials and methods:</p><p>“The 10<sup>th</sup> May was selected as a study end-date because it encompassed the bulk of the “first wave” of the epidemic in the East of England. Furthermore, prior to the 11<sup>th</sup> May 2020, systematic screening of all residents within care homes was much less common and testing primarily occurred where there was a suspicion of an outbreak; our strategy reduced risk of bias which would have been introduced had we included systematic screening.”</p><p>3) the Mann-Whitney U test (more commonly used name than Wilcocox rank-sum test) is appropriately used to compare the age of care home residents vs other cases. However, I struggle to see what the test tells us when comparing cases. How can that comparison be informative without the populations in each nursing home and each residential home? A more appropriate approch would be to model cases as count data, using a Poisson or negative binomial regression model with the care home as the unit of analysis.</p><p>In a Poisson regression model, increasing case numbers per care home was weakly associated with nursing homes relative to residential homes (odds ratio (OR) 1.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 – 1.35), <italic>P</italic>=0.00132). However, we agree with the reviewer’s point that this needs to be interpreted in the context of the populations in each home. The CQC dataset includes number of beds registered with each care home. This could be a rough proxy for number of residents in each care home (though bed occupancy may not be 100%, and there may be some turnover of new patients into the beds over time). When using positive cases per CQC registered beds for each care home, there was a slightly <italic>higher</italic> positivity rate in residential homes than in nursing homes: median 0.063 (IQR 0.033 – 0.11) cases per bed vs median 0.048 (IQR 0.026 – 0.066), respectively (<italic>P</italic>=0.008322, Wilcoxon rank sum test). We are not sure of the significance or applicability of this observation, and it is tangential to the main narrative of the paper. We have therefore removed the comment on different case numbers between residential and nursing homes from the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another issue is what is the genome sequence bringing into the epidemiology of COVID-19. The only thing I can see is whether the outbreak is monophyletic or polyphyletic. I am not sure a clear argument about the importance of this, from the public health point of view has been made – perhaps the authors need to make this clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point; we have expanded on the role of genomics in the analysis and in addressing public health questions in several places.</p><p>We repeated the viral clustering algorithm assuming all genomes were identical; this effectively eliminates the contribution of genomics to the clustering so only temporal differences between samples are used to define clusters. This yielded 316 clusters, significantly fewer than the 409 yielded when genomics was included. This shows that without genomics, distinct transmission events occurring around the same time cannot be distinguished, so viruses are grouped incorrectly into the same clusters when they are actually more likely to be distinct introductions. This analysis has been added to the Results section describing the cluster work:</p><p>“We investigated the role of genomics in defining care home clusters by repeating the transcluster algorithm using the same parameters as for the main analysis but assuming all genomes were identical to each other. This yielded 316 clusters from the 700 residents across 292 care homes – 23% fewer than the 409 clusters yielded when incorporating genomics. This suggests that genomics makes a significant contribution to defining viral clusters; without genomic data, separate transmission events occurring around the same time in a care home cannot be readily distinguished (so cluster sizes are over-estimated and the number of separate viral introductions is under-estimated).”</p><p>We emphasise this point in the Discussion, e.g.:</p><p>“We defined viral clusters within each care home by integrating temporal and genetic differences between cases. This provides a “high resolution” picture of viral transmission; without genomic data, separate introductions of the virus occurring around the same time would be impossible to distinguish.”</p><p>And,</p><p>“incorporating genomic data is more accurate for excluding linked transmission than if only temporal data are available. Genomics can thus be used to “rule out” cases as being part of a linked cluster if the genetic difference is greater than would be expected given the viral mutation rate. This could be practically informative for care homes (along with other organisations at risk of COVID-19 outbreaks like factories (Middleton et al., 2020)) with implications for infection control procedures.”</p><p>An example application of integrating genomics into cluster definitions is to assess whether a care home has a single “outbreak” or unconnected transmission events. PHE currently defines an outbreak as 2 or more cases within the same care home within 14 days. Once an outbreak is declared there are significant infection control implications, such as closing to all non-essential visitors (currently for 28 days). This period resets each time a subsequent case occurs within that time period – so care homes can remain closed to visitors for extended periods, which is obviously difficult for the residents and their families. Genomics could be used to rule out certain cases as being part of a linked transmission cluster occurring within that time window, with implications for whether the care home continues to operate under its “outbreak” protocol for visitor restrictions.</p><p>We have also emphasised the key public health messages of the study more strongly in the Discussion – the need for strong infection prevention and control within care homes to limit transmission:</p><p>“These findings emphasise the importance of limiting viral transmission within care homes in order to prevent outbreaks. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be infectious before the onset of symptoms (He et al., 2020), isolating residents or staff when they develop symptoms is not sufficient to prevent within-care home spread once the virus has entered the care home. Certain measures may be required on an ongoing basis within care homes when there is sustained community transmission, even when no outbreak is suspected (at least until the morbidity and mortality of the virus in older people has been reduced substantially through vaccination or treatments). These may include use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for staff and visitors (including visiting healthcare professionals and friends and family), rigorous hand hygiene, social distancing, and making use of larger, well-ventilated rooms for social interactions or socialising outdoors, providing that this is practical and safe (Jones et al., 2020). This is consistent with current national guidance for care homes in England (Public Health England, 2020b; UK government, 2020b). Face coverings for residents themselves when interacting socially in communal indoor areas could be considered, if acceptable to residents.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>1) Quality of the Abstract is substandard. Even after going over it a few times, I struggle to understand the design, the samples and some of the reported findings. How were samples colelcted. How may samples per patient. Wouldn't it make sense to report positive patients rather than positive samples? why is the CHU subsample of 71 patients highlighted?</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-written the Abstract to emphasise the key points from the study, particularly the central public health point on the importance of limiting within-care home viral transmission</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2</p><p>This is a well written and informative manuscript which addresses transmission of SARS-CoV2 among a particularly vulnerable population. Overall, the authors are to be commended for their diligence, not just in their sequencing efforts, but in tracing and checking the , no doubt, highly complex world of CQC records. The methodology, both for sequencing and data analysis, is comprehensively described and the conclusions reached are well supported by the data. It highlights the potential for within nursing home and between nursing home transmission, and shows clearly the potential involvement of healthcare workers. The findings should have implications for infection control, and surveillance in nursing homes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A couple of areas would welcome clarification:</p><p>1) The genomes were sequenced using the nanopore and illumina platforms. Were a subset of samples cross checked on the other platform to ensure the same results? I might have missed this in the appendix, but would help ensure no disparity between different sequencing platforms.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, this is an important point. In our previous study (Meredith and Hamilton, <italic>Lancet Infectious Diseases</italic>, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30562-4), 14 genomes were sequenced on both platforms, and we found zero instances in which a different nucleotide was called between a pair of sequences. We have now checked our dataset from this study and identified 8 instances in which the same care home resident was sequenced on both Illumina and Nanopore technology. In 7 cases the pairs of sequences have zero SNP differences; in one case there are two SNP differences, both C vs T calls in different parts of the genome. We have added this analysis to the Materials and methods section, including the COG-UK IDs of the 8 pairs of genomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The study, due to testing, bases transmission modelling on symptomatic testing- perhaps a limitation of the study is that asymptomatic transmission couldnt be determined. If this was included, there may have been more within and between nursing home transmission accounting for some of the cases observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer as prior to 11<sup>th</sup> May (when the UK national care home testing portal was introduced) care homes were unlikely to have been screening residents for COVID-19. We highlight in the Discussion the broader limitation that we have an incomplete picture of COVID-19 in the region, due to limitations on testing, asymptomatic/ pauci-symptomatic cases, some individuals getting tested at other sites not included in our study, and not all tests producing a genome that passed quality control filtering. We have also added a reference to the UK Vivaldi study, which estimated care home SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and found a high proportion of asymptomatic cases:</p><p>“We acknowledge several limitations to this study. First, we have not captured all of the COVID-19 cases from the East of England. Serology data indicate that 10.5% of all residents in care homes for people aged 65 and older in England had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by early June, the majority of whom were asymptomatic (UK government, 2020c). The Cambridge CMPHL did not receive all of the samples from the region, though based on national data we estimate we have captured around half of the COVID-19 cases reported from EoE during the study period. We did not have viral sequence data available for 40% of care home residents, as a result of missing samples, mismatches between sequences and metadata, genomes not passing quality control filtering using a stringent threshold (&lt;10% missing calls), or sequences being unavailable at the time of data extraction. We may therefore have underestimated viral cluster sizes.”</p><p>However, one of the strengths of modelling clusters using <italic>transcluster</italic> is that we can, to some extent, account for “missing links” in a connected transmission cluster (whether because those links were asymptomatic and not tested, or the samples did not produce usable genomes, <italic>etc</italic>). <italic>transcluster</italic> allows for a probability of transmission within a set number of intermediate hosts – in our case we chose a relatively relaxed probability (&gt;15%) of transmission occurring within 2 or fewer intermediate hosts. We describe this in the next paragraph after the above quotation in the Discussion:</p><p>“the transcluster algorithm allows for “missing links” within a cluster (our thresholds assumed a &gt;15% probability of infections being linked within &lt;2 intermediate hosts), reducing the impact of missing care home cases on defined clusters.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3</p><p>In this study, genomic epidemiology was used to investigate viral transmission dynamics among care homes residents and health care workers. It aimed at answering questions about the burden of care home associated COVID-19; patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread between care home residents (single and multiple independent transmission networks); and the role of health care workers in the viral spread.</p><p>Major:</p><p>Figure 3A.

Please also consider adding a scale bar (in subs/site, or mutational units). It would be helpful if a full phylogeny could be provided as supplement, with labels and all the annotations suggested in this review.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-produced this figure and now highlight the ten care homes with the largest sample numbers as coloured tips to the branch ends, rather than as the adjacent colour bar. Hopefully this makes the clustering easier to appreciate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Appendix. As shown in the table, among the 6600 cases reported in the period of study, around 19% were linked to home care residents, while most of the remaining cases were associated with community acquired infections. If the proportion between “care home” X “non-care home” cases were nearly 20:80, why the proportion of genomes sequenced from each category was 50:50 (700 genomes each)? How the over-representation of ”care home resident” genomes (and consequent sub-representation of non-care home ones) could have impacted the phylogenetic and transmission network analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We only sampled a matching set of non-care home genomes to get a sense of whether the predominant viral lineages seen in the care home residents was similar to non-care home residents (and to the UK/ Europe as a whole), and this is only for a single figure supplementary to the main narrative. We do not use this sample of non-care home genomes anywhere else in the analysis, including the cluster analysis (<italic>transcluster</italic>) or the phylogenetic tree, so it does not impact on these analyses. We now make that point explicitly clear in the Materials and methods. To formally compare care home and non-care home genomes, we agree multiple factors would need to be controlled for between the populations including the proportion of cases from different time periods, age, county locations, etc. However, as we do not rely on the non-care home samples for any heavy conclusions in this study, we do not feel this is necessary here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Appendix. Please supplement the last table in the appendix with information about: GISAID or Genbank virus ID (“strain name”) and accession numbers (if submitted to other databases), date of collection, geographic location, and other relevant metadata associated with the genomes used in this study. This information is essential for the reproducibility of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>The consensus fasta sequences used in our analyses are publicly available and can be downloaded via COG-UK or GISAID websites. We have added virus name and GISAID accession numbers along with the COG-UK IDs for all analysed genomes to the Supplementary Materials. When linking GISAID IDs to their corresponding COG-UK IDs for this publication we identified two samples where the sequence we analysed was different to the publicly available sequence on COG-UK: CAMB-1ADAE8 and CAMB-1AEB6C, and there were no GISAID IDs for them. After some investigation we found this was due to low coverage in an initial run, which was uploaded to COG-UK and did not pass GISAID QC filtering, but the samples were subsequently re-sequenced with higher coverage, and this was used in our analysis. We are in the process of getting the re-sequenced (high coverage) versions uploaded to COG-UK, and then they will be assigned GISAID accession numbers. This should happen in time for publication.</p><p>The public databases like GISAID include metadata such as patient age, sex, country of sampling etc. However, for reasons of patient confidentiality and information governance, not all of the metadata used in our analysis can be released publicly. This is because of the risk that, when used in combination, certain metadata could de-anonymise individuals. We have added the following explanation to the supplementary table of analysed genomes:</p><p>“Sequences have associated public metadata (also available via the COG-UK website or GISAID), including patient age, sex, collection date (if available), and location to the level of UK county. However, not all of the metadata used in this study can be released publicly. COG-UK samples are sequenced under statutory powers granted to the UK Public Health Agencies. Matched patient data is securely released to the COG-UK consortium under a data sharing framework which strictly controls the handling of patient data. The status of individuals living in a care home and groups of such care home patients are both on the consortium restricted data list. This means that this data cannot be publicly released linked to sequencing identifiers, sampling date and UK counties. This is because of the risk of deductive disclosure. If a research scientist would like to repeat our analysis using these data fields, they should write to the corresponding authors to discuss the process of signing a data sharing agreement that will allow them to access the data securely.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>Figure 3.

What treatments a patient receives, including the invasive treatments provided in intensive care, are complex and individualised decisions based on risk-benefit assessments involving patients, their families and carers, and healthcare professionals (ICS, 2020; NICE, 2020). Of note, non-invasive respiratory support (such as continuous positive airway pressure, high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation) are routinely provided outside ICU in many UK centres.”</p><p>Please also note that the mortality figures have slightly changed from original submission, (1) because we include a care home resident tested at CUH who was not included in the Cambridge COG-UK dataset (detailed in Materials and methods), bringing the total CUH care home residents from 71 to 72, and (2) because we now use mortality at 30 days post positive test, rather than mortality within the initial admission (thus including people who may have been discharged from hospital in a palliative setting who died at home or elsewhere such as in a nursing home). This is more consistent with the way mortality data is reported nationally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear if all non-care home samples came from residents of EoE.
