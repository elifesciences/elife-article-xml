Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a valuable method of assessing fitness in sport and clinical settings. There is a lack of large studies on athletic populations to predict VO<sub>2max</sub> using somatic or submaximal CPET variables. Thus, this study aimed to: (1) derive prediction models for maximal VO<sub>2 </sub>(VO<sub>2max</sub>) based on submaximal exercise variables at anaerobic threshold (AT) or respiratory compensation point (RCP) or only somatic and (2) internally validate provided equations.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 4424 male endurance athletes (EA) underwent maximal symptom-limited CPET on a treadmill (n=3330) or cycle ergometer (n=1094). The cohort was randomly divided between: variables selection (n<sub>runners</sub>=1998; n<sub>cyclist</sub>=656), model building (n<sub>runners</sub>=666; n<sub>cyclist</sub>=219) and validation (n<sub>runners</sub>=666; n<sub>cyclist</sub>=219). Random Forest was used to select the most significant variables. Models were derived and internally validated with Multiple Linear Regression.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Runners were 36.24±8.45 yrs.; BMI=23.94±2.43 kg·m<sup>−2</sup>; VO<sub>2max</sub>=53.81±6.67 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·kg<sup>−1</sup>. Cyclists were 37.33±9.13 yr.; BMI=24.34±2.63 kg·m<sup>−2</sup>; VO<sub>2max</sub>=51.74±7.99 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·kg<sup>−1</sup>. VO<sub>2</sub> at AT and RCP were the most contributing variables to exercise equations. Body mass and body fat had the highest impact on the somatic equation. Model performance for VO<sub>2max</sub> based on variables at AT was R<sup>2</sup>=0.81, at RCP was R<sup>2</sup>=0.91, at AT&amp;RCP was R<sup>2</sup>=0.91 and for somatic-only was R<sup>2</sup>=0.43.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Derived prediction models were highly accurate and fairly replicable. Formulae allow for precise estimation of VO<sub>2max</sub> based on submaximal exercise performance or somatic variables. Presented models are applicable for sport and clinical settling. They are a valuable supplementary method for fitness practitioners to adjust individualised training recommendations.</p><p><bold>Funding:</bold> No external funding was received for this work.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf2"><p>Szczepan Wiecha, received payment for leading CPET workshops at IX Małopolskich Warsztatach Niewydolności Serca.
