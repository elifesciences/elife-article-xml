neural circuits determines nervous system function. Variability can arise during neural circuit development (e.g. neurite morphology, axon/dendrite position). To ensure robust nervous system function, mechanisms must exist to accommodate variation in neurite positioning during circuit formation. Previously, we developed a model system in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ventral nerve cord to conditionally induce positional variability of a proprioceptive sensory axon terminal, and used this model to show that when we altered the presynaptic position of the sensory neuron, its major postsynaptic interneuron partner modified its dendritic arbor to match the presynaptic contact, resulting in functional synaptic input (Sales et al., 2019). Here, we investigate the cellular mechanisms by which the interneuron dendrites detect and match variation in presynaptic partner location and input strength. We manipulate the presynaptic sensory neuron by (a) ablation; (b) silencing or activation; or (c) altering its location in the neuropil. From these experiments we conclude that there are two opposing mechanisms used to establish functional connectivity in the face of presynaptic variability: presynaptic contact stimulates dendrite outgrowth locally, whereas presynaptic activity inhibits postsynaptic dendrite outgrowth globally. These mechanisms are only active during an early larval critical period for structural plasticity. Collectively, our data provide new insights into dendrite development, identifying mechanisms that allow dendrites to flexibly respond to developmental variability in presynaptic location and input strength.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>dendrite</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>dbd</kwd><kwd>A08a</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heckman</surname><given-names>Emily L</given-names></name><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD27056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heckman</surname><given-names>Emily L</given-names></name><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Opposing mechanisms determine dendrite arbor size during a critical period in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural circuit organization dictates circuit function, influencing behavior, cognition, and perception. While developmental programs in genetically identical animals produce similar final products, variability arises during circuit wiring to produce differences in cellular morphology, synaptic partnerships, and numbers of synapses between partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mohr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churgin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Courgeon and Desplan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Couton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tobin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>). Such variability can arise innately due to stochastic processes (e.g. filopodial extension/retraction, lateral signaling, gene expression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Özel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Troemel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wernet et al., 2006</xref>) or when environmental factors impinge on development (e.g. rearing temperature, sensory experience) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hubel et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kiral et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shatz and Stryker, 1978</xref>). Neural development must be flexible to account for these variations to generate robust circuit function.</p><p>To ensure robust circuit function, developing neurons must exhibit specificity and flexibility – specificity in synaptic partner choice and flexibility to respond to variability in partner neuropil territory. If the location and strength of synaptic inputs can vary, how do surrounding neurons adapt such that they receive the right type and right amount of input? Dendrites are the major sites of synaptic input onto a neuron. Studies have shown that dendrites alter their morphology in response to varying levels of synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takeo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tripodi et al., 2008</xref>), and more recently we showed that dendrites can alter their position when a presynaptic partner is routed to an alternate neuropil location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Valdes-Aleman et al., 2021</xref>). Dendrites are clearly capable of structural plasticity, yet how they appropriately respond to a variable developmental landscape is unclear.</p><p>Here, we investigate how and when developing dendrites accommodate wiring variation to ensure robust circuit connectivity. The goal of our study was to determine the cellular mechanisms used by dendrites to compensate for variability in presynaptic axon placement and input strength to facilitate functional connectivity. To study these mechanisms in vivo, we used a model system consisting of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval dbd sensory neurons and their postsynaptic partners, the A08a interneurons. dbd neurons are proprioceptors and sense body-wall segment elongation during peristalsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suslak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vaadia et al., 2019</xref>); their activity is required for maintaining efficient crawling speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</xref>). dbd neurons form segmentally repeated connections with A08a in the larval abdominal segments. A08a has two distinct dendritic domains: lateral and medial. All major inputs to the A08a dendritic domain synapse with a single dendrite, either lateral or medial; the dbd sensory neuron synapses with the medial dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>). The function of A08a neurons in larval behavior has yet to be determined, although their wave-like activity during locomotion suggests that A08as are involved in regulating larval peristalsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Itakura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sales et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Leveraging strategies to manipulate presynaptic activity levels and presynaptic contact with postsynaptic dendrites, we find that there are two opposing mechanisms used to regulate robust partner matching between dbd and A08a: presynaptic contact promotes dendrite outgrowth locally, while presynaptic activity inhibits elongation of postsynaptic dendrites globally. These two strategies highlight the important role of presynaptic inputs in regulating the placement and subsequent elaboration of postsynaptic dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>dbd-Gal4 labels the dbd sensory neuron prior to formation of presynaptic contacts</title><p>We sought to induce variability in the placement of the dbd axon to determine the extent to which its connectivity with A08a is stringently required at the medial dendrite. To do this we first needed genetic access to dbd prior to its interaction with A08a. We previously used <italic>165-</italic>Gal4 (subsequently referred to as <italic>dbd-Gal4</italic>) to label the dbd sensory neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Valdes-Aleman et al., 2021</xref>), but the onset of dbd-Gal4 expression was not determined. Here, we use dbd-Gal4 to drive expression of a myr::HA tag, and the 22C10 antibody to label all sensory neurons as a landmark. We observed the first expression of dbd-Gal4 in dbd neurons at embryonic stage 14. At this time, the axons have just entered the dorsal central nervous system (CNS) as immature growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and would not yet have contacted the more ventral neuropil domain occupied by the A08a dendrites. By stage 15, the dbd neurons formed anterior/posterior bilateral branches adjacent to the midline of the neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), followed by further elaboration to link adjacent segments in stage 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By this time, dbd axon terminals occupy a more ventral region of the neuropil where A08a medial dendrites are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schrader and Merritt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zlatic et al., 2003</xref>).

This line first labels A08a in the early hours of the first larval instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). By this time, A08a has contacted dbd and has developed its characteristic lateral and medial dendritic arbors. The timing of A08a-LexA expression precludes us from knowing the state of A08a dendrite development at the time of first contact with dbd. However, we conclude that dbd-Gal4 labels the dbd sensory neuron prior to its growth into the A08a neuropil domain, and thus it is an appropriate tool for manipulating dbd prior to the establishment of dbd-A08a synaptic connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The dbd sensory neuron locally promotes dendrite elongation in the A08a interneuron</title><p>In a previous study, we tested the ability of dbd and A08a to compensate for developmentally induced wiring variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sales et al., 2019</xref>). We tested for stringent specificity in dbd connectivity with the medial arbor by using genetic methods to target the dbd axon to the lateral neuropil. The dbd axon terminal could be misrouted to the intermediate and lateral neuropils through misexpression of repulsive axon guidance receptors, Robo-2 and Unc-5. dbd could form synapses at both intermediate and lateral dendritic arbors, and the strength of functional connectivity when dbd synapsed with the lateral arbor was indistinguishable from wild-type dbd-A08a connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sales et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, when dbd was targeted to lateral or intermediate neuropil domains, A08a produced an ectopic dendritic arbor to match the presynaptic contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Valdes-Aleman et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we extended and confirmed these findings by showing that the cumulative distribution of A08a dendrite volume corresponds to the location of dbd input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). The increase in dendrite arbor volume was most striking in the intermediate zone of the A08a dendritic domain where there are few arbors present in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we plotted the frequency of branch points off the main A08a neurite across the lateral-medial axis. We found that when dbd is targeted to the intermediate zone, there was an increase in the frequency of dendritic branches off the primary A08a neurite in the intermediate zone, supporting the idea that the observed increase in dendrite volume in the intermediate zone is due to novel dbd-promoted dendrite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>).

We could therefore test whether there is a correlation between the number of dbd neurons innervating a segment and the total A08a dendrite length. In wild type, there are 4 dbd neurons innervating a single VNC segment, two per hemisegment. We found that when 1–2 of the 4 dbd neurons are ablated, A08a dendrite length is not significantly different than in controls. However, when 3–4 of the 4 dbd neurons are ablated, A08a lateral dendrite length is significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This finding suggests that a threshold level rather than a linear summation of dbd input stabilizes A08a dendrite outgrowth.</p><p>The expansion of lateral A08a dendrite length was surprising, as dbd does not contact the lateral dendrite in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>). The growth in lateral dendrites following dbd ablation revealed that dbd provides negative regulation of A08a dendrite outgrowth, in addition to the positive mechanism revealed by the dbd lateralization experiments. Moreover, the negative mechanism acts throughout the neuron, rather than locally as does the positive mechanism. A likely source of a neuron-wide inhibitor of dendrite outgrowth is neuronal activity, which negatively regulates dendrite arbor size in multiple systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tripodi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu and Cline, 1998</xref>).

The first was dbd-specific expression of either tetanus toxin light chain (TNT) or mutationally inactive TNT as a negative control. TNT cleaves the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin, inhibiting evoked synaptic vesicle release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sweeney et al., 1995</xref>). A previous study showed that dbd silencing led to slowed and uncoordinated larval locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</xref>). We validated that our silencing tools were effectively inhibiting dbd activity by comparing larval crawling behavior between control and dbd-silenced animals. Dbd-silenced animals had fewer waves of crawling activity, consistent with the previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B and E</xref>). Thus, we proceeded to ask if dbd silencing leads to expanded A08a dendrites. We found that constitutive dbd silencing using TNT indeed resulted in longer, more branched lateral and medial A08a dendrites at 26±2 hr alh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–I</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Chronic silencing of dbd activity drives A08a dendrite elongation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative crawling trace of inactive tetanus toxin light chain (TNT) control larva (26±2 hr after larval hatching [alh]).

Presynaptic activity from dbd is therefore necessary to prevent excessive postsynaptic dendrite outgrowth in A08a.</p><p>If presynaptic activity inhibits A08a dendrite outgrowth, we predicted that elevated levels of dbd activity would conversely result in shorter A08a dendrites. To activate dbd, we expressed the light-sensitive channelrhodopsin CsChrimson using dbd-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). Animals were exposed to broad spectrum light throughout development and A08a dendrite length and complexity were assayed at 25±2 hr alh. Like our silencing experiments, we first confirmed CsChrimson function by assaying larval crawling efficiency. We found that CsChrimson-expressing larvae initiated fewer locomotor waves of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), confirming a previous report that activation of sensory neurons, including dbd, results in slowed larval locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pulver et al., 2009</xref>). After validating CsChrimson function, A08a dendrite length and complexity were assessed. Compared to negative controls expressing LacZ, dbd optogenetic activation led to a decrease in A08a dendrite length and branching. This effect was most pronounced at the medial dendrite; although some lateral arbors exhibited decreased length and branching, it did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>). We present some possible reasons for this in the Discussion. The decreases in arbor length and branching were likely not due to excitotoxicity, as this method has been previously published in larval motor neurons without inducing excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>).

These observations coupled with a previous report of Gal80<sup>ts</sup> inactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>) suggest that dbd cell death occurs within 24 hr of shifting larvae to 30°C, and likely much sooner; however, we do not know the exact timing of dbd cell death with respect to each temperature shift.</p><p>A08a dendrite length was assayed for all experiments at 72 hr alh in A1 or A2 hemisegments that were innervated by 0–1 dbd neurons. If A08a retained the capacity for dendrite plasticity throughout larval life, we expected to detect increases in dendrite length and branching after ablating dbd at each timepoint. In contrast, compared to negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, F, H, J, L and M</xref>), we found that A08a was competent to expand its lateral dendrites only after dbd was ablated in newly hatched larvae at 0 hr alh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G’ and L–M</xref>), but not when ablations occurred at 24 or 48 hr alh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–M</xref>). This result demonstrates that A08a dendrite structural plasticity is confined to an early critical period, perhaps the same critical period as used by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval motor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Presynaptic contact promotes local dendrite outgrowth</title><p>We sought to uncover the cellular mechanism by which dendrites respond to variable positioning and input of their synaptic partners. Here and in our previous work, we rerouted the dbd axon terminal to the lateral and intermediate neuropils and found that A08a dendrites mirrored the location of their displaced presynaptic partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Valdes-Aleman et al., 2021</xref>). When dbd was targeted to the A08a intermediate dendritic domain, an area devoid of dendrites in wild-type, ectopic branches were established. At the same time, we observed a decrease in medial dendrite volume and branching when dbd was targeted elsewhere. In these experiments, we measured no significant change to dbd-A08a functional connectivity strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sales et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that these compensations in dendrite length were likely activity-independent and due to contact alone.</p><p>Across a variety of model systems, presynaptic contact is correlated with or promotes the local outgrowth of dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jacoby and Kimmel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kamiyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Niell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vaughn, 1989</xref>). In classic studies performed on the giant Mauthner (M) cells in zebrafish and axolotl, ablation of sensory afferents resulted in failed M-cell dendrite formation, whereas suprainnervation by these afferents was sufficient to cause overelaboration of the M-cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodman and Model, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kimmel et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimmel et al., 1977</xref>). Interestingly, when paired with a pharmacological silencing manipulation, suprainnervation of the M-cell still resulted in elongated dendrites, suggesting that contact-based cues are sufficient to drive local dendrite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goodman and Model, 1990</xref>); our results are consistent with these findings. Our similar results when dbd is mistargeted suggest a conserved mechanism across vertebrates and invertebrates for the local initiation of dendrites by sensory afferents. The ability for an axon to promote local dendrite outgrowth offers a potential strategy for pre- and postsynaptic partner matching that is robust to variable axon positioning.</p><p>One outstanding question from our studies is whether the dbd axon induces A08a dendrite formation de novo or selectively stabilizes nascent dendrites. There are currently no methods for tracking the initial formation of A08a dendrites. The LexA driver used to label A08a is first expressed in early larval life, after first outgrowth of A08a medial and lateral dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). At the time of dbd CNS innervation at embryonic stage 14, the morphology of A08a dendrites is unknown. Therefore, it is unclear if dbd induces novel dendrite outgrowth from an otherwise bare neurite, or if it stabilizes and promotes continued dendrite elongation from an arbor already beginning to take form. In wild-type animals, A08a dendrites are innervated by multiple neurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sales et al., 2019</xref>). If dbd is not the first neuron to contact the A08a medial dendritic domain, it is possible that the normal function of the dbd axon is to promote the continuous elongation of the medial dendrite rather than its initial induction. Either possibility would support our finding that presynaptic contact promotes postsynaptic dendrite outgrowth and clarifying the exact mechanism will be important for identifying the molecular players that support either process.</p><p>Until tools are developed that provide genetic access to A08a in early development, previous work on <italic>Drosophila</italic> dendrite development can give clues about the molecular mechanisms used to facilitate local dendrite outgrowth between dbd and A08a. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kamiyama et al., 2015</xref> previously found that the initiation of aCC dendrite outgrowth coincides with when the cell receives presynaptic input from the pioneering interneuron MP1. MP1 expresses the Dscam1 cell adhesion molecule; presynaptic Dscam1 promotes the postsynaptic accumulation of Pak1 and Cdc42 in aCC, specifying the precise location of aCC dendrite elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kamiyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wilhelm et al., 2022</xref>). Perhaps a similar transsynaptic cell adhesion mechanism underlies ectopic A08a dendrite formation when dbd is targeted to the intermediate zone between lateral and medial dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Presynaptic activity inhibits dendrite outgrowth neuron-wide</title><p>Homeostatic structural plasticity is a phenomenon in which neurites adjust their length to counter the effect of too much or too little activity; when activity is excessive, the dendrite shrinks, and when activity is diminished, the dendrite expands. Homeostatic regulation of dendritic arbor size has been documented in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoy et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tripodi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yuan et al., 2011</xref>) and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takeo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tanvir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu and Cline, 1998</xref>). We observed a homeostatic relationship between presynaptic activity levels and postsynaptic A08a dendrite length. When synaptic input onto A08a was decreased by silencing evoked dbd activity, A08a dendrites were elongated; when dbd was chronically activated, A08a dendrites were smaller. In contrast to the robust effect of inhibiting dbd neurotransmission, A08a dendrite length was modestly diminished in response to dbd stimulation. One reason for this could be that the inhibitory A02d neuron, which is a top input to A08a (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), also receives input from dbd (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A02d could therefore potentially cancel out some effects of dbd excitation in A08a. Additionally, while CsChrimson has previously been used to chronically activate neurons for minutes to hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>), it is not clear that the channel actually remains open for such long periods of time. Compensatory adjustments in dendrite length are likely a strategy to maintain a ‘set-point’ of synaptic input. Such a mechanism would be useful to maintain a constant level of postsynaptic output when the amount of input is variable.</p><p>When dbd sensory innervation to the A08a medial dendrite was lost due to dbd ablation, A08a lateral dendrites were elongated whereas the medial arbor was maintained. We hypothesize that when dbd is ablated, A08a medial dendrites are unchanged due to the opposing roles of presynaptic activity and presynaptic contact. Lack of dbd contact (which restricts growth) and lack of dbd activity (which promotes growth) could be working in direct opposition and resulting in no change in medial arbor size. In contrast, the lateral arbor experiences only the loss of activity (which acts neuron-wide), leading to arbor growth. Taken together, our data support a model of dendrite development in which presynaptic contact acts locally to promote dendrite outgrowth, whereas presynaptic activity acts globally across an entire neuron to downregulate dendrite elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We propose that as synapses are added and become functional, activity could act as a negative-feedback mechanism to curb excessive dendrite elongation across the postsynaptic neuron.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model: Presynaptic activity and contact opposingly regulate dendrite outgrowth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Presynaptic contact promotes local dendrite outgrowth, while presynaptic activity levels inhibit neuron-wide dendrite outgrowth.

Sustained alterations to neurotransmission would likely impact postsynaptic calcium levels and therefore intracellular calcium signaling. Indeed, studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> show PKA regulation of dendritic arbor size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baines, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tripodi et al., 2008</xref>). Calcium can also signal through regulators of transcription, allowing the effect of activity to potentially be exerted neuron-wide through changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 1994</xref>). While calcium signaling pathways have probably been the most explored among activity-dependent mechanisms regulating dendrite growth, it is likely one of many pathways that the cell could deploy. For example, Wnt signaling is also recruited to inhibit dendrite elongation when activity levels are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Singh et al., 2010</xref>). In the future, it will be interesting to explore the context in which each type of signaling pathway is engaged, and how they could oppose the effect of growth-promoting contact.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A critical period for dendrite development in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva</title><p>Critical periods are developmental windows of heightened neural plasticity that are present from vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kalb, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takesian and Hensch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Walton et al., 1992</xref>) to insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caglayan and Gilbert, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elekonich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hartfelder et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Levine et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morgan et al., 1998</xref>).

In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic motor system, dendrite length can be homeostatically modified by levels of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tripodi et al., 2008</xref>). The motor dendrites lose the capacity to undergo activity-dependent remodeling at 8 hr alh, early in larval life. The closure of this critical period is governed by astrocytes – their infiltration into the neuropil coincides with critical period closure and their contact with motor dendrites prevents precocious dendrite extension/retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stork et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite the clear evidence for this early window of plasticity in the larva, it was unclear whether activity-dependent structural plasticity could be re-engaged in later stages of larval life. The larval nervous system continues to grow throughout its life, with individual neurons adding hundreds of microns of overall dendrite length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerhard et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore wondered if an interneuron such as A08a would be subject to the same critical period for structural plasticity described for larval motor neuron dendrites, or if dendrite plasticity remains necessary in subsequent stages of larval development to accommodate animal growth. Our findings showed that only ablation of dbd prior to 24 hr alh (and thus loss of its excitatory input to A08a) increases A08a dendrite length. This timing is similar to the critical period for motor dendrite structural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>). These results suggest that larval VNC neurons may generally be subject to the same early critical period regulated by astrocytes, and structural plasticity events may not be inducible in later stages of development. If presynaptic input is not required to regulate dendrite outgrowth in subsequent stages of larval life, perhaps separate cell-intrinsic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tenedini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zwart et al., 2013</xref>) or mechanical mechanisms (e.g. stretch or pulling forces) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balice-Gordon and Lichtman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tao et al., 2022</xref>) are required to allow the scaling of circuits as an organism grows.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Dendrite diversification as a substrate for behavioral evolution</title><p>Here and in previous work, we observed that A08a dendrite development is not hard-wired, but is modulated by the location of presynaptic partners and presynaptic activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Valdes-Aleman et al., 2021</xref>).

Imprecise but constrained morphological development could be a ‘bet-hedging’ strategy to promote the adaptability of an individual species to environmental changes.</p><p>Across species, it is intriguing to speculate that species-specific behaviors evolved in part through mechanisms that pattern neurite morphology. For two highly divergent nematode species, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus</italic>, amphid sensilla neuron number and soma position are highly conserved whereas ciliated dendrite morphology is more diverse. Correspondingly, neurons whose structure is more dissimilar between the species also have more divergent synaptic connections, implying that downstream behaviors would also differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hong et al., 2019</xref>). Another study found that in a species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> with evolved attraction to noni fruit, axon branch morphology in an olfactory processing center diverged from that of species that do not exhibit attraction to noni (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auer et al., 2020</xref>). For interneurons such as A08a, genomic changes resulting in alterations to dendrite neuropil position could vary the number and identities of presynaptic partners. It will be interesting to causally test the impact of neurite architecture on behavioral diversification, and specifically the extent to which genes regulating presynaptic axon position, neural activity, or critical period length are nodes of dendritic and ultimately behavioral evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Briefly, the Filaments tool was selected, and a region of interest (ROI) drawn to encompass the dendrite. The source channel for A08a membrane (488) was selected. An approximation for minimum and maximum dendrite diameters were measured in Slice view, and found to be 0.2 and 1 μm, respectively. These values were used to identify Starting Points and Seed Points for all images. Thresholds for Starting Points and Seed Points were manually adjusted until 1 Starting Point on the main A08a dendritic shaft remained, and Seed Points labeled A08a dendrite signal without labeling image background. The option to Remove Disconnected Seed Points was selected, with a Smoothing factor of 0.2 μm. Absolute Intensity Threshold was manually adjusted until all Seed Points were filled.

The x position of each branch point was measured (in microns) (Cell Counter &gt; Measure). The relative lateral-medial position of each branch point was determined by dividing the branch’s x position by ROI width.

Videos of individual larvae were collected at 5 frames/s for 1 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Shibire experiments</title><p>Newly hatched larvae were aged for 22 hr on standard cornmeal fly food at 30°C. At this time, individual larvae were transferred to a 0.5 mm thick 1.2% agarose pad positioned on top of a 22×40 mm coverslip (Corning, Lot# 14418013, Cat. 2980–224, #1.5 thickness). The larva and coverslip were placed on top of a CherryTemp microfluidic chip (Cherry Biotech, Montreuil, France) with an 18°C surface temperature. Larvae were acclimated to the surface for 2 min prior to recording. Videos of individual larvae were collected at 5 frames/s for 1 min. For all behavior experiments, animals that failed to move during the 1 min recording were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Chrimson experiments</title><p>Embryos and newly hatched larvae were aged for 23 hr under white light (~30,000 lux; larvae age 1.03× faster 28°C) with continuous access to +ATR yeast paste. At this time, a larva was gently transferred to a 4×4 cm 1.2% agarose (Sigma, Lot# SLCD4639, Cat. A9539-500G) arena, illuminated with white light (~30,000 lux). Prior to recording, larvae were acclimated to the arena for 2 min. The ambient temperature during recording was 20–22°C. Videos of individual larvae were collected for ~1 min and total number of locomotor waves was divided by total length of video recording (waves/s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-4"><title>Analysis of larval locomotor behavior</title><p>Movie processing and analysis was performed using FIJI (ImageJ 1.50d, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Fiji">https://imagej.net/Fiji</ext-link>). Locomotor waves were manually quantified. Forward and backward waves were summed together for each animal. The number of waves for each animal was normalized to the control average of each independent experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Identification of top neuron partners in the TEM connectome</title><p>The L1 connectome of the larval <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> CNS was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>). In the Connectivity widget of CATMAID, we obtained all postsynaptic partners for ‘dbd_a1l’, ‘dbd_a1r’, and all presynaptic partners for ‘A08a_a1l’ and ‘A08a_a1r’. Partner neurons were filtered out if they were only present on one side of the brain, or if the sum of their synapses on left and right sides of the brain was fewer than 3. For the remaining neurons, we ranked the top 10 synaptically connected neurons downstream of dbd or upstream of A08a. If a neuron was present across multiple brain segments, we summed their synapses together and indicated this in the table where relevant. Neurotransmitter identities for some neurons were previously published in the literature and were included where possible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Sample definition and in-laboratory replication</title><p>A minimum of two independent experiments were done for each experiment. Sample sizes were determined based on previously published standards. Data points in this paper describe biological replicates (multiple individual animals of a corresponding genotype), as technical replicates (repeated measures of the same sample) were not relevant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistics were computed using Excel or Python (scipy.stats). All statistical tests used are listed in the figure legends. For comparisons between cumulative distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnonv test was used as it is more appropriate for detecting differences across two cumulative distributions, rather than just looking for differences between the means of two groups. For remaining statistical tests, a Student’s two-way t-test was used to detect differences in the mean distribution. An assumption of unequal variance was used, as the sample sizes were not sufficiently large to assume equal variance. Statistical outliers were maintained to show the variance in the data. p-Values are reported in the figures. n.s.=not significant, where p&gt;0.05. Plots were generated using Excel or Seaborn and Matplotlib packages in Python.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-82093-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data is included in the manuscript.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Bruce Bowerman and Dr Molly Jud for the use of their CherryTemp system.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Greg J Bashaw (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Sample sizes for the cell ablations should be increased to provide statistical confidence in the robustness of the result. Currently, samples are 3-4.</p><p>2. Ackerman (Ackerman et al., 2021) posits a critical period for motorneuron dendrites between 0-8hrs after larval hatching. Here, this study suggests that UAS-hid activation following release of a tub-Gal80-ts blockade on Gal4 at the point of hatching might lead to changes on the postsynaptic dendrites of A08a during the same critical period. That might be so, but it will be important to have some more information on the ablation efficacy – e.g. how soon after releasing the Gal80 block on Gal4 is it evident, in the dbd cell body and at its axonal terminals?</p><p>3. Potential ambiguity regarding genotyping should be resolved, clearly. I assume that they did use marked balancers, but that some of the immuno was still uncertain (this can happen). Nevertheless, in combination with the absence of documentation about the timing and extent of cell death in the 'critical period' experiments, it seems warranted to seek clarification.</p><p>4. What is the biological context of dbd-A08a, eg with regard to developmental sequence of cell-cell interactions, connectivity, synaptic transmission or functional relevance to animal behaviour? Information on any of the above could be helpful to begin to interpret findings much better. Some data are presented on cell-cell interactions in Figure 1. If elaborated and paired with information on eventual connectivity, those might give sufficient context with which to interpret experimental findings.</p><p>5. Provide more context on the Dbd-A08a connection in the context of other inputs from the EM connectome. The Doe lab has contributed to analysis of the larval VNC connectome and published several papers on aspects of that. Thus, providing connectome context should not be a large burden. Specifically, this study prides itself, quite rightly, on the precision afforded by the genetic tools available. This is at odds with the complete lack of context offered to the reader on what is now known about dbd and A08a connectivity, which I would argue is crucial for the interpretation of experimental observations. For example, what are the downstream partners of the dbd proprioceptor, and where does A08a sit relative to others, both numerically with regard to proportion of synaptic connections, as well as functionally, where known? The same applies for the converse, from perspective of the A08a interneuron.</p><p>6. Being unfamiliar with the wiring diagram of the A08a interneuron and its inputs within the larval ventral nerve cord, I have a hard time in conceptualizing potential mechanisms of this plasticity between the two connected neurons they characterize. Can the authors comment more on what the EM reconstruction of A08a has shown in terms of input. Is the Dbd axonal input the primary one that normally synapses onto the medial dendrite branch of A08a, or is it one of only 10-20 inputs. If there are many others, what fraction of the synapses overall on the medial dendrite does Dbd make. It would dramatically change my interpretation of what is happening if Dbd only forms 1% of the synapses onto this A08a medial branch versus 50% of the inputs.</p><p>7. Greater attention should be given regarding attribution to prior work on this topic, particularly with respect to older work in the insect (not only <italic>Drosophila</italic>). There is a rich literature to which this paper adds. Placing this work in the proper context is essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Being unfamiliar with the wiring diagram of the A08a interneuron and its inputs within the larval ventral nerve cord, I have a hard time in conceptualizing potential mechanisms of this plasticity between the two connected neurons they characterize. Can the authors comment more on what the EM reconstruction of A08a has shown in terms of input.

If there are many others, what fraction of the synapses overall on the medial dendrite does Dbd make. It would dramatically change my interpretation of what is happening if Dbd only forms 1% of the synapses onto this A08a medial branch versus 50% of the inputs. Similarly, how many neurons synapse onto A08a on all its dendritic branches. I would have a very different interpretation of what the activity manipulation data are suggesting if Dbd makes up a major component of A08a's synaptic input, versus only a small fraction. It would help the reader think about why Dbd plays such a prominent role in setting the overall dendritic field size of A08a if we can better conceptualize how much of A08a input and drive are likely coming from this one sensory neuron.</p><p>2. The authors use dendritic volume and branching of A08a as their primary output measurements for manipulations, which is fine. However, it would be nice to determine if synapse number is changing as well. I assume synapse number would scale to dendrite size, but using a tagged ACH receptor expressed in A08a could really show this important point (I assume this is a cholinergic neuron, but if not, that would be worth discussing as well, and other tagged receptor lines might be available for measuring postsynaptic site number). The Doe lab performed a similar analysis for their motor neuron dendrite plasticity work, so it was a bit unfortunate not to have a synaptic count for this Dbd-A08a dendrite plasticity work. It's not an essential addition, but would allow the authors to say that the dendrite scaling with Dbd activity is likely to be influencing synapse number as well.</p><p>3. Any thoughts on the postsynaptic signaling pathway in A08a that extends from postsynaptic activity to dendrite growth control. Would be worth a few sentences in the discussion to speculate on potential pathways. Is A08a a cholinergic neuron? Do the authors think this is likely through activity-dependent transcriptional changes in A08a, or rather local signaling events that enhance or restrict dendrite expansion through cytoskeletal regulation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I believe I have touched on the most important points in the public review. There are a few areas where some additional clarification and/or documentation of the experiments may be helpful.</p><p>While the authors make a compelling argument for why dbd ablation does not lead to the expected changes in A08 dendrite elaboration (i.e. a balance between the loss of activity dependent suppression of growth and the loss of contact-dependent increase in growth), it is less clear to me why the experiments that induce neural activity only effect medial, but nod lateral dendrites. According to the simplest interpretation of the model, both dendritic domains should be affected. Some additional discussion here could be helpful</p><p>For the critical period data, it would be nice to comment/show the time difference in neuronal loss. Is it clear that DBD is effectively ablated at all time points?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Connectomic context: This study prides itself, quite rightly, on the precision afforded by the genetic tools available. This is at odds with the complete lack of context offered to the reader on what is now known about dbd and A08a connectivity, which I would argue is crucial for the interpretation of experimental observations. For example, what are the downstream partners of the dbd proprioceptor, and where does A08a sit relative to others, both numerically with regard to proportion of synaptic connections, as well as functionally, where known? The same applies for the converse, from perspective of the A08a interneuron.</p><p>Data interpretation: I may have missed it, but was left puzzled by two observations that I felt did not receive the attention deserved or suggested an interpretation that seemed inconguous: (a) that ablation of dbd caused A08a (lateral) dendrites to expand that normally do not make contact with dbd – why? (B) The suggestion in lines 276ff that silencing of dbd activity, which causes a more general dendritic overgrowth phenotype (i.e. not just the lateral A08a dendrites), demonstrated a suppression of dbd on dendritic growth. If indeed simply so, then why does the dbd ablation experiment lead to a different A08a dendritic growth phenotype?</p><p>On cell ablation: These experiments are suggestive, but really need careful controls that detail efficacy and timing of dbd killing. It is concerning that the authors were unclear as to the genotype of animals in which dbd neurons had not been ablated (definitely need to use fluorescently marked balancers). Caspase induced cell death can play out in different ways over time and space of a neurons, which may or may not have a significant impact on events and eventual phenotype interpretation. For example, what is the efficacy of dbd ablation prior to dbd axons reaching the CNS, during CNS ingrowth or after establishing contact with neurons such as A08a? What happens to growth cones and axons of dbd following hid mis-expression? Could remnants be signalling to A08a in some form, e.g. releasing signals such as ROS that are said to be upregulated with dying cells?</p><p>How do these events play out when hid expression is acutely induced, so as to establish if there is a critical period? Here, sample sizes are very small and in need of methodologically independent verification (ideally).

Ackerman (Ackerman et al., 2021) posits a critical period for motorneuron dendrites between 0-8hrs after larval hatching. Here, this study suggests that UAS-hid activation following release of a tub-Gal80-ts blockade on Gal4 at the point of hatching might lead to changes on the postsynaptic dendrites of A08a during the same critical period. That might be so, but it will be important to have some more information on the ablation efficacy – e.g. how soon after releasing the Gal80 block on Gal4 is it evident, in the dbd cell body and at its axonal terminals?</p></disp-quote><p>Constitutive expression of hid in embryonic dbd neurons on average results in ablation of 53% of dbd neurons within 9 hours (animals raised at 30<italic><bold>°</bold></italic>C, hid expression initiating at stage 14 with the onset of dbd-Gal4; ablation complete by stage 17; see figure S3).

Regarding function, several labs have shown that dbd is a proprioceptor, whose activity during larval crawling is co-incident with body segment relaxation (Suslak et al., 2015; Vaadia et al., 2019); the in vivo role of A08a during behavior is unknown, although it’s participation in a central pattern generating network (Itakura et al., 2015) is consistent with a role in regulating larval crawling.

Specifically, this study prides itself, quite rightly, on the precision afforded by the genetic tools available.

Based on synapse counts, dbd is the input to A08a overall, and is also the only excitatory neuron in the top 10 to synapse with the A08a medial dendrite. Among the top 10 neurons in Table 2, dbd synapses make up 52.4% of the total synapses targeted to the A08a medial dendrite.

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, critical periods have been identified in the late embryo/early larva (Ackerman et al., 2021; Crisp et al., 2011; Fushiki et al., 2013; Giachello et al., 2021; Giachello and Baines, 2015; Hartwig et al., 2008; Jarecki and Keshishian, 1995; Tripodi et al., 2008) and in the newly-eclosed adult (Doll et al., 2017; Doll and Broadie, 2016, 2015; Golovin et al., 2021, 2019). Altered activity during the critical period can lead to long-lasting defects in neuronal morphology and behavior (Ackerman et al., 2021; Crisp et al., 2011; Fushiki et al., 2013; Giachello et al., 2021; Giachello and Baines, 2015; Hartwig et al., 2008; Jarecki and Keshishian, 1995; Tripodi et al., 2008). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic motor system, dendrite length can be homeostatically modified by levels of activity (Tripodi et al., 2008). The motor dendrites lose the capacity to undergo activity-dependent remodeling at 8hrs alh, early in larval life. The closure of this critical period is governed by astrocytes – their infiltration into the neuropil coincides with critical period closure and their contact with motor dendrites prevents precocious dendrite extension/retraction (Ackerman et al., 2021; Stork et al., 2014).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

The authors use dendritic volume and branching of A08a as their primary output measurements for manipulations, which is fine. However, it would be nice to determine if synapse number is changing as well. I assume synapse number would scale to dendrite size, but using a tagged ACH receptor expressed in A08a could really show this important point (I assume this is a cholinergic neuron, but if not, that would be worth discussing as well, and other tagged receptor lines might be available for measuring postsynaptic site number). The Doe lab performed a similar analysis for their motor neuron dendrite plasticity work, so it was a bit unfortunate not to have a synaptic count for this Dbd-A08a dendrite plasticity work. It's not an essential addition, but would allow the authors to say that the dendrite scaling with Dbd activity is likely to be influencing synapse number as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the statement that this experiment is &quot;not an essential addition&quot; because the first author has started her postdoc since submission of this manuscript back in July, plus it would take many months.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Any thoughts on the postsynaptic signaling pathway in A08a that extends from postsynaptic activity to dendrite growth control. Would be worth a few sentences in the discussion to speculate on potential pathways. Is A08a a cholinergic neuron? Do the authors think this is likely through activity-dependent transcriptional changes in A08a, or rather local signaling events that enhance or restrict dendrite expansion through cytoskeletal regulation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the opportunity to add some points of discussion here. There is a large body of work on the connection between activity and changes in dendritic arbor size. Many of the best characterized pathways linking activity to dendrite growth are calcium based, and can function globally by regulating gene expression (e.g. CREB, Wnt). We add the following new text to the Discussion to provide this context:</p><p>&quot;How might activity limit dendrite growth throughout the postsynaptic neuron? Sustained alterations to neurotransmission would likely impact postsynaptic calcium levels and therefore intracellular calcium signaling. Indeed, studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> show PKA regulation of dendritic arbor size (Baines, 2003; Tripodi et al., 2008). Calcium can also signal through regulators of transcription, allowing the effect of activity to potentially be exerted neuron-wide through changes in gene expression (Sun et al., 1994). While calcium signaling pathways have probably been the most explored among activity-dependent mechanisms regulating dendrite growth, it is likely one of many pathways that the cell could deploy. For example, Wnt signaling is also recruited to inhibit dendrite elongation when activity levels are high (Singh et al., 2010). In the future, it will be interesting to explore the context in which each type of signaling pathway is engaged, and how they could oppose the effect of growth-promoting contact.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I believe I have touched on the most important points in the public review. There are a few areas where some additional clarification and/or documentation of the experiments may be helpful.</p><p>While the authors make a compelling argument for why dbd ablation does not lead to the expected changes in A08 dendrite elaboration (i.e. a balance between the loss of activity dependent suppression of growth and the loss of contact-dependent increase in growth), it is less clear to me why the experiments that induce neural activity only effect medial, but nod lateral dendrites. According to the simplest interpretation of the model, both dendritic domains should be affected. Some additional discussion here could be helpful</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry this was not clear. Figure 5 shows that activating dbd leads to a diminishing of the medial arbor, and a modest but statistically insignificant decrease in lateral arbor size. We’ve added some potential reasons for this to the Discussion. These include (i) the possibility that dbd is simultaneously providing feed-forward inhibition onto A08a via its connection with the glutamatergic A02d and (ii) that while CsChrimson has been used in long-term activation paradigms before, it is unknown whether the channel can actually remain open for the entire stimulus duration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the critical period data, it would be nice to comment/show the time difference in neuronal loss.

(B) The suggestion in lines 276ff that silencing of dbd activity, which causes a more general dendritic overgrowth phenotype (i.e. not just the lateral A08a dendrites), demonstrated a suppression of dbd on dendritic growth. If indeed simply so, then why does the dbd ablation experiment lead to a different A08a dendritic growth phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding question (a), we hypothesize that ablation of dbd causes loss of A08a excitation, resulting in a homeostatic response to increase all A08a dendrites, both medial and lateral; enlargement of A08a medial dendrites is masked, however, by the loss of contact-based dendrite outgrowth. Thus, the lateral dendrites experience only homeostatic growth, whereas medial dendrites experience both homeostatic growth and loss of contact-induced dendrite growth which cancel each other out. Regarding question (b), the same explanation (or hypothesis) holds for this question as well, which results in the differential effect on the lateral arbor (only homeostatic growth inputs) versus medial arbor (both homeostatic growth inputs AND reduced dendrite growth due to loss of contact-based growth cues). We have revised the Discussion to be clearer on these points.</p><p>Or we can quote reviewer 2 for their elegant phrasing: &quot;… the authors make a compelling argument for why dbd ablation does not lead to the expected changes in A08 dendrite elaboration (i.e. a balance between the loss of activity dependent suppression of growth and the loss of contact-dependent increase in growth).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On cell ablation: These experiments are suggestive, but really need careful controls that detail efficacy and timing of dbd killing.

We are sorry the reviewers had to call us out on this, but very glad they did.</p><p>Embryo/larval critical period</p><p>Jarecki / Keshishian 1995</p><p>Tripodi / Landgraf 2008</p><p>Hartwig / Ramaswami 2008</p><p>Crisp / Bate 2011</p><p>Fushiki / Nose 2013</p><p>Giachello / Baines 2015</p><p>Giachello / Baines 2021</p><p>Adult critical period</p><p>Doll / Broadie 2015</p><p>Doll / Broadie 2016</p><p>Doll / Broadie 2017</p><p>Golovin / Broadie 2019</p><p>Golovin / Broadie 2021</p><p>Manduca and honeybee critical periods</p><p>Caglayan / Gilbert 1987</p><p>Levine / Bate 1986</p><p>Morgan / Mercer 1998</p><p>Hartfelder / Hepperle 1995</p><p>Elekonich / Robinson 2003</p><p>We modify the discussion to say:</p><p>&quot; Critical periods are developmental windows of heightened neural plasticity that are present from vertebrates (Kalb, 1994; Keck et al., 2017; Takesian and Hensch, 2013; Walton et al., 1992) to insects (Caglayan and Gilbert, 1987; Elekonich et al., 2003; Hartfelder et al., 1995; Levine et al., 1986; Morgan et al., 1998). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, critical periods have been identified in the late embryo/early larva (Ackerman et al., 2021; Crisp et al., 2011; Fushiki et al., 2013; Giachello et al., 2021; Giachello and Baines, 2015; Hartwig et al., 2008; Jarecki and Keshishian, 1995; Tripodi et al., 2008) and in the newly-eclosed adult (Doll et al., 2017; Doll and Broadie, 2016, 2015; Golovin et al., 2021, 2019). Altered activity during the critical period can lead to long-lasting defects in neuronal morphology and behavior (Ackerman et al., 2021; Crisp et al., 2011; Fushiki et al., 2013; Giachello et al., 2021; Giachello and Baines, 2015; Hartwig et al., 2008; Jarecki and Keshishian, 1995; Tripodi et al., 2008). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic motor system, dendrite length can be homeostatically modified by levels of activity (Tripodi et al., 2008). The motor dendrites lose the capacity to undergo activity-dependent remodeling at 8hrs alh, early in larval life. The closure of this critical period is governed by astrocytes – their infiltration into the neuropil coincides with critical period closure and their contact with motor dendrites prevents precocious dendrite extension/retraction (Ackerman et al., 2021; Stork et al., 2014).&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
