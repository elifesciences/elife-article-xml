We identify rapid phases of initiation, expansion, duplication, and disassembly and examine the functions of seven different actin and/or nucleator regulators (ANRPs) in guiding these behaviors. We find ANRPs provide distinct activities in building actin cap morphologies – specifically, while DPod1 is a major regulator of actin intensities, Cortactin is required for continued cortical growth, while Coronin functions in both growth and intensity and is required for Cortactin localization to the cap periphery. Unexpectedly, cortical actin populations recover <italic>more rapidly</italic> after regulator disruption, suggestive of a deep competition for limited G-actin pools, and we measure in vivo Arp2/3 recruitment efficiencies through an ectopic relocalization strategy.

This capacity to rapidly direct filamentous actin assembly is key to a cell’s ability to either maintain or abruptly distort its cell shape. During development, the rapid changes in tissue morphologies are often a result of the remodeling of cortical actin and myosin activities (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Munjal and Lecuit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heer and Martin, 2017</xref>). In keeping with this importance of regulating actin structures to achieve discrete cell shapes, a multitude of actin regulators are present within the genomes of eukaryotic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Siripala and Welch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swaney and Li, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pegoraro et al., 2017</xref>). Some of the foremost examples of actin regulators are the nucleation and assembly complexes of the Formin and Arp2/3 complex families. Additionally, there are a host of actin and nucleator regulatory proteins present in the genomes of most higher animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Siripala and Welch, 2007</xref>). However, although the biochemical activities of a broad array of actin regulators have been examined in vitro, how these combined activities are utilized by development in vivo to generate three-dimensional structures is less clear. Furthermore, many actin regulators have been implicated in a variety of different processes ranging from the control of filament branching and turnover to the direct regulation and stabilization of nucleator complex function. Thus, the baseline effects of how these proteins contribute to building cortical structures is unclear. Here, we examine the in vivo function of seven major families of <underline>a</underline>ctin and/or <underline>n</underline>ucleator <underline>r</underline>egulatory <underline>p</underline>roteins (<underline>ANRP</underline>s – DPod1, Coronin, Cortactin, Scar, Wasp, Wash, Carmil) in an intact organismal tissue context. We are using the dynamic furrowing processes in the early syncytial fly embryo to study the rapid formation and disassembly of apical actin networks. In the end, the combined activities of different actin regulatory pathways will drive the cell-shaping events necessary for the development and generation of a wide array of cell morphologies.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytium has a series of rapid transient cleavage cycles that are driven by actin polymerization and membrane trafficking pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Warn, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pelissier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grosshans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mavor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xie and Blankenship, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Following fertilization and the fusion of the male and female pronuclei, the zygotic nucleus undergoes 13 rounds of replication in the absence of cell division to generate a single-celled embryo with approximately 5000 nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hartenstein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mazumdar and Mazumdar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmidt and Grosshans, 2018</xref>). The first nine rounds of replication occur deep in the yolk of the embryo; however, at cycle 10, nuclei migrate to the periphery and begin organizing the formation of cortical actin structures at the apical surface (apical F-actin caps) that will then seed the formation of cytokinetic-like furrows that serve to separate mitotic spindles in the syncytium.</p><p>Apical actin cap and cleavage furrow behaviors are highly transient, forming during each syncytial cell cycle where they compartmentalize and anchor mitotic spindles, before then regressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sullivan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holly et al., 2015</xref>). Embryos undergo four rapid rounds of actin cap and furrow formation (cycles 10–13), followed by a final fifth round of furrow ingression that results in the permanent packaging of nuclei into individual cells and the formation of an epithelium through a process known as cellularization. The ability to form these apical actin caps and ingressing furrows is essential to genomic stability – when these morphogenetic processes are disrupted, chromosomal segregation defects occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sullivan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xie and Blankenship, 2018</xref>). Cap failure leads to aneuploid and polyploid nuclei, and defective nuclei are subsequently jettisoned into the deep yolk layer where they do not contribute further to development. This illustrates the importance of effective cortical actin cap function in the early embryo. These cleavage cycles of actin and furrow formation are rapid, with each full round of cap assembly and disassembly occurring within 7 (cycle 10) to 20 min (cycle 13). F-actin regulation is therefore highly dynamic, and these stages represent an intriguing system to analyze how three-dimensional forms can be swiftly generated.</p><p>Here, we use 4D live-imaging of filamentous actin to determine phasic behaviors during cortical cap formation. Formation of these actin structures progresses through rapid periods encompassing growth, stabilization, elongation, and remodeling activities. Formin and Arp2/3 networks are responsible for building these cortical structures, and individual ANRPs have distinct functions in guiding cap growth and cap-associated actin intensities. We also generate an ANRP-related toolkit of genomic transgenes for these actin regulators and employ a mito-tag strategy to assess the strength of Arp2/3 nucleator recruitment in vivo. Finally, we explore how the disruption of ANRPs leads to <italic>faster</italic> actin network recoveries, which may be suggestive of a competition for a limited G-actin pool that controls actin assembly dynamics in the embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapid formation and dissolution of apical actin cap structures</title><p>The apical actin caps in the early syncytial <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo are highly active structures that undergo cyclic behaviors of formation and disassembly on relatively short time scales.

During this phase, the major increase in cap dimensions occurs in as little as 120 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is followed by cap stabilization and cap elongation, which correlates with spindle duplication and separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2010</xref>). Lastly, caps disassemble and then reform as small proto-caps around two central hubs to begin the next cycle of cap behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>). In each cycle, the cap dynamics share similar features, albeit with moderate differences (especially in the very short cycle 10) – as a result, we will focus on cycle 11 caps going forward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–G</xref>).</p><p>During the expansion phase, cycle 11 actin caps rapidly expand from small proto-caps to caps 15–18 µm in diameter and 206 µm<sup>2</sup> in area on average within 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>). Apical cap size increases almost sixfold during this period and growth rates peak early during expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Interestingly, despite the exponential growth in cap size, the actin intensity increases only mildly, with a ~39% increase by the end of stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This suggests that actin recruitment is carefully regulated spatially such that the cap grows rapidly in total area but regional intensities do not.</p><p>The following stabilization phase lasts for ~60 s with caps largely maintaining their size. As the cell cycle continues, caps elongate and slightly increase in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>). However, cap intensities begin to decrease and heterogeneity within the cap drops by approximately one quarter of the maximum at the end of stabilization phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). Interestingly, the morphology of the cap during elongation switches from round to an elongated doughnut-like structure and caps begin to lose intensity in internal actin populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As the cell cycle reaches mitosis and chromosomal segregation, the caps fragment and disassemble. Overall cap area begins to decline as F-actin gradually disbands leaving low-intensity gaps in the middle of the elongating figure and along cap edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). During actin cap disassembly, the average intensity of caps drops, as well as the measured heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). These results demonstrate that the apical cap is a dynamic and complex F-actin structure, providing an interesting contextual model for the investigation of filamentous behaviors in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Diaphanous and Arp2/3 networks direct actin cap dynamics</title><p>After describing the filamentous actin dynamics above, we wanted to examine the major actin networks that drive these behaviors. The Formin Diaphanous and the Arp2/3 complex have been previously implicated in regulating actin nucleation at these syncytial stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stevenson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zallen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grosshans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). According to published studies, Diaphanous appears to be the major regulator of furrow-associated F-actin, while Arp2/3 has been implicated in apical actin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grosshans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), although comprehensive time-lapse-based quantitation has been lacking. We therefore performed our own quantitative analysis of these protein’s function in the early syncytial stages. Consistent with previous results, disruption of Diaphanous function deeply affects furrow-associated actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, Diaphanous also shows a significant contribution to the early expansion of actin caps. <italic>Dia</italic> disrupted embryos have a ~ 35% reduction in cap area expansion, but a relatively mild 18% reduction in actin intensities and cap expansion rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). We then examined the contribution of the Arp2/3 complex to actin behaviors. By contrast to Diaphanous, when Arp2/3 function is compromised there is an almost complete absence of cap expansion and cap actin intensities are reduced to 47% of wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–H</xref>). Interestingly, the remaining actin structure appear to be hollowed out and missing internal actin populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). As recent evidence has shown that Arp2/3 and Formin networks can demonstrate a degree of interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Suarez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2019</xref>), we examined Diaphanous and Arp2/3 intensities when each network was disrupted. Although defective cap structures characteristic of the above described results were observed, disruption of <italic>Diaphanous</italic> function did not significantly affect Arp2/3 intensities (as judged by ArpC1:GFP), nor did <italic>Arp2/3</italic> disruption affect anti-Diaphanous intensities in the remaining cap structures (anti-Diaphanous immunostaining; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). These results show that Diaphanous and Arp2/3 both contribute to structuring apical actin caps, but that Arp2/3 is the major regulator of actin intensities and cap growth. The hollowed out internal cap structures as well as the failure in cap expansion also suggests a possible model in which Arp2/3 polymerizes F-actin internally, and the cap possesses a dispersion mechanism that flows F-actin filaments towards the edges so as to maintain consistent internal F-actin intensities.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Quantitative dynamics of Formin and Arp2/3-driven actin networks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Still images from live-imaging of apical F-actin dynamics (UAS:moeABD:mCherry, cycle 11) from control, <italic>Dia shRNA</italic> and <italic>ArpC4 shRNA</italic> lines at t = 20, 90, 180, 360, 540 s.

Compromising Coronin function causes an immediate defect in the expansion phase of cap formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,G’</xref>), with actin intensities at ~70% of control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F,G’’</xref>). By contrast, disrupting DPod1 function produces caps that expand at near wild-type levels and possess wild-type areas until they fail to maintain area size in the later stages of apical cap function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,E’</xref>). However, these embryos have dramatically reduced actin intensities throughout the cap area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E’’</xref>). In embryos with compromised Cortactin function, there is a normal burst of actin expansion, but after ~120 s actin caps do not continue to grow and steadily diminish in size, suggesting a role for Cortactin in growth at the cap periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I–I’’</xref>). Interestingly, F-actin intensities within the smaller cap are at <italic>higher</italic> levels than control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I’’</xref>). Disrupting Scar function produces actin caps that show an early depletion of F-actin intensities followed by a delayed expansion phase in which the caps cannot fully reach control cap areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K–K’’</xref>). The specificity and reproducibility of these phenotype was confirmed with second, independent shRNA lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Given these effects on the size, shape, and intensity of apical actin caps, and our results demonstrating that the Arp2/3 complex is the major regulator of actin behaviors in the apical cortex, we next determined the degree to which Arp2/3 complex recruitment (as proxied by an endogenous CRISPR Arp3:GFP) to the apical cortex was compromised in these various backgrounds. Disrupting the Formin Diaphanous had no effect on Arp3:GFP localization at apical structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N,O</xref>). By contrast, disruption of ArpC4, one of the Arp2/3 complex subunits, almost completely abolishes apical Arp3:GFP localization and intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N,O</xref>). Interestingly, DPod1, which had the deepest impact on overall F-actin intensities, also had the largest effect on Arp3:GFP localization, while Coronin, Scar, and Cortactin showed intermediate Arp3:GFP recruitment defects. Together, these results reveal distinct functions for individual ANRPs, with DPod1 being required for overall actin intensities, while Cortactin and Scar are necessary for cap expansion and maintenance. These results are also consistent with Coronin having an early function, possibly in the cap center, and Cortactin/Scar possessing a later function in controlling cap growth and maintenance of cap areas at the periphery. Coronin and Scar have both intensity (at early phases) and cap size functions, and Carmil, Wasp, and Wash have either minor or no contributions to cap dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Coronin directs Cortactin localization to the cap periphery</title><p>To examine the expression and localization of the ANRPs during cap formation, we first used qPCR to examine the relative mRNA levels of each ANRP in the early syncytium. These results show that Coronin, Cortactin, and DPod1 are highly expressed and Carmil and Wash are present at low levels during syncytial stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Dia, Wasp, and Scar have intermediate expression. To further investigate the localization of each regulator, we generated an ANRP toolkit of expression constructs. We first generated either N- or C-terminal UAS GFP expression transgenic constructs (and, in many cases, both N- and C- terminal; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and then followed up with either CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination to knock-in GFP at endogenous loci or generated antibodies to examine endogenous localization. A CRISPR-generated GFP knock-in at the endogenous Arp3 locus shows a strong localization to the apical cap with little localization to furrows, consistent with our functional data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Neither UAS-driven Carmil nor Wasp localized to apical actin caps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), again consistent with the above functional analysis indicating their disruption had little impact on apical cap dynamics. UAS-driven Coronin, Cortactin, Scar, and DPod1 all displayed varying degrees of localization to actin caps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), with endogenous CRISPR constructs or antibody stains showing similar patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). One intriguing facet of these regulators’ localization, however, is that Coronin and Cortactin possessed a complementary localization in mature caps, with Cortactin enrichment occurring at the cap periphery, while Coronin possesses an enrichment in the cap interior (temporal overlays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–I</xref>). This is also consistent with our functional analysis, in which Cortactin was required for cap growth late in the expansion phase and during later size maintenance, while Coronin was required for early cap growth. The complementary localization also suggests a possible antagonism between Coronin and Cortactin. To examine this, we imaged GFP:Cortactin embryos when Coronin was disrupted. Remarkably, this revealed that, in the absence of Coronin function, Cortactin fails to transition to the cap periphery, indicating that Coronin contributes to the ability of Cortactin to localize to the cell periphery to direct actin growth and the maintenance of cap edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J,K</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>ANRP localization at apical actin caps.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Coronin (UAS:Coronin:GFP), Cortactin (UAS:GFP:Cortactin), DPod1 (UAS:DPod1:GFP), Scar (UAS:Scar:GFP), and Carmil (UAS:Carmil:GFP) localization on apical cap structures at t = 20, 180, 270, and 360 s. <italic>Additional Cortactin CRISPR and DPod1 CRISPR allele and anti-Coronin immunostaining data in Fig. Supplement 4-1.</italic> Scale bar = 5 μm.

These recovery rates are nearly identical when actin is directly labeled with GFP, again demonstrating that tracking actin cap behaviors with the MoeABD:GFP accurately reflects actin dynamics and that any on–off actin-binding rates by MoeABD:GFP are significantly slower than actin turnover rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Arp2/3 and Formin network analysis suggests competition for free G-actin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Still images from FRAP recovery of F-actin live-imaging (UAS:moeABD:mCh) in cycle 11 embryos at t = −1s (1 s before photobleaching), 0 s (photobleaching), 4 s, 8 s, 12 s, 24 s, and 32 s.

Our expectation was that as these networks are essential for cap growth and actin intensities, we would observe a longer recovery time after photobleaching. Surprisingly, we found that actin recovery is <italic>much faster</italic> when either Arp2/3 or Diaphanous function is disrupted. Indeed, although actin intensities are much reduced, the half-time to recovery of these intensities is nearly twice as fast as in wild-type embryo (4.2 s and 4.1 s in <italic>ArpC4</italic> and <italic>Diaphanous shRNA</italic> embryos, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To examine this further, we analyzed what would happen to recovery rates when more actin is bound into stable filaments and less G-actin is available. We therefore injected embryos with low levels of jasplakinolide to stabilize F-actin – under these conditions, recovery times increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Similarly, reducing the G-actin availability by low-dose Latrunculin B injection also slowed recovery times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). These results are intriguing, and at least two potential models could explain these behaviors: (1) the enhanced FRAP recovery times are driven by increased rates of nucleation and polymerization due to higher free G-actin pools or (2) higher FRAP recovery rates could be caused by increased actin turnover. Given that both Diaphanous and Arp2/3 complex function are deeply implicated in directing actin growth and nucleation, and the fact that they are chronically depleted in these experiments, we would suggest that these results support the first model and argues that these complexes are in a strong competition for a limited pool of available G-actin monomers. Consistent with this, FRAP analysis after disrupting Cofilin function (known as <italic>twinstar</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) did not significantly slow down FRAP recovery times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we measured cap recovery rates when the individual ANRPs were disrupted. Similar to disrupting Arp2/3 or Dia function, compromising DPod1, Coronin, Cortactin, or Scar led to faster recovery times, although to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B,E</xref>). Interestingly, DPod1 disruption was almost comparable to disrupting Arp2/3 function in its effect on recovery times and immobile fractions. This is consistent with our data indicating that DPod1 has the strongest impact on F-actin intensities in the cap. By analogy to the above, this could also suggest that actin intensities in the various disrupted backgrounds appear to well-reflect the degree to which specific actin networks are the predominant G-actin utilizing networks in the embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Nucleator recruitment strengths of ANRP regulators</title><p>As we have examined the localization and function of the different ANRPs in cortical cap formation, and as the Arp2/3 complex is the major regulator of new actin in the apical cortex, we wanted to test the strength of Arp2/3 recruitment by each ANRP in vivo. Although, as discussed above, the ANRPs have been implicated in several different mechanisms of actin-regulation, many of the ANRPs have been shown to either activate or stabilize Arp2/3 complex function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uruno et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weaver et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uetrecht and Bear, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pollitt and Insall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharya et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore adapted a mitochondrial-tagging assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shin et al., 2020</xref>) to recruit ANRPs to the mitochondria and then tested the degree to which Arp3 and F-actin become ectopically localized. Since DPod1, Cortactin, Coronin, and Scar had the strongest effects on actin cap formation, we fused each of these ANRPs to mCherry and an outer mitochondrial membrane mito-tag (Tom70-HA, 58 amino acids). Intriguingly, the mito-tagged ANRPs are each capable of recruiting Arp3:GFP, although an ANRP-less mito-tag control did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, they also appear able to activate Arp2/3 complex function, as filamentous actin is observed at the mito-tag puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). To measure the strength of recruitment, we quantified the colocalization percentage and relative Arp3:GFP intensity as normalized to mito-ANRP:mCherry intensity. Of the tested ANRPs, mito-DPod1 possessed the strongest colocalization and recruitment ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). By contrast, Coronin had the lowest colocalization and recruitment ability, while Cortactin and Scar had intermediate Arp3-recruiting activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–J</xref>). These results are consistent with our functional analysis, which indicated that DPod1 is most important for overall actin cap intensities and suggests that a high potency ANRP, DPod1, has been selected to drive overall actin levels, while Coronin, Cortactin, and Scar largely have a spatial function in driving cap expansion. These results also provide some insight on the ANRPs relative potencies, as Cortactin demonstrates a high percent of colocalization, but relatively low recruitment ability, while Scar has moderate Arp3 colocalization but high recruitment ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O, P</xref>). Although it was not possible to recover flies that had pair-wise mito-tag combinations of every mito-ANRP, we were able to analyze embryos that possessed both Coronin and Cortactin mito-tags, as well as embryos that had both DPod1 and Scar mito-tags. Intriguingly, the Arp3 localization and recruitment ability was very low in the double mito-Coro+mito-Cort, while Arp3 recruitment was very high in the double mito-DPod1+mito-Scar background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O,P</xref>). This is again consistent with a potential inhibitory interaction between Coronin and Cortactin and with DPod1 and Scar being potent activators of Arp2/3 recruitment and activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>In vivo nucleator recruitment strengths of actin regulatory proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A, C, E, G, I, K, M</bold>) Images of CRISPR Arp3:GFP with mito-tagged mCherry control (<bold>A</bold>) or mCherry:ANRPs (<bold>C, E, G, I, K, M</bold>) in cells at stage 12.

However, here a different mechanism is at work, as we observed that nuclei that underwent apparently normal cell divisions still lost apical positioning in the Arp2/3 compromised background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We therefore correlated nuclear fallout with cortical cap properties such as intensity and cap expansion rates in the various ANRP backgrounds. This analysis revealed that the key property for nuclear anchorage was the growth in cap areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), while overall cap intensities had little correlation to nuclear fallout rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Here, we used the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytium as a system to study rapidly developing actin structures and tested the function of seven different ANRP family members in directing specific properties of the apical cortex. We created an ANRP toolkit composed of 18 different transgenic constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) to analyze the interplay of actin regulators in an intact morphogenetic organism. This toolkit should form a useful reagent collection for the fly community and has revealed that unique ANRPs were used to drive specific aspects of the growing actin cap. We observed that DPod1 has an essential function in supporting the overall actin intensities in the cap, but does not appear to function in directing the expansion of the actin cap. In contrast, Cortactin does not contribute to actin intensities, but plays a key role driving the continued growth and expansion of the cap. Interestingly, Coronin, which shares similar WD40 and DUF domain architectures to DPod1, has a dual role in supporting both actin intensity and cap growth. Coronin also shows the earliest function in directing cap growth, while Cortactin and Scar have cap growth rates that become compromised during the late portions of the expansion phase. Interestingly, our results also showed a potential antagonism between Cortactin and Coronin that may underlie these early and late functions of the two regulatory proteins. Cortactin localizes to the cap periphery in later cortical caps, but fails to undergo this transition when Coronin function is disrupted. This suggests that centrally located Coronin may aid in directing Cortactin to a peripheral enrichment, and is consistent with a previous study showing a competition between Coronin and Cortactin in binding at actin branching points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2008</xref>). These results are consistent with a combinatorial model for structuring the apical cortex in which DPod1 supports overall amounts of actin filaments, Coronin supports very early actin cap growth, and Cortactin and Scar promote mid-to-late cap growth and maintenance, although there are varying degrees of overlap in these functions. We also observed that several ANRPs (Carmil, Wasp, and Wash) appeared to have limited or no function at regulating actin cap formation at these stages, as judged both at the level of localization and function, although it is possible that residual gene function after shRNA disruption could obscure potential phenotypes.</p><p>We also comprehensively quantified apical actin dynamics when the major Formin and Arp2/3 actin networks are disrupted. Earlier works in the fly embryo suggested that the actin cap is largely dependent on Arp2/3 function, while the filamentous actin supporting ingressing furrows is largely Diaphanous/Formin driven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grosshans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Our results are broadly consistent with this viewpoint, although they also point to a lesser, but still substantial, Formin function in the cap. Recent work has suggested that Formin proteins and Arp2/3 complex function possess an intriguing interplay in apical caps, with Diaphanous-based actin bundles being displaced by Arp2/3 actin nucleation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang and Harris, 2019</xref>), and other data has shown a degree of interdependence between Arp2/3 and Formin network function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Suarez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2019</xref>), although our measurements suggest that the <italic>levels</italic> of Diaphanous and Arp2/3 are not greatly changed after disruption of the counterpart network. Given the depth of the actin cap disruption in Arp2/3 compromised embryos, we cannot rule out that the developmental regulation of the phases of actin behaviors is altered in this background, though we would favor a more direct mechanical role of Arp2/3 in directing F-actin formation.</p><p>Our results also reveal a potential deep competition between the Diaphanous/Formin and Arp2/3 networks over the available G-actin pools. Somewhat surprisingly, actin fluorescent recovery times were approximately twice as fast when either network was compromised. Although either increases in filament turnover or filament assembly could explain these faster recovery times, the fact that chronic disruption of Diaphanous and Arp2/3 function (both of which are implicated in directing nucleation and filament growth) led to faster network recoveries is suggestive, to us, that this illustrates the degree to which G-actin availability limits filament assembly. These results would also be consistent with studies in <italic>S. pombe</italic> that have similarly suggested an upregulation of specific Formin or Apr2/3 networks when one network is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 2014</xref>). However, it should be noted that Coronin and DPod1 have each been implicated in regulating actin turnover, in addition to potential roles in regulating growth and nucleation (more on this below; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gandhi and Goode, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mikati et al., 2015</xref>). Contrary to this possibility, disruption of actin destabilizing Cofilin did not produce faster FRAP recovery. We find these results intriguing, as even given the volume of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (9.02 × 10<sup>6</sup> µm<sup>3</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Markow et al., 2009</xref>) and the relatively few actin caps (~500–2000 caps during cycles 10–12) present in the early cortical cycles (i.e., per unit volume), these data suggest that local concentrations of G-actin can still become limiting at the cortex. Finally, we would note that the observed actin FRAP recovery times are faster than has been previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2010</xref>), although this may be due to differences in the measured syncytial cycle (cycle 11 versus cycle 12) or other methodological/instrumental differences.</p><p>To test the relative Arp2/3 recruiting potencies of the ANRPs, we chose to employ an ectopic relocalization strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>). This mito-tag technique has the advantage of testing factors in an intact tissue and cytoplasm, as opposed to artificially, buffered conditions in vitro. Although this approach does not differentiate between direct and indirect interactions, it interestingly revealed that DPod1 most potently recruited Arp2/3 to ectopic sites at the mitochondria, which correlates well with the importance of DPod1 for F-actin intensities at the cortical actin cap. Coronin had the weakest recruiting ability, possibly suggesting a primary role for Coronin in the regulation of Cortactin function and consistent with studies that suggest a complicated, and at times contradictory, function in Arp2/3 regulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gandhi and Goode, 2008</xref>, and discussed below). Interestingly, when Scar was found to colocalize with Arp3:GFP, it was a very potent recruiter of Arp3/F-actin, but only a subset of mitochondrial Scar appeared active (~50% colocalization with Arp3:GFP). Embryos with disrupted DPod1, Cortactin, and Scar function also showed changes in actin stability and recovery rates (as indicated by immobile fractions and T50s) that mimicked the changes observed when Arp2/3 complex function was compromised. The partial colocalization of mito-tag Scar with Arp3:GFP additionally suggests a possible regulation and/or partial activation of Scar, which may be limiting in terms of Scar function and may explain why DPod1 is the most potent regulator of actin network function at these stages despite the similar strength with which Scar appears capable of recruiting Arp2/3 complex function. It may also be that this regulation is limiting in the relocalization assay and suggests one of the caveats to this approach (namely, that although this technique had the advantage of being in vivo, it still represents recruitment to an unnatural compartment that may have its own limitations imposed by the presence or absence of upstream signals and lipid bilayer composition). Nevertheless, this approach is a nicely complementary technique to in vitro biochemical measurements and may provide a useful alternative approach for assaying protein recruitment abilities in the early fly embryo in vivo.</p><p>Finally, although much of our focus has been on the ANRPs in terms of guiding F-actin nucleation through the Arp2/3 complex, it should be pointed out that these regulators have been implicated in other actin-related processes (such as the control of filament branching and turnover) that may be responsible for their relative effects on actin growth and intensities. Our functional results illustrate the final outcomes of disrupting ANRP function on actin morphologies, and, combined with the mito-tag assay, suggest the strength of Arp2/3-dependent regulation, but it is clear that several of these proteins have been implicated in additional biochemical processes other than Arp2/3 activation. For example, Coronin has been observed to both promote and inhibit Arp2/3 function, as well as directing F-actin turnover through cofilin/GMF function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gandhi and Goode, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mikati et al., 2015</xref>). The Scar/Wasp/Wash family of proteins is typically viewed as directly activating Arp2/3 nucleating activities (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Molinie and Gautreau, 2018</xref>), and Cortactin can also activate nucleation at high concentrations, but additionally inhibits Arp2/3 debranching after nucleation has begun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weaver et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uruno et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weaver et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2008</xref>). In other systems, Cortactin and Coronin have been found to compete in either stabilizing or destabilizing Arp2/3 branch points, and Cortactin is often preferentially found in newer filaments of migrating lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2008</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that this new-branch stabilizing function of Cortactin could be a reason why Cortactin has been selected to support the edge outgrowth of the caps. Vertebrate homologs of DPod1 (Coronin7) have also been shown to bind and regulate Cdc42 and/or Rac function, suggesting one potential mechanism of actin/Arp2/3 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Swaminathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharya et al., 2016</xref>). However, regardless of the above various activities, our results show the final products of these factors on the apical, cortical actin networks that form and position nuclei in the early fly embryo. It will be interesting in future experiments to begin to further examine the biochemical partners that may help mediate the activities observed in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stock and genetics</title><p>All stocks were maintained at 25°C.

UAS:mCh:MoeABD displays very similar dynamics to directly labeled actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that on/off rates of the moesin actin binding domain are much slower than actin assembly/disassembly rates, and mCh:MoeABD marks similar structures as phalloidin reveals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>). UAS:mCh:MoeABD has also been used extensively in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as an F-actin reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiehart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spracklen et al., 2014</xref>). The measured apical cap region was determined by the region 0.9 μm (3 z-planes) below the apical most layer in which the embryo could be detected. The apical cap area was selected through manual segmentation based on the cap F-actin boundary after background subtraction. Area, average intensity (average intensity values of the measured pixels, and not summed intensities across the total cap), and standard deviation were quantified in FIJI/ImageJ. Normalization was used to reduce variability due to different initial absolute cap areas that occurs naturally in different embryos. To do so, cap measurement traces were aligned to the first time point of cap elongation phase when the centrosomes separate. Cap behaviors were then tracked backwards to the first moment that a new cap was clearly present (this is approximately t = −180 s from the alignment point at cycle 11), and cap area at this time was used as the initial t = 0 area. Cap areas were normalized to the cap size at cap initiation. This gave the most robust and reproducible measurements of changes in cap area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Intensity measurements</title><p>For Arp3:GFP intensity measurements, a circular region (7705 px<sup>2</sup>, ~207 μm<sup>2</sup>) was quantified in each cap with FIJI/ImageJ. For line intensity measurements, the intensity profiles were quantified in FIJI/ImageJ and smoothed by averaging three neighboring points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>FRAP intensity measurements</title><p>Photobleaching was performed on an Olympus Flouview FV3000 confocal laser scanning microscope with 60 × 1.35 NA objective lens as described above. Five hundred and sixty-one nanometer laser photobleaching of ROIs were drawn to encompass single individual caps, or specific regions of caps (center versus periphery), and ROI data was used for analysis of actin recovery rates. Each single cap FRAP was collected from a single embryo (multiple cap FRAP data were not acquired from a given embryo). Images were acquired every 1 s at 2 ms/pixel exposure settings for a total of 60–120 s. ImageJ was used for measuring cap total intensity from FRAP data. To minimize potential effects of focal plane or biological drift, two non-FRAP caps were measured and used for normalization. Normalized intensity = ((FRAPed cap intensity − background) * FRAPed cap area) / ((non-FRAPed cap intensity − background) * non-FRAPed cap area). To calculate the t50 and immobile fraction, we fitted the FRAP data to two-phase association in Graphpad Prism eight with SpanFast = (Plateau-Y<sub>0</sub>) (%Fast*0.01); SpanSlow = (Plateau-Y<sub>0</sub>) (100-%Fast*0.01); Y=Y<sub>0</sub> + (SpanFast) (1-exp(-KFast*X)) + (SpanSlow) (1-exp(-KSlow*X)). X is time in seconds; Y is total cap intensity over time. Y<sub>0</sub> is the cap total intensity immediately after FRAP (t = 0 s). We assumed that the fast half-time measurement indicates the fluorescence recovery by the surrounding G-actin pool addition and turnover, while the slow half-time was produced through the minor cap expansion and intensity increases during this short time period. Fast half-time measurements and fractions are reported as the measured t50 and immobile fractions. Immobile fractions = (Y<sub>-1</sub>− PlateauFast) / (Y<sub>-1</sub>− Y<sub>0</sub>). PlateauFast = 2 * SpanFast * (1-exp(-KFast*t50)) + Y<sub>0</sub>. Y<sub>-1</sub> is the cap intensity 1 s before FRAP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>shRNA lines were crossed to P[mat-tub-Gal4] mat67; P[mat-tub-Gal4] mat15.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Alphee Michelot as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Anne Cecile Reymann (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Xie and Blankenship present here a characterization of the apical actin architectures during the syncytial cell cycles of the fly early embryo. These actin architectures undergo a series of rapid and transient reorganization correlated with cell cycle. The authors examine the functions of one formin (diaphanous), of the Arp2/3 complex, and of 7 other proteins (called here ANRPs) involved in the activation of the Arp2/3 complex and/or in various other actin regulation activities. Their results reveal a clear complexity, as these proteins display different effects on actin caps dynamics and in anchoring embryonic nuclei.</p><p>This work also includes information of ANRPs localization at actin caps, and their relative role in recruiting the Arp2/3 complex. Among those observations, the authors find a clear antagonism between cortactin and coronin, which was shown in previous studies but is nicely confirmed here.</p><p>In the last part of this work, which is more debatable, the authors performed FRAP experiments on actin caps, and find surprisingly that recovery of actin signals are faster in mutant conditions than in WT. These results, together with the fact that treatment with LatB or Jasp increases on the contrary characteristic times of recovery, suggest to the authors that the pool of monomeric actin might be increased in mutant conditions, potentially revealing a competition between actin networks for a limited pool of monomeric actin.</p><p>Overall, the Reviewers agree that tools and results presented here will be valuable for the community. The experimental procedures are adapted and well performed, and revisions should require limited experimental work. However, the Reviewers regret some lack of explanation on the quantification and statistical analysis of the experiments, notably regarding the lack of detailed explanation on the procedures (segmentation procedure, measure of intensity, calculation of errors, FRAP analysis, colocalization etc).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Quantification of the data:</p><p>Could the authors use a more automatized or robust method, such as via an autocorrelation function, to measure the size of the caps without the bias of using a threshold or a manual segmentation? Could they also provide videos for each conditions as Supplementary data?</p><p>How initial time points of cap formation are determined is not clear. Segmentation or thresholding methods to obtain area and intensities are not clearly described. Measured Area is often shown as normalized over the initial area, but this initial time point seems prone to fluctuations or errors of segmentation.</p><p>Regarding actin intensity: is it a total intensity or a mean density which is important as the area is indeed changing? Important to know if we are considering total actin filaments change or local density changes. Making this distinction would also be interesting while discussing shRNA results. There is also no mention on the impact of bleaching even though 5s interval of 4D acquisitions are performed over several minutes.</p><p>From this quantification and the definition of clear parameters, it should also appear clearly why the authors report that cap dynamics share similar features in cycle 10-13. From an observer's eye, it seems on the contrary that some of these phases are absent from certain cycles. Also, Figure 2C, 3B,E,G,I,K and M are not clear, because each phases are defined based on WT conditions only. It would be important to report how phase durations are modified in shRNAs lines.</p><p>Finally, some results from this quantification are curious. For example, between time 0 and 60s in WT, cap intensity only increases moderately (Figure 1G), while cap area increases a lot (Figure 1D). This suggests that actin density should decrease a lot, which seems opposite to what is observed in Figure 1A.</p><p>2. Statistical analysis:</p><p>In Figures 5 and S7 the number of caps analyzed seems fairly small (n=3 or 4 in some cases) for FRAP experiments. The authors should increase their sample size and show the degree of variability in the FRAP parameters that they measured using box plots and standard deviations (rather than standard error).</p><p>The authors should also clarify what the variation observed for cells within a single embryo is vs. the variation for all embryos considered in this study.</p><p>3. The authors should report the efficiency of silencing in the shRNA experiments. This would enable readers to evaluate if residual activity of these proteins is expected or not. When some shRNA as Carmil, Wasp or Wash have little impact on cap dynamics, could it be just a question of efficiency of silencing? In the absence of such measurements, we would be more careful with the conclusions of these experiments.

Based on the hollowed appearance of actin caps in Arp2/3 shRNA embryos, the authors propose that Arp2/3 may promote central actin assembly that then flows outwards. This seems easy enough to test, for example by photobleaching a region in the center of the cap and examining whether that photobleached region propagates outwards. The authors should conduct the same experiment upon Cortactin shRNA or Scar shRNA treatment, which seem to impede actin flow outwards (Figure 3H-I).</p><p>5.

What would be important for this study is to justify why this specific marker does not interfere for the specific observations made here.

The authors should take into account this possibility when discussing their results, and modify Figure 5G.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63046.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Quantification of the data:</p><p>Could the authors use a more automatized or robust method, such as via an autocorrelation function, to measure the size of the caps without the bias of using a threshold or a manual segmentation? Could they also provide videos for each conditions as Supplementary data?</p></disp-quote><p>We have been very interested in an automated approach, and have tried a variety of segmentation algorithms/approaches. However, largely due to the very spiky periphery of caps and the low SNR (signal-to-noise) at the cap edge under the current imaging conditions, we have not found a segmentation approach that determined cap outlines as well as our manual measurements. For now, this appears to be the most accurate way to capture these area. We would note that this is part of the reason for the moderate n numbers – careful manual measurements of cap sizes means that each cycle 11 cap takes ~2 hours to determine (for example, Figure 1 represents ~35 cumulative hours of manual measurements).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How initial time points of cap formation are determined is not clear. Segmentation or thresholding methods to obtain area and intensities are not clearly described. Measured Area is often shown as normalized over the initial area, but this initial time point seems prone to fluctuations or errors of segmentation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, and we have clarified this in the Methods. The reviewer(s) are correct that, especially in the early time points, individual cap behaviors have some degree of variability. To address this, we temporally aligned caps to the first moment of cap duplication when the centrosomes separate (beginning of the elongation phase). We then went back to the first moment that a new cap is present that will clearly become the cycle 11 cap (this is approximately t = -180 sec from the alignment point). Data on cap area was then the normalized to the size at this starting point to account for variation that is induced from caps either having smaller or larger initial starting sizes. This produced the best comparable data as shown by the error envelopes. Both absolute and relative cap areas are measured and are shown in Figure 1. Both absolute and relative areas show similar dynamics and are not significantly different (0 minute in Figure 3 E’, G’, I’, K’, M’). For example, cap areas dynamics of Cortactin shRNA in Figure 3I (relative area) and I’ (absolute area) are similar, but normalized area dynamics better showed how cap areas evolved over time with less variation due to absolute changes in initial starting cap sizes. Please note that we did not observe that any of our shRNA lines affected the timing of centrosome separation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding actin intensity: is it a total intensity or a mean density which is important as the area is indeed changing? Important to know if we are considering total actin filaments change or local density changes. Making this distinction would also be interesting while discussing shRNA results. There is also no mention on the impact of bleaching even though 5s interval of 4D acquisitions are performed over several minutes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We are reporting average densities and not summed total actin intensities – we clarify this in the Methods (Lines 567-568). In terms of the potential photobleaching through live-imaging, this is one of the advantages of the fly embryo – we rarely observe much in the way of photobleaching. We attribute this in part to: 1) the use of moderate laser powers and exposure time (100ms) to reduce bleaching, and 2) the large volume of the embryo, most of which is not in the illuminated focal plane. We have analyzed long live-imaging videos that covered cycles 10 through 13 (~1 hour of acquisitions) and did not find significant reductions/trends of changes in total actin intensities with our imaging parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From this quantification and the definition of clear parameters, it should also appear clearly why the authors report that cap dynamics share similar features in cycle 10-13. From an observer's eye, it seems on the contrary that some of these phases are absent from certain cycles. Also, Figure 2C, 3B,E,G,I,K and M are not clear, because each phases are defined based on WT conditions only. It would be important to report how phase durations are modified in shRNAs lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we believe that there is a similarity of phases in each of the cell cycles, but agree that there are moderate differences, especially in the short cycle 10. We have clarified the language in the manuscript to match this. Also, to make this similarity of phasing more apparent, we have added image panels to the Supplemental Figure S2 better illustrating the cap behaviors in cycles 10, 12, and 13. It appears that the Expansion and Fragmentation phases are clearly present in all cycles. In terms of the stabilization and elongation phases, cycle 10 is very short, so the stabilization phase is less clear, but the stabilization and elongation phases (as distinguished by the separation/elongation of the cap into an elongated, and eventually separated, cap) also appear to clearly occur in cycles 11-13. This is less obvious in the simple graph of cap area measurements, but changes in the cap dimensions marking elongation are apparent in the new panels in Figure Supplement1-2E-G. In terms of changes in phased behaviors in the shRNA backgrounds, it appears that each of the phases are generally present in each of the backgrounds (at least it does not appear that a phase has been deleted or that the timing of the cell cycle is deeply disrupted) except for in the background where Arp2/3 function is disrupted. In the Arp2/3 background, the cell cycle is ~60 seconds shorter and there is an absence of phased behaviors – we have added a short description of this to the Discussion section on Arp2/3 function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, some results from this quantification are curious. For example, between time 0 and 60s in WT, cap intensity only increases moderately (Figure 1G), while cap area increases a lot (Figure 1D). This suggests that actin density should decrease a lot, which seems opposite to what is observed in Figure 1A.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we believe this goes to what reviewers asked in 1.3, the cap intensity we showed here is average intensity, meaning that the actin density only moderately (~30%) increase from 0-120s (Figure 1G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Statistical analysis:</p><p>In Figures 5 and S7 the number of caps analyzed seems fairly small (n=3 or 4 in some cases) for FRAP experiments. The authors should increase their sample size and show the degree of variability in the FRAP parameters that they measured using box plots and standard deviations (rather than standard error).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing it out. We have repeated our FRAP and increased our sample size. The control, ArpC4, and Dia shRNA data have been replaced with box and distribution plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also clarify what the variation observed for cells within a single embryo is vs. the variation for all embryos considered in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We only FRAP one cap in a given embryo. We have clarified this in the Methods section (“FRAP intensity measurements” section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should report the efficiency of silencing in the shRNA experiments. This would enable readers to evaluate if residual activity of these proteins is expected or not. When some shRNA as Carmil, Wasp or Wash have little impact on cap dynamics, could it be just a question of efficiency of silencing? In the absence of such measurements, we would be more careful with the conclusions of these experiments. In some other systems too, wasp or wave silencing has little effect on cortical dynamics, to compensate gex-3 can be depleted and is more efficient. Did the author consider this option?</p></disp-quote><p>Another good point. Single embryo Westerns are difficult to obtain consistent results, and antibodies do not exist for several of the silenced proteins, so we have used at least two independent shRNAs to show the specificity of the observed phenotypes – this has generally been the standard for work in the early fly embryo. Very similar effects are observed between independent shRNA lines (Figure Supplement 4-1), suggesting that knockdown efficacy in different lines with different shRNA target sequences produces representative and reproducible defects (Figure Supplement 4-1). There is also a good correlation between the localization and functional data – for example, little-to-no localization was observed for Carmil, Wasp, and Wash in the early embryo, which also fits with the lack of phenotypes observed after disruption of these genes. Valium20 and Valium22 shRNA constructs have worked efficiently in the embryo in our lab, but it remains a possibility that residual activity could remain that obscures a phenotype. We have added a short discussion of this possibility to the Discussion section (Lines 402-405).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Based on the hollowed appearance of actin caps in Arp2/3 shRNA embryos, the authors propose that Arp2/3 may promote central actin assembly that then flows outwards.

The authors should conduct the same experiment upon Cortactin shRNA or Scar shRNA treatment, which seem to impede actin flow outwards (Figure 3H-I).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we thought this was a good idea and tried similar experiments prior to our first submission. We also tried this again after receiving the reviewer comments – we were disappointed by our current confocal microscope systems ability to specifically FRAP small subregions of actin caps – this could be either because of system limitations or because of optical imaging limitations with the vitelline membrane and intervening perivitelline space causing too much light scattering. It may be the latter as this inability to FRAP small regions was consistent across two different photobleaching systems (a new Olympus Fluoview FV3000 laser scanning confocal system and a spinning disc-mounted Andor Micropoint system). We did get preliminary data consistent with the our and the reviewers’ expectations, but thought the diffuseness of the photobleached regions was not up to our publication standards.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Below is the data of region specific FRAP – as discussed above, we have not been satisfied with the quality of the FRAP, so prefer not to include it in the main manuscript. Peripheral regions show a slower recovery than central regions, and compromising Cortactin function disrupts the regional differences of the resulting smaller actin caps (n&gt;10 for all).</p></disp-quote><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63046-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We strengthened our justification in lines 283-287. MoeABD:GFP/MoeABD:mCherry or Utrophin:GFP have generally been the standard for visualizing actin dynamics in the early embryo. Both rely on the recognition of filamentous actin, but appear to have the most moderate effects on actin networks in terms of the available labeling methods. This is why we have compared our imaged dynamics with those of directly labeled actin as well as phalloidin stained actin caps (newly combined Figure Supplement 1-1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note that in figure S2 one could show the recovery curves in addition to the extracted value to justify the similarity of the process.

We also adapted a method of FRAP measurements similar to that outlined by Kobb et al. (as suggested) with correction to adjacent, nonbleached caps. This should better adjust for changes in z-levels and/or timing. However, this did not significantly change our reported results. The faster recovery times we observe than has been seen in Cao et al. is interesting, and could be because of the different cycle times (cycle 11 vs cycle 12), methodology, or instrumentation – we comment briefly on this in the Discussion (Lines 438-441). We also added the requested additional FRAP images (Figure Supplement 5-1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

On the one hand, we actually see a faster recovery of the intact actin nucleating network when the other network is disrupted, which could argue against synergistic effects. Contrary to this, it is also true that decreases in overall actin levels could be due to possible indirect decreases in the surviving networks activity. This was interesting, so to look at it more closely, we examined Diaphanous cap intensities after Arp2/3 disruption, and Arp2/3 cap levels after Diaphanous disruption (new Figure Supplement 2-1B-E). Interestingly, neither Arp2/3 levels after Diaphanous disruption, nor Diaphanous levels after Arp2/3 disruption were significantly decreased. We have revised the Results and Discussion sections to mention these findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
