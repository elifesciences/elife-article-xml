difficult to study human pathogen. Most basics of the hepadnaviral life-cycle were unraveled using duck HBV (DHBV) as a model although DHBV has a capsid protein (CP) comprising ~260 rather than ~180 amino acids. Here we present high-resolution structures of several DHBV capsid-like particles (CLPs) determined by electron cryo-microscopy. As for HBV, DHBV CLPs consist of a dimeric α-helical frame-work with protruding spikes at the dimer interface. A fundamental new feature is a ~ 45 amino acid proline-rich extension in each monomer replacing the tip of the spikes in HBV CP. In vitro, folding of the extension takes months, implying a catalyzed process in vivo. DHBc variants lacking a folding-proficient extension produced regular CLPs in bacteria but failed to form stable nucleocapsids in hepatoma cells. We propose that the extension domain acts as a conformational switch with differential response options during viral infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>avihepadnavirus</kwd><kwd>duck hepatitis b virus core protein</kwd><kwd>elctron cryo microscopy</kwd><kwd>extension domain</kwd><kwd>disordered protein domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BO1150/17-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Böttcher</surname><given-names>Bettina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 92/903-1FUGG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Böttcher</surname><given-names>Bettina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Na154/9-4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nassal</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Duck Hepatitis B core protein forms capsids with a slowly folding extension domain which folding competence is important for viral replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepadnaviruses (<italic>hepa</italic>totropic <italic>DNA</italic> viruses) are a family of small enveloped retrotranscribing DNA viruses. In humans, chronic infections with HBV cause ~800,000 deaths per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Report, 2017</xref>). Current therapies can control but rarely cure infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fanning et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martinez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nassal, 2015</xref>). Most fundamental aspects of the hepadnaviral lifecycle such as replication of the tiny ~3 kb DNA via reverse transcription of a pregenomic (pg) RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Summers and Mason, 1982</xref>), or the use of a covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tuttleman et al., 1986</xref>) as episomal persistence reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nassal, 2015</xref>), were uncovered using more tractable model viruses, mostly duck HBV (DHBV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schultz et al., 2004</xref>), prototype of the genus <italic>avihepadnaviridae</italic>.</p><p>Despite basal similarities in genome size, genetic organization and replication strategy the avian viruses exhibit characteristic differences to human and the other mammalian HBVs (genus <italic>orthohepadnaviridae</italic>). They lack an X protein, a regulator of cccDNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Livingston et al., 2017</xref>), and a medium sized (M) envelope or surface protein besides the small (S) and large (L) forms; in addition, the avian virus surface proteins are smaller, with only three predicted transmembrane helices versus four in the orthohepadnaviruses. Particularly striking is the much larger size (~260 amino acids) of their single capsid or core proteins (CPs) which in mammalian HBVs comprise only ~180 aa. Recently discovered HBV-like viruses in distant hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lauber et al., 2017</xref>) maintain this division. Most employ the small type CP but amphibian and reptilian viruses, e.g. Tibetan frog HBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dill et al., 2016</xref>) and lizard HBVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lauber et al., 2017</xref>), encode the large type CP. As the small CPs can obviously perform all essential CP functions (see below, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Venkatakrishnan and Zlotnick, 2016</xref>) the biology behind the large type CPs is enigmatic. A key step would be knowledge of their structure but, ironically, here DHBV lags much behind HBV for which various structures are available for recombinant capsid-like particles (CLPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Böttcher and Nassal, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Böttcher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conway et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crowther et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wynne et al., 1999</xref>), serum-derived nucleocapsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roseman et al., 2005</xref>) and virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dryden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seitz et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>CPs are multifunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zlotnick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diab et al., 2018</xref>), making the HBV CP (HBc) a prime novel antiviral target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lahlali et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schlicksup et al., 2018</xref>). Most obvious is their role as the building block of the icosahedral viral capsid. Production of progeny virions during infection involves transcription from nuclear cccDNA, translation in the cytoplasm of CP, polymerase and the other viral proteins, CP phosphorylation-regulated encapsidation of a complex of pgRNA and polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heger-Stevic et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>), and reverse transcription of pgRNA into relaxed circular (RC plus some double-stranded linear (dsL)) DNA. Such nucleocapsids can interact with the surface proteins to be secreted as enveloped virions. Alternatively, they may interact with nuclear import receptors to be redirected into the nuclear pore where they disintegrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallucci and Kann, 2017</xref>), releasing the rcDNA for conversion into cccDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nassal, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiner and Nassal, 2017</xref>).</p><p>How hepadnaviral CPs integrate the different interaction cues to follow one path or the other is poorly understood but must somehow relate to their three-dimensional (3D) structure. Typical small type CPs comprise an N-terminal ~140 aa assembly domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Birnbaum and Nassal, 1990</xref>) and an arginine-rich ~34 aa C-terminal domain (CTD) whose nucleic acid binding capacity is modulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heger-Stevic et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Both domains are connected by an ~10 aa linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watts et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The assembly domains feature five α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). α3 and α4 form an antiparallel hairpin providing the interface for dimerization with a second subunit. The resulting four-helix bundles protrude as spikes from the capsid surface. The helix α5 plus the downstream sequence (the ‘hand region’) provide the inter-dimer contacts, mostly arranged in T = 4 icosahedral symmetry which comprises 120 Cp dimers (the minor T = 3 class encompasses 90 dimers). The asymmetric unit is composed of two dimers in spatially different surroundings with four quasi-equivalent monomer conformations, A to D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The first residues of the CTD are capsid-internal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zlotnick et al., 1997</xref>) but residues past position 150 usually lack sufficient order for visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Böttcher and Nassal, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Early cryo-EM reconstructions of DHBc suggested a T = 4 arrangement similar to HBc CLPs but with laterally widened spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kenney et al., 1995</xref>). Extensive mutagenesis led to a DHBc model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vorreiter et al., 2007</xref>) predicting an HBc-like body of dimeric assembly domains comprising the N-terminal ~180 aa, an ~80 aa CTD with a more profound morphogenetic impact than in HBc, and a much extended ~45 aa proline-rich loop (residues 78–122) connecting helices α3 and α4. However, all attempts to directly verify this model by cryo-EM reconstructions fell short of sufficient resolution. The broader distribution of DHBc vs. HBc CLPs during sedimentation in sucrose gradients and native agarose gel electrophoresis (NAGE) suggested that morphological heterogeneity obscured the data. Some DHBc variants such as R124E produced more homogeneous CLPs (termed class2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassal et al., 2007</xref>) but did not yield better resolved cryo-EM reconstructions. In particular, the predicted loop at the spike tips remained invisible, in line with complete disorder.</p><p>Here we discovered that over several months of storage this loop, now termed extension domain, adopted a defined fold. This enabled us to determine the structure of whole DHBc CLPs at a resolution of 3.7 Å enabling de novo model building. Functional studies revealed that the extension domain´s ability to fold is dispensable for recombinant CLP assembly but correlates with capsid stability in hepatoma cells. We propose that plasticity of the extension domain represents a large-type CP-specific evolutionary adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>DHBV CP (DHBc) expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> self-assembles into CLPs which package bacterial RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kenney et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassal et al., 2007</xref>). Here, improved expression was achieved using vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heger-Stevic et al., 2018b</xref>) with an <italic>E. coli</italic> optimized DHBc gene encoding the DHBV16 CP sequence (Uniprot accession: P0C6J7.1). CLPs for cryo-EM analysis were enriched by two sequential ammonium sulfphate precipitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Birnbaum and Nassal, 1990</xref>) followed by sucrose gradient sedimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heger-Stevic et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>After two weeks of storage at 4°C we exchanged the sucrose-containing buffer against a cryo-EM compatible buffer with low solute concentration and vitrified the samples. Micrographs showed distinct particles of spherical shape, aggregates of such particles and some proteo-liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). 2D-class averages revealed particles with protruding spikes but also particles that lacked distinct spikes or were deformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that only a fraction of particles had assembled into regular icosahedral capsids. The resulting 3D-map had a nominal resolution of 6.1 Å and showed capsids with an arrangement of spikes and holes resembling that of HBc-capsids with T = 4 triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crowther et al., 1994</xref>) but with 15 Å broader and 5 Å longer spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The characteristic broad spikes of the DHBc CLPs were only visible at lower density thresholds but disappeared at higher density thresholds, suggesting a markedly higher structural variability in the extensions than in the core of the spikes.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we analysed the individual asymmetric units by 3D-classification. The class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) showed 42% of asymmetric units without proper spikes and lower average density consistent with dimers either being misfolded, largely displaced or completely missing. Another third of the asymmetric units grouped into classes in which both spikes were broad, suggesting that all extension domains in the asymmetric unit were folded. The remaining 25% of asymmetric units grouped into classes with one narrow and one broad spike, consistent with folded extension domains in the broad spikes and still unfolded or flexible ones in the narrow spikes. Furthermore, the radial position of the spikes in the CLPs varied by up to 7 Å, indicating local deformations of the capsid shell.</p><p>The analysis of the individual asymmetric units required accurate determination of the orientations of an ordered asymmetric unit of only some 80 kDa, which is at the lower size limit that can be confidently analysed. We speculated that our analysis might have been limited by the imaging conditions (integrating mode, exposure &lt;40 e/Å²), which were chosen for entire capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2019</xref>) rather than for the individual asymmetric units. Therefore, we acquired another data set at a higher dose in counting mode (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For this we prepared new grids of the CLPs that had now been stored in sucrose at 4°C for 10 months.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of image reconstruction and model building.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Sample prepared @</th><th valign="top">DHBc <break/>2 weeks</th><th valign="top">DHBc <break/>10 months</th><th valign="top">DHBcR124EΔ <break/>2 weeks</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">DHBc+FkpA <break/>2 weeks</th><th valign="top">DHBcR124E <break/>3 months</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Magnification</td><td colspan="6" valign="top">75,000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Acquisition mode</td><td>integrating mode</td><td>counting mode</td><td>Counting mode</td><td>Counting mode</td><td>Integrating mode</td><td>Integrating mode</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Total exposure</td><td>39 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup></td><td>77 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup></td><td>60 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup></td><td>60 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup></td><td>40 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup></td><td>40 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Exposure time</td><td>3.5 s</td><td>75 s</td><td>54 s</td><td>56.6 s</td><td>2.4 s</td><td>2.3 s</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pixel size</td><td colspan="6">1.0635 Å</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Beam diameter</td><td colspan="6">1 µm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C2 aperture</td><td colspan="6">70 µm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Objective aperture</td><td colspan="6">100 µm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Spot size</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Number of movies per hole</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Number of fractions</td><td>20</td><td>47</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Number of movies</td><td>3541</td><td>2473</td><td>1496</td><td>2425</td><td>4339</td><td>1226</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Defocus range</td><td>700–2200 nm</td><td>500–2100 nm</td><td>500–1300 nm</td><td>500–1600 nm</td><td>600–1900 nm</td><td>500–2000 nm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Acquisition software</td><td colspan="6">EPU</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Frame alignment and dose weighting</td><td colspan="6">MotionCor2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CTF estimation</td><td colspan="6">CtfFind4.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Processing software</td><td colspan="6">RELION3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Number of selected capsids</td><td>91,445</td><td>89,241</td><td>74,760</td><td>129,522</td><td>161,596</td><td>35,820</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Capsids in final map</td><td>41,117</td><td>20,251</td><td>44,498</td><td>24,854</td><td>44,374</td><td>23,384</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Resolution capsid</td><td>6.1 Å</td><td>3.7 Å</td><td>3.0 Å</td><td>4.2 Å</td><td>4.0 Å</td><td>6.0 Å</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">EMDB</td><td/><td>10800</td><td>10803</td><td/><td>10801</td><td>10802</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">extracted asymmetric units</td><td>2,428,920</td><td>1,215,060</td><td>2,669,880</td><td>1,210,560</td><td>2,662,440</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Extracted units in final map</td><td>561,731</td><td>919,612</td><td>516,257</td><td>n/a</td><td>383,200</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Resolution asymmetric unit</td><td>5.4 Å</td><td>3.0 Å</td><td>3.0 Å</td><td>n/a</td><td>3.9 Å</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Model building, refinement and validation</td><td>-</td><td>Coot, Phenix, Chimera</td><td>Coot, Phenix, Chimera</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Much to our surprise 2D-class averages showed crisper projection averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the 3D-maps of the CLPs were better resolved than before.

Class1 and class 3 (38% of all asymmetric units, both 7.2 Å resolution) represented mainly holes or grossly displaced subunits. Class two was poorly resolved (15% of all asymmetric units, 6.2 Å resolution). Classes 4 and 5 (45% of all asymmetric units, 4.9 Å and 5.7 Å resolution respectively) were better resolved but had a relative radial displacement of 3 Å, which is larger than for the 10 months old DHBc CLPs (2 Å displacement) but significantly smaller than the 7 Å displacement of the 2 weeks old CLPs without co-expressed FkpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Classes 4 and 5 both showed broad spikes indicating folding of the extension domain.

All four subunits of the asymmetric unit had the same overall fold with adaptations to the different spatial surroundings close to the N-termini and in the C-terminal hand regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). The core of the spikes was formed by four helices, with each DHBc monomer contributing an ascending helix (α3; residues 44–78, 35 aa) and a descending helix (α4; residues 120–157, 38 aa). The ascending helix α3 was kinked in the center between F60 and W61 and tilted away from the dimer axis in the upper part of the spike. The helices were considerably longer than in HBc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), where α3 is straight (25 aa) and α4 is kinked (31 aa). The four helices of the spike of HBc and DHBc had a very similar packing below the kink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) but diverged above the kink with a different twist of the helices around each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). At the tips of the spikes the positions of the helices were dramatically different, basically swapping the positions of DHBc α3 with HBc α4 in the same subunit and of DHBc α4 with HBc α3 between different subunits of the dimer. Moreover, DHBc helices α3 and α4 were connected through a 41 aa long extension domain (residues 79–119, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) whereas in HBc this connection is just a short loop of 3–4 aa. The extension with two short helical segments (αe1: 92–99; αe2: 103–117), was positioned at the side of the spike close to α4 of the same subunit and in contact with α3 of the other subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

Nonetheless, the absence of folded extension domains from many spikes in freshly prepared CLPs implied that its contribution is not strictly required for capsid formation and stability, as directly addressed below.</p><p>In HBc which lacks an extension domain a disulphide-bridge between Cys61 on opposite monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) can add to dimer stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nassal et al., 1992</xref>). DHBc lacks a homologous Cys residue; instead at a similar position in the spike Phe60 made a π-stacking interaction with Phe60 on the other monomer, and so did His52 with His52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Another difference between HBc and DHBc was the position of the N-termini. In HBc the N-terminus is located at the dimer interface at the base of the spikes and contributes to the intra-dimer contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wynne et al., 1999</xref>). In DHBc the seven N-terminal residues pointed towards the lumen of the capsid, without contributing to the intra-dimer contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Interestingly, the two N-termini within one dimer had different orientations, with those of chains B and C directed towards the base of the spike and those of chains A and D pointing away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The pockets at the base of the spikes close to the N-termini of chains A and D contained density that was not accounted for by the so far described model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref> magenta). This density resembled a short peptide and was modelled with the 13 very C-terminal residues 250–262. In the other two pockets similar albeit weaker density accounted for the 6 C-terminal residues (257-262). As the connecting residues to the assembly domain were unresolved the C-termini could not be assigned to a specific subunit. Overall, the C-termini appear to take a similar structural role in DHBc as the N-termini do in HBc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>While the intra-dimer contacts differed significantly between HBc and DHBc, the inter-dimer packing in the C-terminal hand-region was largely conserved. The last resolved residues in our model agreed well with the biochemically derived C-terminal border of the DHBc assembly domain around position 187 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassal et al., 2007</xref>). At the given resolution, the fold of the hand-region was similar to that of HBc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) as it maintained the length of the α5 helix and the distance to the adjacent extended stretch. Overall, the RMSD between HBc and DHBc of the hand-region and the part of the spike below the kink and the fulcrum is 1.9 Å, further highlighting the preservation of the whole shell-region of the capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with the preserved inter-dimer contacts, the radius of inner and outer surface of the protein shell and the distance to a diffuse density shell in the interior of the capsid that is attributed to RNA and unresolved parts of the CTDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) was the same in DHBc and HBc.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Slow folding of the DHBc extension domain likely correlates with X-Pro bond isomerization</title><p>The unusually high proline content in the extension domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>) suggested a cis-trans isomerization of one or more of the respective X-Pro bonds as a potentially rate-limiting step in folding of the extension domain, as it is in various proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunyak and Gestwicki, 2016</xref>).

After 2 weeks of storage in sucrose at 4°C the respective CLPs were prepared for cryo-EM. These CLPs displayed similar overall heterogeneity as CLPs without co-expressed FkpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

As the mutation reverses the sidechain charge from positive (R124) to negative (E124) an electrostatic interaction with a nearby acidic sidechain appeared plausible. Based on our structural model, R124E resides shortly after the start (P120) of helix α4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The closest residues in space are E109 and E110 in the extension domain.

Furthermore, the double mutant E110R_R124E maintained the class 2 R124E phenotype but combining the two class2 mutations R124E and E109R in one protein (E109R_R124E) switched the profile to class1. No such switch was seen when R124E was combined with an unrelated class2 mutant, i95, which bears a five aa insertion at position 95. Together these data indicate that a salt-bridge between R124 in the spike core helix α4 and E109 in the extension domain helix eα2 is crucial for the WT-DHBc CLP phenotype. They also suggested that the more distinct behavior of the class2 CLPs relates to an inability of the mutated extension domains to properly fold.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The DHBc extension domain is dispensable for recombinant CLP assembly</title><p>The low folding propensity of the extension domain questioned a direct role in capsid assembly.

The last resolvable contiguous chain residues around position 190 match the biochemically derived end of the assembly domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassal et al., 2007</xref>). Without the extension domain this length corresponds well with the ≥140 aa of the HBc assembly domain, and so does its basic fold comprising five α-helices. As in HBc, α3 and α4 constitute major parts of the intra-dimer interface with another large contribution from the folded extension domain. α3 and α4 are slightly longer in DHBc than in HBc and they differ in tilt and twist. Therefore the structure of the CPs diverges in the protruding spikes while the basic architecture is similar in the actual capsid shell including the inter-dimer contacts, mainly provided by helix α5 and the downstream sequence that folds back on it. Notably, this helical framework forms independently of the extension domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>In HBc the N-terminal residues 1–5 embrace the base of the half-spike formed by the partner subunit in the dimer and contribute to the intra-dimer interface. In DHBc the respective positions are occupied by the C-terminal residues 250–262 while the N-termini point towards the particle lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This places the C-termini at a strategic position to adopt a capsid-external disposition, e.g. for exposure of nuclear localization signals, and antibodies against the C-terminal residues of DHBc can precipitate entire capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schlicht et al., 1989</xref>). However, our analysis of the asymmetric units in DHBc capsids did not show evidence of individual C-termini protruding further to the outside. A similar, albeit less exposed position of the C-termini underneath the base of the spikes has been observed for HBc, yet also without direct structural evidence of further externalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Böttcher and Nassal, 2018</xref>). A structural role of the DHBc C-terminus is further supported by the variety of particle morphologies that result from C-terminal truncations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassal et al., 2007</xref>). Whether the DHBc sequence from positions 190 to 250 has a specific morphogenic role remains to be determined; plausibly it contributes together with packaged RNA to the ring-like capsid-internal density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A temporarily mobile spike extension - defining feature of hepadnaviruses employing large type CPs?</title><p>The most distinctive feature in DHBc vs. HBc are the large extensions at the tips of the spikes that comprise residues 79–119, in line with the biochemical prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassal et al., 2007</xref>) and directly supported by the structure of the extension-less Δ78–122_R124E CLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The extension sequence is unusually rich in P (8 of 45 aa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and E residues (6 of 45 aa), the two most disorder-promoting amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Theillet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Uversky, 2013</xref>). Notably, P79/P80 and P117/P120 at the borders of the extension domain are ideally located to insulate it from the spike-forming four-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These features are preserved in the CPs of diverse other avian hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Non-avian hosts with large-type CPs such as the 266 aa sequence of the Tibetan frog HBV CP diverge at many positions. Yet, the sequence aligning to the DHBc extension domain also has a very high proline content (10 of 48 aa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating evolutionary conservation of this feature over millions of years. We therefore expect that the fundamental structural aspects of the DHBV capsid revealed in this study are prototypical for all hepadnaviruses employing the large-type CPs. The plasticity of the extension domain is also reflected by local resolution analysis and high local B-factors in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Also the spike tips in HBc have high local B-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Böttcher and Nassal, 2018</xref>), perhaps in both cases facilitating induced-fit interactions, e.g. with the envelope proteins, which for DHBV might be more akin to a folding-by-binding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weng and Wang, 2020</xref>). Notably, the structure of one HBc spike tip fits well into the DHBc extension domain emerging from the core-spike which provides two such sites per spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, large-type CPs could have evolved two surface protein binding sites per spike in the extension domains, compared to only one in small-type CPs. This coincides with a generally smaller membrane part of the surface proteins in <italic>hepadnaviridae</italic> with large-type CPs allowing for more surface proteins per area of envelope.</p><p>Despite its disposition for disorder, the extension domain in wt DHBc can adopt a stably folded state, albeit very slowly in vitro. The time-scale in live cells is unknown but in sum our data favour that assembly of the capsid shell precedes folding of the extension domains. Assembly can occur in the complete absence of the extension domain, and CLPs with permanently disordered extension domains, such as R124E, present with more homogeneous morphologies than those from wt DHBc. Hence the large contact area to the intra-dimer interface that forms upon folding of the extension domain may even disfavour regular icosahedral assembly; conversely, the requirement for a folding helper would increase the time-span for undisturbed assembly. Thereafter, extension domain folding provides extra stability to the assembled structure. As a resolution of around 7 Å is sufficient to distinguish folded from unfolded extension domains, defining their states in various stages of the viral life-cycle, including in enveloped virions, appears worthwhile and feasible.</p><p>Based on the high density of prolines in the extension domain we expect the folding helper to be a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, as is supported by the higher frequency of DHBc CLPs with folded extension domains upon coexpression of <italic>E. coli</italic> FkpA. From such activity of a bacterial enzyme it appears unlikely that a specialized isomerase is required in DHBV host cells.</p><p>In contrast to wt DHBc CLPs, the extension domains in R124E CLPs remained invisible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting the homogeneous appearance of class2 CLPs relates to mostly disordered extension domains, as supported by their similarity to the extension-less variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, despite their efficient expression in bacteria DHBc class2 variants were barely if at all detectable in hepatoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); also Δ78–122_R124E gave only faint signals in the NAGE immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). As the same eukaryotic vectors led to efficient production of wt DHBc and other class1 particles, the class2 mutations probably interfered with some aspect of protein stability. In fact, decreased CP stability and lack of capsid formation have independently been reported for a fortuitously identified variant lacking H107 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2006</xref>) which we now know to reside within the center of helix αe2. Deletion of H107 thus puts the remaining residues of the helix out of register and, specifically, ablates a hydrophobic interaction of H107 with I99 in αe1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) which contributes to the stability of the folded extension domain.Likely, long-term unfolded extension domains enhance accessibility of instability determinants, e.g. target sites for proteases, or for ubiquitylation which initiates proteasomal degradation. This view is strongly supported by the multiple proteolysis products seen with DHBc _R124E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), and the simultaneous absence of stable capsids and/or nucleocapsids from this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>;.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). In addition, without the extra contribution of the folded extension domains to the intra-dimer interface the capsid shell may become too labile to withstand the replication process, in particular double-stranded DNA formation. While these are testable hypotheses the lack of stable capsids from these variants precluded statements on a specific role of the extension domain in DHBV replication. Most striking, however, is the complete rescue of wt DHBV-like replication by combining two per se detrimental mutations in the double mutant E109R_R124E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), fully supporting our structural model as well as the importance of a salt-bridge between these two specific positions for the ordered state of the extension domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Conversely, protonation of the glutamic acid carboxylate, realistically achievable at pH values of certain cell compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>), would be sufficient to break this bridge and thus create a reversible pH-responsive conformational switch for capsid stabilization and capsid disintegration.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model correlating disorder vs. order of the DHBc extension domain with phenotypes in bacteria and hepatoma cells.</title><p>Opposite charges in WT-DHBc and the double mutant E109R_R124E facilitate folding of the extension domain, in cells probably accelerated by chaperones, proline cis-trans-isomerases, and/or perhaps the envelope proteins. The shape of the folded extension domain is a schematic approximation to the structural data. Protonation of the E109 carboxylate at low pH ablates the salt-bridge, possibly creating a trigger for a conformational switch. In the absence of opposite charges at positions 109 and 124 (R124E, E109R) repulsion or lack of attraction (R124Q, not shown) hamper folding of the extension domain. This may expose eukaryotic instability determinants and cause the apparent capsid instability in hepatoma cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57277-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>duck</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DHBV16</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">K01834</td><td valign="top">duck hepatitis B virus</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21Star (DE3) CodonPlus RIL</td><td valign="top">Thermofisher and <break/>Agilent</td><td valign="top">C601003 <break/>#230240</td><td valign="top">BL21Star (DE3) <break/>transformed with RIL CodonPlus plasmid</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">LMH</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-2117</td><td valign="top">chicken hepatocellular carcinoma</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pCD16</td><td valign="top">Nassal lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dallmeier et al., 2008</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">CMV promoter controlled DHBV16 vector</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pAAV-DHBc</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">pAAV-MCS Addgene #46954</td><td valign="top">authentic DHBV16 <break/>C gene cloned in pAAV-MCS2 for eukaryotic expression (see Plasmid Constructs)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pAAV-DHBc_Opt</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">pAAV-MCS Addgene #46954</td><td valign="top"><italic>E. coli</italic> optimized DHBV C gene cloned in pAAV-MCS2 for <break/>(see Plasmid Constructs) eukaryotic expression</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pRSF-DHBc_Opt</td><td valign="top">This paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heger-Stevic et al., 2018a</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>E. coli</italic> optimized DHBV C gene cloned in pRSF under T7 promoter for bacterial expression; <break/>(see Plasmid Constructs)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-DHBc <break/>(rabbit poylclonal)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vorreiter et al., 2007</xref></td><td valign="top">serum 12/99</td><td valign="top">raised against recombinant full-length DHBc <break/>WB (1:10,000) <break/>For immuno precipitation (IP): 50 µl Antiserum 12/99 are loaded onto 500 µl Protein A Sepharose beads (Gelbett); 30 µl loaded beads are used per IP</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat IgG anti-Rabbit IgG (Fc)-HRPO</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immuno Research</td><td valign="top">Dianova Cat. # 111-035-046</td><td valign="top">WB (1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">TransIT-LT1</td><td valign="top">Mirus Bio</td><td valign="top">VWR Cat. # 10767–118</td><td valign="top">IF(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Relion 3</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MotionCor2</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zheng et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Ctffind4</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Chimera</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2012</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>Bacterial DHBc vectors were based on either pET28a2-DHBc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassal et al., 2007</xref>) carrying the DHBc nucleotide sequence from DHBV16 (GenBank: K01834.1), or on pRSF_T7-DHBcOpt, a derivative of vector pRSF_T7-HBcOpt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heger-Stevic et al., 2018b</xref>) in which the HBc ORF was replaced by a synthetic, <italic>E. coli</italic> codon usage optimized DHBc sequence (DHBcOpt).

The defocus of the dose-weighted and motion corrected movie averages was determined with ctffind4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Particles were selected by the Laplacian-of-Gaussian algorithm with a mask diameter of 320 Å (data of samples prepared after 2 weeks) or with cryolo using the general network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wagner et al., 2019</xref>) for all other samples followed by autopicking with RELION using 6–9 selected class averages derived from 2D-classification of the picked data.

Particles representing distinct capsids of the same class based on the appearance of the class averages were retained. The EM-map of F97L-capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Böttcher and Nassal, 2018</xref>) was used as starting reference (initial low-pass filter 1/25 Å<sup>−1</sup>) for auto-refinement of the 1<sup>st</sup> data set (2 weeks). For the other data set (10 months) the current best map of DHBc was used as starting reference. During iterative auto-refinement icosahedral-symmetry was applied. Afterwards, particles were classified into 3 classes by 3D-classification without further refinement of orientations. The most populated 3D-class was further refined with auto-refine using only local orientation searches. This was followed by refinement of the contrast transfer function (ctf). For this, particles were re-extracted with a larger box of 800 × 800 Px² without phase-flipping followed by ctf-refinement per particle and beam-tilt refinement for the whole data set. For beam-tilt refinement, we defined beam-tilt classes for each day of acquisition to compensate for a possible drift of beam-tilt over time. For DHBcR124EΔ and DHBc+FkpA we also defined separate beam-tilt classes for each acquisition position in a hole. Ctf-refinement was followed by another round of local auto-refinement. Ctf-refinement only improved resolution of the maps of DHBc after 10 months and DHBcR124EΔ for the other maps no improvement was observed. In these cases we continued with the data without ctf-refinement.</p><p>The resolution was determined during the post-processing step for masked maps after gold-standard refinement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Image processing of the asymmetric unit</title><p>Starting with the results of the final refinement of the capsids, particles were symmetry expanded (‘relion_particle_symmetry_expand’) followed by re-extraction (128 × 128 Px²), phase-flipping and re-centering to the center of one asymmetric unit.

A striking difference between HBV and DHBV is that the DHBV capsid protein is substantially larger than that of HBV (ca. 260 vs. ca. 180 amino acid residues). The three significant accomplishments of this paper are (i) the observation that DHBV capsid protein is partially unfolded and yet still assembles, (ii) the protein will slowly refold and that can be catalyzed by the presence of proline isomerase, and (iii) the actual structure of the protruding domain.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some points to be addressed or discussed to further strengthen the manuscript, for example:</p><p>It is well known that HBc lacks the extension domain and yet is fully functional in human and avian cells. Conversely, DHBc with the extra domain is also functional in both human and avian cells. If there were indeed a host-cell specific determinant for the folding/functions of the extension domain in DHBV, as implied by the authors, it would be interesting to test the various extension domain deletion/substitution mutants in human cells, in addition to avian cells. As it stands now, little could be learnt regarding the exact roles of this extension in viral replication from the phenotype analysis of these mutants in avian cells, due to the apparently severe deleterious effect on capsid assembly.</p><p>Figure 5.

A striking difference between HBV and DHBV is that the DHBV capsid protein is substantially larger than that of HBV (ca. 260 vs. ca. 180 amino acid residues). The authors report high-resolution structures of several DHBV capsid-like particles (CLPs) determined by electron cryo-microscopy. These structures show that DHBV CLPs are generally similar to those of HBV, consisting of a dimeric α-helical backbone with protruding spikes at the dimer interface. The ca. 45 amino acid proline-rich extension unique to the DHBV capsid forms an extra domain near the spike as compared to HBV. The authors noticed that folding of the extension domain seemed to take months in vitro, which could accelerated by prolyl peptidyl isomerase, consistent with a catalyzed process in vivo. DHBc variants lacking a folding-proficient extension domain were competent to assemble capsids in bacteria but failed to form stable nucleocapsids in avian cells. The authors propose that the extension domain acts as a conformational switch with differential response options during viral infection.</p><p>This is an interesting study that has a strong rationale and generates important new information regarding the assembly and replication of HBV-like viruses (hepadnaviruses). The authors should consider the following points in revising the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper the authors show the structure of Duck Hepatitic B Virus Core Protein and variants. DHBc is a dimeric protein that assembles into T=4 capsids. While closely related to the human homolog, DHBc has a bulky insert at the dimer interface. The authors show:</p><p>1) The insert is disordered in freshly purified protein</p><p>2) Can slowly fold, over several months, to an ordered form</p><p>3) Co-expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> with a prolyl isomerase yields capsids that are somewhat better folded.</p><p>4) Compensating charged residue mutations support a stable insert. Non-compensated mutations do not. The resulting proteins with a misfolded insert do not support assembly of functional capsid.</p><p>5) Deletion of the disordered residues results DHBcR124E∆ which has a well-ordered assembly domain and shows how the helical dimer interface is preserved</p><p>The most striking feature of the results is the folded-unfolded transition of the insert as discussed by the authors. This insert is present in lizard and fish variants of HBV but not in mammalian variants. There is an evolutionary argument. The authors do not discuss whether the insert may also interact with receptors or other host-protein.</p><p>The authors include a peculiar discussion of a gap at the dimer interface which may be &quot;pocket factor&quot; binding site. Has a pocket factor ever been observed or is this a speculation? The authors should clarify if this discussion is entirely speculative.</p><p>The quality of the reconstructions is high. However many of the figures are too small and busy. The text is clear with a few exceptions. The structure of the insert will facilitate future experimentation and will raise interest in non-mammalian HBV viruses. The puzzle of the folded to unfolded transition is striking. Co-expression of DHBc with proline isomerase yields a marginally better reconstruction. In the model structures, are prolines in the cis conformation? Would any chaperone do? The conclusion that the delay in folding is due to proline isomerization is ambiguous.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57277.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some points to be addressed or discussed to further strengthen the manuscript, for example:</p><p>It is well known that HBc lacks the extension domain and yet is fully functional in human and avian cells.

Was the defect in subunit stability, assembly, or the stability of the assembled capsids?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the biological function of the extension domain in the large-type Cp remains an intriguing open question, and that investigating the impact of a different, e.g. human, cell environment is a potentially promising approach for new insight. An example is our demonstration, some time ago that the avian DHBV produces much more cccDNA in human hepatoma cells than human HBV. These phenotypic differences might indeed relate to the presence vs. absence of the extension domain in the respective Cps. Hence these and further host-factor focussed investigations are certainly worthwhile but in our view are beyond the scope of the current structure-focussed study.</p><p>However, we experimentally followed up the reviewer suggestion to address the fate of the unassembled subunits of the key mutants DHBcR124E and DHBcR124E∆ which failed to generate stable, replication-competent nucleo-capsids in chicken LMH cells – whereas DHBc WT as well as the charge-reversal mutant DHBc_E109R_R124E did. This was initially shown by DHBc capsid and DHBV DNA detection after NAGE (Figure 5). As direct SDS-PAGE immunoblotting of cell lysates did not yield conclusive data, we adopted an immunoprecipitation (IP) protocol to enrich potentially low amounts and/or partially degraded Cp subunits (about half of the lysate from a 10 cm dish as IP input). To cover as many DHBc epitopes as possible we used a polyclonal rabbit antiserum (12/99; Vorreiter et al., 2007) both for the IP and the subsequent immunoblot (IB) detection step. To minimize signals from the IP antibody chains on the blot we then used an Fc-part specific anti-rabbit secondary antibody-peroxidase conjugate in the final visualization step (which does not react strongly with the antibody light chains in the relevant 25 kDa range of the gel), producing the data now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2C. To corroborate the previously seen nucleocapsid phenotypes in the very same source samples as used for the IP/IB analysis we also subjected about 5% of each lysate to the NAGE-based DHBV capsid and capsid-associated DNA assays (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A, B).</p><p>As before the extension-less variant DHBcR124EΔ gave a very weak NAGE capsid signal (and no detectable capsid DNA signal) and this correlated with a weak signal in the SDS-PAGE IB, comparable to the E109R_R124E lo sample that had received one fifth the amount of DHBc plasmid DNA of the others. Hence the lower steady-state level of DHBcR124EΔ subunits (be it from less efficient production or more efficient degradation) might explain the lower levels of capsids detected in the NAGE IB; however, as previously surmised, the complete lack of detectable DHBV DNA supports a replicative defect of the mutant (pgRNA packaging, and/or reverse transcription). This assumption is now further strengthened by the detectability of viral DNA in the DHBcR124EΔ lo sample, which produced a similarly low capsid signal.</p><p>The most striking new data concern variant DHBc_R124E which, as before, gave no capsid and no capsid-DNA signal in the NAGE blots (although the <italic>E. coli</italic> derived faster-than-wt migrating R124E capsids were clearly detectable on the same blot). The IP/SDS-PAGE/IB protocol revealed the presence of substantial amounts of DHBc-related signals, however, besides little full-length protein the faster mobility of the other bands indicates heavy, variant-specific proteolytic processing, as similar products are completely absent from the DHBc WT and E109R_R124E samples.</p><p>One can still argue whether a lack of assembly competence of R124E in eukaryotic cells (vs. clear capsid formation in bacteria) causes higher sensitivity to proteolysis, or vice versa. However, although these new data do not answer all of the reviewer´s respective questions they directly support the previously only assumed defect in subunit stability when no salt bridge can form between positions 109 and 124 and when the extension domain does not fold.</p><p>We have added these new data as Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and added statements on the increased proteolysis susceptibility of DHBc_R124E in eukaryotic cells in the Results (subsection “Folding competence of the DHBc extension domain is critical for capsid stability in eukaryotic cells and hence viral replication”) and the Discussion section (subsection “A temporarily mobile spike extension – defining feature of hepadnaviruses employing large type CPs?”) of the main text. We also added additional information to the Materials and methods (subsection “Detection of viral capsids, capsid proteins, and capsid-borne DNA”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The question of which chaperone is responsible for capsid protein refolding in vivo is not answered in this paper. The effect of proline isomerase indicates that refolding can be catalyzed. However the limited effect of proline isomerase suggests that some other chaperone(s) may be involved. Also, the interaction of the capsid protein with the surface protein may also contribute to folding. The possibilities should be discussed with an open mind.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is true that we cannot say which chaperone is (or which chaperones are) acting in vivo. However, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer about the &quot;limited effect&quot; of the PPiase. While after two weeks and 2 months (not shown) without co-expression of a PPiase, most DHBc subunits in capsids have still unfolded extension domains this has changed to the majority of extension domains being folded within 2 weeks when co-expressed with a PPiases. A general PPiase is sufficient for the catalysis as it works with the <italic>E. coli</italic> FkpA PPiase. Typically, PPiases are among the most abundant proteins. Therefore, we would expect that the extension domain folds catalysed by a general PPiase of the host cells.</p><p>Another effect on the folding propensity of the extension domain is the formation of salt bridges (R124-E109) and hydrophobic interactions (H109-I99). These interactions are unlikely to require additional chaperones for formation and might happen instantaneously after the prolines are in the correct isomerization state. More importantly the significance of these stabilizing interactions can be interrogated by mutations: Mutants with a destabilized extension domain (DHBc R124E) behave very similar in cell culture to mutants with an entirely missing extension domain (DHBc R124E∆) as they do not form stable capsids that support replication. Considering that the folded extension domain almost doubles the intra-dimer interface it is conceivable that <italic>both</italic> the mutant capsids are less stable. In line with a reduced stability of capsids harbouring CPs with disordered extension domains, we observed that DHBcR124E∆ and DHBcR124E CLPs burst in thin, vitrified buffer whereas DHBc CLPs remains stable. Moreover, the new cell culture data (see above) illustrate a clearly enhanced proteolysis susceptibility of the R124E variant in cell culture.</p><p>Thus proline isomerization probably acts by delaying the folding of the extension domain, whereas interactions within the extension domain are likely to fine-tune capsid stability during the viral life cycle. We have broadened the Discussion along these lines (subsection “A temporarily mobile spike extension – defining feature of hepadnaviruses employing large type CPs?”)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The evolutionary connections from avian to other HBVs is important to understanding virus evolution. The authors should also relate the DHBV structure to other insert containing sequences instead of just the limited sequence alignment of Figure 1—figure supplement 1D.</p></disp-quote><p>While avian large-type CPs have a well preserved extension domain, the sequence conservation of the extension domain to large-type CPs in other species is less well preserved. However, a large number of prolines in the extension domains of other host species is maintained. This is what we wanted to show with the alignment. Detailed, sequence based discussions of evolutionary aspects have been made by Lauber et al., 2017, and Dill et al., 2016, which is given in the Introduction.</p><p>Based on the weak sequence conservation we would not necessarily expect that amphibian or lizard extension domains have a very similar structure – although structural data in Lauber et al., 2017, suggest that small-type CPs of nackedna viruses adopt an HBV CP-like fold despite highly divergent primary sequence. We have modelled the structure of Tibetan Frog CPs based on our DHBc structure. This suggests indeed a similar fold of the extension domain with maintenance of αe2 but not of αe1 and the positioning of the prolines at similar strategic positions as in avian viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). However, a large none-helical insert of some 20 residues with 2 prolines in α3 at the base of the core-spike raises doubts about details of the model. Thus a proper structure should be more revealing as to which extent salt bridges, charge distribution and hydrophobic interactions are maintained in the extension domains of other large-type CPs. Considering the low conservation and the lack of structure of other large-type CPs, we have chosen not to include a structure-based discussion on evolution of the large-type CPs.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Model of the large-type CP of Tibetan frog.</title><p>The model was generated with Modeller (Webb and Sali Current Protocols in Bioinformatics 54, John Wiley and Sons, Inc, 5.6.1-5.6.37, 2016.), using our DHBc structure as template.

We think that the large type CPs have evolved two potential surface protein binding sites per spike compared to only one in small type CPs. Support for this idea comes from the observation that the tip of the small-type HBc CPs matches in its overall fold and arrangement of loops the upper part of one extension domain. We have added the information on the size of the surface proteins in the Introduction (second paragraph) and have discussed the aspect of two potential binding sites per spike in the Discussion (subsection “A temporarily mobile spike extension – defining feature of hepadnaviruses employing large type CPs?”). We also added a figure to illustrate the point (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
