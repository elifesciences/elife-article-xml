Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) play a critical role in the control of growth, development, and adaptation to environmental fluctuations of most multicellular eukaryotes. The catalytic activity of PRC2 is counteracted by Jumonji-type (JMJ) histone demethylases, which shapes the genomic distribution of H3K27me3. Here, we show that two JMJ histone demethylases in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, EARLY FLOWERING 6 (ELF6) and RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), play distinct roles in H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 homeostasis. We show that failure to reset these chromatin marks during sexual reproduction results in the transgenerational inheritance of histone marks, which cause a loss of DNA methylation at heterochromatic loci and transposon activation. Thus, Jumonji-type histone demethylases play a dual role in plants by helping to maintain transcriptional states through development and safeguard genome integrity during sexual reproduction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>epimutation</kwd><kwd>transposon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AUREATE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez-Marcos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L003023/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez-Marcos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP19H05676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueda</surname><given-names>Minako</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EpiGen</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benhamed</surname><given-names>Moussa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N005279/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez-Marcos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N00194X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez-Marcos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P02601X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez-Marcos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Plants reset chromatin marks during sexual reproduction to safeguard the stability of the genome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, chromatin accessibility is modified by DNA methylation, the covalent modification of histone proteins and the deposition of histone variants. These epigenetic modifications allow the establishment of specific transcriptional states in response to environmental or developmental cues. While in most cases environmentally-induced chromatin changes are transient, epigenetic changes induced during development are often stably inherited through mitotic divisions, so that cell identity is maintained and individual cells or tissues do not revert to previous developmental states. A key chromatin modification implicated in these responses is the post-translational modification of histone tails, which are associated with active or inactive transcriptional states. Among these, the methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2) and H3K27me1 have been associated with the repression of transposable elements (TEs) in constitutive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindroth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lippman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mathieu et al., 2005</xref>), whereas other types of methylation, including H3K27me3, have been associated with the repression of genes in euchromatic genome regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pfluger and Wagner, 2007</xref>). H3K27me3 methylation is deposited by PRC2 and plays a crucial role in the development of most multicellular eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laugesen et al., 2019</xref>). In plants, this modification is found in approximately one quarter of protein-coding genes and is dynamically regulated during growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lafos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roudier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). The activity of PRCs is counterbalanced by JMJ demethylases, which catalyze the specific removal of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, five histone demethylases [RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6); EARLY FLOWERING 6 (ELF6); JUMONJI 13 (JMJ13); JUMONJI 30 (JMJ30); and JUMONJI 32 (JMJ32)] have been implicated in the demethylation of H3K27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crevillén et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). These proteins are thought to mediate the temporal and spatial de-repression of genes necessary for a wide range of plant processes such as flowering, hormone signaling, and control of the circadian clock. Inactivation of <italic>REF6</italic> results in the ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3 at hundreds of loci, many of them involved in developmental patterning and environmental responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). It has been proposed that REF6 is recruited to a specific sequence motif through its zinc-finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2011</xref>); however, others have shown that it is also recruited by specific interactions with transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that the affinity of REF6 to chromatin is hindered by DNA methylation, which could explain why its activity is primarily found at euchromatic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that REF6 acts redundantly with ELF6 and JMJ13 to restrict the accumulation of H3K27me3 in gene regulatory regions, thereby unlocking tissue-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, REF6, ELF6, JMJ30 and JMJ32 appear to specifically remove methyl groups from H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 but not from H3K27me1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crevillén et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). Previous investigations have shown that H3K27me1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is associated with constitutive heterochromatin, where it is deposited by ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED PROTEIN5 (ATXR5) and ATRX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacob et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacob et al., 2010</xref>). However, several studies in mammals and plants have shown that H3K27me1 is also found in euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuchs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacob et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vakoc et al., 2006</xref>). The presence of H3K27me3 in euchromatin is thought to be actively re-set during sexual reproduction – a view supported by studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showing that ELF6, REF6 and JMJ13 are necessary to reset and prevent the inheritance of this epigenetic mark to the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crevillén et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). However, the extent to which these epigenetic imprints are reset during sexual reproduction remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that the histone demethylases REF6 and ELF6 play distinct roles in the demethylation of histones in Arabidopsis, and that REF6 plays a major role in H3K27me1 dynamics in active chromatin. We also found that failure to reset H3K27me3 marks during sexual reproduction results in the inheritance of these epigenetic imprints even in the presence of fully functional histone demethylases. The ectopic inheritance of H3K27me3 is associated with the loss of DNA methylation at heterochromatic loci, leading to activation of TEs. Moreover, genetic and epigenetic mutations arising in histone demethylase mutants are stably inherited over multiple generations and result in pleiotropic developmental defects. Collectively, our work has uncovered a hitherto unrecognized role for histone demethylases in maintaining genetic and epigenetic stability of plant genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Arabidopsis REF6 and ELF6 play distinct roles in H3K27me3 homeostasis</title><p>The deposition of H3K27me3 by PRCs correlates with transcriptional repression in plants and animals. The dynamic regulation of this epigenetic mark enables the reactivation of genes primarily implicated in developmental programs; thus, any disruption to these regulatory networks results in major developmental aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kassis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lewis, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Molitor et al., 2016</xref>). The demethylation of H3K27me3 has been linked to the enzymatic activity of five JMJ-type proteins, which act antagonistically to SET-domain histone methyltransferases from the PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). To gain further knowledge about these processes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we investigated the function of two sequence-related histone demethylases, ELF6 and REF6. To aid this analysis, we isolated a loss-of-function T-DNA insertion of <italic>REF6</italic> (<italic>ref6-5</italic>) and a targeted CRISPR/Cas9 deletion in the first exon of <italic>ELF6</italic> (<italic>elf6-C</italic>) (See Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to previous reports, we found that our <italic>elf6-C</italic> plants displayed an early flowering phenotype characterized by a reduced number of rosette leaves at bolting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Noh et al., 2004</xref>).

By manual crossing, we generated <italic>elf6-C/ref6-5</italic> double mutant plants, which displayed pleiotropic growth phenotypes, including increased number of petals and pleiotropic defects in leaf morphology, such as serrations and downward curling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>). These phenotypes were akin to those recently reported for independently generated double mutants of the same histone demethylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2018</xref>), and their stability was confirmed by generating double mutants using different mutant allele combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

To shed light on the function of these two proteins, we analyzed the distribution of H3K27me3 in <italic>elf6-C, ref6-5</italic> and <italic>elf6-C/ref6-5</italic> seedlings through a ChIP-seq assays and compared them to that in wild-type plants. Overall, the accumulation of H3K27me3 within genes was more pronounced in <italic>ref6-5</italic> than in <italic>elf6-C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Most of the hyper-methylated genes found in <italic>elf6</italic> (75%) were hyper-methylated to a greater extent in both <italic>ref6-5</italic> and <italic>elf6-C/ref6-5</italic>, suggesting that these histone demethylases have partially overlapping yet distinct roles in the control of H3K27me3 homeostasis in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). In order to further understand the role of ELF6 and REF6 in transcriptional regulation, we performed an RNA-seq analysis. When combining transcriptomic and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data, we found a strong correlation primarily between genes that were both hyper-methylated at H3K27me3 and down-regulated, thus indicating that this epigenetic mark contributes to their transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). We also found genes that were hypo-methylated and up-regulated, which could be linked to the global transcriptional deregulation observed in these mutants. Taken together, our data point to the essential, yet distinct, roles of REF6 and ELF6 in H3K27me3 homeostasis at genic regions of the Arabidopsis genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>REF6 controls H3K27me1 homeostasis in euchromatin</title><p>Biochemical analyses have revealed that REF6 can remove both tri- and di-methyl groups but not mono-methyl groups at lysine 27 on histone 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that, in addition to controlling H3K27me3 homeostasis, REF6 and ELF6 may be also implicated in H3K27me1 homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we determined the distribution of H3K27me1 through ChIP-seq assays and found that most of the genes targeted by REF6 accumulate high levels of H3K27me1 in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the deposition of H3K27me1 in Arabidopsis is thought to be mediated by ATXR5 and 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacob et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacob et al., 2010</xref>), we determined the genomic distribution of H3K27me1 in the hypomorphic <italic>atxr5/atxr6</italic> mutant. As previously described, large-scale H3K27me1 accumulation in these mutants was significantly reduced at pericentromeric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, we noticed that in <italic>atxr5/atxr6</italic> lines the levels of this histone mark increased in gene-rich regions, pointing to the existence of an alternative pathway for H3K27me1 deposition in euchromatin. These data led us to postulate that the maintenance of H3K27me1 at euchromatin could be mediated by REF6. We therefore investigated the relationship between H3K27me1 and H3K27me3 at genes targeted by REF6. We found that the loss of REF6 activity results in both the accumulation of H3K27me3 and a drastic reduction in H3K27me1 at those loci, while the loss of ELF6 did not have an effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We next assessed genomic regions directly targeted by REF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2016</xref>) and found that the accumulation of H3K27me3 in <italic>ref6-5</italic> was associated with a complete loss of H3K27me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together these data revealed that the maintenance of H3K27me1 in euchromatin is dependent on REF6. To test if the H3K27me1 present in REF6 binding sites is produced by the sequential methylation by PRC2 and partial demethylation by REF6, we performed ChIP-seq analyses for H3K27me1 in the PRC2 methyltransferase double mutant <italic>clf/swn.</italic> We found a strong reduction of H3K27me1 in these mutants at REF6 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), thus confirming that H3K27me1 at these euchromatic sites is PRC2-dependant.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Arabidopsis REF6 plays an essential role in the deposition of H3K27me1 in active chromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome browser views of background subtracted ChIP-seq signals for H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 as normalized reads per genomic content (RPGC) in wild-type (WT) and histone demethylase mutants (<italic>elf6-C</italic>, <italic>ref6-5</italic> and <italic>elf6-C</italic>/<italic>ref6-5</italic>).

To address this gap in our knowledge, we examined the relationship between REF6-dependent H3K27me1 deposition and transcription. To aid this analysis, we divided the transcriptome into 10 equal deciles according to their transcriptional state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found that while H3K27me3 was primarily associated with strongly repressed genes in wild-type (first three quantiles), in <italic>ref6-5</italic>, the ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3 primarily affected genes that displayed low levels of expression (second to fifth quantiles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, we found that the activity of REF6 was required for low-level expression genes (third to fifth quantiles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Collectively, these data support the view that REF6 contributes to gene activation, by the removal of PRC2-dependent repressive marks, and to the maintenance of low-level basal expression, by maintaining H3K27me1 in transcriptionally active chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Inheritance of ectopic H3K27me3 imprints alters the epigenome</title><p>It has been shown in Arabidopsis that histone demethylases are critical for the resetting of H3K27me3 across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crevillén et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). To understand the biological significance of this epigenetic resetting thought to take place during plant sexual reproduction, we generated reciprocal crosses between single and double histone demethylase mutants and wild-type plants. We found that F<sub>1</sub> plants from these crosses were indistinguishable from wild-type, however some F<sub>2</sub> plants displayed unexpected developmental phenotypes that were not present in either single or double mutants (4.65% paternal and 4.42% maternal transmission, n = 1500 each) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). On the other hand, the frequency of plants displaying developmental abnormalities in the F<sub>2,</sub> resulting from F<sub>1</sub> hybrids between wild-type and single histone demethylase mutants, was markedly lower (0.58% for <italic>elf6-C</italic> and 0.63% for <italic>ref6-5;</italic> n &gt; 300 each). Intriguingly, abnormal plants arising from the <italic>elf6-C/+;ref6-5/+</italic> hybrids segregated for the different mutant allele combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), thus indicating that these novel phenotypes are not genetically linked to either <italic>elf6-C</italic> or <italic>ref6-5</italic> mutations. These plants displayed an array of developmental abnormalities, including abnormal leaf and inflorescence development and a severe reduction in fertility. We therefore reasoned that these defects could be caused by epimutations arising in <italic>elf6-C/ref6-5</italic> due to defects in H3K27me3 resetting during sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, we identified among these F<sub>2</sub> progenies one line (A5) that was genetically wild-type for ELF6 and REF6, but had enlarged rosette leaves and partial fertility. From this line, the viable seeds were used to propagate single-seed descent progenies by self-pollinating for over two generations. Plants from F<sub>3</sub> progenies displayed a wide spectrum of developmental abnormalities ranging from plants with wild-type characteristics (21.7%, n &gt; 100 each) to partially infertile plants with abnormal rosette leaves (78.3%, n &gt; 100 each). Notably, F<sub>4</sub> and F<sub>5</sub> progenies continued to segregate the broad range of developmental phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data indicate that loss of histone demethylase activity causes the accumulation of epimutations. To test this working hypothesis, we grew seedlings from two different F<sub>5</sub> progenies (A5.B1 and A5.C6) and performed a ChIP-seq analysis to determine H3K27me3 distribution across the genome. This analysis revealed 544 euchromatic loci with elevated levels of H3K27me3, of which one third were also found to be hyper-methylated in the parental double mutant line used in reciprocal crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data suggest that some of the H3K27me3 imprints present in epimutants were established in <italic>elf6-C/ref6-5</italic> and were then stably transmitted over the five generations, even after the wild-type function of these histone demethylases had been restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We herein named these lines <italic>epiERs</italic> (<underline>epi</underline>mutants arising from <italic><underline>elf6-C</underline>/<underline>ref6-5</underline>)</italic>. Notably, for both characterized lines we found that the ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3 was particularly common and strong in constitutive heterochromatin within the pericentromeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that ELF6 and REF6 are necessary to limit the transmission of H3K27me3 imprints to offspring, and that failure to do so results in epigenomic and developmental abnormalities.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Pleiotropic developmental abnormalities associated with the inheritance of ectopic H3K27me3 imprints in Arabidopsis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The F<sub>2</sub> hybrids from reciprocal crosses between wild-type (WT) and <italic>elf6-C/ref6-5</italic> display novel abnormal plant growth phenotypes.

Importantly, we did not find any significant changes in DNA methylation in any of these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore investigated variation in DNA methylation between plants within each population by performing a BS-seq analysis on individual F<sub>4</sub> <italic>epiER</italic> plants. This analysis revealed that while some plants were consistently devoid of DNA methylation at pericentromeric regions, similar to the <italic>ddm1</italic> mutant, others displayed intermediate states that varied from chromosome to chromosome, thus providing evidence for a partial resetting of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, the loss of DNA methylation in constitutive heterochromatic regions in <italic>epiERs</italic> was associated with a decrease in methylation at TEs and genes located therein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, these defects in heterochromatin methylation were also observed in F<sub>1</sub> hybrids derived from reciprocal crosses between wild-type and histone demethylase mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Given that these pericentromeric regions in <italic>epiERs</italic> failed to fully recover DNA methylation to wild-type levels and displayed elevated H3K27me3 levels, we hypothesized that they may be partially protected from the DNA methylation activity commonly used to target transposons and repetitive DNA elements in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>). We therefore investigated the relationship between DNA methylation and H3K27me3 on transposons located in euchromatic and constitutive heterochromatic genome regions. We found that in <italic>epiERs</italic>, heterochromatic TEs that gained H3K27me3 had a proportional loss of DNA methylation whereas euchromatic TEs showed no change in DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These data support the view that a gain in H3K27me3 has a negative effect on the deposition and/or the maintenance of DNA methylation at heterochromatic transposons. To evaluate the extent to which these defects may affect chromatin compaction, we performed immunostaining assays on interphase nuclei using specific antibodies. We found that in <italic>epiERs,</italic> heterochomatin compaction is strongly affected and manifest as a higher proportion of decondensed nuclei compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

These data suggest that the abnormal distribution of epigenetic marks in <italic>epiERs</italic> results in transcriptional activation of euchromatic and heterochromatic loci. Given that pericentromeric heterochromatin in plants is rich in TEs and is tightly regulated by DNA methylation and other epigenomic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubin et al., 2018</xref>), we tested whether the epigenomic perturbations found in <italic>epiERs</italic> could result in the activation of transposons.

Further analysis revealed that these TEs were depleted in DNA methylation and significantly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then determined the precise location of some of the transposons that had newly mobilized in the different epimutants.

Previous studies in Arabidopsis have shown that the activity of a distinct group of JmJ-type demethylases shape the genomic distribution of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Three of these proteins – JMJ13, ELF6 and REF6 – have been shown to play important roles in development and in the regulation of environmental perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Noh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Our data show that REF6 and ELF6 regulate the removal of H3K27me3 at different genomic loci; while REF6 has a large repertoire of target genes, ELF6 activity is restricted to a small subset of genes, most of which can also be targeted by REF6. Combined with our genetic analysis, these data collectively suggest that despite the structural similarities between these two proteins, they are able to carry out distinct functions in H3K27me3 homeostasis. Our data also support the view that although REF6 restricts the spreading of H3K27me3 to the genomic regions flanking PRC2 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2018</xref>), it also has a hitherto unrecognized function in the regulation of H3K27me1 homeostasis in euchromatin. This view is also supported by the overlap between REF6 genomic targets and H3K27me1 accumulation in euchromatic regions in wild-type plants, as well as by the complete loss of H3K27me1 in PRC2 target loci in plants without REF6 activity, and the partial loss of H3K27me1 in plants without PRC2 activity. Therefore, the accumulation of H3K27me1 in Arabidopsis relies both on the activity of ATXR5 and ATXR6 in heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacob et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacob et al., 2010</xref>) and on the activity of REF6 in transcriptionally active euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). ATXR5 and 6 have been shown to target only newly synthesized H3.1 histone variants, which are deposited during replication and replaced by H3.3 in euchromatin during later stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2014</xref>). In mammals, the histone demethylases UTX and JMJD3, also known as KDM6A and KDM6B, have been shown to catalyze the conversion of H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 into H3K27me1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Santa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Swigut and Wysocka, 2007</xref>). Moreover, defects in PRC2 methyltransferase activity in mammals completely abolishes the accumulation of H3K27me1 in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montgomery et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting a conserved PRC2-mediated mechanism for H3K27me1 homeostasis in euchromatin, in both animals and plants. The precise mechanism responsible for the deposition of this chromatin mark in Arabidopsis is currently unknown, but our data support the view that the deposition of H3K27me1 in euchromatin is dependent on the activity of PRC2 and REF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In mammals the presence of H3K27me1 in actively transcribed genomic regions has been associated with the promotion of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrari et al., 2014</xref>), a fact that may explain why Arabidopsis genes associated with H3K27me1 display moderate levels of expression, whereas the conversion of this mark into H3K27me3 negatively impacts their transcriptional rates.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the role of histone demethylases in the accumulation of H3K27me1 and the formation of epimutations arising in ELF6 and REF6 mutants (<italic>epiERs</italic>).</title><p>(Top panel) Model for the mechanisms implicated in the accumulation of H3K27me1. In pericentromeric heterochromatin of somatic cells, ATRX5/6 deposits in a single-step H3K27me1 on histones containing H3K9me2. In euchromatin of somatic cells, the PRC2 complex deposits H3K27me3, which is converted to H3K27me1 by the catalytic activity of REF6. (Bottom panel) Model for the origin of epiERs. In constitutive heterochromatin of wild type somatic cells, DNA methylation obstructs the PRC2 complex from depositing H3K27me3. In gametes of wild-type plants, reprogramming of DNA methylation facilitates the deposition of H3K27me3 by the PRC2 complex, but these imprints are actively removed by histone demethylases, thus permitting DNA methylases to establish normal levels of methylation. In gametes of elf6-C/ref6-5, the H3K27me3 deposited by the PRC2 complex accumulates during the reprogramming of DNA methylation and interfere with the activity of DNA methyltransferases. The ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3 spreads to flanking genomic regions by recruitment of LHP1 and the PRC2 complex. Dark blue circles, methyl groups. C, Cytosines.

Other studies have also reported the accumulation of H3K27me3 at transposon sites in plant species with reduced levels of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montgomery et al., 2020</xref>), as well as in mammal somatic and reproductive tissues which also show reduced levels of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reddington et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saksouk et al., 2014</xref>). However, our data do not fully support the idea that the deposition of this chromatin mark acts as a compensatory system to silence hypomethylated TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deleris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanna et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, our results suggest that the homeostasis and function of H3K27me1 and H3K27me3 in plants is more complex than previously anticipated. The stable inheritance of de novo acquired DNA methylation imprints in plants is well documented. Mutations in the machinery involved in the deposition of DNA methylation, such as the cytosine <italic>DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1</italic> (<italic>MET1)</italic> and the chromatin-remodeling <italic>DEFICIENT IN DNA METHYLATION 1</italic> (<italic>DDM1</italic>), frequently induce epimutations caused by DNA hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johannes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kakutani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mathieu et al., 2007</xref>). These epimutations are maintained during sexual reproduction and remain stable over several generations, even after the function of MET1 or DDM1 is restored. Moreover, natural epimutations created during asexual propagation and associated with DNA hypomethylation involving TEs, can be stable over multiple generations, thus contributing to a variety of novel heritable phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ong-Abdullah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wibowo et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, analysis of the Arabidopsis <italic>met1</italic> mutant has shown that a large number of TEs that lose DNA methylation gain H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deleris et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, TEs in Arabidopsis gain H3K27me3 in response to <italic>ddm1</italic>-induced loss of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rougée et al., 2020</xref>). Collectively, our data together with these reports suggest that DNA methylation and H3K27me3 act antagonistically to mediate the transcriptional silencing of transposons.</p><p>There is accumulating evidence for the active role of histone demethylases in resetting H3K27me3 at specific loci during sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crevillén et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Noh et al., 2004</xref>) and for a global depletion of H3K27me3 during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borg et al., 2020</xref>). While the precise mechanism(s) governing this phenomenon remains poorly understood, our finding that the failure to reset H3K27me3 during sexual reproduction resulted in its trans-generational inheritance in euchromatin, even when functional demethylase activity was restored, might suggest that some of the H3K27me3 imprints that are ectopically deposited in histone demethylase mutants cannot be reset if they are distal to the target sequences recognized by the demethylases. Furthermore, once established, these H3K27me3 imprints could be maintained across generations as epimutations through the recruitment of LHP1-PRC2 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derkacheva et al., 2013</xref>). Our data revealed that the inheritance of H3K27me3 imprints causes defects on the maintenance of DNA methylation at constitutive heterochromatic. However, these defects are not caused by the ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3 at genes implicated in the DNA methylation machinery. The ectopic deposition of H3K27me3 in constitutive heterochromatin may instead be linked to defects in the resetting of DNA methylation thought to take place during gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calarco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ibarra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Slotkin et al., 2009</xref>) and/or during early embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouyer et al., 2017</xref>), where epigenetic modifications have been shown to be anti-correlative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mathieu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roudier et al., 2011</xref>). Under this scenario, an active resetting of H3K27me3 in gametes would be critical for the re-establishment of DNA methylation, while the ectopic deposition of H3K27me3 in histone demethylase mutants could antagonize the deposition of DNA methylation at TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Mutants defective in histone demethylases could accumulate epigenomic alterations in gametes that could explain the heritable, yet unstable, phenotypes observed in <italic>epiER</italic>s. Similar epimutations and phenotypic variation have been shown to arise from crosses between wild-type plants and mutants defective in the machinery that maintains DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kakutani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marí-Ordóñez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mirouze et al., 2012</xref>). As in these studies, we also found that <italic>epiER</italic>s have defects in the silencing of some transposons resulting in an increase in genetic lesions associated with their mobilization. Taken together our data reveal novel, critical roles for histone demethylases in maintaining both genome integrity and transcriptional states during plant development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>All plant lines used in this study were derived from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> Col-0 accession.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yannick Jacob (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>All reviewers agree that this work looks interesting, but all three reviewers also raised major issues about biological relevance of H3K27me1 in plants and mechanisms behind epimutation and linkages of DNA methylation and H3K27me3. Reviewer 1 and 3 also critisized that paper has two main findings, which are not cohesive. Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most important issue is how ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3 leads to impaired DNA methylation. The mechanistic linkage is poor in the current manuscript, and this should be substantialized in the revision.</p><p>2).Please address the biological relevance of H3K27me1, which is not clear. It could be indirectly linked to gene expression control and genome stability.</p><p>3) The paper could be separated. The first part covers a new biochemical function of REF6 and ELF6, but the second part mainly deals with epimutation in progenies. It is not clear that changes in H3K27me1/H3K27me3 are relevant for the phenotypic and epigenetic alterations in next generations. The manuscript should be more connected.</p><p>However, please thoroughly check the reviewer comments (you find the individual reviews below) and address them to the best of your capacity. All comments are critical for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The contribution by Antunez-Sanchez et al. demonstrates that histone demethylases REF6 and ELF6 have distinct roles in the histone demethylation in Arabidopsis. REF6 has a broader impact in reducing H3K27me3 and is also a major player in the deposition of H3K27me1 in active euchromatin regions. The maintenance of H3K27me1 in active chromatin tends to allow a low-level basal expression. In addition, this study also showed that the failure to reset H3K27me marks during sexual reproduction results in the inheritance of H3K27me3 imprints, which is associated with the loss of DNA methylation at heterochromatic loci, leading to TE activations. Overall, the manuscript covers new roles of REF6 and ELF6 and biological relevance of H3K27me1/me3 homeostasis in genome integrity and transcription activity. However, several flaws should be addressed to show the importance of this study.</p><p>1) What tissues were used for each analysis? Genetic interactions between ELF6 and REF6 vary as shown in phenotypic analysis. Therefore, plant tissues and age should be described in figure legends.</p><p>2) They suggested the importance of H3K27me1 homeostasis in gene expression. I am wondering if the H3K27me1 imprints can be transmitted to offspring in wild type. Otherwise, how the histone mark could be reset. Is there another responsible histone demethylase that removes H3K27me1? In addition, the relevance of H3K27me1 in genome stability is limited, and interpretation about epi-mutants relies mainly on ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3. Although they emphasize their finding about REF6-catalyzed H3K27me1 as shown in Figure 7, the analysis of H3K27me1 was not extensive.</p><p>3) Do REF6 and ELF6 have critical roles in silencing pericentromoric regions? How about H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 levels in pericentromeric regions in ref6 and elf6 mutants?</p><p>4) Ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3 leads to global reductions in DNA methylation at pericentromeric regions. To support the idea that hypomethylation caused by ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3 depends on RdDM pathways, they should use mutants of RdDM pathways. In addition, if REF6 and ELF6 are particularly relevant in histone modification at active chromatin, what mechanisms could be involved in changes in DNA methylation at pericentromeric regions? I think that DNA methylation could be indirect and stochastic results.</p><p>5) Reduction of H3K27me1 could be linked to global reductions in DNA methylation? There is no experiment to rule out the possibility.</p><p>6) Individual epi-mutants have variable phenotypes, and genetic backgrounds are not likely uniform. I am wondering if GO analysis is meaningful in this situation. It could be very different depending on individuals.</p><p>7) Figure 4E: Please quantify the results, rather than showing representative images.</p><p>8) Figure 7: The summary figure should show main finding of this paper. I think only the fraction of this study is shown, and this makes reader confusing. The authors should rearrange the manuscript and figures and give a more focused view of the conclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>General Assessment</p><p>The manuscript by Antunez and colleagues provide important biological insights into the role of DNA demethylase in maintaining genetic and epigenetic stability between different generations. In addition, this study also shed light on the contribution of H3K27me2/3 demethylases toward in vivo levels of H3K27me1 in plants. I think this is important work that should be of general interest to the plant epigenetic community. The manuscript is well-written and the conclusions are substantiated.</p><p>Substantive concern:</p><p>1) One concern with the manuscript is the mechanism leading to epimutations that is proposed by the authors, which is that ectopic inheritance of H3K27me3 in gametes leads to the different phenotypes observed. The work of Olivier Mathieu and his colleagues in 2005 has shown that loss of DNA methylation in ddm1 mutants leads to ectopic gains of H3K27me3 in heterochromatin. Transcriptional reactivation of transposons and transposition (e.g. Tsukahara et al., Nature 2009) is also observed in ddm1 mutants like in the EpiER lines. Therefore, it would be useful for the authors to investigate if DNA methylation is impaired because of genome-wide gains in H3K27me3 in gametes, or whether one or a few affected loci are responsible for the loss of DNA methylation. The authors try to address this point (e.g. subsection “Accumulation of ectopic H3K27me3 at centromeric heterochromatin is linked to DNA hypomethylation”), however, more information should be provided. They should indicate which genes in the DNA methylation pathways have been assessed for H3K27me3 levels. In addition, the transcriptional status of these genes should be assessed (the data is already available from this study) to determine if loss of DNA methylation is due to down-regulation of DNA methylation genes. Transcriptional silencing of these genes could be achieved indirectly, if no gains in H3K27me3 are observed at the genes.</p><p>2) Results: It's not clear to me looking at Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 5 that REF6 is &quot;…required for low-level expression genes.&quot; I think those figures indicate that these genes (3rd and 5th quantiles) gains H3K27me3, but the transcriptional impact of the increase of H3K27me3 at these genes is not provided. Since they have transcriptional data for ref6 mutants, the authors could look if gains in H3K27me3 at these genes decrease their expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper looks at the effects of the Arabidopsis H3K27me3 histone demethylases (HDM) REF6 and ELF6 on the plant epigenome and on the generation of novel epialleles. There are two fairly distinct parts to the paper. In the first part, they generate elf6 ref6 double mutants using likely null alleles, one generated by genome editing. They use genomic approaches to show that many target genes gain H3K27me3 methylation and have decreased expression in the mutants. This part is consistent with what has been shown by several other studies, notably the Kaufman group ( Nature Plants, 4:681). Of greater novelty, they then show that REF6/ELF6 targets are enriched for H3K27me1 in the wild type background, but lose this mark in ref6 elf6 double mutants, consistent with a role for REF6 and ELF6 in generating this mark by demethylating H3K27me3 to H3K27me1 but being unable to demethylate H3K27me1 substrates. Using ChIP seq they show that ATXR5 and ATXR6 (H3K27me1 monomethylases required for heterochromatic H3K27me1) are not required for the H3K27me1 that they find at euchromatic locations. They correlate H3K27me1 in euchromatin with intermediate level gene expression, although whether this is an indirect effect of a lack of H3K27me3 is hard to disentangle. In the second part they describe the appearance of novel phenotypes at low frequency in F2 progeny of WT X elf6 ref6. They identify REF6+ ELF6+ homozygous progeny in F2 and show that these can transmit novel phenotypes from F2 to F5 generations. Profiling of selected F5 individuals with novel phenotypes reveal various changes, including H3K27me3 hyper and hypomethylation, loss of DNA methylation, and mobilisation of transposable elements (TE). The suggestion is that the novel phenotypes are caused by epialleles, i.e. heritable alterations in histone or DNA methylation, although DNA sequence based changes due to TE insertion or imprecise excision are also possible causes.</p><p>Overall I found this a very interesting paper. The role of HDM in euchromatic H3K27me1 is novel and intriguing, perhaps difficult to assess the significance as the mechanism of H3K27me1 action is not known in plants, i.e. readers etc for this mark have not been identified. The observation that ref elf mutants may give rise to epialleles that persist even when REF6 ELF6 activity is restored is of broad interest, and builds on studies such as Crevillen et al. (Nature 515: 587) which showed that elf6 impairment can give rise to heritable epigenetic changes (but in this case only in the elf6 mutant background). On the negative side, the two parts of the paper are not very strongly connected, for example it is not very clear if changes in H3K27me1 described in part one are relevant for the phenotypic and epigenetic alterations described in part two. Also, there is very limited description of the phenotypes found and the causes are not very clear i.e. alterations in which genes are causal and what are the genetic or epigenetic changes involved? It is not very clear why ref6/elf6 depletion gives rise to the effects observed, for example one of the major changes in hyper H3K27me3 methylation and loss of DNA methylation at pericentromeric heterochromatin, yet ref6 elf6 mutants do not seem to show this change. Overall, the observations are interesting, they have done a lot of analysis and it is unreasonable to expect a complete explanation but the overall picture remains confusing. As such I think the paper is borderline for <italic>eLife</italic>, and would at least require some revision along the lines below.</p><p>1) Figure 3A shows plants with aberrant phenotypes and their transmission, however there is no description of the phenotypes, or of their inheritance i.e. what kind of segregation ratios are observed in the different generations. For example, A5 looks to be broad leaved but gives rise to plants with narrow curled leaves in F3 generation, it is not clear if these are transmitted into F4 generation or at what frequency, or if traits are dominant or recessive.</p><p>2) It's not very clear which generation is used for the various profiles of A5 progeny, possibly F4 or F5 plants?</p><p>3) Much of the data is not accessible or presented. For example, no lists of the peaks found for the different marks profiled are provided, nor are there lists of differential peaks found, or how these related to genes showing altered expression.</p><p>4) In Figure 3D the wild type trace is invisible, either omitted or masked by another trace?</p><p>5) The recent paper from Berger group on reprogramming in sperm (Borg et al., 2020) could be referenced and discussed. This study would suggest that H3K27me3 hypermethylation should not be transmitted paternally once REF6/ELF6 activity is restored. It would be interesting to know if the phenotypes and or epigenetic changes seen in A5 can be transmitted maternally, paternally or both once RER6/ELF6 activity is restored. Given that some or all of the effects of REF6/ELF6 depletion may be indirect effects of H3K27me3 changes, for example TE mobilisation or DNA hypomethylation, it is possible that the phenotypes would be transmitted but this might give some indication of whether H3K27me3 changes are causal for the phenotypes or not, or indirect. If the phenotypes are recessive, then this would require both paternal and maternal transmission in self progeny.</p><p>6) Subsection “REF6 controls H3K27me1 homeostasis in chromatin” states that H3K27me1 is not affected at euchromatic gene in atxr5 atxr6 mutants, however in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 it looks as if levels are actually increased in the mutant. This should be commented on and discussed. It should also be mentioned that the particular atxr5 atxr6 double mutant combination is hypomorphic and not null.</p><p>7) Figure 6F shows that line A5.B1.3 which has a seed pigmentation phenotype has a 5 bp insertion in the tt4 gene. It is stated that this is due to transposon remobilisation but it is not clear if this is inferred as a likely imprecise excision, or whether they are able to show that a TE is present in this location in a progenitor plant?</p><p>8) Given that a lot of sequence data is available for some of the lines, I wondered if authors should check that there are no mutations present in genes associated with RdRM etc? That is not intended as a slight, but since changes in DNA methylation are observed that don't readily correlate with what is seen in the ref6 elf6 parental lines it could presumably be easily checked and eliminated as a potential cause.</p><p>9) The correlation between pericentromeric H3K27me3 increase and DNA methylation decrease is an interesting observation, but they provide no mechanism why this should arise in elf6 ref6 backgrounds, which they show seem normal for pericentromeric DNA methylation and H3K27me3. The Qiu et al. (2019) Nat Comm paper, which the authors here mention in the Introduction, reported that REF6 cannot bind efficiently on methylated DNA, so it is puzzling.</p><p>10) Lines were picked based on aberrant phenotypes, propagated, and then analysed and found to contain various epigenetic and genetic changes. It is difficult to know whether the changes cause the phenotypes seen, and if so which particular changes. This made me wonder to what extent ELF6 REF6 F2 progeny with normal phenotypes would also show epigenomic changes, or whether this is specific to the plants with phenotypic abnormalities?</p><p>11) The fact that ref6 and elf6 have opposite effects on flowering time is curious. The elf6c mutant is early flowering, consistent with a role for ELF6 in binding the floral repressor FLC and promoting its expression by H3K27me3 demethylation (Mol Plant 11:1135). The ref6 mutant is late flowering, and has been correlated with increased FLC expression (Plant Cell 16: 2601), which seems at odds with the hypermethylation for H3K27me3 and decreased expression more typical of these mutants. This might be commented on, and whether the various profiling experiments offer any explanation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A new role for histone demethylases in the maintenance of plant genome integrity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Overall I find it an interesting paper of broad general interest but don't feel that the revision greatly addresses the comments from before as to mechanism and significance of H3K27me1 being unclear. That said, there is a lot of data in the paper and it is an interesting story that is perhaps complementary to the Borg et al., 2020 paper.</p><p>I have issues with a couple of the points made by authors.</p><p>3) Much of the data is not accessible or presented. For example, no lists of the peaks found for the different marks profiled are provided, nor are there lists of differential peaks found, or how these related to genes showing altered expression. All the raw data has been uploaded in a public repository. We don't think it is necessary to upload all of the peak data as supplemental information.</p><p>It is a given that the raw data will be provided. Since there is a lot of discussion of the ChIP seq data and selected peaks etc are shown I think it reasonable that the authors provide lists of enriched genes for the various ChIP seq experiments, as is usually provided in other papers.</p><p>8) Given that a lot of sequence data is available for some of the lines, I wondered if authors should check that there are no mutations present in genes associated with RdRM etc?

REF6 has a broader impact in reducing H3K27me3 and is also a major player in the deposition of H3K27me1 in active euchromatin regions. The maintenance of H3K27me1 in active chromatin tends to allow a low-level basal expression. In addition, this study also showed that the failure to reset H3K27me marks during sexual reproduction results in the inheritance of H3K27me3 imprints, which is associated with the loss of DNA methylation at heterochromatic loci, leading to TE activations. Overall, the manuscript covers new roles of REF6 and ELF6 and biological relevance of H3K27me1/me3 homeostasis in genome integrity and transcription activity. However, several flaws should be addressed to show the importance of this study.</p><p>1) What tissues were used for each analysis? Genetic interactions between ELF6 and REF6 vary as shown in phenotypic analysis. Therefore, plant tissues and age should be described in figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised Materials and methods, we have included information about the age and type of plant tissues used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They suggested the importance of H3K27me1 homeostasis in gene expression. I am wondering if the H3K27me1 imprints can be transmitted to offspring in wild type. Otherwise, how the histone mark could be reset. Is there another responsible histone demethylase that removes H3K27me1? In addition, the relevance of H3K27me1 in genome stability is limited, and interpretation about epi-mutants relies mainly on ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3. Although they emphasize their finding about REF6-catalyzed H3K27me1 as shown in Figure 7, the analysis of H3K27me1 was not extensive.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an interesting point. Although it is not yet known how removal of H3K27me1 occurs and which proteins are involved in this process, it has been recently proposed that this might occur during replacement by the histone H3.10 variant (Borg et al., 2020).</p><p>We have investigated the relationship between H3K27me3, H3K27me1 and DNA methylation in epiER plants and found a negative correlation between H3K27me3 and the other two epigenetic marks (see heatmap analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We do not think these results affect our current hypothesis but are happy to include these data if deemed necessary.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58533-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do REF6 and ELF6 have critical roles in silencing pericentromoric regions? How about H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 levels in pericentromeric regions in ref6 and elf6 mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>Analysis of H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 in ref6-5, elf-C and elf6-C/<italic>ref6-5</italic> did not reveal significant changes in pericentromeric regions compared to WT, thus indicating that these histone demethylases do not play a major role in the regulation of chromatin at these genomic regions. Moreover, the binding of these histone demethylases to chromatin is thought to be prevented by DNA methylation (Qui et al., 2019), therefore their role in silencing pericentromeric regions in somatic tissues appears to be limited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3 leads to global reductions in DNA methylation at pericentromeric regions. To support the idea that hypomethylation caused by ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3 depends on RdDM pathways, they should use mutants of RdDM pathways. In addition, if REF6 and ELF6 are particularly relevant in histone modification at active chromatin, what mechanisms could be involved in changes in DNA methylation at pericentromeric regions? I think that DNA methylation could be indirect and stochastic results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We clarified these points in the revised Discussion and explained briefly below:</p><p>Deleris et al., 2012 have shown that in the Arabidopsis <italic>met1</italic> mutant impaired for CG methylation, hundreds of TEs that lost DNA methylation also gained H3K27me3. Recently, Rougée et al. (2020) have also shown that numerous TEs gain H3K27me3 in response to <italic>ddm1</italic>-induced loss of DNA methylation. Collectively, these studies suggest that DNA methylation can antagonize H3K27me3 deposition at TEs and that transposon sequences can be marked by H3K27me3 through the activity of the PRC2 complex. In addition, our data show that a gain on H3K27me3 can induce a loss of DNA methylation at TEs. Collectively, our data combined with these reports suggest that these two epigenetic pathways act antagonistically at TE sites. The precise mechanism(s) implicated in changes in DNA methylation at pericentromeric regions are not yet fully understood but we hypothesize that these histone demethylases may be required to protect DNA demethylated regions from the activity of the PRC2 complexes during the reprogramming of heterochromatic marks thought to take place during plant gametogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Reduction of H3K27me1 could be linked to global reductions in DNA methylation? There is no experiment to rule out the possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>H3K27me1 is linked to DNA methylation primarily in centromeric and pericentromeric transposon-related sequences but not on euchromatin. Our data shows that the accumulation of H3K27me3 and reduction of H3K27me1 in <italic>ref6-5</italic> mutant is primarily on genic regions (REF6 targets) usually lacking DNA methylation. For these reasons, we did not consider it necessary to perform the experiment suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Individual epi-mutants have variable phenotypes, and genetic backgrounds are not likely uniform. I am wondering if GO analysis is meaningful in this situation. It could be very different depending on individuals.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the GO analysis is informative because if specific gene networks are affected in epimutants, which differ in their epigenetic background, it suggests that the genomic regions affected are non-random.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4E: Please quantify the results, rather than showing representative images.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of nuclear chromatin condensations was provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 7: The summary figure should show main finding of this paper.

In addition, this study also shed light on the contribution of H3K27me2/3 demethylases toward in vivo levels of H3K27me1 in plants. I think this is important work that should be of general interest to the plant epigenetic community. The manuscript is well-written and the conclusions are substantiated.</p><p>Substantive concern:</p><p>1) One concern with the manuscript is the mechanism leading to epimutations that is proposed by the authors, which is that ectopic inheritance of H3K27me3 in gametes leads to the different phenotypes observed. The work of Olivier Mathieu and his colleagues in 2005 has shown that loss of DNA methylation in ddm1 mutants leads to ectopic gains of H3K27me3 in heterochromatin. Transcriptional reactivation of transposons and transposition (e.g. Tsukahara et al., Nature 2009) is also observed in ddm1 mutants like in the EpiER lines. Therefore, it would be useful for the authors to investigate if DNA methylation is impaired because of genome-wide gains in H3K27me3 in gametes, or whether one or a few affected loci are responsible for the loss of DNA methylation. The authors try to address this point (e.g. subsection “Accumulation of ectopic H3K27me3 at centromeric heterochromatin is linked to DNA hypomethylation”), however, more information should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data support the view that DNA methylation is impaired because gametes gain H3K27me3. This hypothesis is supported by a recent report that has shown that histone demethylase mutants cause a significant increase in H3K27me3 in male gametes (Borg et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They should indicate which genes in the DNA methylation pathways have been assessed for H3K27me3 levels. In addition, the transcriptional status of these genes should be assessed (the data is already available from this study) to determine if loss of DNA methylation is due to down-regulation of DNA methylation genes. Transcriptional silencing of these genes could be achieved indirectly, if no gains in H3K27me3 are observed at the genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have checked the chromatin (H3K27me3 and H3K27me1) and expression profiles of genes implicated in DNA methylation in our histone demethylase mutants and in two epiERs. We only found one common differentially expressed gene (FDM2), which is thought to act redundantly with five other genes (FDM1, FDM3, FDM4 and FDM5) in RNAdirected DNA methylation (Xie et al., 2012). Moreover, although this gene is downregulated in <italic>ref6-5</italic> and elf6-C/ref6-5, it does not cause significant changes in DNA methylation.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58533-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Results: It's not clear to me looking at Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 5 that REF6 is &quot;…required for low-level expression genes.&quot; I think those figures indicate that these genes (3rd and 5th quantiles) gains H3K27me3, but the transcriptional impact of the increase of H3K27me3 at these genes is not provided.

The role of HDM in euchromatic H3K27me1 is novel and intriguing, perhaps difficult to assess the significance as the mechanism of H3K27me1 action is not known in plants, i.e. readers etc for this mark have not been identified. The observation that ref elf mutants may give rise to epialleles that persist even when REF6 ELF6 activity is restored is of broad interest, and builds on studies such as Crevillen et al. (Nature 515: 587) which showed that elf6 impairment can give rise to heritable epigenetic changes (but in this case only in the elf6 mutant background). On the negative side, the two parts of the paper are not very strongly connected, for example it is not very clear if changes in H3K27me1 described in part one are relevant for the phenotypic and epigenetic alterations described in part two. Also, there is very limited description of the phenotypes found and the causes are not very clear i.e. alterations in which genes are causal and what are the genetic or epigenetic changes involved? It is not very clear why ref6/elf6 depletion gives rise to the effects observed, for example one of the major changes in hyper H3K27me3 methylation and loss of DNA methylation at pericentromeric heterochromatin, yet ref6 elf6 mutants do not seem to show this change. Overall, the observations are interesting, they have done a lot of analysis and it is unreasonable to expect a complete explanation but the overall picture remains confusing. As such I think the paper is borderline for eLife, and would at least require some revision along the lines below.</p><p>1) Figure 3A shows plants with aberrant phenotypes and their transmission, however there is no description of the phenotypes, or of their inheritance i.e. what kind of segregation ratios are observed in the different generations. For example, A5 looks to be broad leaved but gives rise to plants with narrow curled leaves in F3 generation, it is not clear if these are transmitted into F4 generation or at what frequency, or if traits are dominant or recessive.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a description of the phenotypes observed and the ratios at which they appear. We have also added a figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 phenotypes of segregating plants).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It's not very clear which generation is used for the various profiles of A5 progeny, possibly F4 or F5 plants?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the text that F5 plants were used for the ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and bulk BS-seq, and that F4 plants were used for the BS-seq of individual plants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Much of the data is not accessible or presented.

We have changed the y axis label to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The recent paper from Berger group on reprogramming in sperm (Borg et al., 2020) could be referenced and discussed. This study would suggest that H3K27me3 hypermethylation should not be transmitted paternally once REF6/ELF6 activity is restored. It would be interesting to know if the phenotypes and or epigenetic changes seen in A5 can be transmitted maternally, paternally or both once RER6/ELF6 activity is restored. Given that some or all of the effects of REF6/ELF6 depletion may be indirect effects of H3K27me3 changes, for example TE mobilisation or DNA hypomethylation, it is possible that the phenotypes would be transmitted but this might give some indication of whether H3K27me3 changes are causal for the phenotypes or not, or indirect. If the phenotypes are recessive, then this would require both paternal and maternal transmission in self progeny.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed the data that was published by Borg et al., 2020 while our manuscript was under review. Their data support our view that the accumulation of H3K27me3 could have profound consequences in the reprogramming of other epigenetic marks. Our genetic data suggest that histone methylases are required in the male and female germline to prevent the accumulation of epigenetic defects in the offspring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “REF6 controls H3K27me1 homeostasis in chromatin” states that H3K27me1 is not affected at euchromatic gene in atxr5 atxr6 mutants, however in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 it looks as if levels are actually increased in the mutant. This should be commented on and discussed. It should also be mentioned that the particular atxr5 atxr6 double mutant combination is hypomorphic and not null.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 6F shows that line A5.B1.3 which has a seed pigmentation phenotype has a 5 bp insertion in the tt4 gene.

The Qiu et al. (2019) Nat Comm paper, which the authors here mention in the Introduction, reported that REF6 cannot bind efficiently on methylated DNA, so it is puzzling.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data combined with recent work (Borg et al., 2020) supports the hypothesis that an increase in H3K27me3 levels in histone demethylase mutants causes defects on the epigenomic reprogramming that takes place during gametogenesis, primarily at pericentromeric regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Lines were picked based on aberrant phenotypes, propagated, and then analysed and found to contain various epigenetic and genetic changes. It is difficult to know whether the changes cause the phenotypes seen, and if so which particular changes. This made me wonder to what extent ELF6 REF6 F2 progeny with normal phenotypes would also show epigenomic changes, or whether this is specific to the plants with phenotypic abnormalities?</p></disp-quote><p>For practical reasons we did not perform epigenomic analyses in plants from ELF6 REF6 progenies that were indistinguishable from wild-type. We cannot exclude that “normal-looking” plants may contain a small number of epigenomic modifications, but this does not affect any of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The fact that ref6 and elf6 have opposite effects on flowering time is curious. The elf6c mutant is early flowering, consistent with a role for ELF6 in binding the floral repressor FLC and promoting its expression by H3K27me3 demethylation (Mol Plant 11:1135). The ref6 mutant is late flowering, and has been correlated with increased FLC expression (Plant Cell 16: 2601), which seems at odds with the hypermethylation for H3K27me3 and decreased expression more typical of these mutants. This might be commented on, and whether the various profiling experiments offer any explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting to investigate why <italic>ref6-5</italic> and <italic>elf6-C</italic> have opposing effects on flowering but in order to define the precise mechanism(s) it would be desirable to conduct a detailed analysis, which is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors have provided some new data, ChIP seq of H3K27me1 in clf swn mutants, which provides some support for their model that euchromatic H3K27me1 derives from demethylation by REF6 of H3K27me3 deposited by PRC2 and is a good addition. Overall I find it an interesting paper of broad general interest but don't feel that the revision greatly addresses the comments from before as to mechanism and significance of H3K27me1 being unclear. That said, there is a lot of data in the paper and it is an interesting story that is perhaps complementary to the Borg et al., 2020 paper.</p><p>I have issues with a couple of the points made by authors.</p><p>3) Much of the data is not accessible or presented.
