Assessment of inflammatory and metabolic characteristics of a urbanizing African population and the comparison with populations outside Africa could provide insight in the pathophysiology of the rapidly increasing epidemic of NCDs, including the role of environmental and dietary changes. Using a proteomic plasma profiling approach comprising 92 inflammation-related molecules, we examined differences in the inflammatory proteome in healthy Tanzanian and healthy Dutch adults. We show that healthy Tanzanians display a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared to Dutch subjects, with enhanced activity of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signalling pathway and higher concentrations of different metabolic regulators such as 4E-BP1 and fibroblast growth factor 21. Among the Tanzanian volunteers, food-derived metabolites were identified as an important driver of variation in inflammation-related molecules, emphasizing the potential importance of lifestyle changes. These findings endorse the importance of the current dietary transition and the inclusion of underrepresented populations in systems immunology studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>proteome</kwd><kwd>immune system</kwd><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013279</institution-id><institution>Joint Programming Initiative A healthy diet for a healthy life</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TransMic (project 529051018)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Netea</surname><given-names>Mihai G</given-names></name><name><surname>de Mast</surname><given-names>Quirijn</given-names></name><name><surname>Cavalieri</surname><given-names>Duccio</given-names></name><name><surname>Lionetti</surname><given-names>Paolo</given-names></name><name><surname>Schultze</surname><given-names>Joachim L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Netea</surname><given-names>Mihai G</given-names></name><name><surname>de Mast</surname><given-names>Quirijn</given-names></name><name><surname>van der Ven</surname><given-names>Andre J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Radboud Revolving Research Funds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Temba</surname><given-names>Godfrey S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019899</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vadaq</surname><given-names>Nadira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Spinoza Prize NWO SPI94-212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Netea</surname><given-names>Mihai G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced grant 833247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Netea</surname><given-names>Mihai G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC2151 390873048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Netea</surname><given-names>Mihai G</given-names></name><name><surname>Schultze</surname><given-names>Joachim L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comparing the inflammatory proteome of healthy Tanzanian and Dutch adults highlights a pro-inflammatory phenotype and metabolic differences in Tanzanians, with the potential role of food-derived metabolites in driving inflammation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human immune response is tightly regulated by a complex and intricate network of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other immuno-metabolic mediators. Prolonged dysregulation of this network may result in an unresolved pro-inflammatory state, which is central to the development of a wide range of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, rheumatic and inflammatory bowel diseases, and even malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moore and Tabas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seyedsadjadi and Grant, 2021</xref>). The inflammatory response is highly variable among healthy individuals as a consequence of genetic and non-genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodin and Davis, 2017</xref>). These include intrinsic factors such as age and sex, as well as environmental exposures such as diet and past infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liston et al., 2021</xref>). Not surprisingly, variation in inflammatory proteins between populations has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schutte et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schutte et al., 2006</xref>). Understanding the nature of this variation and the factors involved is key for understanding the dynamics of infectious as well as immune-mediated pathology across populations.</p><p>Worldwide, many communities are currently undergoing a rapid urbanization process with a transition of lifestyle, and diet, characterized by a more sedentary lifestyle and a shift from traditional high-fiber diets to a diet richer in processed foods, animal fat and simple carbohydrates. Also, environmental exposures change from close contact with animals and smoke from burning wood to petrol gasses. This is accompanied by an epidemiologic transition in which the burden of disease shifts from infectious diseases to NCDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaglehole et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Unwin et al., 2010</xref>). This epidemiologic transition is at least partly mediated through effects on the immune system of individuals across communities. We recently reported that urban-living Tanzanians display a pro-inflammatory gene signature and higher ex-vivo cytokine responses compared to rural-living individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Temba et al., 2021</xref>) and that food-derived metabolites are an important driver of this difference. In communities in sub-Saharan Africa, this effect may also be more pronounced than in other populations, as the historically high burden of infectious diseases may have resulted in the selection of genotypes favoring a robust immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karlsson et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, we recently showed important differences in the genetic regulation of cytokine responses between healthy Tanzanian and Dutch individuals, with enrichment of interferon pathways in the Tanzanians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boahen et al., 2022</xref>). In a context with a declining burden of infectious diseases, alongside a shift to an unhealthy Western-type lifestyle, such a heritable pro-inflammatory phenotype may particularly drive a health-to-disease transition with the onset of NCDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bickler et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Studies on non-Western populations outside historically wealthy countries are underrepresented in systems-immunology literature, despite the fact that these populations are representative of the majority of the worldâ€™s population. In addition, these populations offer unique opportunities to increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of NCDs, including the role of diet and environmental exposures. Our present knowledge of the regulation of the immune system in individuals in sub-Saharan Africa and how this compares to individuals in the industrialized world is limited. We investigated the hypothesis that healthy individuals in East Africa have a pro-inflammatory phenotype in comparison to individuals from North-western Europe and that these differences are partly driven by common environmental factors, including diet. Using a 92-plex proteomic panel based on a proximity extension assay technology, we compared the inflammatory proteome of healthy Tanzanians of African origin residing in Tanzania with that of healthy individuals of Western-European ancestry living in the Netherlands. Next, we studied associations between the proteome with intrinsic factors and environmental exposures, with special emphasis on the food-derived metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Demographics</title><p>Data from plasma samples of 318 Tanzanian and 416 Dutch individuals were included in this study.

measured simultaneously in samples from the Tanzanian and Dutch participants using the Olink â€˜inflammationâ€™ panel, which targets 92 cytokines, chemokines and other inflammation and metabolism-related proteins (Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Relative protein concentrations are reported as normalized protein expression (NPX) units, which are on a Log2 scale. Eighteen proteins were excluded from further analysis because their value was below the lower limit of detection in more than 25% of samples in both cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 2</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the remaining 74 proteins revealed a clear separation between Tanzanian and Dutch samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A volcano plot of differentially expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) showed that 35 (47%) proteins were significantly higher in the Tanzanians and 20 (27%) lower at an FDR p&lt;0.05, with correction for age and sex and BMI. The most prominently (fold change (FC)) upregulated proteins were two regulators of metabolism: the mTOR substrate and translational repressor 4E-BP1 (log<sub>2</sub> FC 1.9; FDR p=1.3 Ã— 10<sup>â€“60</sup>) and FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21; log<sub>2</sub> FC 1.3; p=1.3 Ã— 10<sup>â€“30</sup>), a hormone produced by the liver that functions as a major regulator of glucose and lipid homeostasis. Obesity and excess carbohydrate and/or insufficient protein intake were reported to increase FGF21 concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>). Other prominently upregulated proteins in the Tanzanians were interleukin (IL)â€“17 A (log<sub>2</sub> FC 0.7; p=9.6 Ã— 10<sup>â€“34</sup>) and IL-17C (log<sub>2</sub> FC 0.7; p=1.1 Ã— 10<sup>â€“74</sup>), and the CC-chemokine family members CCL11/eotaxin (eosinophil chemoattractant; log<sub>2</sub> FC 0.7; p=7.3 Ã— 10<sup>â€“63</sup>), CCL3/MIP-1Î± (macrophage inflammatory protein-1Î±; log<sub>2</sub> FC 0.6; p=5.6 Ã— 10<sup>â€“10</sup>), CCL7/MCP3 (monocyte chemotactic protein 3; log<sub>2</sub> FC 0.6; p=7.4 Ã— 10<sup>â€“42</sup>) and CCL8/MCP2 (log<sub>2</sub> FC 0.5; p=8.4 Ã— 10<sup>â€“23</sup>). The cytokines Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18, as well as oncostatin-M (OSM) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) were also significantly higher in the Tanzanians.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed inflammatory protein profiles among Dutch and Tanzanian participants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis depicting the sample distribution of Dutch (N=416) vs. Tanzanian (N=318) healthy individuals across PC1 and PC2, indicating significant differences in the inflammatory protein profiles of the two cohorts.

ST1A1 is a cytosolic sulfotransferase that catalyzes the sulfonation of endogenous and exogenous compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). AXIN1 is a negative regulator of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kikuchi, 1999</xref>).

In high-income countries, age is a potent driver of immune variation with a shift toward a pro-inflammatory state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">BrÃ¼Ã¼nsgaard and Pedersen, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferrucci et al., 2005</xref>).

We postulated that diet also explained part of the variation in inflammatory proteins. To test this hypothesis, we selected food-derived metabolites (n=288) from an untargeted plasma metabolome, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Temba et al., 2021</xref>).

Among the Tanzanians, food-derived metabolites were identified as an important driver of variation in inflammation-related proteins, emphasizing the potential importance of lifestyle changes.</p><p>In the same European and African cohorts, we recently showed remarkable differences in the genetic regulation of immune responses, with ancestry-specific pathways regulating induced cytokine responses and significant enrichment of the interferon pathway in the Tanzanians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boahen et al., 2022</xref>). From a historical perspective, the natural selection of genotypes that mediate a strong inflammatory response offers an obvious advantage in areas with a high infectious diseases burden such as sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, epigenetic regulation as a conduit that mirrors environmental exposure (e.g. diet, lifestyle or exposure to infectious diseases) may also promote an inflammatory signature. However, while a strong inflammatory response can be advantageous in the hostâ€™s response against infections, it may become disadvantageous when the environment changes with a reduction in the infectious burden and a shift toward an unhealthy lifestyle. Many areas in sub-Saharan Africa are currently witnessing such changes and this is one of the important drivers of the rapid increase in non-communicable diseases and other inflammation-associated pathologies.</p><p>A healthy diet is an important component of a healthy lifestyle. In the present study, we show that Tanzanians who consumed more traditional staple foods, such as ugali (porridge made from maize or millet) or plantain, as well as green vegetables, had lower concentrations of inflammation-related proteins. We also observed several significant associations between food-derived metabolites and inflammatory proteins. Specifically, plant-derived polyphenols were negatively associated with members of the MCP and CXCL families. Especially gallic acid, a natural phenic acid with different health benefits, which is present in mangos and other edible plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2021</xref>), had different negative associations with immune-derived proteins. These data confirm our earlier findings that diet has an important impact on cytokine responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Temba et al., 2021</xref>) as well as plasmatic coagulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Temba et al., 2022</xref>). Traditional foods, particularly plant-based diets, are increasingly recognized for their cardiovascular health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hemler and Hu, 2019</xref>), and our findings support the notion that promoting traditional diets may be a viable public health strategy for curbing the NCDs epidemic. Other environmental exposures may potentially confound the diet-inflammation associations, for example, individuals with a traditional diet may also use more frequently a pit latrine or smoky fuels and may have more infections, but we found no significant associations between inflammatory proteins and any of these other environmental exposures.</p><p>An interesting observation was the limited number of associations between advancing age and inflammation-related proteins in the Tanzanians. In historically wealthy countries, aging is associated with a blunted response of immune cells to stimulation, while having a chronic low-inflammation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yashin and Jazwinski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liberale et al., 2020</xref>), as also observed in Dutch in this study. Cytokine responses decline in the Tanzanians with advancing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Temba et al., 2021</xref>), similar to Europeans, but the reasons why systemic inflammation does not increase remain uncertain. Possible explanations are the already present inflammatory signature at a younger age, possibly because of higher cumulative exposure to infections or other environmental insults, or that older participants in Tanzania manage to control the inflammatory state by a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>The two most upregulated proteins in the Tanzanians, 4E-BP1 and FGF21, are regulators of metabolism. FGF21 has received much attention recently as an endocrine regulator of glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>). FGF21 is an insulin sensitizer, and its secretion is increased by a high intake of carbohydrates and low dietary protein intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maekawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundsgaard et al., 2017</xref>). FGF21 inhibits age-associated metabolic syndrome and protects against diabetic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). FGF21, therefore, acts differently from classic energy balance signals like leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>). Traditional Tanzanian diets are high in carbohydrates and low in proteins, which may explain the high FGF21 among the Tanzanians. FGF21 was also reported to be higher in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), but we did not find an association with BMI. Tanzanians also had higher leptin and lower adiponectin concentrations than the Dutch. This is in line with the results of an earlier study among non-obese and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes in Tanzania and Sweden, which showed that leptin concentrations were 50% higher in the Tanzanians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2004</xref>). This supports the importance of potential ethnic differences in metabolic profiles and adipocytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mente et al., 2010</xref>). To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare FGF21 levels between healthy individuals from sub-Saharan Africa and Europe.</p><p>Another interesting finding was the significant differences in CDCP1 and AXIN1, pointing towards an enhanced activity of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway in the Tanzanians. The Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway is a key regulator of inflammation, playing a role in both the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma and Hottiger, 2016</xref>). Dysregulated activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway is increasingly recognized to play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, metabolic inflammatory diseases and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jridi et al., 2020</xref>). Mice fed on a high-fat Western-type diet expressed high concentrations of Wnt2 protein in atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting that the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway also contributes to atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The resolution of inflammation is typically coordinated by key lipids, proteins, and peptides (such as annexin, lipoxins, and resolvins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Headland and Norling, 2015</xref>). It would be interesting to examine whether a decrease in the production of these endogenous mediators by immune cells could potentially contribute to the pro-inflammatory phenotype observed in the Tanzanians.</p><p>To summarize, our findings reveal significant differences in inflammatory and metabolic proteins and pathways between healthy individuals living in East Africa and individuals living in Western Europe. This is especially important in light of the current epidemiological transition and lifestyle changes in sub-Saharan Africa, which coincides with a sharp increase in non-communicable diseases in the region. Our study also endorses the importance of including underrepresented populations in systems-immunology studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design and population</title><p>The present study used samples from two cross-sectional cohorts of healthy volunteers: the 300-Tanzania-FG (300TZFG) and the Dutch 500FG. Both cohorts were enrolled within the Human Functional Genomics Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org">https://www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org</ext-link>). The demographic characteristics of both cohorts have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Temba et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ter Horst et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, the 300TZFG cohort consists of 323 healthy Tanzanian individuals aged between 18 and 65 years residing in the Kilimanjaro region in Northern Tanzania. The cohort was enrolled between March and December 2017. Exclusion criteria were participants with any acute or chronic disease, use of antibiotics or anti-malaria medication in the three months before blood sampling, tuberculosis in the past year, a blood pressure â‰¤90/60 mmHg or â‰¥140/90 mmHg, or random blood glucose &gt;8.0 mmol/L. Pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding females were excluded. The 500FG cohort consists of 534 Dutch individuals of Western-European background, aged 18 years and older. Data was collected between August 2013 and December 2014 at the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) in the Netherlands. Exclusion criteria were: the use of any medication in the past month and acute or chronic diseases at the time of blood sampling. Pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding females were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sample collection and preparation</title><p>The current study is part of the Human Functional Genomics Project (HFGP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://humanfunctionalgenomics.org/">humanfunctionalgenomics.org</ext-link>), which employs standardized procedures for sample collection, handling, and pre-processing. Blood was obtained in the morning via antecubital puncture into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes (Monoject; Covidien, Ireland). Within two to three hours after blood collection, plasma was collected by centrifugation at 3800 rpm for 8 min at room temperature. The obtained plasma were stored at âˆ’80 Â°C, as recommended by the ISBER biobanking organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia et al., 2014</xref>). Plasma samples for the Tanzania cohort were shipped to the Netherlands on dry ice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Inflammatory proteome</title><p>Plasma proteins were measured with the Olink 92 Inflammation panel using proximity extension technology (Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assarsson et al., 2014</xref>). This panel includes 92 inflammation-related proteins. This assay utilizes the binding of target proteins by paired oligonucleotide antibody probes, followed by hybridization and amplification. Data are reported as normalized protein expression values (NPX), which is an arbitrary unit in a Log2 scale that is calculated from normalized Ct values. Validation data of the assay are available on the Olink website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.olink.com">https://www.olink.com</ext-link>). All samples were measured in the same batch in a single run. Proteins were excluded from analysis when values were both below the detection limit in more than 25% of all samples. Plasma samples from the Tanzanian and Dutch cohorts were on their first and second freeze-thawed cycles, respectively. Pre-analytical processing such as freeze-thawed cycles and storage time has limited influence on the measured proteins reported in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enroth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Measurement of the circulating inflammatory mediators</title><p>Plasma concentrations of the cytokines IL-6, IL-1Î², IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-18 (lot number Bio-Tech/R&amp;D; SPCKC-PS-001559) and IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BPa) (lot number Bio-Tech/R&amp;D; SPCKB-PS-000502) were measured in EDTA plasma using the Simple Plex cartridges run on the Ella platform (Protein Simple, San Jose, USA) following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Plasma metabolome</title><p>Plasma samples of the Tanzanian cohort were measured using the untargeted metabolomics workflow by General Metabolics (Boston, MA) with procedures as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuhrer et al., 2011</xref>). In short, metabolites were measured by a high throughput mass spectrometry technique using the Agilent Series 1100 LC pump coupled to a Gerstel MPS2 autosampler and the Agilent 6520 Series Quadrupole Time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Our non-targeted high-throughput method relies on flow injection and does not involve separation of compounds based on an LC gradient. This is because many different species would be fragmented simultaneously. Historically, the decision to collect high-accuracy flow injection has been a technological trade-off to enable efficient analysis of large cohorts. Therefore, metabolites detected in the high-throughput non-targeted metabolomics screening method, which enables the screening of these large cohorts for metabolomic feature patterns, are based on accurate mass (approximately 1 ppm accuracy) and natural isotope detection consistent with the assigned formulae; final assignments are pending validation with LC-MS/MS. For this study, the MS spectra files (accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metaboLights/MTBLS2267">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metaboLights/MTBLS2267</ext-link>) contain 70 scans, each of which contains the full MS1 profile data from m/z 50â€“1050 for two subsequent injections from the same needle draw of any given sample. The analytical method and approach to data processing and annotation were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuhrer et al., 2011</xref>). The selection of food-derived metabolites was performed based on the ontology given in the HMDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hmdb.ca/">https://www.hmdb.ca/</ext-link>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Temba et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The proteomic data from the Dutch and Tanzanian cohorts were normalized using inter-plate controls for batch variation correction and presented in the log<sub>2</sub> scale. Normalizing for batch effects was done using pooled plasma standards on all plates. Eight samples of plasma pool controls were measured in each cohort (two per plate, a total of 4 plates per cohort). We performed bridging normalization based on median differences between plasma pool controls in the 300TZFG and 500FG cohorts. The following steps were applied for each protein: (1) Determine the median value from the eight bridging samples for each protein in the 300TZFG and 500FG cohort. (2) Calculate the median differences (300TZFG-500FG) as median differences X. (3) Take the NXP values of each protein in the 300TZFG cohort and subtract the median difference (the X value). This created a normalized data set for the 300TZFG cohort.</p><p>Data values below the limit of detection (LOD) were handled using the actual measured values to increase the statistical power and give a complete data distribution. Outliers detection were done using principal component analysis (PCA) in which data points that fall in more than 3 standard deviations from the mean of principal component one (PC1) and two (PC2) were excluded. This pre-analytical process led to exclusion of 12 participants (N=7 Dutch and N=5 Tanzanians) as potential outliers. Proteins with &gt;25% data values below LOD in both cohorts were excluded (N=18 in the Duch and N=20 in the Tanzania cohorts), leaving 74 and 72 inflammatory proteins for the downstream data analysis in the Dutch and Tanzanian cohorts respectively. In total, 416 Dutch and 318 Tanzania participants were available after the pre-analytical process. Details of preanalytical steps for both cohorts are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>To analyze the similarities and dissimilarities between the samples, unsupervised PCA was performed using 'prcomp' function in R package. Heatmap of unsupervised hierarchical clustering (k-nearest neighbors with 100 repetitions) of the samples was generated using 'ComplexHeatmap' R package by calculating the matrix of Euclidean distances from the log<sub>2</sub> NPX value. Limma (linear models for microarray data) R package was used for differential expression analysis of plasma inflammatory proteins between cohorts. Proteins with adjusted P-value (FDR)&lt;0.05 were selected as significantly differentially expressed (DE). Proteins with a positive and negative value of log<sub>2</sub>-fold-change were considered as upregulated and downregulated, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Ethical statementThe study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College (CRERC) (No 2443) and the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol. IX/2290 and NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol.IX/3318) in Tanzania.

research, i.e., the variability of different populations which have different genetic backgrounds and are exposed to different diets and environments. As most research is carried out in developed countries, we need to understand and generate background data in other populations, such as the described here in Tanzania. The fundamental findings refer to enhanced pro-inflammatory phenotype in plasma of individuals from Tanzania as compared to individuals from Holland. Food-derived metabolites were identified as a driver of variation in inflammation-related molecule expression. Whether pro-inflammatory phenotypes associate with changes in life span or risk of chronic disease and whether changes in life style will reverse this pro-inflammatory phenotype and related outcomes clearly deserve further investigation in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82297.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Teixeira</surname><given-names>Mauro Martins</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0176yjw32</institution-id><institution>Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais</institution></institution-wrap><country>Brazil</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.08.23.504992">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.23.504992v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers and I found the manuscript interesting and important. Both reviewers would like to see some validation of findings â€“ either ex vivo, in vivo or in different populations. This may be a little beyond the scope of the current study (as it would need large patient cohorts or significant clinical studies) but needs to be discussed in some detail. Whenever possible, validation should be performed, as suggested by reviewers.</p><p>2) There is a need to clarify some relevant methodological issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>â€“ The proteomic data were normalized for batch effect. The authors should describe in detail the batch correction method.</p><p>â€“ The authors should correlate the inflammatory proteome with the common genetic variations described in a previous manuscript for the same cohorts (Boahen et al., 2022).</p><p>â€“ Circulating proteins related to the mTOR pathway and metabolism, such as 4EBP1 and FGF21, were differentially regulated. Moreover, AXIN1 and CDCP1, associated with the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway, were regulated. The authors should validate the differential expression of these pathways by looking at other targets in the two cohorts using orthogonal techniques.</p><p>â€“The dysregulation of mTOR and Wnt/Î²-catenin pathways should be evaluated upon food-borne metabolite treatment.

The authors should describe in detail the batch correction method.</p></disp-quote><p>We now describe the normalization for batch effect in detail in the methods section under statistical analysis, page 20; lines 320-327. Normalizing for batch effects was done using pooled plasma standards on all plates. Eight samples of plasma pool controls were measured in each cohort (two per plate, a total of 4 plates per cohort). We performed bridging normalization based on median differences between plasma pool controls in the 300TZFG and 500FG cohorts. The following steps were applied for each protein: (1) Determine the median value from the eight bridging samples for each protein in the 300TZFG and 500FG cohort. (2) Calculate the median differences (300TZFG-500FG) as median differences X. (3) Take the NXP values of each protein in the 300TZFG cohort and subtract the median difference (the X value). This created a normalized data set for the 300TZFG cohort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“ The authors should correlate the inflammatory proteome with the common genetic variations described in a previous manuscript for the same cohorts (Boahen et al., 2022).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In our previous manuscript (Boahen et al., 2022), we studied the genetic variations of whole-blood cytokine responses to a range of microbial and synthetic ligands. We used the top six independent SNP-cytokine loci identified in this previous paper and performed matrix pQTL analysis to determine an association with the protein expression levels. As shown in the table, we found several associations, but none of these reached genome-wide (P&lt;5X10<sup>-8</sup>) or suggestive (P&lt;5X10<sup>-6</sup>) significance, possibly due to the limited sample size of our cohort.</p><p>We have included this information in the text (page 9; lines 107-112) and we included the table as a Table S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“ Circulating proteins related to the mTOR pathway and metabolism, such as 4EBP1 and FGF21, were differentially regulated. Moreover, AXIN1 and CDCP1, associated with the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway, were regulated. The authors should validate the differential expression of these pathways by looking at other targets in the two cohorts using orthogonal techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to validate the differential expression of these proteins and pathways using whole blood transcriptomics data, but we encountered challenges with comparability between the cohorts. Therefore, we were unable to validate the differences between the Tanzanian and Dutch cohorts using orthogonal techniques. However, we were able to confirm the significance of these pathways in relation to traditional versus westernized diet, as described in the following comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“The dysregulation of mTOR and Wnt/Î²-catenin pathways should be evaluated upon food-borne metabolite treatment. This validation can be performed in ex vivo and in vivo models.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the comment, we utilized preliminary data from a proof-of-concept dietary intervention study that was conducted in the same region in Tanzania (ISCRTN15619939). To validate the importance of these pathways, we analyzed data from 23 young, healthy males residing in an urban area who underwent a 2-week dietary switch from a westernized to a traditional Tanzanian, high-fiber, plant-based diet. Using the same Olink proteomics platform, we observed a significant reduction in plasma levels of proteins associated with the mTOR pathway, including 4E-BP1 (Î² coeff. -1.87; <italic>P</italic> = 0.003) and FGF-19 (Î² coeff. -1.253; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001). Additionally, we noticed a trend towards a reduction in the Wnt/ Î² -catenin signaling protein AXIN1 (Î² coeff. -0.555; <italic>P</italic> = 0.063), while CDCP1 levels remained unchanged (Î² coeff. 0.049; <italic>P</italic> = 0.464). We have included these findings on page 12; lines 166-175.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“ From the Materials and methods section, the identification of metabolites was based on accurate mass.

Fragmentation spectra should be shown to validate the identifications of food-borne metabolites.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion and have now provided a detailed description of the metabolite measurement method in the methods section. Our non-targeted high-throughput method relies on flow injection and does not involve separation of compounds based on an LC gradient. This is because many different species would be fragmented simultaneously. Historically, the decision to collect high-accuracy flow injection has been a technological trade-off to enable efficient analysis of large cohorts. Therefore, metabolites detected in the high-throughput non-targeted metabolomics screening method, which enables the screening of these large cohorts for metabolomic feature patterns, are based on accurate mass (approximately 1 ppm accuracy) and natural isotope detection consistent with the assigned formulae; final assignments are pending validation with LC-MS/MS. For this study, the MS spectra files (accessible at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metaboLights/MTBLS2267) contain 70 scans, each of which contains the full MS1 profile data from m/z 50 to 1050 for two subsequent injections from the same needle draw of any given sample.</p><p>We have incorporated this information into the method section of the revised manuscript (page 19; lines 296-308), and we have updated Figure 4 to include the putatively annotated food-borne metabolites with their formulas next to them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study that has potential broad impact if the findings can be reproduced in additional cohorts.
