metabolites in plants. These transporters, many of which are sodium-coupled, have been shown to use an elevator mechanism of transport, but exactly how substrate binding is coupled to sodium ion binding and transport is not clear. Here, we solve the crystal structure at 2.3 Å of a transporter from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (ASBT<sub>NM</sub>) in complex with pantoate, a potential substrate of ASBT<sub>NM</sub>. The BASS family is characterised by two helices that cross-over in the centre of the protein in an arrangement that is intricately held together by two sodium ions. We observe that the pantoate binds, specifically, between the N-termini of two of the opposing helices in this cross-over region. During molecular dynamics simulations the pantoate remains in this position when sodium ions are present but is more mobile in their absence. Comparison of structures in the presence and absence of pantoate demonstrates that pantoate elicits a conformational change in one of the cross-over helices. This modifies the interface between the two domains that move relative to one another to elicit the elevator mechanism. These results have implications, not only for ASBT<sub>NM</sub> but for the BASS family as a whole and indeed other transporters that work through the elevator mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bile acid symporters</kwd><kwd>sodium-coupled transport</kwd><kwd>elevator mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM118772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name><name><surname>Naughton</surname><given-names>Fiona</given-names></name><name><surname>Beckstein</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P010393/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brotherton</surname><given-names>Deborah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The putative substrate pantoate binds to a sodium-coupled secondary transporter of the bile acid sodium symporter family, with sodium-dependent binding and conformational changes consistent with an elevator mechanism of transport.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The bile acid sodium symporter (BASS) family of secondary transporters is synonymous with its founding members, the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) and the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geyer et al., 2006</xref>). These proteins harness the sodium ion gradient to transport bile acids across the plasma membranes of enterocytes of the terminal ileum and hepatocytes, respectively. They are both targets of drugs currently in the clinic; ASBT as the target of drugs to alleviate chronic constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karpen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khanna and Camilleri, 2021</xref>) and NTCP as a target for hepatitis B and D virus entry inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wedemeyer et al., 2023</xref>). Both proteins also influence drug distribution. The BASS family, however, transports a wide array of substrates other than bile acids. In mammals, the sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT) transports sulphated steroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grosser et al., 2013</xref>) and others are putative neurotransmitter transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burger et al., 2011</xref>). In plants sodium-coupled BASS transporters transport small metabolites such as pyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furumoto et al., 2011</xref>) and glycolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">South et al., 2017</xref>) across the plastidial membrane.</p><p>The first detailed structural information on the BASS transporters came through crystal structures of two bacterial transporters, one from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (ASBT<sub>NM</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2011</xref>) and one from <italic>Yersinia frederiksinii</italic> (ASBT<sub>YF</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Though neither protein is likely to transport bile acids physiologically, in vitro both transporters have been shown to catalyse the sodium-dependent transport of the bile acid taurocholate (TCH) and have provided an initial structural framework through which the extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies carried out on ASBT and NTCP could be mapped. The bacterial transporters are built from 10 transmembrane helices, with a twofold inverted repeat arranged in two domains, a core domain, and a panel domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The core domain is characterised by two extended helices that cross over at the centre with residues within the extended region contributing to two sodium ion binding sites (Na1 and Na2). The residues forming the sodium binding site in ASBT<sub>NM</sub> are conserved in many members of the BASS family including ASBT and NTCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). ASBT<sub>NM</sub> was crystallised in the presence of TCH and this bile acid is observed to bind in an inward-facing cavity between the core and panel domains in a binding mode that remains stable during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alhadeff et al., 2015</xref>). Secondary transporters function by the alternating access mechanism in which conformational changes to the transporter enable the substrate binding site to switch between the opposing sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beckstein and Naughton, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>). The structure of ASBT<sub>YF</sub> was solved in both an inward-facing state, similar to ASBT<sub>NM</sub>, and an outward-facing state. Based on these structures an elevator-type model of transport was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). In such mechanisms it is expected that the substrate binds to one domain, which moves with respect to another so that the substrate can be carried across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>). In the ASBT<sub>NM</sub> structure, however, the position of the TCH is not entirely consistent with such a model, as though there are specific interactions only with residues of the core domain, the TCH is not primarily embedded within that domain and is not set as deeply within the cleft as might be expected. This may be partly due to the protein binding to the inward-facing state of the protein where the substrate should be released, but it is also likely that the bile acids do not bind optimally to the bacterial transporters. More recently, structures of human NTCP have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asami et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goutam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2022</xref>). Though NTCP lacks the first transmembrane helix of the bacterial transporters, the overall fold of the proteins is the same and similar conformations of outward- and inward-facing states consistent with an elevator mechanism of transport are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2022</xref>). The structure of NTCP was also solved with glyco-chenodeoxycholic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). In this structure two molecules of the bile acid are observed binding to the protein with weak interactions to the core domain. The unusual binding modes led the authors of this paper to propose an alternative to the classical alternating access mechanism that involves the binding of two substrates, only one of which is transported in each cycle. To gain further insight into the mechanism of BASS family of transporters, and in particular the 10-transmembrane helix transporters, we therefore sought to find a likely substrate for the bacterial transporters that would enable us to understand how substrates bind.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of ASBT<sub>NM</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of ASBT<sub>NM</sub> in complex with taurocholate ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2011</xref>).

PanS has been implicated in the transport of the coenzyme A precursors, ketopantoate, and pantoate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ernst and Downs, 2015</xref>). ASBT<sub>NM</sub> and ASBT<sub>YF</sub> are also similar to BASS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and it has been shown that BASS1 from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> can transport pantoate, at least in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore decided to investigate whether the coenzyme A precursors would also bind to ASBT<sub>NM</sub>.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that pantoate, but not ketopantoate or pantothenate, binds to ASBT<sub>NM</sub>. We solve the crystal structure of the protein in complex with pantoate and show that the pantoate makes specific interactions with residues in the cross-over region of the protein consistent with the elevator mechanism of transport. MD shows that this binding mode is more stable when sodium ions are present in their respective binding sites. Binding of pantoate causes a subtle conformational change within the core region of the protein, which may trigger the more widespread movements of the protein that would enable transport to occur. This suggests a more specific mechanism for ASBT<sub>NM</sub>, much more in line with the classical alternating access model of transport, than has recently been suggested for NTCP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pantoate binds to ASBT<sub>NM</sub></title><p>To assess whether pantoate and its derivatives are likely substrates for ASBT<sub>NM</sub>, we first used a dye-based stability assay in which stability is used as a surrogate for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexandrov et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas pantoate stabilised the protein to a similar amount to TCH, neither ketopantoate nor pantothenate had any effect under the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Crystals were grown using the in meso method of crystallisation and the structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined at a resolution of 2.3 Å (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Density consistent with pantoate, and sodium ions in both ion binding sites is evident in the resulting maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). There is also evidence of a lipid-like molecule within the binding site. The transporter adopts an inward-facing conformation as seen for the structure of ASBT<sub>NM</sub> with TCH present (ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub>; 3ZUX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2011</xref>) and the two structures can be superposed with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.6 Å for 263 out of 308 C<sub>α</sub> atoms within 2 Å after superposition (see Materials and methods). The most substantial difference in the conformation of the two structures is seen for TM1. In the ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> structure, TM1 bounds one side of the crevice between the panel and core domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this structure the helix is kinked at residue Thr 14 so that it splays out and enlarges the cavity on the inward-facing side of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub> structure TM1 is still kinked although the whole helix has moved as an approximate rigid body by ~75° pivoting around Ile 11 such that residues 1–10 move over the cytoplasmic entrance to the cavity to partially occlude it from the inward-facing side, and residues 12–28 move away from TM10.

The carboxylic acid of the pantoate interacts with the main chain nitrogen atoms of Thr 112 and Ala 113 of TM4b and the 2-hydroxyl oxygen is within hydrogen bonding distance of the main chain nitrogen of Gly 267 of TM9b and the amino oxygen of Asn 265. The hydroxyl oxygen of the methyl-propanol moiety also interacts with His 294 and Asn 295, which reside on TM10. These residues are all within the core domain. The closest residues to the pantoate on the panel domain are Ile 203 and Ile 47 that interact with the methyl-propanol moiety. The sodium ion binding sites in ASBT<sub>NM</sub> are also located at the cross-over region of the two helices, behind the pantoate when viewed from the crevice between the core and panel domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The ions are clearly defined in the electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and there is very little change in their coordination in the ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub> structure with respect to that of ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Within the region of the sodium and pantoate binding sites the most obvious change in the pantoate-bound structure relative to ASBT <sub>NM(TCH)</sub> is that the main chain nitrogen of Thr 112 is displaced by ~1 Å and the C<sub>γ</sub> by 2.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In fact, there is a slight movement of the whole of TM4b, which includes the sodium ion ligands, Ser 114 and Asn 115, towards the pantoate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). On the panel domain Ile 203, located at the centre of TM7, is also displaced slightly (~1.2 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>) enabling the pantoate to be accommodated easily. The conformational change of TM1 may be triggered by this displacement given that Ile 203 would clash with Phe 15 if TM1 had adopted the same conformation as in ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structure of ASBT<sub>NM</sub> without substrate</title><p>Given that the subtle conformational changes between the pantoate and TCH-bound structures would be consistent with mechanistic changes upon substrate binding, with ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> representing a non-substrate bound structure, we also solved the structure without TCH or pantoate present (ASBT<sub>NM(ns)</sub>) at 2.1 Å using the in meso method of crystallisation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Overall, ASBT<sub>NM(ns)</sub> is very similar to ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> with an RMSD of 0.5 Å for 293 out of 308 C<sub>α</sub> atoms (see Materials and methods) and an almost identical coordination of the sodium ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). There are only two regions where there are slightly larger changes. The first, again, centres on TM1. However, the change is much more subtle than to the pantoate-bound structure, pivoting ~15° at Thr 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The second is in the loop between TM5 and TM6, which links the core to the panel domain where the loop takes a conformation more similar to that seen in the ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub> structure. In flexing between the inward- and outward-facing structures, as reported for ASBT<sub>YF</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), this loop changes conformation as it allows the panel to move with respect to the core. Overall, therefore, it appears that the binding of pantoate, rather than either the absence of TCH or the difference in crystallisation method, causes the change in position of TM4b.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Structure of ASBT<sub>NM</sub> without pantoate or taurocholate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of ASBT<sub>NM(ns)</sub> (wheat) on ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> (pale green) highlighting the similarity of the two structures.

Firstly, we mutated the two residues for which the side chains are within hydrogen bonding distance of the pantoate in the ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub> structure and tested the affinity of pantoate for the resultant proteins by ITC. Whereas the mutation of Asn 265 to alanine caused the binding of pantoate to be abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), mutation of Thr 112 to either valine or alanine surprisingly resulted in an increase in affinity to 87 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and 11 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) respectively, though noticeably the latter was entropy driven. Secondly, because much of the molecular recognition involves the main chain atoms, we used a structure-activity relationship approach, testing whether a panel of similar compounds would stabilise the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). None of the compounds tested stabilised the protein as much as pantoate, showing the importance of the hydroxy-acetate group, which interacts with the main chain atoms. Just replacing the hydroxyl oxygen with a ketone as in ketopantoate appears to disrupt binding, likely due to an unfavourable interaction with Asn 265. The only other residues that possess the hydroxy-acetate moiety are isocitrate and D-malate. Both compounds have additional charged groups that may make them less favourable for binding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Characterisation of pantoate binding to mutants of ASBT<sub>NM</sub>.</title><p>Pantoate binding to ASBT<sub>NM</sub> mutants measured by isothermal calorimetry.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89167-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Testing a panel of compounds for potential binding to ASBT<sub>NM</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Compounds were subjected to the stability assay.

Over 0.5 µs of MD simulations, pantoate remains in the crystallographic binding position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). With sodium ions present in both the Na1 and Na2 sites, the hydrogen bonds between pantoate and the main chain nitrogen atoms of T112 and A113 at the N-terminus of TM4b and G267 at the N-terminus of TM9b remain intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) with more fluctuating interactions with the side chain atoms.

The results from the MD simulations demonstrate the importance of the sodium ions in stabilising the binding mode of the pantoate at the N-termini of the cross-over helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and might suggest that the ions structure the region in readiness for substrate binding. This conclusion is supported by the sodium-free wild-type structures of ASBT<sub>YF</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), where the region equivalent to 110–116 in ASBT<sub>NM</sub> and the pantoate interacting residues Thr 112 and Ala 113 adopt varying positions. While it would appear from the MD simulations that the interaction that the pantoate makes with the side chain of Asn 265 is less conserved than those involving the main chain atoms, the mutagenesis studies highlight the importance of the residue in binding. Asn 265 also caps TM4b so could potentially stabilise the structure of the binding site as well as interacting with the substrate.</p><p>The pantoate is firmly nestled within the core domain and the only interactions it makes with the panel domain are van der Waals interactions with Ile 47 and Ile 203. These residues are conserved in PanS and ASBT<sub>YF</sub> but in BASS1 are replaced with a valine and a threonine respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The binding of the pantoate appears to cause a displacement of Ile 203, which in turn displaces Phe 15 on TM1. The novel position of TM1 appears to partly occlude the pantoate in the binding site. It would be tempting to think that the partially occluded conformation we observe here is mechanistic as transporters often go through one or more occluded conformations during their mechanistic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beckstein and Naughton, 2022</xref>). However, while Phe 15 is conserved in PanS, ASTB<sub>YF</sub>, and BASS1, and there is some flexing of this region in ASBT<sub>YF</sub> as the protein changes conformation from outward- to inward-facing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), there is little conservation at the N-terminus amongst the proteins, suggesting that the position of the N-terminus may not be critical for transport.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref> have demonstrated that ASBT<sub>YF</sub> is likely to go through an elevator mechanism as is also observed for other proteins with the same fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ung et al., 2022</xref>). As a sodium-coupled symporter, the pantoate should bind to the outward-facing form of the protein and trigger movement to the inward-facing state where it can be released. Modelling the outward-facing state of the ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub> structure based on the ASBT<sub>YF</sub> structure shows that the pantoate could easily be accommodated in the outward-facing form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The position of the pantoate observed here, therefore, is consistent with an elevator mechanism. It is possible that with the constraints of the membrane, the interaction of Ile 207 with the pantoate as the protein moves to the inward-facing state would trigger the release of the pantoate, rather than resulting in the movement of TM1. In binding the pantoate the position of Thr 112 moves by 2.4 Å (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>). The position of this residue is intriguing because in morphing between the putative outward and inward states of the protein, Thr 112 comes within 2 Å of Met 48 on the panel domain. The interaction between Thr112 and Met48 may, therefore, block the protein from switching conformations. It can be speculated that the movement of the threonine side-chain may unlock the transporter, allowing it to switch from outward- to inward-facing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic of mechanism.</title><p>Pantoate binding to the cross-over region between TM4b and TM9b of the substrate-free structure (<bold>A</bold>) elicits a conformational change in TM4b (red arrow) (<bold>B</bold>).

The sodium binding sites are conserved throughout these BASS transporters with high conservation within the cross-over regions. Each of these molecules would be able to form hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogen atoms of TM4b and TM9b as observed with pantoate. While the pantoate transporter BASS1 contains an asparagine and threonine at the positions of Asn 265 and Thr 112 respectively, in the other BASS transporters these are replaced by serine and glutamine respectively. This may allow the keto-acids to bind. It would be expected, therefore, that a similar mechanism and binding mode may be seen throughout the BASS transporters.</p><p>It also seems plausible that in the human bile acid transporters, the substrate would also form specific interactions with the main chain nitrogen atoms of the cross-over helices. As we observe for pantoate binding to ASBT<sub>NM</sub>, for human ASBT it has been shown that uptake of TCH is abolished when the equivalent of Asn 265 (Asn 266) is mutated to a cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2008</xref>) and increases when Thr 112 (Thr 110 in ASBT<sub>NM</sub>) is changed to the same residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hussainzada et al., 2008</xref>). In NTCP mutation of Asn 262 also abolishes uptake of TCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests there may be some similarity in the mechanisms but exactly how these proteins are able to bind to the wide variety of primary, secondary, and conjugated bile acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grosser et al., 2021</xref>) that have been reported as substrates is difficult to say. Liu and co-workers have modelled two bile acids into density that they observe when they solved the structure of human NTCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). In this structure, while the glycine head group of the bile acid is near to the cross-over helices, the interactions with it are rather weak and the density associated with this moiety is also rather poorly defined. As the authors of this study have pointed out, it is hard to reconcile this binding mode with the conformational changes associated with an elevator mechanism, which others have demonstrated since that paper was submitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2022</xref>). It may well be that the binding mode observed for NTCP is a non-productive mode and a greater interaction with the residues of the cross-over region, linking the sodium ions with substrate binding, will be required to elicit a conformational change. Given that pantoate does not interact with TM1, it seems unlikely that the absence of this helix in the bile acid transporters would affect the elevator mechanism unduly.</p><p>In conclusion the elucidation of pantoate-bound ASBT<sub>NM</sub> provides new insight into the mechanism of the BASS family of transporters. Pantoate binding to the cross-over region of the sodium-bound protein causes subtle changes to Thr 112 and TM4b. Thr 112 is located in the centre of the protein near to the panel domain and its repositioning could unlock the transporter, enabling it to swap between outward- and inward-facing states. In the absence of sodium ions these residues are likely to be more flexible, which may enable the transporter to switch from one conformation to another without requiring the conformational change mediated by the substrate. While the exact binding mode of bile acids in the human proteins remains unclear, the high conservation of residues involved in this area suggests that the interaction with residues on the cross-over region may follow a similar mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Nesseria meningitidis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ASBT<sub>NM</sub></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10450">https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10450</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ASBT<sub>NM</sub></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PWaldo GFPd-3C<break/>(plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hatton et al., 2022</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Modified from original PWaldo GFPd vector<break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1110/ps.051466205">https://doi.org/10.1110/ps.051466205</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lemo21(DE3)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">New England Biolabs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pantoate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Merck Life Science UK</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(R)-Pantoic acid sodium salt</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification</title><p>ASBT<sub>NM</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2011</xref>) was subcloned into a modified version of the expression vector, pWaldo GFPd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drew et al., 2006</xref>) in which the TEV protease site had been altered to a 3C protease recognition site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hatton et al., 2022</xref>).

Such changes would be consistent with a mechanism of sodium driven transport with clear coupling of the sodium ions to substrate translocation.

In Figure 2A, the names are not consistent with the chemical structure. &quot;-ate&quot; denotes when a carboxylic acid is in the deprotonated form, creating a charged carboxylate. What is drawn is pantoic acid, ketopantoic acid, and pantoethenic acid. Less importantly, the wedges and hashes for the methyl group are arguably not appropriate, since the carbon they are attached to is not a chiral center. For the crystallization, this makes no difference, since under near-neutral pKas the carboxylic acid will spontaneously deprotonate, and the carboxylate form will be the most common. However, if the structures in Figure 2A were used for classical molecular simulation, that would be a big problem, since now that would be modeling the much rarer neutral form rather than the charged state. I am reasonably sure based on Figure 5 that the MD correctly modeled the deprotonated form with a carboxylate, but that is inconsistent with Figure 2A. Otherwise, the structure and simulation analysis falls into the mainstream of modern structural biology work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the inconsistency of the protonaNon state in the naming of the molecular structures. Thank you for poinNng this out – though the names represented the predominant form in soluNon, the more aestheNcally pleasing protonated form got the beOer of us in our representaNons. The correct form was used in the MD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1.

I notice that the apo and pantoate structures are crystallized in different space groups. How does this compare to the original TCH structure? Is there any chance that crystal packing is altering the TM1 geometry or loop 1?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot rule out the effect of the crystallisation conditions on the movement of the TM1. We have now solved a number of different structures of ASBTNM and this is the first time we observe TM1 in this conformation. As stated above we have refrained from overplaying the significance of the movement of TM1 to transport, other than to say that some adjustments need to be made to accommodate the pantoate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Pg 3, &quot;... with a 5-fold inverted repeat...&quot;, Should be 2-fold?</p></disp-quote><p>Changed, thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Is there any chance that the MD simulations (even in a reduced form) could be uploaded to Zenodo or a similar repository?</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken up this suggestion and added the information in the paper: MD trajectories in the GROMACS XTC format were deposited in the OSF.io repository under DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/KFDT5 under the open CC-BY Attribution 4.0 International license.
