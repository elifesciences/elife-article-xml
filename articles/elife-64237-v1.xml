the variance of human bone mass, but the contribution of non-genetic factors remains largely unknown. By utilizing maternal/offspring transmission, cohabitation, or fecal material transplantation (FMT) studies, we investigated the influence of the gut microbiome on skeletal maturation. We show that the gut microbiome is a communicable regulator of bone structure and turnover in mice. In addition, we found that the acquisition of a specific bacterial strain, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), a gut microbe that induces intestinal Th17 cell expansion, was sufficient to negatively impact skeletal maturation. These findings have significant translational implications, as the identification of methods or timing of microbiome transfer may lead to the development of bacteriotherapeutic interventions to optimize skeletal maturation in humans. Moreover, the transfer of SFB-like microbes capable of triggering the expansion of human Th17 cells during therapeutic FMT procedures could lead to significant bone loss in fecal material recipients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>bone structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK112946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pacifici</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK108842</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pacifici</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR028009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pacifici</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK098391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Rheinallt M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The gut microbiota is a non-genomic, transmissible regulator of bone volume, structure, and turnover.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis has a devastating impact on quality of life and is a significant cause of disability and morbidity in both women and men. Low bone mineral density (BMD), a key feature of osteoporosis, results from suboptimal skeletal maturation culminating in low peak bone density by 30 years of age, and/or by accelerated bone loss thereafter. Interestingly, there is considerable natural variation in peak BMD within populations, with most of the variation being attributed to genetic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peacock et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estrada et al., 2012</xref>). However, the remaining nongenomic factors that contribute to peak BMD variance remain enigmatic. A well-recognized determinant of phenotypic variability within populations is the composition and community structure of the gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sommer and Bäckhed, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tremaroli and Bäckhed, 2012</xref>). Indeed, studies undertaken in both humans and animals have pointed to the gut microbiome as a potential regulator of skeletal maturation. Among them are the reports that mice raised in germ-free (GF) conditions have altered BMD, bone volume and bone structure compared to conventionally raised (Conv.R) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sjögren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Novince et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwarzer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). Additional evidence showing that the microbiome is a significant regulatory factor for skeletal health include reports that the gut microbiome affects the bone waste induced by estrogen deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>), glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schepper et al., 2020</xref>) and by diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that the presence of the gut microbiota is required for parathyroid hormone (PTH) to stimulate both bone formation and bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2020</xref>). It is also known that antibiotic treatment which depletes the gut microbiome increases bone density in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yan et al., 2016</xref>), while bacterial recolonization post-antibiotic treatment results in bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schepper et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, variations in the composition of the microbiome affect not only BMD, but also bone strength by its actions on bone material properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guss et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Humans are initially colonized by microbes at birth, with the microbiota eventually reaching maturity at about 3 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodríguez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kashtanova et al., 2016</xref>). Thereafter, gut bacterial species are thought to adapt within individual microbiomes enabling their long-term colonization into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Early microbial colonization and microbiota succession is influenced by the maternal microbiota, although a precise measure of the extent to which a mother microbiome is acquired by the offspring has been challenging to ascertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKnite et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, strict vertical inheritance of the gut microbiota is thought not to occur in the human microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groussin et al., 2020</xref>), although recent studies using deep metagenomic microbiome sequencing have reported that in most cases the mother’s dominant strains were transmitted to her child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yassour et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, early gut colonizers, if retained, do have the potential to exert lasting physiological effects on health and disease for most or perhaps all of adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faith et al., 2015</xref>). It is also noteworthy that long lasting modifications to the mature microbiota require substantial interventions, including permanent dietary changes, major changes in the health status of the host, or extensive microbial manipulations such as a long-term course of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lozupone et al., 2012</xref>). Although microbiome sequencing approaches have shown a mother’s dominant strains were transferred to her child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yassour et al., 2018</xref>), few studies have shown that phenotypes elicited by dominant strains are also transferred to offspring. In addition, few studies have demonstrated that phenotypes elicited by strains within microbiomes are transferred by co-habitation. Discovering that phenotypes that have a negative impact on bone health are transferred within the microbiome would also identify a window of opportunity for intervention with the ultimate goal of promoting the optimal skeletal development.</p><p>An example of a gut microbe that elicits a salient and tractable phenotype is segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which are spore-forming, Gram-positive commensal bacteria. In the mouse, SFB drive the development and expansion of Th17 cells that are produced and reside in the intestinal lamina propria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaboriau-Routhiau et al., 2009</xref>). Th17 cells are an osteoclastogenic population of CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miossec et al., 2009</xref>) defined by their capacity to produce IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of SFB in the intestine of healthy mice leads to lower bone density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hathaway-Schrader et al., 2020</xref>), which occurs via SFB-driven expansion of Th17 cells in the gut, migration of Th17 cells to the bone marrow (BM), and increased secretion of IL-17 in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2020</xref>). These observations are a well-characterized mechanism of how a gut microbe can act as a modulator of a host phenotype, in this case the skeletal response. These observations also offer a powerful model to establish proof of principle that phenotypes are transmitted within the microbiome. Pertaining to relevance to public health, in humans, about twenty non-virulent gut bacterial strains are known to induce Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atarashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). If any of the human microbiome-residing Th17 cell-inducing bacteria are transmitted from a mother to her child, then they may turn out to be a significant influencer of, or an impediment to the child’s skeletal development. Furthermore, the approach of fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) from healthy donors to patient with diseases such as p<italic>seudomembranous colitis</italic> of the large intestine due to an overgrowth of Clostridioides is increasingly practiced. The transfer <italic>of</italic> gut microbes that expand Th17 cells in the gut of recipients during FMT may lead to lower bone density, particularly in the context of hyperparathyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). These observations underscore an exigent need to discover if bone phenotypes are communicable with the transfer of gut microbes between individuals.</p><p>With this goal, in this study we assessed the role of gut microbiota as a transmissible influencer of skeletal development and homeostasis. Using gnotobiotic murine models of early microbiome establishment through maternal contacts or cohabitation, we show that skeletal phenotypes are transferable within the fecal microbiome. We also show that the transfer from the mother to offspring of microbes that induce Th17 cell expansion in the gut is a significant negative determinant of bone health structure later in life. Together, our data supports the notion that the gut microbiome acts as a factor that can be transmitted between individuals and elicit significant effects on skeletal development. These findings also identify the acquisition of the microbiome as a window of opportunity for therapeutic interventions to overcome gut microbe-orchestrated suboptimal skeletal maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Maternal microbiome regulates skeletal maturation</title><p>To investigate the extent to which maternal microbiome affects the skeleton of the offspring we made use of two strains of mice, C3H/HeN and C57BL/6 purchased from Taconic biosciences (herein referred to as TAC mice) raised in conventional conditions or GF conditions. C3H/HeN mice have higher indices of bone volume and bone stracture as compared to C57BL/6 mice. Conventional TAC C57BL/6 mice were raised in a vivarium that contains SFB, which are potent microbial inducers of Th17 cell expansion in intestinal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>). Conventional TAC C3H/HeN mice were raised in a SFB<sup>-</sup> facility. In these experiments, we transferred fecal material of each conventional mouse strain to GF mating pairs of the other mouse strain, i.e. transfer fecal material from a conventioanlly raised C57BL/6 to a GF C3H/HeN breeding pairs, and vice versa. We then assessed bone structure and turnover in 16-week-old female mice of the F1 generation produced by the conventionalized breeding pairs, which were colonized with the mother’s microbiome from birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nongenomic effects of gut microbiome on bone volume, structure and turnover are hereditarily transferred.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the experimental outline.

We also confirmed the absence of SFB in GF C57BL/6 mice that were colonized with C3H/HeN microbiome, and the presence of SFB in C3H/HeN germ-free mice that were colonized with C57BL/6 microbiome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Herein, we referred to mice colonized with fecal material from donor of the different genetic background as ‘discordant’ mice, whereas mice colonized with fecal material from a donor of the same genetic background are referred to as ‘concordant’ mice. At 16 weeks of age C3H/HeN concordant mice had higher bone volume/total volume ratio (BV/TV) compared to concordant C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). SFB<sup>+</sup> mice have a lower BV/TV compared to SFB<sup>-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hathaway-Schrader et al., 2020</xref>). Corroborating the relevance of SFB for skeletal maturation, we showed that the discordant C3H/HeN mice had lower femur BV/TV ratio, trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and higher trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) than concordant C3H/HeN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref>). By contrast, concordant and discordant C57BL/6 mice had similar indices of trabecular volume and structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref>). Moreover, cortical area (Ct.Ar) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th), which are indices of cortical bone structure, were higher in concordant C3H/HeN mice than in concordant C57BL/6 mice, while discordant C3H/HeN mice had lower Ct.Ar and Ct.Th than concordant C3H/HeN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Analysis of C57BL/6 mice cortical structure revealed that Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were higher in discordant than in concordant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that TAC C57BL/6 microbiome worsen trabecular and cortical bone maturation. Mechanistic studies revealed that serum CTX, a marker of bone resorption, was higher in concordant C57BL/6 mice than in concordant C3H/HeN mice. Moreover, C3H/HeN microbiome lowered CTX levels in C57BL/6 mice, while C57BL/6 microbiome increased bone resorption in C3H/HeN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). By contrast, all groups of mice had similar serum levels of osteocalcin, a marker of bone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p><p>Since C57BL/6 microbiome is SFB<sup>+</sup> and C3H/HeN microbiome is SFB<sup>-</sup>, and SFB is a potent inducer of intestinal Th17 cell expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>), we assessed the number of Th17 cells in Peyer’s Patches (PP) and the BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the measurement of the absolute number of PP Th17 cells is technically challenging due to variability of the size of the collected PP tissue, PP Th17 cells were quantified as percentage of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We confirmed that the number of PP Th17 cells and the levels of small intestine (SI) tissue <italic>Il17a</italic> transcripts were higher in all groups of mice with SFB<sup>+</sup> microbiome than in those with SFB<sup>-</sup> microbiome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). In addition, the number of Th17 cells and the levels of <italic>Il17a</italic> mRNA in the BM were also higher in all mice with an SFB<sup>+</sup> microbiome, as compared to those with SFB<sup>–</sup> microbiome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). IL-17 stimulates the release of further inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, we found the levels of <italic>Tnfa</italic> mRNA were higher in the BM and SI and of mice with SFB<sup>+</sup> microbiome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>).

To investigate the impact on post-natal skeletal development of microbiome changes occurring after the establishment and consolidation of the original microbiome, FMTs were carried out across two strains of mice, and antibiotic treatments were employed. Specifically, groups of 8-week-old female TAC C57BL/6 and TAC C3H/HeN were treated with a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ampicillin; 0.5 g/L, Vancomycin; 0.25 g/L, Neomycin; 0.25 g/L, and Metronidazole; 0.5 g/L) for 2 weeks. 24 hr after the completion of the antibiotic treatment, mice were subjected to oral gavage of a liquid suspension of fecal material from either TAC C57BL/6 mice or TAC C3H/HeN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The recipient mice were housed in sterile cages in an isolated environment for 8 weeks before sacrifice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Analysis showed that donor C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN mice had distinct microbiome composition and diversity, and that FMT led to the establishment of the donor microbiome in the host mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We confirmed that SFB was present in donor C57BL/6 mice, and that antibiotic treated mice subjected to FMT with fecal material from these mice were also SFB<sup>+</sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In-vitro µCT analysis showed that donor C3H/HeN mice had higher femoral BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Th and lower Tb.Sp compared to C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>). C3H/HeN mice also had higher indices of cortical structure compared to C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). FMT from donor C57BL/6 mice to antibiotic treated C3H/HeN mice altered all indices of trabecular volume and structure in the recipient C3H/HeN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>). In addition, FMT from C57BL/6 mice to antibiotic treated C3H/HeN mice induced cortical bone loss in the recipient C3H/HeN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). Conversely, FMT from donor C3H/HeN mice did not affect indices of trabecular and cortical bone in recipient C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–I</xref>). These data suggested that gut microbiota of C57BL/6 mice has modulatory influences on both trabecular and cortical bone structure. In order to investigate the mechanism of bone loss induced by the transfer of C57BL/6 to antibiotic treated C3H/HeN mice, we measured serum levels of markers of bone resorption and bone formation. Analysis showed that serum levels of CTX were significantly higher in antibiotic treated C57BL/6 mice and C3H/HeN mice colonized with C57BL/6 microbiome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).

We showed that the gut microbiome shapes the acquisition of bone volume, structure and turnover when acquired by newborn mice via vertical transfer from the mother or by young mice via co-housing with other mice. Replacement of the original established microbiome with a new microbiome via treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics followed by FMT, also conditioned skeletal maturation. Transmission of gut microbes, and in particular of SFB, lead to the stimulation of bone resorption in recipient mice of the same, or different genetic strain. Moreover, the gut microbiome was found to act as a major non-genomic heritable factor in the transmission of bone phenotypes, including from mother to offspring. Together, these data showed that the microbiome is a communicable regulator of bone development.</p><p>Our observations were obtained using the powerful model of SFB-induced bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hathaway-Schrader et al., 2020</xref>), which allowed us to faithfully measure microbiome-dependent osteo-immunological events.</p><p>These observations have considerable societal implications, as they provide rational to support the feasibility of pre-, pro- and post-biotic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zaiss et al., 2019</xref>) to enhance post-natal bone development. Because we show that the offspring inherits the microbiome from the mother, these interventions may include supplementing the microbiome of gestating females with bone anabolic bacterial strains which may then be transferred to offspring at birth. In addition, our observations may support the rational of directly supplementing the neonate with beneficial bacteria at birth. Whether introduced strains establish permanent residency is an open question, especially due to the reported change and establishment of the adult gut microbiome by 2 to 3 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodríguez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kashtanova et al., 2016</xref>). In the event that permanent residency is not established, then further bacteriotherapy interventions of infants at 2 to 3 years of age may be necessary. Discovering the parameters whereupon beneficial strains permanently engrafted into the microbiome throughout adulthood will be essential endeavors in efforts to treat microbial impediments to optimal post-natal bone development.</p><p>The transfer of phenotypes within the microbiome by cohabitation has long intrigued investigators. Contributing environmental factors that shape our microbial communities include diet, age, our surroundings, and the individuals with whom we interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, contact with pets, especially dogs, are influencing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Song et al., 2013</xref>). Because mice are coprophagic, they provide a robust model to establish the efficiency of microbiome transmission between animals, and importantly also allows the detection of microbiome-induced phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robertson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caruso et al., 2019</xref>). Our data supported the notion that the gut microbiome is a factor of non-genomic transmission of bone structure and bone turnover between animals, since acquisition of an SFB<sup>+</sup> microbiome by co-housing lowered indices of post-natal bone development in mice irrespective of genetic strain. Clearly, the extent to which these observations are applicable to humans depend on the surroundings, including sanitation practices within the home and the efficiency of waste treatment within the municipalities. While in healthy mice Th17 cells are induced mostly by SFB, in healthy humans there are about 20 non-virulent gut bacterial strains known to induce Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atarashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). Among them the most are Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and Acinetobacter baumanii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atarashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). Since these strains are not equally potent, the presence of one or more of Th17 cell-inducing bacteria and their relative frequency is likely to affect skeletal development. Thus, identifying a source and then implementing evasion strategies to prevent the acquisition of microbes that induce Th17 cells in the gut may be a potential approach to avoid impediments to optimal post-natal bone development.</p><p>Despite reports that the gut microbiota of healthy people shows resilience and a capacity for recovery following antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palleja et al., 2018</xref>), we showed that FMT immediately after antibiotic treatment potently modified post-natal bone development phenotype in mice. Our observations are evidence that following a course of broad-spectrum of antibiotics, the microbiome may indeed be modified by FMT to introduce bacterial strains that may elicit modulatory effects on bone health and disease. Whether the newly introduced bacterial strains within the FMT may become permanent residents over the lifetime of the organism is yet to be determined. However, in our approach using mice, we show that 4 weeks colonization of microbiome materials introduced by FMT was sufficient to elicit a phenotype. This period required for microbes to elicit their associated phenotypes may vary and likely to depend on the potency whereby a given bacterial strain elicits its influence. Nevertheless, since the lifespans of humans are considerably longer than experimental science timeframes, which was up to 8 weeks in the models outlined in this manuscript, the acquisition and establishment of a Th17 cell expanding microbe early in life may have pernicious effects on post-natal bone metabolism over an entire lifetime.</p><p>An interesting finding of our studies was that increased expression of <italic>Il17a</italic> in the gut and the BM was associated with increased expression of <italic>Tnfsf11</italic> in the BM but not in the gut. IL-17 is known to induce TNFSF11 production by osteoblasts and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li, 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that osteoblasts and osteocytes might be the source of TNFSF11 in the BM of mice in response to elevated levels of BM IL-17, and that the absence of these lineages and other TNFSF11 producing cells sensitive to IL-17 in the intestine may explain the inability of IL-17 to stimulate TNFSF11 production in the gut.</p><p>It should also be noted that the effects of the microbiome on skeletal development were more potent in trabecular bone than in cortical bone. This is consistent with previous reports where we found the microbiome not to regulate cortical bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tyagi et al., 2018</xref>). This is likely to reflect the fact that the microbiome regulates bone acquisition mostly via T cells. These cells reside in the BM, where they have physical access to trabecular bone cells. In addition, cytokines secreted by T cells are present in relative high concentration in the BM, where they can affect bone cells and their precursors. By contrast, T cells have minimal physical access to cortical bone.</p><p>In each of the three experimental models utilized in the current study, the microbiome regulated skeletal development by modulating bone resorption without affecting bone formation. The reason for this phenomenon remains unknown, although it is tempting to speculate that the capacity of IL-17 to blunt bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>) might have been offset by gut microbes that stimulate bone formation such as bacteria that generate short chain fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zaiss et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our data showed that the gut microbiome is a non-genomic heritable factor that contributes to the variance of bone volume, structure and turnover within populations. The specific effects of the microbiome on bone depend on its diversity and composition. The presence in the gut microbiome of saprophytic strains capable of expanding intestinal Th17 cell in healthy individuals it is likely to a predictor of suboptimal skeletal development and low peak bone mass. Furthermore, the findings of this study have significant implications to the practice of FMT from healthy donors to recipients, where the transfer of microbes that trigger the expansion of gut Th17 cells could lead to lower bone density in recipients. On the other hand, we also identified the method or timing of microbiome transfer as a window of opportunity to apply bacteriotherapeutic interventions to overcome suboptimal skeletal maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

R C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN mice and GF C3H/HeN mice were purchased from Taconic biosciences (Rensselaer, NY). Fecal material from 16 week-old Conv.R C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN mice was transferred into GF pregnant C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN mice of the opposite genotype (or same genotype to generate controls) through oral gavage on alternate days between E4 and E15 as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomez de Agüero et al., 2016</xref>). Pregnancies were timed according to the day of vaginal plug. Fecal material donor mice were housed in Tecniplast bio-exclusion ISO cages to maintain the original microbiota until 16 weeks of age. Pregnant mice and offspring were housed in hermetically sealed ISO bio-exclusion cages. Once weaned, the offspring was housed alone in bio-exclusion ISO cages until the pups reach 16 weeks of age. To control for host-microbiome reciprocal interactions, the microbiome of each group of donor mice were normalized by routinely exchanging bedding between cages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Co-Housing</title><p>For the co-housing experiment, 10-week-old female Conv.R C57BL/6 mice were purchased from TAC and JAX laboratories. All the mice were fed sterile water and chow. Control groups were housed separately for 4 weeks. Experimental groups were co-housed with mice purchased from the other vendor that is JAX mice were co-housed with TAC mice for 4 weeks. Since mice are coprophagic, co-housing caused equalization of gut microbiome. After 4 weeks of co-housing mice were sacrificed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>FMT in conv. R.

Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The study is seen as novel and of general interest because it is the first to demonstrate that the microbiome is a non-genomic determinant of bone mass heritability. It includes novel approaches, such as the evaluation of the effects on the offspring of microbiome transfer in the mother. The analysis of bone indices has been conducted using state of the art methods, and the conclusions are well supported by the presented data.

This study demonstrates the importance of SFB as regulator of postnatal bone mass acquisition in mice. Are these findings relevant in humans?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that our findings are relevant in humans. In fact, while in healthy mice Th17 cells are induced mostly by SFB, in healthy humans, there are about 20 non-virulent gut bacterial strains known to induce Th17 cell differentiation (1, 2). Therefore, we hypothesize that skeletal growth in humans is influenced by the presence and the frequency of one or more of these Th17 cell-inducing bacteria. This point is now discussed in the revised manuscript where we state:</p><p>”While in healthy mice Th17 cells are induced mostly by SFB, in healthy humans there are about 20 non-virulent gut bacterial strains known to induce Th17 cell differentiation. Since these strains are not equally potent, the presence of one or more of Th17 cell-inducing bacteria and their relative frequency is likely to affect skeletal development. Thus, identifying a source and then implementing evasion strategies to prevent the acquisition of microbes that induce Th17 cells in the gut may be a potential approach to avoid impediments to optimal post-natal bone development”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please discuss how intestinal Th17 cells are induced in humans and if bacteria equivalent to SFB have been described in humans. RANKL is a critical inducer of osteoclast formation, and the manuscript shows that BM RANKL is regulated by the microbiome. Please discuss what is the cellular source of BM RANKL and whether the authors believe that RANKL is induced by IL-17.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we describe the role of SFB-like bacteria in the induction to Th17 cells in humans. Please see reply to point #1 above. We also discuss our hypothesis that RANKL is likely to be secreted by osteoblasts/osteocytes and possibly T cells in response to IL-17. Our hypothesis is supported by pertinent literature and by an earlier report from our laboratory in which we demonstrated that IL-17 signaling in osteoblasts/osteocytes stimulates RANKL production in concert with PTH (3). The following paragraph has been added to the Discussion:</p><p>“An interesting finding of our studies was that increased expression of IL-17 in the gut and the BM was associated with increased expression of RANKL in the BM but not in the gut. IL-17 is known to induce RANKL production by osteoblasts and osteocytes. Therefore, it is likely that osteoblasts and osteocytes might be the source of RANKL in the BM of mice in response to elevated levels of BM IL-17, and that the absence of these lineages and other RANKL producing cells sensitive to IL-17 in the intestine may explain the inability of IL-17 to stimulate RANKL production in the gut”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The effects of the microbiome appear to be more potent in trabecular bone than in cortical bone. How is this explained? Is this consistent with previous reports about the effects of microbiome in bone?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point that is been addressed by adding the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“It should also be noted that the effects of the microbiome on skeletal development were more potent in trabecular bone than in cortical bone. This is consistent with previous reports where we found the microbiome not to regulate cortical bone. This is likely to reflect the fact that the microbiome regulates bone acquisition mostly via T cells. These cells reside in the BM, where they have physical access to trabecular bone cells. In addition, cytokines secreted by T cells are present in relative high concentration in the BM, where they can affect bone cells and their precursors. By contrast, T cells have minimal physical access to cortical bone”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Introduction: The authors refer to the role of GM as regulator of skeletal mass in humans making references to two papers (Wang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019), These papers are not related to skeletal maturation, they refer to adults.</p></disp-quote><p>Point well taken.

It is suggested to that a paragraph in the Discussion be included in order to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>This important point has been addressed by adding the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>”In each of the three experimental models utilized in the current study, the microbiome regulated skeletal development by modulating bone resorption without affecting bone formation. The reason for this phenomenon remains unknown, although it is tempting to speculate that the capacity of IL-17 to blunt bone formation (4) might have been offset by gut microbes that stimulate bone formation such as bacteria that generate short chain fatty acids (5)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There are some typos as Payer's patches in the legend of supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the typo, which has been fixed.</p><p>References</p><p>1) Atarashi K, Tanoue T, Ando M, Kamada N, Nagano Y, Narushima S, Suda W, Imaoka A, Setoyama H, Nagamori T, Ishikawa E, Shima T, Hara T, Kado S, Jinnohara T, Ohno H, Kondo T, Toyooka K, Watanabe E, Yokoyama S, Tokoro S, Mori H, Noguchi Y, Morita H, Ivanov, II, Sugiyama T, Nunez G, Camp JG, Hattori M, Umesaki Y, Honda K.
