cells is closely linked with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, a prevalent age-dependent chronic disorder causing low back pain. While previous studies have highlighted that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) mitigated IVD degeneration through anti-apoptotic and pro-anabolic effects, its impact on IVD cell senescence remains elusive. In this study, human NP and AF cells derived from aged, degenerated IVDs were treated with recombinant human (rh) PDGF-AB/BB for 5 d. Transcriptome profiling by mRNA sequencing revealed that NP and AF cells responded to the treatment in similar yet distinct ways. The effects of PDGF-AB and BB on human IVD cells were comparable. Specifically, rhPDGF-AB/BB treatment downregulated genes related to neurogenesis and mechanical stimulus response in AF cells, while in NP cells, metabolic pathways were predominantly suppressed. In both NP and AF cells, rhPDGF-AB/BB treatment upregulated genes involved in cell cycle regulation and response to reduced oxygen levels, while downregulating genes related to senescence-associated phenotype, including oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondria dysfunction. Network analysis revealed that PDGFRA and IL6 were the top hub genes in treated NP cells. Furthermore, in irradiation-induced senescent NP cells, PDGFRA gene expression was significantly reduced compared to non-irradiated cells. However, rhPDGF-AB/BB treatment increased PDGFRA expression and mitigated the senescence progression through increased cell population in the S phase, reduced SA-β-Gal activity, and decreased expression of senescence-related regulators. Our findings reveal a novel anti-senescence role of PDGF in the IVD, making it a promising potential candidate to delay aging-induced IVD degeneration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Back pain is among the most common health problems and is frequently caused by damage to the discs between the vertebrae, known as intervertebral discs. These discs act as cushions, allowing for movement and absorbing mechanical forces.</p><p>As people age, these discs become stiff and wear out, which is a major risk factor for back pain. Cellular senescence, a process in which cells stop dividing and start releasing harmful cell products, contributes to this degeneration by damaging the surrounding cells. In aged or degenerated intervertebral discs, the number of senescent cells is significantly increased.</p><p>The protein PDGF is a growth factor involved in cell growth and division and is widely used in the clinical setting for tissue regeneration and repair. So far, it was unknown if PDGF could slow down cellular senescence in intervertebral discs.</p><p>To find out more, Zhang et al. collected two types of cells found in intervertebral discs – the nucleus pulposus cells and the annulus fibrosus cells – from tissue samples of healthy individuals and patients with disc hernias. They then treated these cells with PDGF and analyzed their gene activity. The experiments showed that PDGF slowed cellular senescence in both cell types. In both tissues, PDGF increased the expression of genes that promote the cell cycle and decreased the expression of genes related to senescence, including those involved in oxidative stress responses and mitochondrial dysfunction. Zhang et al. also noted some tissue-specific responses to PDGF treatment, with nucleus pulposus cells responding more by reducing the activity of genes involved in metabolic pathways, and annulus fibrosus cells by deactivating genes involved in responses to mechanical stimulation experienced during daily activities.</p><p>Zhang et al. further developed a ‘cellular senescence model’ by exposing healthy cells extracted from the nucleus pulposus and the annulus fibrosus to a single dose of senescence-inducing radiation in both cell types. Immediate treatment with PDGF reduced the expression of senescence-related genes.</p><p>In summary, the study indicates that PDGF can inhibit cell senescence in intervertebral discs. The next step will be to validate these findings in animal models and clinical trials to ensure safety and effectiveness. In the future, this could lead to new strategies for developing minimally invasive therapies to inhibit or halt the progression of degenerative disc disease within the ageing spine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cellular senescence</kwd><kwd>PDGF</kwd><kwd>intervertebral disc degeneration</kwd><kwd>irradiation</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR076427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drissi</surname><given-names>Hicham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jack McKee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drissi</surname><given-names>Hicham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006939</institution-id><institution>Emory University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drissi</surname><given-names>Hicham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PDGF mitigated cellular senescence in human intervertebral disc by modulating cell cycle, inflammation, and mitochondria function, offering a potential strategy for combating age-induced disc degeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Low back pain (LBP), ranked as the first cause of years lived with disability, is a prevalent condition. Although the etiology of LBP is multifactorial, a major contributor of LBP is IVD degeneration, which is increasing exponentially due to a growing aged population worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2016</xref>). Current treatments, such as medicine, physical therapy, and surgical excision of the herniated tissues, only temporarily alleviate painful symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xin et al., 2022</xref>). In fact, patients often experience persistent LBP after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coronado et al., 2015</xref>). The fundamental cause of this is the inadequate knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology mechanisms leading to IVD degeneration. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration and develop novel therapeutic interventions to mitigate the degenerative processes.</p><p>The IVD consists of three compartments: the gelatinous nucleus pulposus (NP), fibrous annulus fibrosus (AF), and cartilaginous endplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sivan et al., 2014</xref>). NP and AF tissues play distinct yet complementary roles in maintaining the spinal function. The NP has a high content of proteoglycans and water, absorbing and distributing mechanical forces. In contrast, AF consists of multiple layers of concentric lamellae, which provide strength and stability to the disc and withstand compressive forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sivan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pattappa et al., 2012</xref>). The NP plays a crucial role in the progression of IVD degeneration due to its susceptibility to significant structural and functional changes during aging and degeneration. Indeed, NP structural changes are easily detected through imaging techniques. Thus, because of its high water content, MRI has made the NP the most visible indicator of disc degeneration in clinical practice. In contrast, degenerated alterations in the AF are more closely linked to pain and disability. As a result, effective therapeutic strategies for IVD degeneration should aim to restore the functionality of the entire disc unit.</p><p>Cellular senescence, triggered by normal cells in response to various intrinsic and extrinsic stressors, is a fundamental mechanism underlying age-related chronic diseases. Senescent cells are featured by irreversible growth arrest and acquire a senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue-damaging proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ngo et al., 2017</xref>). Activation of P53/P21 and P16 pathways plays a critical role in regulating senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reimann et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, the NF-κB pathway is a major pathway involved in the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salminen et al., 2012</xref>). Factors within the SASP can act in an autocrine manner to reinforce the senescent state and induce senescence in neighboring cells via paracrine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumari and Jat, 2021</xref>). This mechanism elucidates the accumulation of senescent cells with aging and its associated detrimental effects. In the IVD, it has been well established that the number of senescent cells increases with aging and IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veroutis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gruber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gruber et al., 2009</xref>), as demonstrated by increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) positive cells and decreased cell proliferation. Growing research also demonstrates that targeting cellular senescence holds promise in alleviating the progression of IVD degeneration. Long-term systemic or local clearance of senescent cells by senolytic drugs mitigated age-related IVD degeneration in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Novais et al., 2021</xref>) and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix proteases and restored IVD structure in an injury-induced IVD degeneration model in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim et al., 2022</xref>). Cherif et al. and Mannarino et al. demonstrated that in humans, senolytic drugs o-Vanillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mannarino et al., 2021</xref>), and RG-7112 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cherif et al., 2020</xref>) attenuated NP cellular senescence, where a combination of these two senolytic drugs reduced the release of inflammatory factors and pain mediators in degenerated NP cells from low back pain patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mannarino et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>PDGF is a major constituent of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which is widely used in the clinical setting for tissue regeneration and repair. It can be made of a homodimer of A, B, C, and D polypeptide chains, or an AB heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heldin and Lennartsson, 2013</xref>). Among these, PDGF-AB and -BB are the predominant forms in PRPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weibrich et al., 2002</xref>). Two types of PDGFR (PDGFRA and PDGFRB) were identified that differ in ligand-binding specificity. PDGFRA binds to all PDGF chains but D chain while PDGFRB only binds to B and D chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heldin and Lennartsson, 2013</xref>). Upon binding, the PDGF-PDGFR network induces a cascade of phosphorylation in pathways including cell proliferation, migration, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Contreras et al., 2021</xref>). We previously demonstrated that recombinant human PDGF-BB (rhPDGF-BB) inhibited cell apoptosis while promoting cell proliferation and matrix production in human IVD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Presciutti et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, when delivered via hydrogel, rhPDGF-BB successfully inhibited IVD degeneration and restored IVD biomechanical function in a rabbit preclinical model of puncture-induced IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paglia et al., 2016</xref>). In the current study, we hypothesize that PDGF-AB and -BB mitigated IVD degeneration by targeting cellular senescence. To test it, aged, degenerated human IVD cells were treated with rhPDGF-AB or -BB and transcriptome profiling was performed on treated NP and AF cells. We found similar but distinct responses to the treatment between NP and AF cells. In NP cells, PDGF-AB and -BB treatment upregulated the expression of PDGFRA and genes involved in cell cycle progression while downregulating the expression of genes related to ROS production, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. The alterations in these pathways indicated that the senescent phenotype was alleviated in human degenerated IVD cells treated with PDGF-AB/BB. Furthermore, in human senescent NP cells induced by irradiation, PDGFRA was significantly reduced, while PDGF-AB/BB treatment mitigated the progression of senescence through increased cell cycle progression and reduced SA-β-Gal staining and the expression of P21, P16, NF-κB, and IL6.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sample collection and cell extraction</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Specifically, in aged, degenerated human NP and AF cells, PDGF-AB/BB treatment suppressed the ROS accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the resultant oxidative stress, while stimulating cell cycle progression. In the NP, PDGFRA was among the top hub genes that showed strong interaction with other genes. Moreover, its expression was significantly reduced in irradiation-induced senescent cells. Importantly, immediate PDGF-BB treatment after irradiation promoted the expression of <italic>PDGFRA</italic> and mitigated senescence-associated phenotype in healthy IVD cells. This novel function of PDGF-BB/PDGFRA signaling is likely linked to their ability to inhibit NF-κB, P16, and P21 pathways in NP cells. In contrast, while PDGF treatment alleviated the senescent phenotype in AF cells, it also induced changes in pathways such as response to mechanical stimuli and neurogenesis, which were distinct from those in NP cells. This indicates that the treatment enhanced IVD functionality through different mechanisms within the two compartments. Senescence is a key contributor to the onset and the progression of IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silwal et al., 2023</xref>). It can occur naturally with aging or can be triggered by growth factor deficiency, radiation, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). Senescent cells exit the cell cycle and cannot divide; their accumulation reduces the IVD’s ability to generate new cells to replace apoptotic or necrotic cells. It has been well established that an increased number of senescent cells was positively correlated with IVD aging and the severity of degeneration while negatively correlated with the percentage of proliferating cells in human NP and AF tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gruber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veroutis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gruber et al., 2007</xref>). Since PDGF is a mitogenic growth factor and promotes cell proliferation in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Contreras et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">García-Olivas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin-Garrido et al., 2013</xref>), it is intriguing to explore whether PDGF-AB/BB could mitigate or prevent against cellular senescence in IVDs. We observed groups of upregulated genes regulating cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in PDGF-AB/BB-treated NP cells. AF cells also had an upregulation of chromosome segregation and mitotic nuclear division pathways, suggesting that these cells were actively proliferating. Cell cycle progression is controlled by cyclins, and the expression of cyclin D1 and B1, regulators of the G1/S and G2/M phase transition, respectively, was increased in degenerated NP cells after PDGF-AB/BB treatment. Transcriptomic analysis also revealed that increased cyclin D1 was among the top hub nodes, tightly regulated by PDGF-AB and BB. In addition, cell cycle analysis confirmed that PDGF-AB/BB induced the transition from G1 to S1 phase in senescent IVD cells. Our data suggested that PDGF treatment led to an increase in the proliferation of senescent IVD cells in the S phase likely through cyclin D1 and B1. These findings were in accordance with previous studies showing that PDGF-stimulated cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression in rat mesangial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hida et al., 2003</xref>), rat adventitial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2024</xref>), and human vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin-Garrido et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The antisenescence of PDGF has been demonstrated in several studies. For example, PDGF-BB decreased SA-β-gal positive cells and the expression of P53 and P21 while enhancing proliferative potential in senescent human dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae et al., 2016</xref>) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from immune thrombocytopenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). PDGF exerts its function by binding to its receptors, thereby triggering a cascade of intracellular signaling events, such as cell proliferation and survival. The PDGF-PDGFRA signaling is often suppressed in premature aged or senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mori et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting that PDGF signaling dysfunction might be involved in senescence or aging. Notably, our transcriptome data has shown that both PDGF-AB and -BB induced the expression of <italic>PDGFRA</italic> in aged, degenerated NP cells. This autoregulatory loop caused IVD cells to become more sensitive to PDGF treatment and augmented the signaling cascades triggered by PDGF binding, including senescence-associated P21, P16, P53, and NF-κB pathways. In line with this thought, PPI analysis revealed that <italic>PDGFRA</italic> closely interacted with upregulated <italic>MDM2</italic>, a negative regulator of P53. NF-κB signaling is a major signaling pathway that is involved in inflamm-aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Songkiatisak et al., 2022</xref>) and induces the onset of SASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salminen et al., 2012</xref>), such as IL6, IL8, and CXCL1. In our study, irradiation in NP cells led to decreased <italic>PDGFRA</italic> expression, which impaired the activity of PDGF/PDGFRA signaling. However, PDGF-BB treatment promoted the expression of <italic>PDGFRA</italic> and decreased the expression of <italic>P21, P16,</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> in senescent NP cells, likely by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. In fact, it has been shown that NF-kB signaling was elevated in mouse IVDs exposed to a single 20 Gy dose of irradiation in an ex vivo culture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). These findings support the idea that PDGF treatment could stimulate the expression of <italic>PDGFRA</italic> and mitigated the progression of senescent phenotype in healthy IVD cells. Interestingly, while mRNA level was increased in PDGF-treated NP cells, its protein level was decreased, highlighting the complexity in PDGF receptor dynamics. Upon binding with PDGF ligands, PDGFRA is known to undergo rapid internalization and degradation, a mechanism that prevents overstimulation of the signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rogers and Fantauzzo, 2020</xref>). The upregulated gene expression probably compensates for this degradation and supports continued activation of PDGFRA signaling activation, emphasizing its crucial role in response to the PDGF treatment. Further studies using preclinical animal models to validate the protectiveness of PDGF against the onset or progression of senescence in the IVD will offer more robust evidence.</p><p>Degenerated IVD cells experienced an imbalance between ROS accumulation and antioxidant capacity, leading to oxidative stress, which is involved in cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). Mitochondrion is the primary location of intracellular ROS production and its dysfunction in degenerated IVD cells causes electron leakage, resulting in the formation of superoxide radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). PDGF-AB/BB treatment suppressed the activity of damaged mitochondria, leading to decreased ROS and oxidative stress in degenerated NP and AF cells, as indicated by GO BP analysis. Consistently, GSEA revealed the underrepresentation of oxidative phosphorylation in treated NP cells. The downregulation of genes related to mitochondria activity and oxidative phosphorylation may be indicative of a shift in metabolic pathways, leading cells to potentially prioritize alternative pathways such as glycolysis. Indeed, PDGF treatment upregulated groups of genes involved in response to decreased oxygen levels, suggesting that the treatment-activated cellular mechanisms involved in sensing and adapting to low oxygen conditions. In line with this idea, it has been demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor 1α is highly expressed in healthy NP cells to suppress oxidative phosphorylation and enhance glycolysis, allowing cells to adjust to a hypoxic microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Song et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Silagi et al., 2021</xref>). Conversely, degenerated NP cells show an opposite metabolic pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Song et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Silagi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Besides the anti-senescence, NP and AF cells responded differently to PDGF-AB/BB treatment. AF cells were more responsive to the treatment with twice as many DEGs as NP cells. The difference in tissue architecture and cellular contents between NP and AF contributes to their specialized functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kudelko et al., 2021</xref>). The multiple layers of concentric lamellae in the AF enable it to withstand circumferential loads, while this highly organized structure was disrupted with aging and degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dittmar et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, damage to the AF has the potential to stimulate neovascularization and nerve ingrowth, provoking an inflammatory response and contributing to low back pain. PDGF-AB/BB treatment downregulated groups of genes related to neurogenesis and response to mechanical stimulus in AF cells, while downregulated genes in the NP were more associated with metabolic pathways, providing evidence that the treatment enhanced IVD functionality in different aspects between the two compartments.</p><p>Senescence as a central hallmark of aging can be induced by several factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silwal et al., 2023</xref>). One limitation of this study is that we did not examine the effects of PDGF-AB/BB treatment on senescence using other senescence models. In addition, our findings were obtained in vitro experiments, so caution is needed when interpreting our data. Our future work will focus on establishing an appropriate experimental animal model to study the functions of PDGF on cellular senescence.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated a novel function of PDGF in human NP and AF cells. PDGF-AB/BB treatment alleviated oxidative stress and mitochondria dysfunction while stimulating cell cycle progression in degenerated IVD cells. In addition, the treatment mitigated the progression of senescence in healthy NP and AF cells following irradiation. These findings suggest that PDGF-AB/BB may serve as a promising potential candidate for IVD degeneration by targeting cellular senescence.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Prior literature has demonstrated the importance of accumulation of senescent cells in mediating many of the pathological effects associated with the degenerate disc joint, such as inflammation and tissue breakdown. In this study, the authors treat clinically relevant human nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells from patients undergoing discectomy with recombinant PDGF-AB/BB for 5 days and then deep phenotyped the outcomes using bulk RNA sequencing. In addition they irradiated healthy human disc cells which they subsequently treated with PDGF-AB/BB examining the expression of SASP-related markers and also PDGFRA receptor gene expression. Overall PDGF was able to down-regulate many senescent associated pathways and the degenerate phenotype in IVD cells. Altered pathways were associated with neurogenesis, mechanical stimuli, metabolism, cell cycle, reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall the authors achieved their aims and the results by and large support their conclusions although improvements could be made to enhance the rigor of the study and findings</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A major strength of this study is the use of human cells from patients undergoing discectomy for disc herniation as well as access to healthy human cells. Investigating the role of PDGF regarding cellular senescence in the degenerate disc joint is novel and an underexplored area of research which is a significant contribution to the field of spine. This study highlights a potential target for addressing cellular senescence where most of the prior focus has been on senolytic drugs. Such studies have broad implications to other age-related diseases where senescence plays a major role. The use of transcriptomics and therefore an unbiased approach to investigating the role of PDGF is also considered a strength as is the follow-up studies involving irradiating healthy human disc cells and treating these cells with PDGF. The combined assessment of both nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells in the context of these studies adds to the impact.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A weakness of these studies relates to qualitative data presented for the B-galactosidase assay. Quantification of such data sets would greatly strengthen the studies and lend further support to the hypotheses. The study in its current form could be strengthened by the inclusion of mechanistic studies probing the downstream PDGF receptor associated pathways for example specifically targeting or modulating the activity of the PDGF receptor PDGFRA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103073.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Changli</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Atlanta</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Diaz-Hernandez</surname><given-names>Martha Elena</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Atlanta</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fukunaga</surname><given-names>Takanori</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Atlanta</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shenoy</surname><given-names>Sreekala</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Atlanta</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yoon</surname><given-names>Sangwook Tim</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory Orthopaedics and Spine Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Atlanta</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Haglund</surname><given-names>Lisbet</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>McGill University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montreal</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Drissi</surname><given-names>Hicham</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Atlanta</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>The Reviewer asks that we provide the source of PDGF-AB/BB proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for omitting such information. We now provide the source of PDGF-AB/BB in the Methods as PeproTech. In our revised manuscript we clearly state in Page 7, line 142: “Cells were then treated with recombinant human PDGF-AB (40ng/ml; PeproTech, 10770584) or -BB (20ng/ml; PeproTech, 10771918) for 5 days. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer asks that we adequately report our chosen irradiation parameters suggesting that we consider (PMCID: PMC5495460) for appropriate parameter reporting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We now provide a more detailed irradiation reporting based on the shared manuscript in Page 9, line 10, line 204.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer requests more details about the age range to distinguish young from old donors.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Methods section of our revised manuscript, we now provide the age range for our old donors being between 53 and 67 while our younger donor population ranged between 19 and 27 years of age. These changes are reflected in Page 6, line 128: “Human degenerated NP and AF tissues (Grade IV or V on Pfirrman grade; 64.6 ±8.5 years old) were obtained as the surgical waste from donors with discogenic pain, with each donor providing written informed consent. Healthy NP and AF cells (23.0 ±3.7 years old) were gifted by Professor Lisbet Haglund from McGill University (Tissue Biobank #2019-4896).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer wonders about the rationale for using different concentrations of PDGF-AB/BB in the degenerate cell and irradiation experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity. We initially treated cells with different concentrations (20 and 40 ng/ml) of PDGF-AB/BB to first establish a dose-response. From our MTT and gene expression analyses we determined that 20ng/ml was sufficient to elicit significant changes in cell proliferation markers, including MKI67, CCNB1 and CCND1. Increasing the concentration to 40 ng/ml of either growth factor did not significantly influence these parameters. However, we felt that for our bulk RNA seq experiments, we may see better changes in signaling molecules under 40ng/ml of PDGF-AB since its effects on cell growth at this concentration were maximal while PDGF-BB was maintained at 20ng/ml based on its efficacy in our mitogenic response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer asks that we consider describing the effects of PDGF-AB/BB as mitigating or therapeutic rather than protective both in the title and throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer’s recommendation, and we have now changed the title to “Therapeutic effects of PDGF-AB/BB against cellular senescence in human intervertebral disc”. Moreover, we implemented this change in the revised manuscript as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer believes that changes in the NP are more clinically evident (by imaging methods), despite degeneration often initiating from the AF (annulus fibrosus), e,g. through tears/microtears and would like for us to reflect this in our revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer’s comment, and we thank them for this added accuracy. On this basis, we now corrected our language in the introduction by stating in Page 4, line 68 that: “To date, the main focus of IVD cell studies has been on the NP, as changes in the NP are easily detected through imaging techniques like MRI, making it the most visible indicator of disc degeneration in clinical practice. In addition, NP plays a crucial role in the progression of IVD degeneration due to its susceptibility to significant structural and functional changes during aging and degeneration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer points out a prior study which examined the effects of X-ray irradiation on NF-kB signaling in young and aged IVDs (PMCID: PMC5495460) suggesting that we include this reference in our revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion, and we are now referencing this elegant study in the discussion section of our revised manuscript. Thus, in page 20, line 440 we state: “ In fact, it has been shown that NF-kB signaling was elevated in mouse IVDs exposed to a single 20 Gy dose of irradiation in an ex vivo culture model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer asks that our experimental methods are described in the order of the experimental workflow. For example, section 2.2 describes RNA sequencing, which is a terminal assay. Section 2.2 may be more appropriate for detailing the methods of PDGF-AB/BB treatment, along with the rationale.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out and have reorganized the Methods section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>The Reviewer requests more experimental details in the methodology including the rationale for such methods/conditions as well as specific culture models utilized, substrates, cell density, and media components.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity. We now revised the methods section based on the comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer asks about the quantitative data for b-galactosidase assay and immunofluorescence of senescence-associated proteins such as P21 and P16.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for omitting this information. We now included the quantification of P21 and P16 positive cells, which is presented in the revised Figures 4. For b-galactosidase assay, we were unable to quantify the percentage of positive cells because we did not perform nuclei staining, making it difficult to accurately determine the total cell number. Instead, we provided representative images showing the full field of view at 10X magnification using Echo microscope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer requests the protein level data of PDGFRA to determine if the transcripts are being translated to protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. The protein expression of PDGFRA has been included in the Supplementary Figure 2. We found that PDGFRA protein levels were decreased in both NP and AF cells in response to PDGF treatments. It is known that upon binding with PDGF ligands, PDGFRA undergoes rapid internalization and degradation, a mechanism that prevents overstimulation of the signaling pathway (doi: 10.1042/BST20200004). The upregulated gene expression probably attempting to compensate for this degradation and supports continued activation of PDGFRA signaling activation, emphasizing its crucial role in response to the PDGF treatment. Thus, we implemented it in the discussion section in page 22, line486:” Interestingly, while mRNA level was increased in PDGF treated NP cells, its protein level was decreased, highlighting the complexity in PDGF receptor dynamics. Upon binding with PDGF ligands, PDGFRA is known to undergo rapid internalization and degradation, a mechanism that prevents overstimulation of the signaling pathway (Rogers and Fantauzzo 2020). The upregulated gene expression probably attempting to compensate for this degradation and supports continued activation of PDGFRA signaling activation, emphasizing its crucial role in response to the PDGF treatment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer points out that our conclusion that “PDGF do not mediate their effects via the PDGFRA” is not supported by the current data asking that further discussion, interpretation, and direct comparison of the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus data sets be presented to the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the insightful comment. In page 20, line 432, we have corrected our language to now state: “In contrast, while PDGF treatment alleviated the senescent phenotype in AF cells, it also induced changes in pathways such as response to mechanical stimuli and neurogenesis, which were distinct from those in NP cells. This indicates that the treatment enhanced IVD functionality through different mechanisms within the two compartments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer cannot appreciate the changes in S-phase between control and treated groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor quality of the figure in our initial submission. We analyzed the data in S phase and included them in our revised Figures 5C and 5F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Reviewer believes that discectomies are typically not performed on patients with discogenic back pain but on patients who are undergoing surgery for a herniated disc.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer, and we corrected our language in the revised manuscript.
