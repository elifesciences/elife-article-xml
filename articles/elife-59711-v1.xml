with age. Neural hyperactivity has been implicated in impairing cognitive plasticity with age, but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that chronic excitation of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons during ageing causes a rapid decline of experience-dependent plasticity in response to environmental O<sub>2</sub> concentration, whereas sustaining lower activity of O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons retains plasticity with age. We demonstrate that neural activity alters the ageing trajectory in the transcriptome of O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons, and our data suggest that high-activity neurons redirect resources from maintaining plasticity to sustaining continuous firing. Sustaining plasticity with age requires the K<sup>+</sup>-dependent Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> (NCKX) exchanger, whereas the decline of plasticity with age in high-activity neurons acts through calmodulin and the scaffold protein Kidins220. Our findings demonstrate directly that the activity of neurons alters neuronal homeostasis to govern the age-related decline of neural plasticity and throw light on the mechanisms involved.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>experience-dependent plasticity</kwd><kwd>neural ageing</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>oxygen-sensing neurons</kwd><kwd>neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis</kwd><kwd>plasticity decline</kwd><kwd><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N004574/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Busch</surname><given-names>Karl Emanuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109614/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Busch</surname><given-names>Karl Emanuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UK Dementia Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spires-Jones</surname><given-names>Tara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation H2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spires-Jones</surname><given-names>Tara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chronic excitation of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> oxygen-sensing neurons alters calcium homeostasis to accelerate the decline of neural plasticity with age.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most feared aspects of ageing is that as we get older our brain function deteriorates. Neural plasticity, which is the ability of the nervous system to adapt to changing environments or to encode new memories, declines continuously and progressively from early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arey and Murphy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park and Bischof, 2013</xref>). The environmental and intrinsic factors driving this decline of neural plasticity are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arey and Murphy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BÃ©nard and Doitsidou, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stein and Murphy, 2012</xref>). Sensory input and neural excitation are important in regulating the ageing process and have been shown to control <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcedo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zullo et al., 2019</xref>), but how they drive the ageing of cognitive function and plasticity remains obscure.</p><p>A growing body of evidence indicates that neural hyperactivity is an early-stage functional hallmark of neurodegeneration, particularly in Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busche and Konnerth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Filippini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koelewijn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Palop et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Putcha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stargardt et al., 2015</xref>). Other studies too suggest that neural hyperactivity impairs memory formation. For example, subregions of the hippocampus with elevated neural activity are unable to encode new information in ageing rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>), and drug treatment that lowers hippocampal activity improves memory formation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakker et al., 2012</xref>). Also, epilepsy, which is characterized by neural overactivation, is frequently associated with cognitive impairment, especially with deficits in learning and memory, and increases the risk of developing dementia with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dodrill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hermann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sen et al., 2018</xref>). A direct role of sensory input and neuronal activity in age-related cognitive decline has not yet been studied, however. Dysregulation of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been implicated in activity-linked cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Foster, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lerdkrai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pchitskaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Toescu and Verkhratsky, 2007a</xref>), but the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Elucidating how neuronal activity regulates cognitive decline at the molecular level may pave the way for a strategy to slow cognitive decline with age.</p><p>To study the mechanisms that govern the decline of cognitive plasticity with age, we are using the robust and reproducible behavioral responses to O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> a genetically and molecularly tractable nematode worm with an average lifespan of three weeks. These animals strongly avoid environments in which the atmosphere is either rich in O<sub>2</sub> (21%, as in the air) or poor in O<sub>2</sub> (&lt;5%) and they move toward environments with O<sub>2</sub> levels of 5â10%, which are optimal for adequate cellular respiration but cause little oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee and Atkinson, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Persson et al., 2009</xref>). As the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> increases, the animals gradually switch their locomotory behavior from low-speed âdwellingâ to high-speed âpersistent roamingâ. This O<sub>2</sub>-evoked switch is sustained for as long as the animals are exposed to the higher concentration of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). Four O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons â the URX pair, AQR and PQR â continuously respond to high concentrations of O<sub>2</sub> to generate this persistent roaming behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). Tonic activity of these neurons is necessary and sufficient to set the behavioral state according to the ambient O<sub>2</sub> concentration for many minutes and even hours. The activity state and cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of these neurons are chronically elevated by long-term exposure to a high concentration (21%) of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). The functional properties of these O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons thus make them an ideal system for manipulating long-term neuronal excitation in vivo.</p><p>Here, we have established an assay in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to elucidate how neuronal activity affects the decline of neural plasticity with age. Animals show O<sub>2</sub> experience-dependent behavioral plasticity, where an overnight shift of the O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the culture environment reprograms the wormsâ O<sub>2</sub>-evoked speed responses. We show that long-term activation of O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons accelerates the decline of plasticity with age at both the neuronal and behavioral level. By gene expression profiling of O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons in ageing animals, we show that neuronal activity alters age-related changes in the transcriptome of O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons, suggesting a re-distribution of neuronal resources according to neuronal activity state during ageing. In particular, the differential expression of neuronal genes that modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis plays a central role in mediating activity-dependent decline. Low activity neurons require the K<sup>+</sup>-dependent Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> (NCKX) exchanger to remove intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in order to sustain plasticity with age, whereas the decline of plasticity associated with high neuronal activity acts through calmodulin and the scaffold protein Kidins220 (also known as ARMS).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Previous oxygen experience determines whether the plasticity of O<sub>2</sub> responses is maintained or lost with age in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>Long-term exposure to different oxygen environments creates a memory that configures <italic>C. elegansâ</italic> aversion to high CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fenk and de Bono, 2017</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that <italic>C. elegans</italic> adapt their O<sub>2</sub> preference depending on previous oxygen experience. To test this, we cultured animals from birth in an atmosphere of either their preferred O<sub>2</sub> concentration (7%) or at 21% O<sub>2</sub>, and assayed the speed of locomotion of young (1-day-old) adults when they were exposed to a series of stepwise decreasing concentrations from 21% to 7% O<sub>2</sub> and a final step from 7% to 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The reference laboratory strain N2 has acquired a hyperactive version of the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1, which attenuates avoidance of 21% O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of bacterial food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Persson et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore tested animals bearing the <italic>ad609</italic> loss-of-function mutation in <italic>npr-1,</italic> thus restoring their robust avoidance of high O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). Strikingly, the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> at which the worms were initially cultured determined their responses to the stepwise changes in O<sub>2</sub> concentration: animals initially cultured in 21% O<sub>2</sub> gradually decreased their speed of locomotion as the O<sub>2</sub> concentration decreased from 21% to 7%, as observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref>); those initially cultured in 7% O<sub>2,</sub> however, were highly motile at all concentrations from 21% to 11% and only exhibited dwelling behavior when they reached their initial culture condition of 7% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that animals can âupdateâ their O<sub>2</sub> preference if they have recently been switched to a different oxygen environment, and tested this by transferring them from 21% to 7% O<sub>2</sub> or viceÂ versa 12 hr before assaying their locomotory speed in response to stepwise changes in O<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, when 1-day-old adults cultured at 21% were shifted to 7% O<sub>2</sub> overnight, their locomotory response to intermediate O<sub>2</sub> strongly increased compared to animals cultured at high oxygen throughout, and resembled that of animals that had been cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub> for their whole life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Conversely, animals shifted from 7% O<sub>2</sub> to a 21% oxygen environment decreased their locomotory speed at intermediate O<sub>2</sub> relative to animals cultured at 7% oxygen throughout, and their response resembled that of animals cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub> for their whole life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This shows that the tuning of oxygen responses depends on the O<sub>2</sub> conditions animals were cultured in and is plastic according to the most recent O<sub>2</sub> concentration change.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Previous oxygen experience determines the retention or loss of the plasticity of O<sub>2</sub> responses with age in <italic>C.Â elegans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Assay scheme for testing O<sub>2</sub>-evoked speed responses of day 1, day 4, day 7, and day 10 adults.

This suggests that the sensory ability itself remains largely intact until day 10 of adulthood but is accompanied by a progressive decline in locomotory ability, consistent with previous studies on the decline of <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system function with age, where locomotory speed typically reaches half-maximal capacity in 7â8 day-old adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Glenn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Podshivalova et al., 2017</xref>). Response tuning by O<sub>2</sub> culture condition, that is, the higher locomotory speed at intermediate O<sub>2</sub> concentrations of worms cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub> and lower speed of worms cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub>, is preserved in ageing animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C,E</xref>). We then tested if experience-dependent plasticity of O<sub>2</sub> responses declines with age, by switching 3-, 6-, and 9-day-old animals to the opposite O<sub>2</sub> environment for 12 hr and recording O<sub>2</sub>-evoked locomotion the next day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Animals that were cultured at high ambient O<sub>2</sub> and switched to 7% started to lose the ability to update their O<sub>2</sub>-evoked responses already at day 4 and by day 7 showed no difference to those of animals kept continuously at 21% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). By contrast, animals cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub> largely retained O<sub>2</sub> experience-dependent plasticity even up to day 10 of adulthood and changed their locomotory response to stepwise changes in O<sub>2</sub> concentration after switching to 21% O<sub>2</sub> for 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). We calculated a plasticity index based on the sum of the speed differential across measurement points, normalized to the plasticity in young adults (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods for details). The index documents the divergence in plasticity for worms exposed to a high or low oxygen environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The decline of cognitive plasticity with age is thus conditional on environmental state.</p><p>To test whether the plasticity loss in animals shifted from 21% to 7% O<sub>2</sub> and the plasticity retention in animals shifted from 7% to 21% O<sub>2</sub> may be a consequence of a bias in the assay paradigm, we compared the plasticity of 21% and 7% O<sub>2</sub> cultured animals after animals were shifted from 21% to 7% O<sub>2</sub>, or from 7% to 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G,H</xref>). Animals first cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub> and then cultured for 1 day at 7% O<sub>2</sub> showed significantly less plasticity after the 7%â21% O<sub>2</sub> shift than animals continuously kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G,I</xref>), while animals first cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub> and then cultured for 1 day at 21% O<sub>2</sub> show significantly higher plasticity after the 21%â7% O<sub>2</sub> shift than animals continuously kept at 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1H,I</xref>). This suggests that the decline rate of plasticity is dictated by the accumulated long-term environmental exposure to high or low O<sub>2</sub>, rather than the direction of the O<sub>2</sub> shift. In addition, we observed that the plasticity of 7-day-old 21% O<sub>2</sub>-raised animals cultured for 1 day at 7% O<sub>2</sub> before the plasticity experiment is significantly higher than that of animals kept at 21% O<sub>2</sub> throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1GâI</xref>).

In a 7â21% O<sub>2</sub> gradient, animals previously cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub> accumulated in a narrow range of O<sub>2</sub> near 7%, whereas those acclimated to 21% O<sub>2</sub> distributed over a broader range of concentrations between 7% and near 21% O<sub>2</sub>, showing attenuated avoidance to high and intermediate O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,H</xref>).

Treatment with the antioxidant NAC to reduce oxidative stress does not ameliorate the loss of experience-dependent plasticity in worms cultured at high oxygen. Together, these data indicate that the amount of neuronal activity governs the decline of cognitive plasticity with age: chronically high neuronal activity causes the decline and eventual loss of the ability of neurons to reconfigure their responses following sensory input changes, compromising their ability to generate behavioral plasticity and adaptation in ageing individuals, whereas neurons that are chronically under-active in the long term are better at retaining neuronal plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Neuronal activity state dynamically regulates gene expression in the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons during ageing</title><p>Sustained neuronal excitation and the associated elevated intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] profoundly affect gene transcription, reconfiguring functional properties of neurons and underpinning experience-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>).

For 1-day-old animals cultured in 21% O<sub>2</sub>, 7881 genes were differentially expressed in the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neuron samples when compared to whole-worm transcriptomes, of which 4058 genes were enriched in the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons (at a false discovery rate (FDR) ofÂ &lt;0.1 and a minimum fold change of 1.5). Genes known to be expressed in URX, AQR, and PQR neurons were among the most highly enriched transcripts in neuronal samples from both 1- and 7-day-old animals.

Very few of these DEGs were common to the neuronal and whole-worm gene sets, or to the young and old samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>). To determine which gene categories were enriched in the differentially expressed gene sets, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis. As expected, several GO terms were co-regulated in the same direction in the neuronal and whole-worm transcriptomes, which may reflect general cellular responses to ambient O<sub>2</sub> concentration. Specifically, genes involved in neuropeptide signaling were upregulated in both neurons and whole worm transcriptomes of young adults cultured at the high O<sub>2</sub> concentration, whereas several GO terms related to translation were downregulated in both neurons and whole worms at this O<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In 7-day-old worms, only one gene class overlapped between neurons and whole-worm samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Although the genes expressed in the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons that are upregulated at high O<sub>2</sub> overlap by only nine genes between young and old animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), they were enriched in many of the same categories of <italic>C. elegans</italic> phenotypes as shown by phenotype enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angeles-Albores et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

This is notable as <italic>C. elegans</italic> display persistently high locomotory activity at 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The GO terms that were enriched in genes differentially expressed at high or low O<sub>2</sub> concentration specifically in O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons were very different in young and old adult worms: no categories were co-regulated in the same way in both age groups. In neurons from young animals, only lipid transport was upregulated by high O<sub>2</sub>, whereas most categories that were downregulated were linked to cellular organization and signaling processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons largely do not rely on inducing transcription to maintain high neural activity in young adults. By contrast, in neurons from old animals all enriched gene groups were upregulated at high O<sub>2</sub>, which signifies chronically high neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). These gene groups were related to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes and signaling pathways such as cGMP signaling, which is essential for O<sub>2</sub> sensory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Couto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

However, their expression is upregulated with high neuronal activity in day 7 adultsâ O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons, but not in day 1 adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). The aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway, which controls expression of the soluble guanylate cyclase genes essential for oxygen sensing, is increased with age at high activity, but decreased at low activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The activity-related genes we identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic> showed a significant decrease in dPRG transcript abundance in low-activity O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons with age, whereas dPRG expression levels in the high-activity neurons were sustained with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

Oxidative stress in neurons generally increases with age and causes their greater susceptibility to oxidative insults and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Castelli et al., 2019</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis shows that oxidative stress-related genes and related GO terms were specifically upregulated with age in the high-activity O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons, whereas only two of these GO terms, such as cell redox homeostasis, showed enrichment with age in the low-activity neurons as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>); no such increase in any of these GO terms was seen in the whole worm transcriptomes.

O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neuron-specific knockdown of <italic>tax-6</italic> in 1-day-old adults altered the response pattern to the stepwise changes in O<sub>2</sub> concentration both of animals cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub> throughout and of those shifted to 21% O<sub>2Â </sub>12 hours before the assay, while animals kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub> prior to the experiment behaved normally. Specifically, worms exposed to 21% O<sub>2</sub> were less able to slow down at intermediate O<sub>2</sub> (between 19% and 14% O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). As a result, <italic>tax-6</italic> RNAi eliminated plasticity in young animals in the 21% to 7% O<sub>2</sub> shift assay and significantly reduced plasticity in the 7% to 21% O<sub>2</sub> shift experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Like their 1-day-old adult counterparts, 7-day-old adults cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub> with <italic>tax-6</italic> knocked down showed no plasticity, with no significant behavioral difference to controls of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,H</xref>). Remarkably, 7% O<sub>2</sub> cultured animals subject to cell-specific <italic>tax-6</italic> RNAi show significantly less age-related decline of O<sub>2</sub>-evoked speed responses. Specifically, locomotory speed at high O<sub>2</sub> levels increased compared to controls for animals cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub> throughout and in those shifted to 21% O<sub>2</sub>12 hr prior to the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Plasticity was retained with age in the same way as in 7-day-old control animals cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). The beneficial effect of <italic>tax-6</italic> knockdown was only seen in animals with low neuronal activity in O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons, suggesting that calcineurin signaling contributes to the decline of O<sub>2</sub>-evoked behavior with age under physiological conditions of stimulation. Moreover, since knockdown of <italic>tax-6</italic> did not restore plasticity in 7-day-old 21% O<sub>2</sub> cultured animals, the CMD-1-induced plasticity loss is likely to be acting through a calcineurin-independent pathway. Overall, <italic>tax-6</italic>/calcineurin regulates the tuning of locomotory speed responses to stepwise changes in O<sub>2</sub> concentrations and O<sub>2</sub> experience-dependent plasticity in young adults, and promotes the decline of locomotory responses with age under physiological conditions.</p><p>The ryanodine receptor UNC-68 is an endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel and involved in sustaining tonic sensory responses in the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref>).

These results suggest that NCX-5 plays an essential and specific role in sustaining experience-dependent plasticity during ageing and in enabling older animals to adapt to new environments.</p><p>We hypothesized that the accelerated behavioral plasticity decline in ageing animals with <italic>ncx-5</italic> knockdown may be a consequence of altered O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons of young adults. To test this, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of the URX O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons in both 2-day and 7-day-old adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>).

Intriguingly, although <italic>ncx-5</italic> knockdown did not change the behavioral plasticity of 2-day-old adults, it did reduce plasticity of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses: <italic>ncx-5</italic> RNAi animals shifted from 21% to 7% O<sub>2</sub> for 12 hr increased their Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to O<sub>2</sub> stimuli, compared to those cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub> throughout, less strongly than control animals did upon the same treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Also in the converse experiment, control animals shifted from 7% to 21% O<sub>2</sub> for 12 hr very significantly reduced their responses to high and intermediate O<sub>2</sub> stimuli, whereas with <italic>ncx-5</italic> knocked down, URX Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to the O<sub>2</sub> stimuli were not significantly different between animals shifted from 7% to 21% O<sub>2</sub> and those cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub> throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Therefore, the ability of the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons to adapt to changing O<sub>2</sub> environments requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance by NCX-5 already in young adults. The accumulated effect of lack of NCX-5 during ageing may be the cause of accelerated behavioral plasticity decline. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of <italic>ncx-5</italic> in URX elevates baseline [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at 7% O<sub>2</sub> in low O<sub>2</sub> cultured animals, where the neuron is inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This suggests that impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis at rest may be responsible for accelerating the plasticity decline. To further explore this, we tested if knockdown of <italic>cmd-1</italic>, which slows plasticity decline, alters Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis as well, by performing Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in URX.

Together, these results suggest that the control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in young adults by NCX-5 in low-activity neurons and CMD-1 in high-activity neurons determines if behavioral plasticity is retained or lost in aged animals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>NCX-5 and CMD-1 control neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis to affect plasticity decline with age.</title><p>(<bold>AâB</bold>) URX Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of day 2 adults cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub> and shifted to 7% O<sub>2</sub> overnight with control L4440 (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>ncx-5</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) RNAi knockdown in O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons.

Thus, these data suggest that neuronal activity state affects age-related plasticity decline independent of lifespan-regulating pathways.</p><p>Overall, our results indicate that factors linked to neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling govern the decline of the experience-dependent plasticity in O<sub>2</sub> responses with age.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As we grow older, the brain functionally deteriorates and is increasingly at risk of neurodegeneration and dementia. Neural plasticity as the basis of learning and memory formation is among the earliest cognitive functions to deteriorate with age, but the underlying molecular and physiological processes are little understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park and Bischof, 2013</xref>). Here, we establish a new behavioral paradigm in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to mechanistically dissect neural plasticity decline with age. Ambient oxygen drives robust and long-lasting neuronal activation and avoidance behavior of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> also adapts to recently changed oxygen environments on a timescale of hours by showing increased or decreased sensitivity to intermediate oxygen levels, resulting in altered aerotaxis. This reprogramming of the behavior is reflected in plasticity of the URX sensory neuronsâ response to oxygen stimuli, in which a prior shift from a 21% to a 7% O<sub>2</sub> environment strongly sensitizes O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the cell body. The reprogramming of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of the sensory neuron itself suggests a form of intrinsic neuronal plasticity operating in URX, where long-term changes in input cause the persistent modification of its intrinsic electrical properties to adjust their excitability relative to input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Debanne et al., 2019</xref>). Intrinsic neuronal plasticity is involved in mediating learning and memory and in homeostatic regulation, but few studies have investigated it in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mozzachiodi and Byrne, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, we found that the decline of O<sub>2</sub>-evoked plasticity with age is conditional on the O<sub>2</sub> environment â in animals cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub>, plasticity rapidly declines and is lost within one week of adulthood, whereas at 7% O<sub>2</sub> culture, plasticity was sustained even in 10-day-old adults. For comparison, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> chemotaxis, learning and memory abilities start to decline after 2â3 days of adulthood and are lost by the end of the first week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> oxygen-sensing neurons are tonic sensors which show chronically elevated neural activity and cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> for as long as they are exposed to 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). Our data provide compelling support for the hypothesis that the behavioral plasticity decline with age is specifically induced by chronic high neuronal activity rather than ambient O<sub>2</sub>-induced high oxidative stress: long-term chemogenetic inhibition of neuronal activity in the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons by HisCl1 was sufficient to restore behavioral plasticity in day 7 adults cultured at high oxygen, while chronic optogenetic excitation of the URX O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons strongly impaired behavioral plasticity of day four adults cultured at low oxygen. In contrast, antioxidant treatment did not improve plasticity decline with age, although a reduction of whole worm oxidative stress was observed. Furthermore, in our RNA-seq data, there was little overlap between neuronal and whole-worm differentially expressed genes in response to different O<sub>2</sub> levels in both young and old adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), which further supports a specific and profound role played by neural activity state in governing plasticity decline with age, distinct from a general effect of O<sub>2</sub>-induced cellular oxidative stress. Interestingly, 5-day-old worms grown at 21% O<sub>2</sub> and switched to 7% O<sub>2</sub> for 24 hr showed a substantial recovery of plasticity, which suggests the loss of plasticity due to chronic hyperactivity in the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons is not permanent and can be restored by prolonged reduction of neural activity even in aged animals.</p><p>Our results point to neural excitation and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] as key determinants of the decline of neural plasticity with age, where persistently high neural activity state causes neurons to lose their ability to adapt and learn new information, while previously learned responses are maintained. The transcriptomics data suggest that neuronal activity regulates neuronal transcriptome dynamically during ageing. Genes that form the oxygen-sensing machinery and those directly related to oxygen responses such as cGMP signaling; those that defend cells against oxidative stress; genes linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling; and activity-regulated genes are all significantly more highly expressed in ageing O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons maintained at chronically high activity, compared to ageing neurons kept at low activity. In contrast, genes required for learning or modulation of synaptic transmission are downregulated with age in the high-activity but not the low-activity neurons. Based on these data, we propose that chronically high activity causes neurons to direct resources toward maintaining a high tonic firing rate, sustaining cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, and defending themselves against increased oxidative stress caused by elevated neural activity; leaving fewer resources for the cellular mechanisms required for maintaining neural plasticity. It would be interesting to compare our differential gene expression data with transcriptomics data obtained from regions of ageing human brains associated with high or low neural activity, to determine whether age-related transcriptional changes altered by neuronal activity affect evolutionarily conserved pathways.</p><p>Another important finding from the cell-type-specific RNA sequencing is that genes underlying neuronal function, including those involved directly in sensing oxygen, are generally downregulated in the aged O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons, consistent with previous findings in the ageing brains of mouse, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Aplysia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Greer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ximerakis et al., 2019</xref>). It is not well understood how the downregulation of neuronal activity-related genes relates to ageing processes. A recent study reported that global inhibition of neuronal activity can extend lifespan in humans, mice and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zullo et al., 2019</xref>). Also, lowering neuronal activity reduces tau propagation and Î²-amyloid deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yuan and Grutzendler, 2016</xref>). This suggests that the downregulation of neuronal activity does not simply reflect a decline of neuronal function with age but may have a protective role in longevity. Such downregulation would be expected to sacrifice neuronal responsiveness and especially experience-dependent plasticity, which depends on new gene synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>). However, the ability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to generate oxygen-evoked behaviors in 7-day-old adults shows only a modest decline. In that regard, it is noteworthy that the most significant gene classes upregulated in aged neurons are translational and ribosome biogenesis-related genes, in particular the eIF2 and eIF4 signaling pathways which control translational initiation. So far, the purpose of upregulating the neuronal translation machinery with age is unknown. It is possible that it constitutes an adaptation to compensate for the wide-ranging decline of genes required for neuronal function, to sustain continued functioning and sensory responses of the ageing nervous system. This upregulation is neuron-specific, as gene ontology terms related to translation were generally downregulated in the whole-worm samples. Neuron-specific upregulation of translation factors and ribosome biogenesis with age has also been identified in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ximerakis et al., 2019</xref>), rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ori et al., 2015</xref>), killifish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumgart et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davie et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that it is a highly conserved mechanism in neuronal ageing. This different transcriptional regulation of translational and ribosome biogenesis pathways is consistent with the idea that nervous system ageing is distinct from that of other tissues. In the future, it will be interesting to investigate whether interfering the age-dependent upregulation of translation and ribosome biogenesis processes affects cognitive performance in ageing animals.</p><p>A wealth of studies supports the hypothesis that dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is responsible for the decline of neural and cognitive function with age and increases the risk of neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms involved are little understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berridge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lerdkrai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pchitskaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thibault et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Toescu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Toescu and Verkhratsky, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Toescu and Verkhratsky, 2007b</xref>). Our study determines Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis control as a critical intermediary between neuronal activity and neuronal ageing, and identifies specific and distinct roles of calmodulin, calcineurin, the NCKX K<sup>+</sup>-dependent Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger and the Kidins220/ARMS scaffold protein in the neuronal activity-dependent plasticity decline with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). All four proteins are involved in regulating neural Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagur and HajnÃ³czky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hassan and Lytton, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jaudon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mansuy, 2003</xref>), and NCKX and Kidins220 were not previously known to contribute to cognitive decline. Reduction of calmodulin (<italic>cmd-1</italic>), calcineurin (<italic>tax-6</italic>) and Kidins220 (<italic>kdin-1</italic>) generally had a beneficial effect, promoting plasticity and/or locomotory activity with age, whereas removal of NCKX (<italic>ncx-5</italic>) accelerated the decline of plasticity, suggesting that the decline of plasticity is an actively managed process in which individual Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated pathways play different roles.</p><p>Our findings suggest a model where in the high neural activity state, intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is chronically elevated, and the resulting overactivation of calmodulin/CMD-1 promotes a gradual decline of plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>cmd-1</italic> restores behavioral plasticity in ageing worms by reducing intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] without otherwise changing the O<sub>2</sub>-evoked speed response, and is likely acting through a calcineurin-independent pathway, as <italic>tax-6</italic> knockdown does not phenocopy the effect of <italic>cmd-1</italic> RNAi. Calcineurin as an early responder to Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to act in a negative feedback loop to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, contributing to downregulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling by weakening Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mansuy, 2003</xref>). <italic>tax-6</italic> knockdown eliminated plasticity in the highly active O<sub>2</sub> neurons of young and old worms, which may be the result of an excessive rise of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Likewise, removal of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger NCX-5 would impair Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from the cytosol and did indeed not have any beneficial effect on the plasticity loss of the highly active neurons. <italic>ncx-5</italic> expression is upregulated with high activity, presumably in response to the increased demand of extruding intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from highly active neurons.</p><p>In contrast, we found that neuron-specific knockdown of <italic>kdin-1,</italic> whose expression is sustained with age in high-activity neurons but significantly decreases in low-activity neurons, restores experience-dependent plasticity in 7-day-old adults cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub>. <italic>kdin-1</italic> is a member of the Kidins220 (kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa)/ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning (ARMS) family, which acts as a signaling platform at the plasma membrane. Kidins220 controls neuronal activity and excitability and negatively regulates long-term potentiation in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Strack et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study in glia cells showed that it regulates intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis via store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jaudon et al., 2020</xref>). Tantalizingly, Kidins220 expression is regulated by neural activity levels, and in turn inhibits synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scholz-Starke and Cesca, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these results suggest an evolutionarily conserved mechanism where persistent expression of Kidins220/<italic>kdin-1</italic> in ageing neurons causes plasticity loss, while plasticity is sustained in those cells that downregulate <italic>kdin-1</italic> expression with age. It will be interesting to explore in future studies if CMD-1 and KDIN-1 act in the same pathway to induce age-related plasticity decline.</p><p>In neurons that are at a lower activity state, intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is kept at low levels. Surprisingly, in aged neurons maintained at lower activity, <italic>tax-6</italic> RNAi not only did not decrease plasticity but even improved overall O<sub>2</sub>-evoked behavioral responses, suggesting, and consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mansuy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shibasaki et al., 2002</xref>), that calcineurin has multiple distinct roles in regulating excitability and plasticity. Calmodulin/CMD-1 is only partially activated at low activity but may act together with calcineurin/TAX-6 and the ryanodine receptor/UNC-68 to decrease responsiveness in aged neurons. The NCKX/NCX-5 exchanger is responsible for maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by removing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm, and we found that its function is required for the plasticity of neurons to adapt to changing O<sub>2</sub> levels. Possibly because of the reduced demand for clearing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol compared to high activity neurons, ageing low-activity neurons express less NCX-5.</p><p>An important conclusion from our data is that loss of <italic>ncx-5</italic> alters neuronal responsiveness and plasticity of the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons already in young adults, preceding the defects in behavioral plasticity caused by cell-specific removal of <italic>ncx-5</italic>. The age-related decline in the expression levels of genes mediating neuronal function, including of <italic>ncx-5</italic>, may represent an impairment of a âcognitive reserveâ, causing the dissimilar effects of loss of specific neuronal functions on the cognitive performance of young and old individuals. Young adults seem to have higher resilience to a certain level loss of neuronal function than older adults, by compensating for reduced neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis for example.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the mechanisms governing the decline of learning and memory in ageing animals intersect with the pathways regulating ageing and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stein and Murphy, 2012</xref>). It would be interesting in future studies to examine long-lived mutants such as <italic>daf-2</italic> to see whether they are resistant to the decline in plasticity caused by high O<sub>2</sub> exposure. Our data on the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neuron-specific knockdown of lifespan regulators suggest that neuronal activity state affects age-related plasticity decline independent of lifespan-regulating pathways, in particular of IIS/FOXO signaling. Thus, any effect in long-lived mutants would likely be non-cell-autonomous.</p><p>In summary, our study reveals that sustained high neural activity alters the neuronal ageing trajectory and negatively impacts plasticity in the ageing brain. Through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked signaling and transcriptional changes, cellular resources are likely redirected away from sustaining neuronal plasticity and toward maintaining and supporting persistently high excitation. Our study and previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell and Hardingham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berridge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bezprozvanny, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Foster, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pchitskaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Toescu and Verkhratsky, 2007a</xref>) support a model that both too low and too high neuronal activity have negative long-term effects on neuronal heath and plasticity. Treatments that moderately reduce neural activity and correct dysregulated neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in hyperactive neurons may be beneficial for early-stage intervention in cognitive decline and neurodegenerative conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E.Â coli</italic>)</td><td>OP50</td><td>CGC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:OP50">WB-STRAIN:OP50</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>AX204</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coates and de Bono, 2002</xref></td><td/><td><italic>npr-1(ad609) X</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>AX1864</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch et al., 2012</xref></td><td/><td><italic>npr-1(ad609) X;

After 48 hr, adults were transferred to the second RNAi plate seeded with the same bacteria, and their progeny was used for the assays. For RNAi by feeding experiments in young adults we assayed 2-day-old adults instead of day 1 adults because RNAi knockdown is more efficient at this age (data not shown). KL92 was used for behavioral assays and KL317 for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging; in both strains, expression of the RNA transporter <italic>sid-1</italic> was limited to the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons by transgenic expression from the <italic>gcy-32</italic> promoter to achieve cell-specific knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Calixto et al., 2010</xref>).

Worms were then washed rapidly with M9 buffer five times. 200 Âµl room temperature pronase (15 mg/ml, dissolved in 340mOsm L15) was added and worms were incubated for 8â15 min. During pronase incubation, a pellet pestle motor was used every 2â3 min for 10 s each time to dissociate and homogenize worm cells. After each round of using the pellet pestle motor, dissociation was monitored by checking 2 Âµl of the pronase suspension under the microscope. When the majority of big worm chunks were no longer visible, 800 Âµl ice-cold BSA (0.2%)/L-15 (340mOsm) was added to stop the reaction. At this point, 10 Âµl of the dissociated worm solution of each sample was transferred to 300 Âµl RNA extraction buffer (PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus Bioscience)) and kept on ice. This solution was subsequently used to determine the whole-worm transcriptome. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 9600 g for 5 min at 4Â°C and then resuspended using 1 ml ice-cold BSA (0.2%)/L-15 (340mOsm), and immediately passed through a 10 Âµm filter for sorting.</p><p>For FACS sorting, age-matched AX204 worms were used as negative control for setting gates.

Using the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the authors show here that sustained hyperactivity of a specific neuron type accelerates this decline. Together with other work, this suggests that healthy aging relies on a 'sweet spot' of neural activity; levels that are too high may divert resources away from programs that maintain plasticity as neurons age.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;High neural activity accelerates the decline of cognitive plasticity with age in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thorsten Hoppe (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In your paper, you examine the effects of persistent neuronal activity, using the <italic>C. elegans</italic> oxygen-sensing neurons as a model, on neuronal plasticity and behavior. Interestingly, chronic exposure to high oxygen, but not low oxygen, leads to age-related declines in neural plasticity. Your paper also provides evidence that this is a specific consequence of chronic activity of the O2 neurons, but we would like this idea to be further tested (see below). Further, using cell-specific transcriptomics and knockdown experiments, you identified specific molecular mechanisms that contribute to the enhancement of age-related decline. The reviewers found these to be very interesting findings that provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal plasticity in aging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Before your work is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, there are several points that must be addressed.</p><p>1) There is concern about whether the effects you see on gene expression and behavior are truly due to increased activity of the oxygen-sensing neurons, rather than other effects of high oxygen exposure. For example, some of these could result from general cellular adaptations to high oxygen; further, stimulation of the oxygen-sensing neurons leads to increased cytoplasmic cGMP, which could itself have a significant impact on gene expression. Your revised manuscript should directly test whether increased neuronal activity itself is the cause of the changes you observe after chronic high-oxygen exposure. The reviewers feel that the best way to do this would be to examine the effects of optogenetic stimulation of oxygen-sensing neurons in a 7% oxygen environment.</p><p>2) Some interpretations of the calcium-imaging experiments are unconvincing, owing to high levels of noise and small sample size. Because of this, it is not clear that the decline of behavioral plasticity that you report is also occurring at a physiological level. Specifically, in Figure 2C and D, you claim that while there is no plasticity in panel C, there is instead in panel D. However, the noise is so large in these recordings that this interpretation becomes questionable. In Figure 2F, the mean of YA at D1 kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub> (gray triangles) seems higher due to three data points that appear to be outliers. Therefore, the difference between 21% and 7% groups could be much smaller and may even be not significant. The same applies to Figure 2E. In your revised manuscript, these concerns should be addressed by carrying out additional calcium imaging experiments.</p><p>3) In Figure 3, it is not clear whether the behavior of worms with silenced O<sub>2</sub> sensing neurons was assayed at 7% O<sub>2</sub>. This control seems to be missing from the manuscript. Please add it or explain why it is not necessary.</p><p>4) The genetic background used for RNAi knock-down is not clearly specified in the text or the figures. These experiments need to be done in a way that avoids RNAi spreading (e.g., in a <italic>sid-1</italic> mutant background). Please clarify this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59711.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is concern about whether the effects you see on gene expression and behavior are truly due to increased activity of the oxygen-sensing neurons, rather than other effects of high oxygen exposure.

In Figure 3 of the first submission, we showed, using chemogenetic silencing of the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons, that high neural activity is <italic>necessary</italic> to accelerate the decline of plasticity. However, we did not demonstrate that high neural activity is <italic>sufficient</italic> to accelerate cognitive decline. We have now performed chronic optogenetic stimulation of the URX O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons in a 7% O<sub>2</sub> environment, using Channelrhodopsin, and find that this treatment significantly reduces behavioural plasticity during ageing, while control animals show no significant decline. The chronic stimulation only alters the behaviour of animals that are switched to 21% O<sub>2</sub> but not that of animals kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub> throughout, which suggests that chronic activity of URX does not alter O<sub>2</sub> responses per se, but specifically changes how the plasticity of the O<sub>2</sub> response declines with age. These new data have been added to Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some interpretations of the calcium-imaging experiments are unconvincing, owing to high levels of noise and small sample size.

We performed power calculation on the previously submitted Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data for the comparison group showing the smallest effect (D7LT7ON21 vs. D7LT7ON7 at 14% [O<sub>2</sub>], Figure 2D) and the observed power is 0.56 at the detected effect size (d=0.81). For a power of 0.8, 21 recordings per group would be required to claim significance at that effect size. We therefore have done further Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging recordings, incorporated in Figure 2 of the resubmission, reaching at least 25 recordings per condition. These data confirm the previous finding that there is no plasticity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in 7-day-old URX neurons when cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub>, but that those cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub> retain plasticity. In the combined results, <italic>p</italic> values decrease for all three conditions that did show plasticity in the URX Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (D1 adults kept at 21% O<sub>2</sub> (panel A), D1 adults kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub> (panel B) and D7 adults kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub> (panel D)). In contrast, the <italic>p</italic> value for D7 adults kept at 21% O<sub>2</sub> (panel C) still shows no significant difference:</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"><break/></th><th valign="top">Panel A <break/></th><th valign="top">Panel B <break/></th><th valign="top">Panel C <break/></th><th valign="top">Panel D <break/></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><italic>p</italic> values of recordings in first submission: <break/></td><td valign="top">0.0025 (**) <break/></td><td valign="top">0.0459 (*) <break/></td><td valign="top">0.7609 (ns) <break/></td><td valign="top">0.0478 (*) <break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>p</italic> values with new recordings included: <break/></td><td valign="top">0.0004 (***) <break/></td><td valign="top">0.006 (**) <break/></td><td valign="top">0.6357 (ns) <break/></td><td valign="top">0.0031 (**) <break/></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The additional recordings therefore significantly strengthen our conclusion that plasticity of URX responses is lost with age only in animals cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub>, but not in those cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Concerning the outliers (that is, neurons responding particularly strongly to the stimulus) in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of 1-day-old adults, removing them from both the 21% and 7% groups does not change the outcomes of the statistical comparison. Specifically, the scatterplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> show the combined old and new data with day 1 outliers removed (cf. Figure 2E, F in the first submission, and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C, D in the resubmission). Removing the outliers decreases the <italic>p</italic> value of the comparison between the first and third column of the left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> (cf. Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D in the resubmission), which demonstrates that the significantly higher mean of D1 young adults kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub> (gray triangles) compared to that of D1 adults kept at 21% O<sub>2</sub> (grey dots) is not due to an outlier effect. In the panel on the right (cf. Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C in the resubmission), removing outliers does not alter the outcomes of the statistical comparisons.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59711-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3, it is not clear whether the behavior of worms with silenced O<sub>2</sub> sensing neurons was assayed at 7% O<sub>2</sub>.
