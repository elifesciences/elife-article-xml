However, the spatial organization and viability of its bacterial components remain unclear. Here, we apply culturing, imaging, and molecular approaches to human and mouse skin samples, and find that the skin surface is colonized by fewer viable bacteria than predicted by bacterial DNA levels. Instead, viable skin-associated bacteria are predominantly located in hair follicles and other cutaneous invaginations. Furthermore, we show that the skin microbiome has a uniquely low fraction of viable bacteria compared to other human microbiome sites, indicating that most bacterial DNA on the skin surface is not associated with viable cells Additionally, a small number of bacterial families dominate each skin site and traditional sequencing methods overestimate both the richness and diversity of the skin microbiome. Finally, we performed an in vivo skin microbiome perturbation-recovery study using human volunteers. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that, while the skin microbiome is remarkably stable even in the wake of aggressive perturbation, repopulation of the skin surface is driven by the underlying viable population. Our findings help explain the dynamics of skin microbiome perturbation as bacterial DNA on the skin surface can be transiently perturbed but is replenished by a stable underlying viable population. These results address multiple outstanding questions in skin microbiome biology with significant implications for future efforts to study and manipulate it.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>bacterial viability</kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1AI124669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acosta</surname><given-names>Ellen M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bratton</surname><given-names>Benjamin P</given-names></name><name><surname>Gitai</surname><given-names>Zemer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acosta</surname><given-names>Ellen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-1734030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bratton</surname><given-names>Benjamin P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TL1TR003019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acosta</surname><given-names>Ellen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018582</institution-id><institution>Penn Skin Biology and Diseases Resource-based Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-AR069589</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Payne</surname><given-names>Aimee S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The bacterial DNA on the surface of human and mouse skin is primarily from dead bacteria while viable skin microbiome bacteria mostly colonize subsurface skin structures like hair follicles.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The skin is the largest organ in the human body, providing roughly 25 square meters for potential hostâmicrobe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallo, 2017</xref>).

Human skin is also home to the organisms that comprise the skin microbiome, which has been shown to have important roles in human health. For example, the human skin microbiome affects immune system education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scharschmidt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Polak-Witka et al., 2020</xref>), wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kalan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loesche et al., 2017</xref>), colonization resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd et al., 2018</xref>), modulation of gene expression in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meisel et al., 2018b</xref>), and may have a role in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meisel et al., 2018a</xref>). Despite the many contributions of the skin microbiome to human health, there are important questions that have not been addressed by traditional methods: Why is the skin microbiome stable across months in longitudinal studies yet easily perturbed upon transient environmental changes like swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nielsen and Jiang, 2019</xref>)? Why are there so many anaerobic bacteria on an organ exposed to the air? And why is it so difficult to stably colonize the skin with new microbes without strong perturbations like abrasion? Traditional methods of sampling, culturing, and sequencing the bacterial members of the skin microbiome have been indispensable for establishing the skin microbiome field. Here, we extend these foundational studies with additional approaches to differentiate between viable and nonviable bacteria in order to begin to address these important questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fluorescence in situ hybridization reveals few bacteria on the skin surface</title><p>The predominant method by which skin microbiomes have been studied is through sequencing of DNA from swabbed skin areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huttenhower et al., 2012</xref>). However, despite the fact that the skin microbiome is often depicted as a well-mixed coating of microbes on the skin surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grice and Segre, 2011</xref>), it remains unclear whether the DNA from the skin surface reflects the underlying biology of the skin microbiome. Additionally, while sequencing and culture-based studies have demonstrated that bacteria extend into deeper portions of the skin, the spatial distribution of the skin microbiome as a whole has not been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Polak-Witka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belkaid and Tamoutounour, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lousada et al., 2021</xref>). To address this gap, we determined the spatial distribution of bacterial cells in the skin using the universal bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe EUB338, which hybridizes to bacterial 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amann et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>We first used EUB338 FISH on biopsied healthy adult human facial tissues and found that the skin surface contains very few bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, clusters of bacteria were found within hair follicles and other cutaneous skin structures like comedos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). There are several possible explanations for the lack of FISH staining on the skin surface. For example, viable surface bacteria may have been eliminated by sterilization of the biopsied area (we address this possibility below). Alternatively, the surface bacteria could exist in a state like stationary phase that has fewer EUB388-hybridizable ribosomes, or by skin microbiome bacterial species being less prone to FISH probe hybridization. However, we confirmed that EUB338 staining works well in stationary-phase cells of multiple skin microbiome bacterial species (<italic>Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus,</italic> and <italic>Corynebacterium striatum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) staining of human tissue.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Scale bar = 20 Âµm.

We refer to this ratio as an enrichment score. The median enrichment score for human follicles was 11.24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, the skin surface (stratum corneum) had an enrichment score of just 0.188. This pattern of observing many bacteria in follicles but few on the skin surface held true when using FISH probes specific for <italic>C. acnes</italic>, one of the most abundant bacterial species in the human skin microbiome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For <italic>C. acnes</italic>, the enrichment score was 3.14 for follicles compared to 0.67 for the stratum corneum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We note that while the majority of intact skin-associated bacteria were not associated with the skin surface, there are some visible bacteria on the skin surface, especially in areas near subsurface structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This indicates that FISH staining is capable of detecting bacteria on the skin surface. Thus, our results are consistent with previous reports that bacteria can be cultured from skin surface swabs but also extend these findings to demonstrate that the skin surface has fewer intact bacteria than deeper skin structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bacterial DNA on the skin surface overrepresents the number of viable bacteria</title><p>DNA sequencing of samples collected by swabbing the skin surface is the most common method used to evaluate the skin microbiome because it is simple, noninvasive, and has been shown to result in higher consistency than other sampling methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjerre et al., 2019</xref>). However, traditional metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing do not differentiate DNA from viable and inviable bacteria. We thus implemented a method that allowed us to quantitatively determine the fraction of DNA in a sample that is specifically from intact bacteria. The ability to molecularly differentiate between viable and inviable cells would enable us to both validate our FISH results using an orthogonal method on untreated, living skin, and address the possibility that the low numbers of intact surface bacteria observed by FISH were due to biopsy sterilization. To this end, we utilized the cell-impermeable small molecule propidium monoazide (PMA), which binds irreversibly to double-stranded DNA upon photoactivation to inhibit PCR amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nocker et al., 2006</xref>). When PMA photoactivation is performed before the cell lysis step of DNA isolation, the genomic DNA inside viable bacteria is protected from PMA binding because PMA is cell-impermeable, while cell-free DNA or DNA within permeabilized bacteria becomes PMA-bound. To quantify bacterial DNA, we combined the use of PMA with droplet digital PCR (PMA-ddPCR). Calculating the ratio of ddPCR counts between samples without PMA and samples with PMA allowed us to generate a viability score for any given bacterial population. A similar approach has been used to assess the viability of bacteria from environmental waste water samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Propidium monoazide-droplet digital PCR (PMA-ddPCR) and viability scores for human skin and non-skin microbiomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the PMA-ddPCR workflow.

We performed serial dilutions of each bacterial culture and in parallel performed both colony-forming units (CFU) plating and ddPCR with or without PMA. In every case, the amount of DNA in a sample (assessed by PMA-ddPCR) correlated well with the number of culturable bacteria in high and low bacterial abundance scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these controls confirm that PMA-ddPCR is a reliable method for assessing the amount of DNA in a sample present within intact bacteria.</p><p>We next applied PMA-ddPCR to human skin microbiome samples by swabbing the skin of four healthy human volunteers at eight sites (glabella, retroauricular crease, lower back, hair shaft, antecubital fossa, popliteal fossa, nares, and dorsal forearm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A and B</xref>). PMA-ddPCR revealed that the viability scores for these sites ranged between 0.02 and 0.12 (0 represents a fully nonviable population, 1.0 represents a fully viable population), indicating that the majority of bacterial DNA found on the skin surface are not associated with viable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To investigate whether this was a skin-specific phenomenon, we tested several non-skin microbiome sites (tongue, saliva, plaque, and feces). We found that in all non-skin microbiome sites, the viability score was significantly higher than for the skin, ranging from 0.4 (saliva) to 0.87 (feces) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to address whether our PMA-ddPCR viability scores accurately represent of the number of viable bacteria on the skin surface. The low number of detectable bacteria on the skin surface (either by FISH or PMA-ddPCR) does not imply that the skin surface is sterile but rather that the majority of the bacterial DNA on the skin surface are not from these viable cells. Indeed, culturing bacteria directly from the skin is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd et al., 2018</xref>). To quantify the number of viable bacteria directly, we plated a small amount of each sample using the standard conditions for culturing skin microbes (5% sheep blood in tryptic soy agarose plates incubated both aerobically and anaerobically). To determine whether PMA-ddPCR or traditional ddPCR better represented the number of viable skin microbiome bacteria, we compared our results to a standard curve generated with known numbers of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. For each sample, the PMA-ddPCR quantification closely matched this standard curve while the samples lacking PMA showed no overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>). The highest abundance skin microbiome species are readily culturable, such that quantifying the DNA from viable skin surface bacteria should be able to accurately predict CFUs upon plating. Quantifying the bacterial DNA in skin microbiome samples without the use of PMA resulted in DNA quantities that were, on average, 82 times higher than predicted by the standard curve, while the use of PMA brought this value down to just 1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Using ddPCR counts to predict CFU showed similar results, as ddPCR in the absence of PMA yielded values that predicted CFU counts 58.5 times greater than those measured, while PMA-ddPCR yielded values that predicted CFU counts that were on average only 1.28 times greater than the actual cultured CFU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Since we expect a ratio near 1, these findings lend further support for our conclusion that PMA-ddPCR reflects the viable microbiome better than the approaches lacking PMA.</p><p>Our FISH results from biopsied skin suggested that viable bacteria may be protected below the skin surface. To test this hypothesis in untreated skin, we collected facial follicle contents and used PMA-ddPCR to compare the viability of facial follicle contents and skin surface samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The average viability for follicle contents was greater than tenfold higher for follicle contents than for the skin surface, confirming that cells in hair follicles are more viable than those on the skin surface. Together, our results from FISH on biopsies and PMA-ddPCR on skin swabs independently support the conclusion that the skin surface is populated by few viable bacterial cells, indicating that the surface of healthy, non-sterilized human skin is sparsely colonized. While these data indicate that bacterial DNA on the skin surface is predominantly not associated with viable bacterial cells, we note that our results do not suggest that there are no viable cells on the skin surface. Rather, our data indicate that the majority of the bacterial DNA on the skin surface are not within bacteria such that using PMA provides a much more accurate estimation of the viable skin microbiome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Traditional sequencing methods overestimate skin microbiome richness and diversity</title><p>Like many microbiomes, the existing knowledge of the skin microbiome is heavily based upon bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, which was developed to assess bacterial populations while avoiding biases introduced by culturing methods. However, our findings suggest that using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to study the skin microbiome is not entirely unbiased as most of the DNA in these samples are not from viable bacteria and traditional 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing does not differentiate between DNA originating from live or dead cells. The inability of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to differentiate between these two types of bacterial populations has been mentioned as a potential downfall of the method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd et al., 2018</xref>). To evaluate how accurately traditional 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing captures the living skin microbiome composition, we utilized PMA followed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (an approach we refer to as PMA-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nocker et al., 2010</xref>). By sequencing pairs of matched samples with PMA treatment (PMA-seq) and without PMA treatment (traditional sequencing), we were able to explore how closely the microbiome compositions obtained from traditional sequencing methods resembled the viable microbiome composition obtained by PMA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These experiments established that at each skin site sampled, compared to traditional sequencing, the PMA-treated samples were less rich (richness, <italic>R,</italic> is a measure of the number of identifiable bacterial taxa) and less diverse (diversity, <italic>H,</italic> is measured by the Shannon diversity index) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Furthermore, samples that had greater richness in traditional sequencing (<italic>R</italic><sub>trad</sub>) showed proportionally larger decreases in richness and Shannon diversity with PMA-seq (<italic>R</italic><sub>PMA</sub> and <italic>H</italic><sub>PMA</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). These results suggest that, although it appears by traditional sequencing that there is a wide range of richness values at different skin sites (1â30 different taxa), in reality the richness across the skin microbiome at different body sites is relatively similar and low (1â10 different taxa). Thus, though there appears to be a wide range of diversity in the skin microbiome by traditional sequencing, PMA-seq indicates that this is generally an overestimation at any given skin site. In fact, our results suggest that the viable skin microbiome tends to be dominated by a relatively small number of taxa at most sites. An independent analysis of glabella samples from five healthy volunteers including contamination controls revealed the same trends that traditional sequencing overrepresented both diversity and richness with or without contaminant removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Relative abundance and change in richness and diversity of traditional sequencing compared to PMA-seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative abundance of all sequenced bacterial taxa at the family level.

We note that these values represent enrichment relative to the rest of the sequences, a measurement that is distinct from the viability score.

For a system in which we could perform both FISH and PMA-ddPCR on the same samples, we turned to mouse skin, which also enabled us to ask whether our findings are human-specific. We assessed the spatial distribution of bacterial cells in mouse skin tissue using the universal bacterial EUB338 FISH probe with tissue from K14-H2B-GFP mice. We observed the same bacterial distributions as seen in the human tissues: a high abundance of bacteria in hair follicles (enrichment score of 15.26) with relatively few bacteria on the skin surface (enrichment score of 0.21) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and D</xref>).

This result supports the hypothesis that bacterial DNA on the skin surface can be readily removed and is continuously replenished by viable bacterial populations in protected reservoirs below the skin surface.</p><p>Examining repopulation dynamics more finely at the ASV level revealed that ASVs that were lost upon surface sterilization often reappeared over time, consistent with the model that surface repopulation can be driven by subsurface populations. Specifically, we found that after surface sterilization, the skin is repopulated by the same ASVs as were present before sterilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B</xref>, we highlight specific examples in which a given ASV appears in the live-cell population (+PMA) prior to surface sterilization (T0), disappears from the live-cell population following sterilization (T3), and later reappears in the live-cell population either 24 or 48 hr later. Together, these results suggest that bacteria thrive in protected areas below the skin surface and that the DNA of their dead remains accumulates on the skin surface. In this way, the bacterial DNA on the skin surface acts as a fingerprint of the communities below.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we used both imaging and PMA-based methods to demonstrate that the skin surface is sparsely colonized by bacteria. This central finding holds true across skin from human biopsies, healthy swabbed volunteers, hairy mice, and nude mice. The skin microbiome has garnered a great deal of attention as a means for educating the immune system, combatting pathogens, and promoting wound healing, and multiple groups are pursuing skin probiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings have significant implications for the mechanisms underlying these skin microbiome functions, as well as for the ability to manipulate skin microbiome composition. For example, our findings support previous work suggesting that the key function of immune education by the skin microbiome occurs within hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Polak-Witka et al., 2020</xref>), though cell-free DNA on the skin surface could also impact the immune system. Our findings also support previous work showing that individual pores are colonized by clonal bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conwill et al., 2022</xref>). Meanwhile, our results may help to explain why stably colonizing the skin surface with exogenous bacteria has proved to be difficult and often requires abrasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scharschmidt et al., 2015</xref>). Disruption of the stratum corneum (skin surface layers), which occurs during skin abrasion, may allow access to the deeper layers of tissue where the stable bacterial populations reside. Thus, targeting the bacteria within hair follicles may represent a better strategy for stably manipulating the skin microbiome or educating the immune system. While it has been known for some time that bacteria inhabit hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Polak-Witka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lousada et al., 2021</xref>), our findings extend this knowledge and suggest that the viable bacteria of the skin microbiome are primarily restricted to these sites. This is further supported by our finding that bacteria can be readily cultured from the skin surface, but at far less abundance than suggested by the amount of bacterial DNA present on the skin.</p><p>Our results also offer insight into the apparent paradox of skin microbiome stability, in which skin microbiome composition has been found to be both stable over long timescales and susceptible to transient perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nielsen and Jiang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oh et al., 2016</xref>). The skin is primarily colonized by viable bacteria in pilosebaceous units and other skin invaginations, and the bacterial DNA on the skin surface is mostly from dead bacteria. We show that surface bacterial DNA could be easily washed away, while the viable subsurface bacteria remain unperturbed by washing, persisting as a small but stable source of new bacterial DNA that replenishes the skin surface over time. This model also explains the counter-intuitive abundance of obligately anaerobic bacterial species associated with the skin microbiome. Human skin cells are also born below the skin surface and are pushed to the surface as they die. In this way, the life cycle of the skin microbiome may resemble the process of epithelial cell turnover in the skin.</p><p>Our findings also raise fundamental questions that will need to be addressed by future studies focused on why the skin surface is poorly colonized. The accessible DNA in non-skin microbiomes is generally representative of viable bacterial cells as all non-skin microbiomes tested had viability scores above 0.4. This is in stark contrast to the skin microbiome, which had viability scores between 0.02 and 0.12. Even saliva, which contains many antimicrobial compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van ât Hof et al., 2014</xref>), had a viability score nearly four times greater than the highest viability score for a skin microbiome. The uniquely low viability score associated with the skin could be explained by passive mechanisms, like bacterial DNA adhering to the skin long after a bacterial cell dies. Alternatively, there could be active mechanisms like bacterial killing on the skin surface by factors like antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelial cells, competition between bacterial species, or exposure to harsh environmental factors such as starvation, UV radiation, or desiccation. Another open question is whether similar trends hold true for non-bacterial components of the skin microbiome like fungi and viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human and mouse tissue processing</title><p>Human tissue was obtained through the Skin Translational Research Core within the Skin Biology and Diseases Resource-based Center (SBDRC) at the University of Pennsylvania.

After hybridization, slides were incubated in wash buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl) for 1 hr at 47Â°C in the dark. Slides were then washed in 1Ã PBS for 10 mins. To visualize tissue nuclei, tissues were then stained with 1 Âµg/mL DAPI for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were then washed 3Ã in 1Ã PBS for 10 min each. Following the final wash step, tissues were mounted with glycerol-based anti-fade non-curing mounting media. Coverslips were sealed using a 1:1:1 mixture of petroleum jelly, lanolin, and paraffin. Images were acquired on a Nikon A1R-Si HD confocal microscope controlled by NIS Elements software. ImageJ and MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natwick, MA) were used for image processing. To calculate fluorescence enrichment scores, maximum projections of Z-stacks were used. A rectangular region of interest (ROI) of width W was drawn around a follicle using only the DAPI channel. A second ROI was drawn near the follicle opening with dimensions 0.5W Ã 2W in order to capture follicle-associated fluorescence near the follicle opening. In an orthogonal processing step, the pixel intensities for the entire image in the FISH fluorescent channel were fit using a 3 component Gaussian mixture model (GMM) corresponding roughly to non-tissue background, non-probe autofluorescence, and probe-based signal. Using this GMM as the background subtraction value for each image, the mean intensity for each ROI was calculated. This threshold value was used to calculate the mean fluorescence value inside the ROI and outside the ROI. The ratio of the mean fluorescence value inside the ROI to the mean fluorescence value outside of the ROI was used for quantifying follicle- and stratum corneum-associated fluorescence (enrichment score).

These approaches cannot detect the source of sequenced DNA, and they fail to demonstrate the origin of sequenced DNA from live or non-viable bacteria. Moreover, scientists proved in people and mice that live bacteria for the most part remained within hair follicles rather than on the skin's surface. Overall, this study is of excellent quality and has broad implications beyond a particular subject.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is well-designed, and the experimental methods are well-described.</p><p>The results are presented clearly and are supported by statistical analyses.</p><p>The study's findings are novel and have important implications for understanding the skin microbiome and the biology of the skin.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>RNA-based NGS could parallelly study the results of this DNA-based microbiome study. The bulk RNA-Seq can sequence thousands of transcripts from each viable bacterium and match them with the bacterial genome and transcriptome references. It is one of the best confirmatory methods for showing the diversity of viable cutaneous bacteria.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87192.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The study by Acosta et al. is very interesting as it presents a simple and easy method for identifying live and dead bacteria DNA in the skin - PMA labeling, verified by FISH. This study provides several meaningful conclusions that could inform future skin microbiome studies:</p><p>Firstly, the 16s rRNA gene sequencing of skin microbial samples collected by cotton swabs may include DNA from a large number of dead bacteria, leading to an over-representation of skin bacteria in the analysis.</p><p>Secondly, the study found that there were fewer live bacteria on the skin surface than the detected bacterial DNA predicted, with most skin bacteria harboring in the hair follicles. This conclusion aligns with the physiological properties of the skin, as the hair follicle epithelium creates a moist, nutrient-rich, low-UV, and immune-privileged environment, which is conducive to the growth, colonization, and development of microorganisms.</p><p>Finally, the authors propose that the bacteria on the skin surface originate from the proliferation and replenishment of hair follicle resident bacteria, which could be one reason for the short-term instability and long-term stability of the skin microbiome.</p><p>Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the composition and distribution of skin bacteria and highlights the importance of using appropriate methods to identify live bacteria in skin microbiome studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
