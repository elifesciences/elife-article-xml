completion of genome duplication by restarting collapsed replication forks. However, this beneficial function is not without risk as replication restarted by homologous recombination is prone to template switching (TS) that can generate deleterious genome rearrangements associated with diseases such as cancer. Previously we established an assay for studying TS in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Nguyen et al., 2015). Here, we show that TS is detected up to 75 kb downstream of a collapsed replication fork and can be triggered by head-on collision between the restarted fork and RNA Polymerase III transcription. The Pif1 DNA helicase, Pfh1, promotes efficient restart and also suppresses TS. A further three conserved helicases (Fbh1, Rqh1 and Srs2) strongly suppress TS, but there is no change in TS frequency in cells lacking Fml1 or Mus81. We discuss how these factors likely influence TS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>replication fork collapse</kwd><kwd>RTS1</kwd><kwd>replication fork barrier</kwd><kwd>recombination-dependent replication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>090767/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitby</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P028292/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitby</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P019706/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitby</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genomic deletions and gene conversions, caused by template switching associated with restarted DNA replication, are detected downstream of a collapsed replication fork and are suppressed by several conserved DNA helicases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Problems that arise during DNA replication are thought to be the root cause of much of the genome instability, including duplications, deletions and translocations of chromosomal segments, that is associated with cancer and other disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and García-Muse, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arlt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015</xref>). One common problem that arises is accidental collision of the replication fork with proteins that are tightly bound to the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lambert and Carr, 2013</xref>). Such collisions can precipitate a process known as replication fork collapse in which the protein components of the fork (collectively known as the replisome) are thought to partially or completely dissociate from the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortez, 2015</xref>). In some cases this process may also be associated with DNA breakage, detaching one arm of the replication fork and exposing a single duplex DNA end. Replication fork collapse, either with or without DNA breakage, causes a localized cessation of DNA synthesis that can be remedied through the intervention of homologous recombination (HR) proteins, which restart replication.</p><p>In eukaryotes, recombination-dependent replication (RDR) has been studied mostly in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, using experimental systems in which RDR is initiated from a site-specific DNA double-strand break (DSB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kramara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sakofsky and Malkova, 2017</xref>). HR uses intact homologous DNA sequences as templates to repair DSBs and, if such sequences are available for only one side of the break, repair occurs via a RDR process termed break induced replication (BIR). In most cases, BIR has been studied outside of the context of S-phase, with a DSB, rather than a collapsed or broken replication fork, acting as its inducer. However, studies, using a site-specific single-strand DNA break to induce replication fork breakage, have shown that essentially the same BIR process can repair broken forks during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Similar to other HR-mediated repair processes, BIR involves the 5’ to 3’ nucleolytic resection of a duplex DNA end to provide a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail for the Rad51 recombination protein to load on to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anand et al., 2013</xref>). In yeast, this loading reaction depends on Rad52, which acts as a mediator between ssDNA coated with the ssDNA-binding protein RPA and Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krogh and Symington, 2004</xref>). Once loaded, Rad51 performs a DNA homology search, followed by strand invasion of the intact DNA sequence that it finds, forming a displacement (D) loop. The D-loop acts as a platform for replication protein reassembly, which seemingly involves most of the main replisome components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lydeard et al., 2010</xref>). However, BIR exhibits a number of features that distinguishes it from canonical replication initiated from a replication origin, including: a requirement for the non-essential DNA Polymerase ∂ subunit Pol32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lydeard et al., 2007</xref>); a dependence on the Pif1 DNA helicase to promote DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>); progression via a migrating D-loop or bubble resulting in conservative rather than semi-conservative replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saini et al., 2013</xref>); a massively increased rate of mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deem et al., 2011</xref>); an association with clustered mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sakofsky et al., 2014</xref>); and an increased frequency of template switching (TS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Given that a BIR-like process has been documented in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costantino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roumelioti et al., 2016</xref>), it is highly likely that its error-prone nature and propensity for TS causes many of the mutations and genome rearrangements that are associated with cancer and other diseases. It is therefore imperative that the factors that influence BIR’s tendency to cause genomic change are identified, and their conservation of function in related RDR processes assessed, especially in the context of ongoing DNA replication during S-phase.</p><p>We, and others, have documented a related process to BIR in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, which is induced by the <italic>RTS1</italic> protein-DNA polar replication fork barrier (RFB), as opposed to a DNA break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyabe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mizuno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). This form of RDR has been termed homologous recombination-restarted replication (HoRReR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyabe et al., 2015</xref>) but, in this paper, we will refer to it simply as RDR. Replication forks collapse, and recruit HR proteins, within approximately 10 min of collision with <italic>RTS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohebi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to BIR, Rad51 and Rad52 promote replication restart at <italic>RTS1</italic> and, in doing so, can inadvertently cause genomic rearrangements through the recombination of repetitive DNA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lambert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mizuno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Also like BIR, RDR induced by <italic>RTS1</italic> is highly mutagenic and prone to TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iraqui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mizuno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). In this paper, we advance from our earlier study by identifying some of the key factors that influence TS during RDR, including key antirecombinogenic DNA helicases and collisions between restarted replication and tRNA transcription. We also highlight apparent similarities and differences between TS associated with BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>RTS1</italic>-induced RDR in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Elevated levels of TS are detected up to 75 kb downstream of <italic>RTS1</italic></title><p>In our previous study, we established an assay in <italic>S. pombe</italic> for studying TS associated with restart of a collapsed, yet unbroken, replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Using this assay, we found that restarted replication is associated with high levels of TS similar to BIR in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, increased TS associated with BIR is only observed within the first 10 kb of template DNA that is copied, after which it drops to spontaneous levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we observed high levels of TS at 12.4 kb downstream of the site of fork collapse but had not looked beyond this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). To see if TS associated with RDR from a collapsed fork in <italic>S. pombe</italic> is similarly restricted to a ~ 10 kb region, as it is during BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we used strains with a recombination reporter inserted at one of five different sites, ranging from 0.2 kb to 140 kb downstream of the <italic>RTS1</italic> RFB on the right arm of chromosome 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We also positioned <italic>RTS1</italic> ‘within’ the reporter (we will refer to this as the 0 kb site) to monitor TS recombination during the initiation of RDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The reporter consists of a direct repeat of <italic>ade6<sup>-</sup></italic> heteroalleles with an intervening <italic>his3<sup>+</sup></italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A single TS between these repeats causes a deletion of the intervening region and formation of one <italic>ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> gene, whereas two TS events can convert one of the <italic>ade6<sup>-</sup></italic> heteroalleles to <italic>ade6<sup>+</sup></italic>. These events are distinguished by the loss/retention of the <italic>his3<sup>+</sup></italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>RTS1</italic> is inserted close to a cluster of early firing replication origins (<italic>ori-1323</italic>, <italic>ori-1338</italic> and <italic>ori-1342</italic>), which means that it is almost always encountered first by a replication fork moving in the telomere to centromere direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, as <italic>RTS1</italic> is a polar RFB, it only blocks forks at this site in one orientation, which we refer to as the active orientation (AO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). The non-blocking orientation is referred to as the inactive orientation (IO) and acts as a negative control for our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, the Ade<sup>+</sup> recombinant frequencies, measured at the 35 kb, 75 kb and 140 kb sites are essentially the same with and without <italic>RTS1-IO</italic> (p &gt; 0.4), and at the 0 kb, 0.2 kb and 12.4 kb sites <italic>RTS1-IO</italic> causes only a modest ~1.4–1.9-fold increase in deletions (p ≤ 0.001) compared to the spontaneous frequencies obtained from equivalent strains with no <italic>RTS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Compared to strains with <italic>RTS1-IO</italic>, those with <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> exhibited increases of between 32-fold to 133-fold in the frequency of Ade<sup>+</sup> recombinants at sites up to 35 kb downstream of the RFB, but no increase was observed at the 75 kb and 140 kb sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41697.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TS downstream of <italic>RTS1</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map showing sites of insertion for the direct repeat recombination reporter on chromosome 3.

To see if the absence of increased levels of TS at the 75 kb reporter was due to replication convergence occurring upstream of this site, we deleted replication origin <italic>ori-1253</italic>, which is responsible for more than 80% of canonical forks that normally converge with the collapsed/restarted fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). This deletion had no effect on the frequency of spontaneous recombination at the 75 kb reporter (p = 0.58 and 0.34 for gene conversions and deletions, respectively), whereas it caused an approximately 5-fold increase in deletions when <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> was present (p &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data show that restarted replication can cause increased levels of TS at least as far as 75 kb downstream of a collapsed replication fork in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p><p>The increases in recombinants up to 35 kb downstream of <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> are comparable to the 49-fold increase observed when the RFB is placed at the 0 kb site between the two <italic>ade6<sup>-</sup></italic> heteroalleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, at the 0 kb site, the fold increase in gene conversions is higher than that of deletions (by ~3:1), whereas, at the 0.2 kb downstream site, the fold increases in gene conversions and deletions are comparable (126-fold and 135-fold, respectively) and, at the 12.4 kb, 35 kb and 75 kb sites, the fold increase in deletions (42-fold, 58-fold and 4-fold, respectively) is much higher than for gene conversions (6-fold, 16-fold and 2-fold, respectively). These data suggest that during the initial phases of restarting DNA replication there is a greater likelihood of generating a gene conversion, whereas the TS associated with restarted replication is more likely to give rise to a deletion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>High levels of TS downstream of <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> depend on Pfh1</title><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, efficient BIR depends on the Pif1 DNA helicase, which aids D-loop migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate whether Pif1 is similarly important for RDR in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, as it is for BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we made use of two mutant alleles of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pif1 gene, called <italic>pfh1-m21</italic> and <italic>pfh1-mt*</italic>, which encode protein that localises normally to mitochondria but has greatly reduced (<italic>pfh1-m21</italic>) or no detectable (<italic>pfh1-mt*</italic>) nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pinter et al., 2008</xref>). This was important because Pfh1 has an essential mitochondrial function in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pinter et al., 2008</xref>).

Deletion of <italic>mus81</italic> has no effect on the frequency of gene conversions at either 0 or 12.4 kb reporters, but does cause a slight increase in deletions (~1.4-fold) at the 0 kb reporter and a decrease in deletions (~1.5-fold) at the 12.4 kb reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BC</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The absence of any major change in TS frequency at the 12.4 kb reporter, in both the <italic>fml1</italic>∆ and <italic>mus81</italic>∆ mutant, could be due to a change in restart efficiency offsetting a potential decrease or increase in TS. However, 2DGE of replication intermediates at and around <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> reveals wild-type levels of large Y-shaped and double Y-shaped DNA molecules, suggesting that restart is unaffected by loss of either Fml1 or Mus81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The factors affecting TS associated with recombination-mediated DNA replication have hitherto been studied mainly in the context of BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and outside of S-phase. In our study we have measured TS associated with RDR from a collapsed, yet unbroken, replication fork in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. With this system, we have identified similarities with BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, as well as some potential differences. To place our findings into a conceptual framework, we will first discuss a hypothetical model for TS, which is elaborated from a previous model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). We envisage that the collapsed replication fork regresses to form a classic ‘chicken foot’ structure with an exposed ssDNA tail formed by the nucleolytic activity of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1-Ctp1 complex and Exo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teixeira-Silva et al., 2017</xref>). Rad51 loads onto the ssDNA tail to form a nucleoprotein filament that first locates a homologous duplex and then invades it to form a D-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 2). Pol∂ extends the 3’ end of the invading strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyabe et al., 2015</xref>) and, as it does, the D-loop moves in tandem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saini et al., 2013</xref>). Although not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lagging strand DNA synthesis may be established on the nascent leading strand giving rise to conservative replication, which could then be directed into semi-conservative replication by branch migration of the regressed replication fork behind the D-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Such a model would be compatible with the finding that RDR, triggered by fork collapse at <italic>RTS1</italic>, is semi-conservative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyabe et al., 2015</xref>), and contrasts with BIR, which is conservative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Donnianni and Symington, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saini et al., 2013</xref>). As DNA replication progresses, the associated migrating D-loop is likely to be susceptible to dissociation, either through the action of DNA helicases and/or by branch migration of the regressed replication fork ‘catching up’ with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Dissociation of the D-loop in a region of repetitive DNA would lead to TS if the ejected DNA strand re-invades the ‘wrong’ repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, steps 4 and 5; note that the DNA repeats, in yellow, are directly orientated as they are in our genetic assay). RDR is terminated upon encounter with the oncoming replication fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, steps 6 and 7) and, during this process, the invading DNA strand may either be ligated to the nascent lagging strand of the oncoming fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 7a) or be unwound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 7b). If unwound, a second TS may be triggered (not shown) or the regressed replication fork may simply re-set by branch migration and merge with the oncoming fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, steps 8b and 9b). Note that these events can give rise to a gene conversion in our genetic assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Ligation of the invading DNA strand to the nascent lagging strand of the oncoming fork would prevent further TS and consolidate the formation of a deletion, with branched DNA structures being resolved by nucleases (not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorenz et al., 2009</xref>) or by the completion of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, steps 8a and 9a). In the latter case, the region being deleted would form a heterologous loop of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 9a), which could be removed by a large DNA loop repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clikeman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sommer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41697.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for TS between direct repeats.</title><p>Parental DNA strands are dark blue, nascent DNA strands are light blue and DNA repeats are yellow. The grey line in steps 5, 6, 7a and 8a indicates that the light blue and yellow lines, which it connects, are continuous.

The observation that TS in <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> is constrained to the first 10 kb of template DNA that is copied, suggests that the D-loop eventually matures into a more stable structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). This maturation process may involve cleavage of the D-loop by structure-specific nucleases such as Mus81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Osman and Whitby, 2007</xref>). Our finding that TS downstream of <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> is generally biased in favour of deletions, whereas at the RFB gene conversions predominate, suggests that the frequency of double TS events declines soon after replication has restarted. Interestingly, Carr and colleagues reported that the propensity for restarted replication to perform a U-turn at small inverted repeats positioned downstream of <italic>RTS1</italic> declined 4-fold when the distance between RFB and repeats was increased from 0 to 2 kb, and then appeared to plateu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mizuno et al., 2013</xref>). These observations suggest that the putative migrating D-loop, which is formed following replication fork collapse at <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>, undergoes partial stabilization shortly after it is formed. However, unlike with BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, a degree of D-loop instability must be retained because we can detect TS over distances of at least 75 kb downstream of the site of fork collapse. Our finding, that <italic>tRNA<sup>GLU08</sup></italic>HO increases TS downstream of <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>, suggests that head-on collisions with transcription complexes might exacerbate D-loop instability and be a key trigger in promoting TS.</p><p>The apparent disparity in D-loop maturation, between BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and RDR in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, may reflect differences in D-loop processing. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Mus81 constrains TS during BIR presumably by resolving the D-loop into a more stable fork structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>). However, in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we found no evidence that Mus81 is required to constrain TS during RDR. In fact the only constraint, over the region in which TS can occur in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, seems to be the point at which the restarted replication converges with the oncoming replication fork - a property which is shared with BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>TS associated with restarted replication is thought to be responsible for generating many of the genome rearrangements that are associated with cancer and other disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho and Lupski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>). However, some complex genome rearrangements can span distances of hundreds of kilobases and, therefore, could not be formed from a single restarted replication event if TS was limited to a 10 kb region downstream of the site of fork collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>). Our finding, that TS events occur over a much greater distance in <italic>S. pombe</italic> than they do for BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> shows that TS, associated with the repair of a single collapsed replication fork, may be capable of generating some of the long-range and complex genome rearrangements seen in humans.</p><p>Similar to BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Pif1 family DNA helicase Pfh1 promotes RDR, which explains why there is a general reduction in the levels of TS downstream of <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> in <italic>pfh1-m21</italic> and <italic>-mt*</italic> mutants. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Pif1 aids DNA synthesis during BIR by driving D-loop migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>), and Pfh1 might do likewise during RDR in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Moreover, our observation, that resected regressed replication forks accumulate at <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> in a <italic>pfh1-mt*</italic> mutant, suggests that Pfh1 is a candidate for promoting the putative branch migration and/or re-setting of the regressed replication fork behind the migrating D-loop (see Discussion above). Pfh1 also has the ability to drive DNA replication by dislodging protein-DNA barriers via its so-called sweepase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sabouri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steinacher et al., 2012</xref>). Efficient RDR past <italic>RTS1</italic> presumably requires removal of the barrier protein Rtf1, which may depend on Pfh1’s sweepase activity.</p><p>Despite Pfh1 being needed for efficient RDR, we were able to detect an increase in TS in a <italic>pfh1-m21</italic> mutant if we provided more time for replication restart to occur, which shows that Pfh1, in addition to promoting RDR, also plays a role in suppressing TS. This finding contrasts with BIR in <italic>S. cerevisisae</italic> where Pif1 has no affect on TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stafa et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike <italic>S. pombe</italic> and humans, which have only one Pif1 family helicase, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has a second Pif1 helicase called Rrm3, which, whilst seemingly not required for BIR, is important for the repair of replication-associated DSBs as well as replication past stable protein-DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivessa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muñoz-Galván et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that Pif1 and Rrm3 act redundantly in the suppression of TS in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Alternatively, the role of Pif1 helicases in suppressing TS may only be evident when RDR acts during S-phase alongside ongoing canonical DNA replication. Specifically, they may play an important role in directing the termination of DNA replication where a canonical fork encounters a D-loop. We speculate that Pfh1 drives D-loop dissociation during termination through its action as an accessory helicase at the oncoming DNA replication fork, where it likely translocates on the lagging template strand in a 5’ – 3’ direction (i.e. towards the D-loop and on the same DNA strand that the invading strand is annealed to) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sabouri, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 7b). Without this activity there would be a greater tendancy for the 3’ end of the invading strand at the D-loop to ligate to the lagging strand of the oncoming fork, which would specifically favour deletion formation in our genetic assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, steps 7a – 9a). Indeed, in the instances where we can detect an increase in Ade<sup>+</sup> recombinants when <italic>pfh1</italic> is mutated, it is specifically deletions that increase, with the frequency of gene conversions either decreasing or remaining unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition to Pfh1, we have identified a further three conserved DNA helicases that suppress TS downstream of <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>, namely Rqh1, Srs2 and Fbh1. These helicases, and their homologues in other organisms, are well known as major players in directing the outcome of homologous recombination reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doe and Whitby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fugger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kohzaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larsen and Hickson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorenz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morishita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niu and Klein, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Osman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simandlova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsutsui et al., 2014</xref>). However, their role in suppressing TS downstream of a collapsed replication fork has not previously been demonstrated, though it has been suggested that the homologue of Rqh1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Sgs1) might limit translocations between highly diverged genes by suppressing TS during BIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>). Based on the known activities of their homologues, Rqh1, Srs2 and Fbh1 have the potential to influence TS in various ways. For example, Sgs1 and its human homologue BLM, as well as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Srs2, are capable of dissociating D-loops in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bachrati et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bugreev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dupaigne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fasching et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Brabant et al., 2000</xref>). The dissociation of a nascent D-loop can abort a TS event before a genetic change is made (e.g. a deletion or gene conversion in our genetic assay) and, therefore, the loss of this activity might account for the increase in TS we observe in both <italic>rqh1</italic>∆ and <italic>srs2</italic>∆ mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, Lambert and colleagues showed that Rqh1 was responsible for the disappearance of recombination intermediates at <italic>RTS1</italic> in cells lacking CAF1, and proposed that this was due to its ability to drive D-loop dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pietrobon et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Another way in which Rqh1 may affect TS is by catalyzing the branch migration of the regressed replication fork behind the migrating D-loop. The regressed fork forms a four-way/Holliday junction, which is a structure that several RecQ–type helicases have been shown to unwind/branch migrate in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cejka and Kowalczykowski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karow et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeRoy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Machwe et al., 2011</xref>). As discussed above, branch migration of the four-way junction into the ‘back’ of the D-loop would cause the D-loop to unwind. This might happen more frequently during an attempted TS event if the four-way junction continues to migrate whilst the D-loop is being re-established.</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Rad51 promotes strand re-invasion, leading to a TS event during BIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anand et al., 2014</xref>). Presumably, Rad51 loads onto the ejected DNA strand following dissociation of the migrating D-loop to form a nucleoprotein filament. Both Srs2 and Fbh1 regulate nucleoprotein filament formation by dissociating Rad51 from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simandlova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsutsui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>). The loss of this anti-recombinogenic activity might account for the increase in TS observed in <italic>srs2</italic>∆ and <italic>fbh1</italic>∆ mutants.</p><p>Whilst dissociation of a nascent D-loop might prevent TS recombination, the unwinding of a fully established migrating D-loop would promote it. Indeed, this is exactly the activity that Mph1 is thought to catalyze during BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stafa et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that Fml1, despite promoting ectopic recombination during the restart of replication, appeared to have no effect on TS once replication had restarted. It is possible that a reduction in TS caused by lower levels of migrating D-loop dissociation is offset by an increased number of D-loops reaching our 12.4 kb genetic reporter. We are currently developing methods to measure restarted replication tract lengths, which will allow us to better calibrate our TS data.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a number of factors that influence TS associated with replication restart from a collapsed replication fork, revealing both similarities and potential differences with TS during BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The fact that <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are only distant relatives, being about as divergent from each other as each is to animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heckman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sipiczki, 2000</xref>), means that the similarities we have reported (e.g. Pif1 helicases promoting replication restart) are likely to be conserved in humans. Even the apparent disparities may simply reflect differences in the recombination assays used rather than fundamental mechanistic differences between RDR in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This is exemplified in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where the importance of Mus81 in limiting TS during BIR appears to depend on the recombination assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stafa et al., 2014</xref>). In future studies, it will be important to establish whether the apparent disparities between RDR in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and BIR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> reflect real species-specific differences, fundamental differences in the restart of replication from a DSB/broken replication fork versus a collapsed, yet unbroken, fork or simply differences in the recombination assays that have been used.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source <break/>or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. pombe</italic>)</td><td valign="top">various strains</td><td valign="top">PMID: 15889146</td><td valign="top"/><td>standard laboratory strain (972) derivatives; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. pombe</italic>)</td><td valign="top">various strains</td><td valign="top">PMID: 25806683</td><td valign="top"/><td>standard laboratory strain (972) derivatives; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. pombe</italic>)</td><td valign="top">various strains</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td>standard laboratory strain (972) derivatives; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. pombe</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MCW4956</td><td valign="top">PMID: 22426535</td><td valign="top"/><td>standard laboratory strain (972) derivatives; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. pombe</italic>)</td><td valign="top">various strains</td><td valign="top">PMID: 19546232</td><td valign="top"/><td>standard laboratory strain (972) derivatives; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. pombe</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MCW3059</td><td valign="top">PMID: 18851838</td><td valign="top"/><td>standard laboratory strain (972) derivatives; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. pombe</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MCW3061</td><td valign="top">PMID: 18851838</td><td valign="top"/><td>standard laboratory strain (972) derivatives; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pMJ33</td><td>this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td>plasmid; see Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pMJ34</td><td>this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td>plasmid; see Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCB44</td><td>this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td>plasmid; see Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pMW899</td><td>PMID: 22426535</td><td valign="top"/><td>plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pMW905</td><td>PMID: 22426535</td><td valign="top"/><td>plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>various oligonucleotides</td><td>this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td>see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3 </xref>(oligonucleotides)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> strains and oligonucleotides are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>, respectively.

of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Factors affecting template switch recombination associated with restarted DNA replication&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gregory Ira (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this new manuscript the authors investigate the repair of stalled forks in fission yeast with a system where polar replication fork blockage – <italic>RTS1</italic> sequence – is placed downstream from a set of early firing origins. <italic>RTS1</italic> is known to stimulate recombination and the authors previously demonstrated that <italic>RTS1</italic> stimulates locally also template switches. The role of multiple enzymes in template switches at the site of the fork stalling is investigated. Template switches are scored as frequency of recombination between two Ade- alleles located downstream from <italic>RTS1</italic> that generates ADE+ colonies. The reporter cassette was placed at different distance from the fork stalling sequence and in some experiments the authors additionally modified the experimental system by deleting upstream origins, inserting a tRNA gene or replication that result in a delay of converging forks.</p><p>The authors provide convincing evidence suggesting that Pfh1 helicase is important for TS particularly further from the site of RTS1. This indicates that Pfh1 similar to Pif1 in budding yeast could be involved in repair specific extensive DNA synthesis. Furthermore the authors find a role of DNA helicases Srs2, Rqh1 and Fbh1 in controlling TS accordingly to previously documented functions of these helicases in regulation of recombination intermediates. Interestingly Fml1, a helicase that these authors and others showed to regulate D-loop stability has no function in limiting TS. Also Mus81 does not have a role in repair and TS frequency at stalled forks. The authors also show that TS can occur even far away from fork stalling place (75 kb) in case where there is no efficient converging fork. Overall the manuscript provides new and interesting data on a topic that is important in genome instability field.</p><p>The data are of high quality and the manuscript is well written. We note, however, that many of the effects in the mutants are small (and barely significant) and alternative models should be considered. Moreover, the effect of the tRNA gene on TS is not well connected to the rest of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) You must reconsider how you discuss and compare your data with data obtained in other organisms. You should be more careful when comparing genetic requirements for template switches at nick induced recombination, in recombination at stalled replication forks and in BIR that occurs in G2. You make strong conclusions about the differences in control of TS between budding yeast and fission yeast but the differences in some of the phenotypes may be simply related to different recombination assays used and not different organisms as is claimed. Even within budding yeast depending on the recombination system use, the role of DNA helicases and nucleases in template switches and BIR is different. For example some BIR events in budding yeast depend on Mus81 while others do not and similarly TS are regulated by Mus81 or not depending on the assay. Stafa et al. showed that Mus81 is not regulating template switching during BIR while Mayle et al. showed that Mus81 suppresses template switching in recombination induced by nicks. Work from Russell and Arcangioli labs clearly demonstrated the function of Mus81 in repair of nick induced breaks in fission yeast. Others demonstrated similar function of Mus81 in budding yeast and other organisms. In the assay used here, all repair processes seem to be possible without any contribution of Mus81 so it is somewhat difficult to compare these results with assays where Mus81 is essential. Also Fml1, similar to budding yeast, Mph1 may play a role in TS in fission yeast but in BIR and not at stalled forks. A fair comparison between budding yeast and fission yeast would require related recombination assays. Thus all strong statements on differences between organisms should be toned down unless you compare similar recombination assays.</p><p>2) The tRNA gene data are not well connected to the rest of the manuscript. A better connection could be made by introducing the <italic>pfh1, rqh1, srs2, fbh1, fml1, mus81, pcf2</italic>, and <italic>pcf3</italic> mutants into this assay.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41697.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) You must reconsider how you discuss and compare their data with data obtained in other organisms.

These new data are presented in a new version of Figure 4, which incorporates data from the original version of Figure 6 (note that in this re-organisation of the paper the original Figure 5 is now Figure 6). Our new data show that the <italic>pfh1</italic> mutants exhibit heightened levels of spontaneous recombination when <italic>tRNA</italic>-HO is present but, surprisingly, with <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> they exhibit the same fold increase in TS relative to wild-type as they do without <italic>tRNA</italic>-HO (compare Figure 2B and Figure 5D).
