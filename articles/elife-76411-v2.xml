Although external neuromodulation techniques have been used to manipulate interhemispheric sensorimotor activity, a central controversy concerns whether this activity can be volitionally controlled. Experimental tools lack the power to up- or down-regulate the state of the targeted hemisphere over a large dynamic range and, therefore, cannot evaluate the possible volitional control of the activity. We addressed this difficulty by using the recently developed method of spatially bivariate electroencephalography (EEG)-neurofeedback to systematically enable the participants to modulate their bilateral sensorimotor activities. Here, we report that participants learn to up- and down-regulate the ipsilateral excitability to the imagined hand while maintaining constant contralateral excitability; this modulates the magnitude of interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) assessed by the paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm. Further physiological analyses revealed that the manipulation capability of IHI magnitude reflected interhemispheric connectivity in EEG and TMS, which was accompanied by intrinsic bilateral cortical oscillatory activities. Our results show an interesting approach for neuromodulation, which might identify new treatment opportunities, e.g., in patients suffering from a stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>interhemispheric inhibition</kwd><kwd>brain-computer interface</kwd><kwd>neurofeedback</kwd><kwd>neural manipulation</kwd><kwd>inhibitory sensorimotor processes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A) (#20H05923)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ushiba</surname><given-names>Junichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic International Brain Science Research Promotion Program (#JP20dm030702)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ushiba</surname><given-names>Junichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Moonshot R&amp;D program (Grant Number JPMJMS2012)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ushiba</surname><given-names>Junichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ushioda Memorial Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Keio University Doctorate Student Grant-in-Aid Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayashi</surname><given-names>Masaaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interhemispheric inhibition can be manipulated by directly and bidirectionally modulating the bilateral sensorimotor excitabilities in a spatially bivariate Brain-Computer Interface-based neurofeedback paradigm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Projection neurons wire the brain over long distances and provide a network between different brain regions. In particular, both hemispheres are structurally connected by transcallosal projections and exhibit functional cross talks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hofer and Frahm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meyer et al., 1995</xref>); such interhemispheric interaction is essential for higher order cognitive and sensorimotor brain functions. An early argument for interhemispheric interaction was that dynamic interplay via the callosum not only allows for simple coordination of processing between the hemispheres but also has profound effects on attentional functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banich, 1998</xref>). In the motor domain, neurons in the monkey primary motor cortex are firing bilaterally and motor signals from the two hemispheres interact during unimanual motor tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames and Churchland, 2019</xref>); in the human motor cortex, measuring these neural activities via electroencephalography (EEG) and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) recently revealed that the two hemispheres act together and the related cortical oscillatory activity influences the inhibitory interhemispheric brain network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Picazio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stefanou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A critical issue is whether a specific interhemispheric activity can be volitionally controlled. Previous studies have focused on inhibitory interhemispheric sensorimotor network, evaluated by interhemispheric inhibition (IHI), from movement-related manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duque et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duque et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Morishita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nelson et al., 2009</xref>), and passive neuromodulation effects by non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or repetitive TMS (rTMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boddington and Reynolds, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gilio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Williams et al., 2010</xref>). Due to the experimental limitations related to these observational or open-loop paradigms, much less is known about the effects of changes in sensorimotor activity patterns in both hemispheres on IHI, and the possibility of manipulating IHI. Therefore, the closed-loop paradigms to manipulate bilateral sensorimotor activity patterns and IHI should be of great value for the understanding of human sensorimotor brain function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conceptual illustration of the current study and experimental overview.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) When a certain stimulus was input into the system, the brain was considered to vary with the state, resulting in interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) changes. The upper panel highlights the experimental limitations in the observational paradigm due to a variety of IHI magnitudes observed during actual movement. In this case, it is unclear whether the changes in electroencephalography (EEG) patterns in both the hemispheres would affect IHI. The middle panel indicates that it is unclear whether it is possible to manipulate inhibitory interhemispheric sensorimotor activity in the open-loop neuromodulation paradigm using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The lower panel shows that specific EEG patterns are associated with IHI magnitude, and brain-computer interface (BCI)-based neurofeedback modulates the EEG activities. Therefore, if bilateral EEG patterns that underlie IHI are identified, we should be able to volitionally regulate the IHI magnitude via BCI-based neurofeedback, suggesting the possibility of plastic interhemispheric balancing. (<bold>B</bold>) The current bi-EEG-triggered dual-TMS experimental system involved spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback that allows volitional modulation of EEG patterns only in a targeted hemisphere to enable us to verify our hypothesis. Different states of the targeted bidirectional up- and down-regulated ipsilateral hemisphere to the imagined hand while maintaining constant contralateral excitability were tested in the following states: (1) resting-state, (2) during motor imagery without visual feedback, (3) high, (4) middle, and (5) low excitability states. A blue target box, based on the predetermined SMR-ERDs, was displayed corresponding to each session. A cue signal was generated to trigger the conditioning stimulus when the signal reached the target box. The yellow line on the head represents the signal flow from the conditioning hemisphere that modifies the contralateral side through the corpus callosum, and the blue line represents the test stimulus toward the right hand.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76411-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As a recent neural manipulative tool, numerous studies have used a brain-computer interface (BCI)-based neurofeedback whereby participants learn to volitionally desynchronize and synchronize oscillatory sensorimotor rhythms (SMR-ERD/ERS) in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex (SM1) through visual and/or somatosensory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ang and Guan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaudhary et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ramos-Murguialday et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Soekadar et al., 2015b</xref>). BCI-based neurofeedback is supported by the fact that the intensity of SMR-ERD in EEG represents states of high versus low excitability of not only the SM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neuper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Neuper and Pfurtscheller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pfurtscheller et al., 2006</xref>), but also the corticospinal descending pathway, as measured by the motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Takemi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takemi et al., 2013</xref>). Because both hemispheres are structurally and functionally connected, it is likely that the balance of bilateral SMR-ERDs and transcallosal excitability states are linked, as indicated by common variation of conditioning MEP amplitude and IHI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferbert et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ghosh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ni et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we sought to investigate the association of IHI and the balance of SMR-ERDs to understand the inhibitory sensorimotor functions of interhemispheric interaction that may critically depend on the oscillatory brain activity in both hemispheres. Furthermore, if changes in the oscillatory brain activity influenced IHI, we tested whether it can be manipulated using a dual-coil paired-pulse TMS protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daskalakis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferbert et al., 1992</xref>). To assess the association of IHI with ongoing oscillatory brain activity, we used a recently developed spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback technique that allows volitional modulation of SMR amplitude in both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hayashi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>) and triggers the TMS pulses in real time at predetermined bilateral SMR amplitudes. Our system, therefore, overcomes previously unresolved experimental limitations of the ordinary observational or open-loop experimental paradigm. That is, our paradigm enables participants to control the bivariate sensorimotor excitability, and determines whether it is possible to manipulate the IHI magnitude.</p><p>Using the novel closed-loop bivariate (bi-hemispheric brain state-dependent) EEG-triggered dual-coil paired-pulse TMS system (bi-EEG-triggered dual-TMS), we evaluated the effects of different states of the targeted bidirectional up- or down-regulated one-sided hemisphere on effective inhibitory interhemispheric network expressed by IHI: (1) resting-state (REST), (2) during right finger motor imagery (MI) without visual feedback (NoFB), (3) high (HIGH), (4) middle (MID), and (5) low (LOW) excitability states of the ipsilateral SM1 (conditioning side) to the unilateral imagined hand movement while maintaining constant contralateral excitability during BCI-based neurofeedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Inspired by the findings that SMR-ERD was associated with corticospinal excitability amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Takemi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takemi et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that the ipsilateral SMR-ERD to the imagined (right) hand is a potent up- or down-regulator of IHI from the ipsilateral (right) to the contralateral (left) hemisphere. This multimodal research provides strong evidence for the dynamic interplay between distinct regions underlying IHI through BCI-based neurofeedback, and may therefore form the basis for interhemispheric sensorimotor activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Values corresponding to each statistical figure are presented in each table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) for readability.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data compliance</title><p>Participants completed all five sessions as follows: (1) resting-state (REST), (2) right finger MI without visual feedback (NoFB), (3) high excitability states of the ipsilateral SM1 during BCI-based neurofeedback (HIGH), (4) middle excitability states of the ipsilateral SM1 during BCI-based neurofeedback (MID), and (5) low excitability states of the ipsilateral SM1 during BCI-based neurofeedback (LOW). In the three neurofeedback sessions (i.e. HIGH, MID, and LOW), participants received visual feedback during right finger MI and tried to modulate the sensorimotor activity patterns. The NoFB session served as a baseline to examine the IHI magnitude without visual stimuli and volitional control. The REST session also served as a control to determine the intrinsic IHI magnitude at rest.</p><p>In all MIs-based sessions (NoFB, HIGH, MID, and LOW), participants subjectively confirmed that they were able to perform kinesthetic MIs of unilateral right hand index finger abduction. The EEG signals with amplitudes ≤100 μV were consistently recorded throughout the sessions. Contralateral and ipsilateral SMR amplitudes to the imagined hand were greater during the resting epoch than during the MI epoch, indicating desynchronization of the sensorimotor neural activity induced by MI. The averaged power spectrum density from the C3 channel during the resting epoch showed peak frequencies at 8–13 Hz and 21–24 Hz across the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neuper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pfurtscheller, 2001</xref>).

All procedures were well tolerated and no adverse events were noted.</p><p>To quantify the difficulties in each neurofeedback session, two indices were examined: (1) the number of triggered trials represents the BCI performance (i.e. success trials) since TMS was only triggered when the EEG signal exceeded the predetermined SMR-ERD threshold; (2) mean waiting time for a triggered event from task onset, which yields a range of 0–5 s (triggered TMS timing). The mean values of all triggered trials (±1 SD) of the neurofeedback sessions were 14.2 ± 4.7 trials and post-hoc paired t-tests following a one-way repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) revealed no significant differences between the three sessions (all p&gt;0.05; HIGH: 12.0 ± 5.0 trials, MID: 16.1 ± 3.8 trials, and LOW: 15.9 ± 5.4 trials).

This was the first study to show IHI-state manipulation with a large dynamic range induced by volitional variation in ipsilateral sensorimotor excitability expressed by SMR-ERD. In addition, resting-state interhemispheric networks at the TMS (IHI<sub>rest</sub>) and EEG (interhemispheric Network-intensity<sub>rest</sub>) levels were associated with the manipulation capability of IHI magnitude.</p><p>Previous neurofeedback studies have demonstrated that it is possible to gain voluntary control over central nervous system activity without externally administered interventions, if appropriate neurofeedback is embedded in a reinforcement learning task, such as food rewards for animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engelhard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fetz, 2013</xref>) and visually rewarding stimuli for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>). However, conventional BCI-based neurofeedback of the SMR signal from one hemisphere does not guarantee spatial specific activation of the sensorimotor region in the targeted hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caria et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Soekadar et al., 2015a</xref>) because sensorimotor activities in the left and right hemispheres potentially influence one another, making IHI manipulation difficult. Using spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback enables participants to volitionally increase or decrease (bidirectional) the ipsilateral sensorimotor excitability, while maintaining constant contralateral sensorimotor excitability. Ipsilateral SMR-ERD to the imagined hand (but not contralateral), reflecting IHI magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and their significant correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), were explained by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haegens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Khademi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kraus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Madsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Naros et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ros et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sauseng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Thies et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zarkowski et al., 2006</xref>). The in vivo cortical recordings in monkeys revealed that pericentral alpha power was inversely related with the normalized firing rate in the sensorimotor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haegens et al., 2011</xref>). In humans, several studies using single-pulse TMS of the motor hand area combined with EEG tested how ongoing pericentral oscillatory activity impacts corticomotor excitability reflected by the MEP amplitude. These EEG-TMS studies found a negative relationship between pre-stimulus alpha power and MEP amplitude through both offline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sauseng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zarkowski et al., 2006</xref>) and online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Madsen et al., 2019</xref>) approaches, whereas the opposite of that was also found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Thies et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, another EEG-TMS study using neurofeedback demonstrated that the endogenous suppression of alpha rhythms at rest can produce robust increase in MEP amplitude and decrease in short-interval intracortical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ros et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, in the beta band, some evidences were revealed that a negative relationship between beta power and MEP amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Khademi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kraus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Naros et al., 2020</xref>). As for IHI through the transcallosal fiber, it is predominantly regulated through direct postsynaptic mechanisms in the apical dendritic shafts of pyramidal neurons and a specific cortical microcircuitry mediated by dendritic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, consistent with this phenomenon, down-regulation of ipsilateral SMR-ERD, e.g., may influence the excitation of the ipsilateral transcallosal pyramidal neuron followed by disinhibition of the contralateral inhibitory interneurons during unilateral upper limb MI. Therefore, pronounced changes in cortical mechanism despite the absence of sensory input and constant MEP amplitude in the imagined right hand elicited by single TS suggest that the modulation of IHI magnitude from the ipsilateral (right) to the contralateral (left) hemisphere was at least partly of cortical, rather than spinal origin. These neural mechanisms can be explored further by using triple pulse procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ni et al., 2011</xref>) in which (dis)inhibition can be directly measured as the modulation of short-interval intracortical inhibition.</p><p>The potential contribution of resting-state IHI magnitude and interhemispheric functional connectivity in the alpha and high beta bands to the current results of manipulation capability in IHI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) can be speculated by considering the previous studies. Inter-regional communication is accompanied by synchronized oscillations in different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Varela et al., 2001</xref>), and this synchronization can be evaluated by functional connectivity. Because both hemispheres are structurally connected by transcallosal projection and exhibit functional cross talks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hofer and Frahm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meyer et al., 1995</xref>), the manipulation capability of IHI is likely associated with a structural connectivity as well as local oscillatory power entrainment. As for frequency band outside of neurofeedback target, it is well known that the intensity of SMR-ERD in the beta band reflects the sensorimotor cortical excitability and corticomuscular activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hussain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schulz et al., 2014</xref>). This multimodal EEG-TMS approach proves that the bilateral alpha and beta activities observed in the current study served to modulate the functional interhemispheric interaction over motor cortices.</p><p>For the other modalities, e.g., real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback to a single region of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sitaram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Weiskopf et al., 2004</xref>) or inter-regional functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liew et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>) can be used for volitional modulation of neuronal connectivity and could serve as a possible therapeutic tool for motor or cognitive training in diseases related to impaired inter-regional connectivity. However, even fMRI-based neurofeedback with high spatial resolution, based on blood oxygenation level-dependent signal, cannot easily distinguish between the excitatory and the inhibitory activities from each region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moon et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, neurofeedback using interhemispheric functional connectivity has the possibility to counteract the modulation of IHIs from the right to left hemisphere and from the left to right hemisphere. Our results showed no significant difference in Network-intensity during MI between HIGH and LOW sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that interhemispheric functional connectivity at the EEG level was not changed, whereas IHI was modulated. This may indicate that IHI and Network-intensity simply reflect the activity of different neural populations; interhemispheric projections act via surround/lateral inhibition in the sensory and motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carson, 2020</xref>), while the synchrony at the EEG level reflects changes in the activity of local interactions between pyramidal neurons and interneurons in the thalamocortical loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, it is possible that Network-intensity reflects the degree of bidirectional synchrony between the two motor cortices, while IHI reflects one-way (right-to-left) inhibitory effects. Therefore, it is unclear whether fMRI-based neurofeedback using interhemispheric functional connectivity is linked to ipsilateral excitability, and whether it modulates IHI magnitude.</p><p>Interhemispheric activity is also passively modulated by externally administered interventions, e.g., tDCS or rTMS over the motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gilio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pena-Gomez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Williams et al., 2010</xref>). Although such tools have neuromodulation efficacy, their long-term sustained effects are often limited and they do not have spatial specificity due to the remote effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Pino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Notturno et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Weiskopf et al., 2004</xref>). Conversely, under the conscious selflearning environment, volitional control of MEP amplitudes is retained for at least 6 months without further training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ruddy et al., 2018</xref>), which supports the future prediction of long-term efficacy of IHI manipulation. In addition, we successfully demonstrated that IHI changes greater than the variance explained by the CS effect. Based on our findings, further experiments may help to better understand the pathway specificity. To further confirm whether the participants learned pathway-specific IHI manipulation, the CS effect should be kept constant across the conditions by adjusting the CS intensity to evoke left MEP of 1 mV peak-to-peak amplitude. Furthermore, the effect size of IHI manipulation in the current study (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>=1.50) was comparable with that of representative tDCS (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>=1.55) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Williams et al., 2010</xref>) and superior to that of rTMS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gilio et al., 2003</xref>) (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>=0.80; note that it is a read from the graph). Two meta-analyses of clinical trials using rTMS and tDCS also indicated that the effect sizes were medium (0.4–0.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeyemo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hsu et al., 2012</xref>). Based on a previous study of neurofeedback training combined with externally administered interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ang et al., 2015</xref>), their combination may contribute to facilitating neural plasticity.</p><p>Our techniques and evidences are expected to be applied in various fields, e.g., in the context of neurorehabilitation. In stroke patients, the interhemispheric imbalance/competition model predicts the presence of asymmetry in the interhemispheric sensorimotor network, with excessive inhibition from the non-affected hemisphere limiting motor performance and maximal recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duque et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murase et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is believed that guiding inhibitory interhemispheric network to the appropriate pattern through both targeted up-conditioning in the affected hemisphere and down-conditioning in the non-affected hemisphere may contribute to reduced abnormal IHI and enhanced achievable functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chieffo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Pino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hummel and Cohen, 2006</xref>). Although the rehabilitation strategy of attempting to rebalance interhemispheric networks in order to improve motor recovery after stroke is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bundy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), the current technique can be tailored either to up-conditioning the damaged hemisphere, down-conditioning the intact hemisphere, a combination of both, or vice versa depending on the patient’s specific states. Furthermore, a previous review advocated the conceptual framework and suggested that a fundamental role of IHI is to support the narrowing of excitatory focus by co-opting the capacities of the two cerebral hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carson, 2020</xref>). This framework is consistent with the known associations between the structural integrity of callosal projections and the magnitude of the motor deficits after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Auriat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Granziera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koh et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, our spatially bivariate EEG-neurofeedback approach might be highly relevant to application perspective in the context of stroke recovery as well as a basic science perspective. Future work probing the residual ability to manipulate IHI in stroke patients is warranted.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has several limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the results. Although we successfully demonstrated the bidirectional changes in the ipsilateral SMR-ERD, the bidirectional changes in IHI from the right to the left hemisphere were not statistically significant since there was no significant difference between the MID and LOW sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The current results should prompt future studies to ascertain whether down-regulation of IHI (i.e. disinhibition) during MI and up-regulation of IHI at rest in the non-dominant hemisphere (intact hemisphere) are possible in a similar setup.</p><p>Additionally, a methodological limitation of our study was related to the order effects due to cumulative TMS pulses and elapsed time since the order of REST and NoFB sessions were not randomized (the last three neurofeedback sessions [HIGH, MID, and LOW] were randomized). However, statistical analyses included all sessions, including REST and NoFB sessions, using the latter two sessions as a control condition. Therefore, our comparison to REST and/or NoFB sessions may have been affected by the order effect.</p><p>For the limitations of the volitional control of SMR-ERD during unilateral MI, all participants were right-handed (Laterality Quotient: 72.2 ± 30.9%), as assessed by the Edinburgh Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Oldfield, 1971</xref>), to eliminate bias due to the dominance. If a left-handed participant performs the same experiment, the modulation effect via BCI-based neurofeedback may be different. Moreover, in case the contralateral SMR-ERD was up- or down-regulated instead of being maintained at a moderate level, it is unclear whether the ipsilateral SMR-ERD was modulated bidirectionally and whether the IHI changed with it. The study performed a total of 11 sessions, including REST and NoFB, and the combinations of SMR-ERDs in both hemispheres (3 conditions versus 3 conditions) may be worth evaluating in the future. In addition, it is not clear from previous experiments whether the bivariate neurofeedback approach is superior to the conventional BCI-based neurofeedback that exploits SMR-ERD from one hemisphere. Since both hemispheres are connected by intrinsic transcallosal projections and exhibit functional crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hofer and Frahm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meyer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Waters et al., 2017</xref>), it is expected that the sensorimotor excitability in the opposite hemisphere would also be up-regulated through univariate (i.e. ipsilateral hemisphere to the imagined hand) BCI-based neurofeedback. Consistent with the findings that the unilateral up- or down-regulation of the sensorimotor excitability manipulates the IHI magnitude, such sensorimotor activation without spatial specificity may inhibit the other hemisphere, leading to weaker range of IHI manipulation. Thus, we presumed that it is difficult to produce the same effect as this study via univariate BCI-based neurofeedback. A future study is required to directly compare the effect size of IHI manipulation between bivariate and univariate BCI-based neurofeedback in a within-participant cross-over design with adjusting experimental time by omitting certain experimental conditions.</p><p>Finally, the sex ratio in this study was the consequence of recruiting freely from the university; there was no experimental plan to equalize the sex ratio. Because there were few female participants in the study, it is unclear whether our findings can be generalized to females. Previous studies revealed that the brain microstructure, including corpus callosum, differed between men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dunst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menzler et al., 2011</xref>). It is unknown whether these sex differences influenced our IHI study and additional studies are required to determine this.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we presented an innovative approach to manipulate the state of IHI, by directly and bidirectionally modulating SMR-ERDs in a spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback paradigm.

The experiment consisted of five sessions: (1) resting-state (REST), (2) right finger MI without visual feedback (NoFB), (3) high (HIGH), (4) middle (MID), and (5) low (LOW) excitability states of the ipsilateral SM1 during BCI-based neurofeedback (details in ‘Experimental sessions’). The difference of IHI magnitude in the last three sessions (i.e. HIGH, MID, and LOW sessions) was the primary dependent variable of interest. The three neurofeedback sessions were conducted in a randomized order across participants. Prior to the three sessions, REST and NoFB sessions were performed to estimate individual baseline during rest and MI for the offline analysis.</p><p>To estimate the appropriate sample size for this study, a preliminary experiment was conducted before the main experiment. In the preliminary experiment, four healthy participants (not included in the main experiment) performed BCI-based neurofeedback training and underwent brain state-dependent dual-coil brain stimulation, similar to the main experiment. We calculated the IHI magnitude in each session.

All participants were right-handed (Laterality Quotient: 72.2 ± 30.9%) as assessed by the Edinburgh Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Oldfield, 1971</xref>). The TMS procedure was not applied to two participants due to the higher RMT (greater than 70% of the maximum stimulator output) of the right or left FDI muscles. This criterion ensured that the TMS stimulator would be able to perform at the required intensities for the whole duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stefanou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zrenner et al., 2018</xref>).

The EMG data from each trial were stored for offline analysis on a computer from 500 ms before to 500 ms after the TMS pulse. Simultaneously, 5–10 ms of data were transferred immediately after collection to a computer for real-time analysis. In case of muscular contraction due to finger movement, the experimenter reminded participants to relax their muscles and ensure absence of muscle activity during MI. To monitor the real-time surface EMG signals, EMG signals were band-pass filtered (5–1000 Hz with second-order Butterworth) with a 50 Hz notch to avoid power-line noise contamination; the root mean square of the filtered EMG signal from the FDI for the previous 1000 ms of data was displayed on the second experimenter’s screen in the form of a bar.</p><p>Throughout the experiment, the participants were seated in a comfortable chair with stable forearm support and performed MI of unilateral right index finger abduction.

We identified the optimal left and right coil positions over the hand representation area at which a single-pulse TMS evoked a MEP response in the FDI muscle with the lowest stimulus intensity, referred to as the motor hotspot. The TS was delivered to the motor hotspot of the left M1, with the handle of the coil pointing backward and approximately 45° to the midsagittal line. The other coil for the CS was placed over the motor hotspot of the right M1 but slightly reoriented at 45–60° relative to the midsagittal line because it was not possible to place two coils in some participants with small head size.This orientation is often chosen in IHI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daskalakis et al., 2002</xref>) since it induces a posterior-anterior current flow approximately perpendicular to the anterior wall of the central sulcus, which evokes MEPs at the lowest stimulus intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rossini et al., 2015</xref>). To immobilize the head and maintain fixed coil positions over the motor hotspots during the experiment, chin support and coil fixation arms were used.

Around 10 conditioned MEPs were collected for each CS intensity, along with 10 unconditioned MEPs (i.e. TS was given alone) in randomized order. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of the conditioned MEPs were averaged for the different CS intensities and expressed as a percentage of the mean unconditioned MEP amplitude. The IHI intensity curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) ensured that IHI was approximately half-maximum for each participant when 120–130% RMT of CS intensity was applied, similar to the previous EEG-TMS experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stefanou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tsutsumi et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback</title><p>The present study was conducted based on a spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback that displays bi-hemispheric sensorimotor cortical activities, which we recently developed in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hayashi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>). This method allows participants to learn to regulate these two variates at the same time and induce changes in target-hemisphere-specific SMR-ERD. Visual feedback was provided on a computer screen in the form of cursor movements in a two-dimensional coordinate, in which x- and y-axis corresponded to the degree of the ipsilateral (right) and contralateral (left) SMR-ERD to the imagined right hand, respectively. The axis range was set from the 5th (i.e. SMR-ERS) to 95th (i.e. SMR-ERD) percentile of intrinsic SMR-ERD distribution in the EEG calibration session, and the origin-position (x=0, y=0) represented median values of bilateral SMR-ERDs, respectively. The cursors were presented at the origin-position at the initiation of a trial, and values exceeding the boundary were rounded to either the 5th or 95th percentile. A key point of the current methodology is that, e.g., when participants were instructed to move the cursor toward the middle right (x&gt;0, y=0) in the two-dimensional coordinate, the position showed a strong SMR-ERD in the ipsilateral hemisphere and moderate SMR-ERD in the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback enables us to investigate how sensorimotor excitability in the target hemisphere (i.e. ipsilateral side to the imagined hand) contributes to IHI from the ipsilateral hemisphere to the contralateral hemisphere while maintaining constant contralateral sensorimotor excitability.</p><p>During MI, participants were asked to perform kinesthetic MI of right index finger abduction from the first-person perspective with equal time constants of 0.5 Hz cycle. Kinesthetic MI was performed because a previous study demonstrated that the focus of EEG activity during kinesthetic MI was close to the sensorimotor hand area, whereas visual MI did not reveal a clear spatial pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Neuper et al., 2005</xref>). To improve MI task compliance (i.e. whether all participants successfully performed the MI in the same manner), we not only asked them to perform kinesthetic MI from a first-person perspective but also asked them to perform a rehearsal before each session. In addition, we confirmed that SMR was observed in a frequency-specific, spatiotemporal-specific, and MI-related manner through offline analysis after each session. These characteristics of SMR-ERD indicate that kinesthetic MI, not visual MI, was performed appropriately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Neuper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pfurtscheller and Neuper, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Real-time brain state-dependent dual-coil brain stimulation</title><p>The bi-EEG-triggered dual-TMS setup analyzes the raw EEG signal in real time to trigger TMS pulses depending on the instantaneous bilateral spatially filtered SMR-ERDs (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Each trial was initiated by a 5 s resting epoch, followed by a 1 s ready epoch, and completed by a 6 s MI epoch. During this 12 s trial period, participants were asked not to move, blink, or swallow to prevent EEG artifacts derived from non-neural activity. After each 12 s trial, the screen went black for 3 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Participants were allowed to move freely to avoid mental fatigue during this interval period, before the next trial started. Thereafter, the target frequencies in the contralateral and ipsilateral SM1 were determined for each participant in order to feedback the most reactive frequency. Since SMR-ERD in the alpha band is a reliable EEG biomarker of increased neuronal excitability in SM1, corticospinal tract, and thalamocortical systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neuper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Soekadar et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Takemi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Takemi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>), the target frequencies were selected from the alpha band (8–13 Hz) by calculating the mean intensity of SMR-ERD with a 3 Hz sliding bin and 2 Hz overlap. Second, the target ranges of SMR-ERD during bi-EEG-triggered dual-TMS setting were normalized for each participant based on SMR-ERD distribution in the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres.</p><p>After the calibration session, the main IHI experiment with dual-coil paired-pulse TMS was performed in five consecutive sessions (10 min each) with fixed CS and TS intensities. Each session consisted of 12 s of 40 trials with 3 s interval periods as same as the EEG calibration session. Five experimental sessions comprised different conditions as follows: (1) resting-state where participants were instructed to relax and look at the origin of the 2-D coordinates on the computer screen in front of them (REST), (2) right finger MI without visual feedback (NoFB), participants tried to achieve (3) high (HIGH), (4) middle (MID) and (5) low (LOW) excitability states of the ipsilateral SM1 during BCI-base neurofeedback.

The EEG signal underwent a 1–70 Hz, second-order Butterworth bandpass filter and a 50 Hz notch filter. The EEG signals of all channels were spatially filtered using a common average reference, which subtracted the average value of the entire electrode montage (the common average) from that of the channel of interest to remove global noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McFarland et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tsuchimoto et al., 2021</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spatially bivariate EEG-neurofeedback can manipulate interhemispheric rebalancing of M1 excitability&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Nicole Wenderoth as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tomas Ros (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main claim of the authors that the spatially bivariate EEG-neurofeedback lead to changes in interhemispheric inhibition is currently not sufficiently supported by the experimental evidence because (i) the authors did not demonstrate that IHI could be modulated bidirectionally, (ii) the training did not lead to a corresponding change in interhemispheric coherence and, therefore, no conclusions with regard to interhemispheric &quot;rebalancing&quot; can be drawn, and (iii) it is unclear whether the effects were mainly driven by excitability changes in the right hemisphere such that changes in IHI are merely an epiphenomenon. It will be important to address these concerns by presenting control analyses and/or additional data.</p><p>2) There is no significant difference in Network-intensity (better: interhemispheric coherence) during MI between HIGH and LOW sessions; the provided explanations in the discussion are highly speculative. The most obvious explanation is that interhemispheric coherence was simply not changed by MI and ERD feedback. How can this lack of an effect be reconciled with the main claim of the authors?</p><p>3) The paired-pulse TMS effects could result from modulating the excitability of the right motor cortex. It is important to show that IHI changed over and above the CS effect.</p><p>4) Bidirectional control of IHI would need to be significantly demonstrated above and below the resting baseline. Although the study shows bidirectional control of SMR power (in the ipsilateral hemisphere), this is strictly not the case for IHI (which shows only significant increases relative to rest).</p><p>5) The result section is difficult to understand because context information is often missing since the detailed Methods are reported at the end. Please revise the results to improve accessibility for the reader.</p><p>6) Some statements like &quot;suggesting that the volitional control of SMR-ERDs in the closed-loop environment differs from spontaneous SMR fluctuations&quot; require a direct statistical comparison</p><p>7) Revise correlation analyses to properly account for within versus between-subject variability</p><p>8) It remains an open question, whether the more sophisticated neurofeedback approach (of modulating both hemispheres separately) was indeed necessary to achieve the findings of this work.</p><p>9) The dynamic range of SMR modulation occurs mainly in the ipsilateral hemisphere (in terms of bidirectional control). The contralateral hemisphere consistently shows increased SMR power relative to rest, with no bidirectional modulation. Please explain why this was the case and discuss potential implications</p><p>10) Why was the gender ratio of the subjects (1:11, F:M) so highly skewed? This should be explained, and potential limitations should be discussed</p><p>11) The discussion of the neurophysiological mechanisms mediating IHI would benefit from more depth and a better embedding into the literature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript reports the interesting phenomenon that selectively modulating the excitability of the right hemisphere changes interhemispheric inhibition from the right to the left hemisphere. While this is interesting, I'm wondering how the interhemispheric result relates to changes in corticospinal excitability as assessed via MEPs in response to the conditioning stimulus.</p><p>I understood that the CS has been chosen such that TS MEPs are reduced by approximately 50%. Was that done while participants were at rest or while they performed the MI task /BCI control?</p><p>If the CS intensity was determined at rest, did the authors analyse the CS MEPs and particularly how they change from IHI at rest to IHI during the MI/BCI control? Does IHI change independently of MEP modulation in response to the CS? This would be an important analysis also for the shuffled non-triggered trials since it might reveal whether corticospinal excitability and IHI can be controlled independently.</p><p>Please note that there has been some debate in the field whether or not the CS effect has to be kept constant across conditions. Thus, if there are differences in CS MEP amplitudes between the sessions, the authors might want to address this methodological issue in the discussion.</p><p>The result section is difficult to understand because context information is often missing since the detailed Methods are reported at the end. Please revise the results to improve accessibility for the reader. In that regard, I would recommend swapping the order in the result section and presenting first the EEG states and then the associated IHI measures.</p><p>What is the rationale for using right finger MI as the no-FB condition? Please explain</p><p>Line 257ff: there seems to be a mistake: «one-way rmANOVA for sessions (three levels: HIGH, MID, and LOW) revealed significant differences F(2,44) = 1.43, p &lt; 0.248,…» should probably read « revealed no significant differences».</p><p>Line 260 ff there seems to be a mistake: Although the IHI magnitude in the LOW session was larger than that in the HIGH and LOW sessions.… replace second LOW by MID.</p><p>I liked the control analysis of the authors shown in suppl. Figure 3-2, However, the conclusion that the LOW,MID,HIGH data shown in Figure 3B is different from the data shown in suppl. Figure 3-2 requires a direct statistical comparison.</p><p>Figure 4C: I'm not convinced that presenting the laterality index adds any information to Figure 4 A and B. In fact, I found the caption confusing since it seems to suggest that (i) the negative LI for LOW results from contralateral activity which is inconsistent with the topoplot that shows high activity in the ipsilateral hemisphere; and (ii) the positive LI for HIGH results from ipsilateral activity which is also inconsistent with the topo which shows desynchronisation in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Given the shown in panels A and B, the LI measure seems inappropriate since there are virtually no activity changes in the contralateral hemisphere while the ipsilateral hemisphere shows either synchronized or desynchronized SMR activity.</p><p>Associations between IHI magnitude and bilateral EEG patterns: The authors might want to consider calculating a repeated measures correlation because it does not seem meaningful to pool data across the LOW, MID, HIGH sessions.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Line 470ff: The first sentence of the discussion follows a reversed logic. Participants did not consciously self-regulate IHI but they modulated their EEG pattern based on the closed-loop spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback. Changes in IHI were the consequence of self-regulating the EEG activity pattern.

J Physiol. 2020 Nov;598(21):4781-4802 might help.</p><p>The authors argue that &quot;This multimodal EEG-TMS approach proves that the bilateral α and β activities observed in the current study served to regulate the inhibition and facilitation of inhibitory functional coupling of interhemispheric interaction over motor cortices.» This argument would be strengthened if the interhemispheric effects were independent of the general excitability of the ipsilateral hemisphere as reflected in CS MEP amplitudes. Only then, the authors can argue that their intervention specifically modulated interhemispheric circuits.</p><p>Lines 538-544: Explanatory theoretical model: I cannot follow the argument of the authors. Is it possible that IHI and &quot;network intensity&quot; simply reflect the activity of different neural populations? IHI effects are rather specific and I doubt that this could be picked up via general EEG markers.</p><p>Line 561ff This seems to be consistent «Furthermore, the effect size of IHI manipulation in the current study (Cohen's d = 1.50) was approximately 1-2-fold higher than that of representative tDCS (Cohen's d = 1.55)…».</p><p>Discussion of IHI in stroke: As stated by the authors, it is somewhat controversial whether IHI is a useful therapy target early after stroke. However, their EEG-neurofeedback approach allows to selectively up- or down-regulate one hemisphere which might be highly relevant in the context of stroke recovery both from a basic science and application perspective. It might be worthwhile to expand this aspect of the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the Introduction is comprehensive in terms of the mechanistic relation between EEG and TMS variables, it does not sufficiently include the &quot;clinical&quot; significance of modifying IHI e.g. in terms of rehabilitation potential. It would be nice to include a few references in clinical populations where IHI and/or SMR are impacted, or where IHI/SMR have been used as prognostic markers of motor recovery. I would also include a sentence or two in the Abstract underlining the potential clinical significance of manipulating IHI.</p><p>In terms of related studies combining the TMS/EEG/BCI trio, the work by Ros et al. 2010 was one of the first to demonstrate that MEP measures of cortical excitability and inhibition (MEP, SICI) can be modulated using closed-loop feedback of oscillations from the motor cortex.</p><p>Ros, T., Munneke, M.A.M., Ruge, D., Gruzelier, J.H. and Rothwell, J.C.

Mean and sum have different definitions, do you mean 'the mean value of all the triggered trials'?</p><p>There is no reference to what the abbreviation 'TS' stands for (I am assuming it is &quot;test stimulus&quot;)</p><p>Line 219: The manipulation range of IHI (i.e., the difference between HIGH and LOW sessions) was 32.6. However elsewhere the means (Line 222/ 223) are separately indicated as HIGH: 62.0 and LOW: 96.9. Their difference (96.9 – 62.0) is 34.9.</p><p>Line 263: &quot;suggesting that the volitional control of SMR-ERDs in the closed-loop environment differs from spontaneous SMR fluctuations&quot;. This depends on how one defines the word &quot;differs&quot;. In this case, the comparison is technically qualitative as the contrast is between a significant result (volitional control, p &lt;0.05) and a non-significant one (spontaneous fluctuation, p &gt; 0.05). However, a more direct comparison would involve comparing the two effects directly (volitional vs spontaneous) by statistically testing for a significant difference in effect sizes (e.g. using a two-way rmANOVA).</p><p>Taking the effect size of the HIGH-vs-LOW contrast as an example, for volitional control this is d = 1.42, while for spontaneous fluctuation it is d = 0.49, which yields a differential d = 0.93 (1.42 -0.49). This is likely statistically significant but it will depend on the error term, hence the need for a formal two-way rmANOVA analysis with an interaction effect. This should be done for all the contrast analyses in the paper (including SMR power), instead of using the one-way ANOVA.</p><p>The dynamic range of SMR modulation occurs mainly in the ipsilateral hemisphere (in terms of bidirectional control). The contralateral hemisphere consistently shows increased SMR power relative to rest, with no bidirectional modulation. How do the authors explain this ? Could this be due to how the neurofeedback was implemented for each hemisphere (thresholds/rewards)? Right hand dominance? If the latter, where there any differential effects in the subgroup of left hand dominant participants?</p><p>Line 580: &quot;the current technique can be tailored either to upregulate the damaged hemisphere, down-regulate the intact hemisphere…&quot; and Line 585: &quot;In conclusion, we presented an innovative approach to voluntarily and bidirectionally manipulate the state of IHI&quot;</p><p>Critically, bidirectional control would need to be significantly demonstrated above and below the resting baseline. Although the study shows bidirectional control of SMR power (in the ipsilateral hemisphere), this is strictly not the case for IHI (which shows only significant increases relative to rest). Hence, the term &quot;bidirectional&quot; should not be used in the context of the IHI, but rather the phrase &quot;control of interhemispheric disinhibition&quot;. Hence, the authors could state that the current results should motivate future studies investigating whether upregulation of IHI in the damaged hemisphere is possible above and beyond spontaneous resting values.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a well-conducted study building and expanding on the pioneering work of this group (Takemi et al. 2013, 2015). The novel contribution of this study is that self-regulated ERD is not modulating the TMS effects on the periphery (MEP) only, but also the TMS effects on the opposite brain hemisphere. This has been probed by IHI, but may probably have also been shown by TEP.</p><p>All other interpretations with regard to &quot;rebalancing&quot;, &quot;pathway-specificity&quot;, &quot;interhemispheric connectivity&quot;, and &quot;challenging the concept of neurorehabilitation&quot; etc. are far fetching and should be toned down. Such statements would have necessitated (i) either direct neurofeedback of interhemispheric coherence, (ii) or demonstration of a direct link between the self-regulated ERD and interhemispheric coherence, and (iii) the application in patient populations.</p><p>Therefore, it is advisable to better link this study to the large body of literature in the IHI field, and discuss where this work adds additional insights. It is surprising, for example, that relevant previous literature is not referred to and discussed: Liang et al. (2014) have shown that imagined movements change IHI, Nelson et al. (2009) demonstrated bi-directional IHI, and Morishita et al. (2011, 2012) contributed with regard to ipsilateral inhibitory circuits and IHI. This work should be cited.</p><p>The weaknesses listed above should also be acknowledged as limitations in the discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Spatially bivariate EEG-neurofeedback can manipulate interhemispheric inhibition&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Ivry (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Based on the new analyses, it is unclear whether the original finding that interhemispheric inhibition can be modulated by a new EEG neurofeedback approach does still hold. Reviewer #1 points out an alternative statistical approach that might strengthen the original argument of the authors while controlling for changes in the excitability of the modulated hemisphere.</p><p>Reviewer #3 points out that it is still unclear whether bihemispheric EEG is superior to unihemispheric EEG. The authors might want to address this comment by adding an in-depth discussion of how their new neurofeedback method compares with existing methods with regard to modulating interhemispheric interactions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors provided very thorough and extensive revisions and they have addressed most of my comments. It is particularly reassuring to see the additional analyses of corticomotor excitability as probed by the CS.</p><p>However, I'm still not completely convinced by the author's statistical approach.</p><p>If I understood the approach correctly, % change in IHI and % change of CS MEP amplitude were entered into one rmANOVA model and the authors tested for a condition x index interaction effect (which did not reach significance). This is a rather strict comparison. A more traditional approach would be to add % CS change as a covariate of no interest and test whether the IHI effect survives even if the covariate is added. If that is the case, the authors have demonstrated that IHI changes over and above the variance explained by the CS effect which would support their initial hypothesis that IHI can be modulated via their EEG-BCI and is not simply an epiphenomenon. No other statistical analyses would be required. However, the discussion would need to be modified!</p><p>The authors also analysed changes in CS MEP amplitude across conditions. CS MEPs did not significantly differ across the different EEG-BCI conditions. However, the absence of a significant effect does not allow the authors to conclude that there is &quot;no effect&quot;. This would require a Bayesian approach which would test whether the data provides evidence in favour of H0. This could be another argument that IHI changes over and above CS changes. However, I don't think that these additional analyses would be needed if the co-variance analysis of IHI would reach significance. Maybe the authors might want to consult a stats expert for this analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am satisfied with the author's responses and revisions, which are extensive and much more consistent with the collected evidence from the experiment.</p><p>Ultimately, I am ambivalent (i.e. neither for nor against) on recommending this paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> based on its scientific significance. On a positive note, the authors clearly demonstrate that it is possible to modulate IHI (albeit unidirectionally) using bivariate neurofeedback, and this is an original and scientifically novel contribution. On the other hand, from the experiments conducted, it is not clear whether the bivariate neurofeedback approach is critical for the observed findings since there is no comparison to the conventional BCI-based neurofeedback that exploits SMR-ERD from one hemisphere. Hence the results show evidence of &quot;sufficient&quot; conditions to reduce inter-hemispheric inhibition (IHI) but do not provide evidence of &quot;necessary&quot; conditions i.e. whether uni-hemispheric neurofeedback would lead to similar effects but with a much more parsimonious experimental setup that does not involve controlling EEG from both hemispheres.</p><p>I, therefore, leave it to the senior editor for the ultimate decision regarding publication, taking also into account the other reviewers' comments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76411.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main claim of the authors that the spatially bivariate EEG-neurofeedback lead to changes in interhemispheric inhibition is currently not sufficiently supported by the experimental evidence because (i) the authors did not demonstrate that IHI could be modulated bidirectionally, (ii) the training did not lead to a corresponding change in interhemispheric coherence and, therefore, no conclusions with regard to interhemispheric &quot;rebalancing&quot; can be drawn, and (iii) it is unclear whether the effects were mainly driven by excitability changes in the right hemisphere such that changes in IHI are merely an epiphenomenon.

The most obvious explanation is that interhemispheric coherence was simply not changed by MI and ERD feedback. How can this lack of an effect be reconciled with the main claim of the authors?</p></disp-quote><p>Our results presented a spatially bivariate EEG-based neurofeedback approach that enables healthy participants to independently self-regulate excitability of the left versus right hemispheres resulting in IHI changes. However, interhemispheric coherence was not associated with ipsilateral excitability (Figure 5D). We would like to emphasize that this exploratory analysis only provides a limited minor result.</p><p>We think that our results are reasonable since it is possible that interhemispheric coherence did not reflect inhibitory modulation via neurofeedback; IHI and Network-intensity may reflect the activity of different neural populations. Our explanatory theoretical model (Lines 538-544 in the previous manuscript) has not been fully clarified based on the experimental results, so we have removed the relevant text and simplified the discussion. It is unclear whether fMRI-based neurofeedback using interhemispheric functional connectivity is linked to ipsilateral excitability, and whether it modulates IHI magnitude.</p><p>In addition, the interhemispheric coherence was calculated with one-to-one electrodes, while the Network-intensity is an expanded index for evaluation between multiple electrodes. In this study, Network-intensity was adopted to evaluate coherence involving not only C3 (or C4) but also peripheral multiple electrodes. Previous studies described that Network-intensity was calculated from the corrected imaginary part of coherence (ciCOH) (Ewald et al., 2012; Hayashi et al., 2020; Vukelić and Gharabaghi, 2015).

Additionally, neurofeedback using interhemispheric functional connectivity has the possibility to counteract the modulation of IHIs from the right to left hemisphere and from the left to right hemisphere. Our results showed no significant difference in Network-intensity during MI between HIGH and LOW sessions (Figure 5D), indicating that interhemispheric functional connectivity at the EEG level was not changed, whereas IHI was modulated. This may indicate that IHI and Network-intensity simply reflect the activity of different neural populations; interhemispheric projections act via surround/lateral inhibition in the sensory and motor cortices (Carson, 2020), while the synchrony at the EEG level reflects changes in the activity of local interactions between pyramidal neurons and interneurons in the thalamocortical loops (Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999). Furthermore, it is possible that Network-intensity reflects the degree of bidirectional synchrony between the two motor cortices, while IHI in this study reflects one-way (right-to-left) inhibitory effects.”</p><p>[Lines 1157-1159] “Therefore, it is unclear whether fMRI-based neurofeedback using interhemispheric functional connectivity is linked to ipsilateral excitability, and whether it modulates IHI magnitude.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The paired-pulse TMS effects could result from modulating the excitability of the right motor cortex.

We have added additional results related to changes in corticospinal excitability as assessed by MEPs in the left FDI in response to the conditioning stimulus over the right hemisphere (Figure 4—figure supplements 3B). A direct statistical comparison between increase in IHI and left MEP amplitude is shown in Figure 4—figure supplements 3C. To compare the two indices, the percent changes based on the values in NoFB session were calculated. The stimulus intensity of the CS during the experiment was set such that the CS evoked MEP of peak-to-peak amplitude from the left FDIs (SI<sub>1mV</sub>) “at rest” (Lines 1482-1484, “The stimulus intensities of the left and right M1 to evoke MEP …”). In addition, we analyzed the non-triggered trials to show the CS effect (Figure 4—figure supplements 3D).</p><p>Based on the additional results, the MEP amplitudes in the left FDI elicited by CS did not vary across sessions, indicating that the modulation of the ipsilateral SMR-ERD caused no changes in corticospinal excitability in the contralateral side. Although we successfully revealed that modulating the excitability of the right hemisphere changes IHI from the right to the left hemisphere, a significant interaction between IHI modulation and changes in the left MEP amplitude was not observed. Thus, the specificity of the IHI manipulation could not be fully demonstrated. To confirm whether the participants learned pathway-specific IHI manipulation, the CS effect should have been kept constant across the conditions by adjusting the CS intensity to evoke left MEP of 1 mV peak-to-peak amplitude. Because such an experiment was not possible in the present study due to the time limitation (the experimental time would need to be doubled to 5–6 h to perform such an experiment), further studies are warranted.</p><p>We have toned down our results and conclusions, such as the use of the term &quot;pathway-specific&quot; manipulation, since our experiment did not directly demonstrate whether changes in interhemispheric inhibition and corticospinal excitability are independent phenomena. We have revised the manuscript to include these additional analyses, figures, and limitations.</p><p>[Lines 555-599] “Although we revealed that modulating the excitability of the right hemisphere changes IHI magnitude from the right to the left hemisphere, the specificity of the IHI manipulation was not proved yet. We presented additional results related to changes in corticospinal excitability as assessed by MEPs in the left FDI in response to the CS over the right hemisphere (Figure 4—figure supplements 3B).

Furthermore, in order to investigate whether changes in IHI from the right to the left hemisphere and changes in corticospinal excitability in the right hemisphere are independent phenomena, a direct statistical comparison between the normalized IHI and the normalized left MEP was applied. During the triggered TMS trials, a two-way rmANOVA for sessions (three levels: HIGH, MID, and LOW) and indices (two levels: increase in IHI and left MEP amplitude) revealed a significant main effect for sessions (F<sub>(2, 122)</sub> = 3.96, <italic>p</italic> = 0.022, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.06), but no main effect for indices (F<sub>(1, 122)</sub> = 1.11, <italic>p</italic> = 0.294, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.01) and for interaction (F<sub>(2, 122)</sub> = 1.65, <italic>p</italic> = 0.195, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.03).

Please explain why this was the case and discuss potential implications</p></disp-quote><p>We aimed to modulate the ipsilateral hemisphere bidirectionally while maintaining constant the contralateral excitability using our spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback. To evaluate the effect of SMR modulation in the ipsilateral hemisphere, participants always aimed to maintain constant contralateral SMR-ERD. As written in the manuscript (&quot;Spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback&quot;), visual feedback was provided on a computer screen in the form of cursor movements in a two-dimensional coordinate, in which x- and y-axis corresponded to the degree of the ipsilateral and contralateral SMR-ERD, respectively. For example, in HIGH session, participants were instructed to move the cursor toward the middle right (x &gt; 0, y = 0) in the two-dimensional coordinate, the position showed a strong SMR-ERD in the ipsilateral hemisphere and moderate SMR-ERD in the contralateral hemisphere. On the contrary, in LOW session, participants were instructed to move the cursor toward the middle left (x &lt; 0, y = 0) in the two-dimensional coordinate, the position showed a low SMR-ERD (or strong SMR-ERS) in the ipsilateral hemisphere and moderate SMR-ERD in the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback enables us to modulate the ipsilateral SMR-ERD bidirectionally while maintaining constant contralateral SMR-ERD in the three sessions (i.e., HIGH, MID and LOW). In fact, Figures 2A and B showed the intended results. To help readers’ understanding, we prepared a sample video as Video 1.</p><p>The above is the answer to your point, but we notice that we need to describe the experimental limitation regarding (1) handedness and (2) the other patterns of the contralateral excitability. In this study, all participants were right-handed (Laterality Quotient: 72.2 ± 30.9%), as assessed by the Edinburgh Inventory (Oldfield, 1971), to eliminate bias due to the dominance. If a left-handed participant performs the same experiment, the modulation effect via BCI-based neurofeedback may be different.

We have added additional results related to changes in corticospinal excitability as assessed by MEPs in the left FDI in response to the conditioning stimulus over the right hemisphere (Figure 4—figure supplements 3B). A direct statistical comparison between increase in IHI and left MEP amplitude is shown in Figure 4—figure supplements 3C. To compare the two indices, the percent changes based on the values in NoFB session were calculated. The stimulus intensity of the CS during the experiment was set such that the CS evoked MEP of peak-to-peak amplitude from the left FDIs (SI<sub>1mV</sub>) “at rest” (Lines 1482-1484, “The stimulus intensities of the left and right M1 to evoke MEP …”). In addition, we analyzed the non-triggered trials to show the CS effect (Figure 4—figure supplements 3D).</p><p>Based on the additional results, the MEP amplitudes in the left FDI elicited by CS did not vary across sessions, indicating that the modulation of the ipsilateral SMR-ERD caused no changes in corticospinal excitability in the contralateral side. Although we successfully revealed that modulating the excitability of the right hemisphere changes IHI from the right to the left hemisphere, a significant interaction between IHI modulation and changes in the left MEP amplitude was not observed. Thus, the specificity of the IHI manipulation could not be fully demonstrated.

To evaluate the effect of SMR modulation in the ipsilateral hemisphere, participants always aimed to maintain constant contralateral SMR-ERD. As written in the manuscript (&quot;Spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback&quot;), visual feedback was provided on a computer screen in the form of cursor movements in a two-dimensional coordinate, in which x- and y-axis corresponded to the degree of the ipsilateral and contralateral SMR-ERD, respectively. For example, in HIGH session, participants were instructed to move the cursor toward the middle right (x &gt; 0, y = 0) in the two-dimensional coordinate, the position showed a strong SMR-ERD in the ipsilateral hemisphere and moderate SMR-ERD in the contralateral hemisphere. On the contrary, in LOW session, participants were instructed to move the cursor toward the middle left (x &lt; 0, y = 0) in the two-dimensional coordinate, the position showed a low SMR-ERD (or strong SMR-ERS) in the ipsilateral hemisphere and moderate SMR-ERD in the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, spatially bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback enables us to modulate the ipsilateral SMR-ERD bidirectionally while maintaining constant contralateral SMR-ERD in the three sessions (i.e., HIGH, MID and LOW).

On the other hand, from the experiments conducted, it is not clear whether the bivariate neurofeedback approach is critical for the observed findings since there is no comparison to the conventional BCI-based neurofeedback that exploits SMR-ERD from one hemisphere. Hence the results show evidence of &quot;sufficient&quot; conditions to reduce inter-hemispheric inhibition (IHI) but do not provide evidence of &quot;necessary&quot; conditions i.e. whether uni-hemispheric neurofeedback would lead to similar effects but with a much more parsimonious experimental setup that does not involve controlling EEG from both hemispheres.</p><p>I, therefore, leave it to the senior editor for the ultimate decision regarding publication, taking also into account the other reviewers' comments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an in-depth comparison of the new bivariate and univariate neurofeedback methods.</p><p>First, this study did not perform to show the necessary and sufficient condition that IHI can be manipulated only via bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback.

A future study should be performed to directly compare the effect size of the IHI manipulation between bivariate and univariate BCI-based neurofeedback in a within-participant cross-over design with adjusting experimental time by omitting some experimental conditions. Again, the present study focused to show the feasibility of bivariate BCI-based neurofeedback for targeted IHI manipulation, and required 2.5–3 h of the experimental protocol for proving this.</p><p>When conducted a future experiment for direct comparison of bivariate and univariate BCI-based neurofeedback, it is highly probable that the necessary conditions will be satisfied for the following reasons.</p><p>Our findings indicated that unilateral (not bilateral) up- or down-regulation of the sensorimotor excitability manipulates the IHI magnitude (Figure 2C and Figure 4B), which is consistent with previous studies (Carson, 2020; Duque et al., 2005; Murase et al., 2004). However, conventional methods did not guarantee unilateral specific sensorimotor activation (Buch et al., 2008; Caria et al., 2011; Soekadar et al., 2015). In addition, SMR-ERD was observed focused over the scalp sensorimotor areas, mainly bilaterally (e.g., Pichiorri et al., 2011; Vidaurre et al., 2019). Therefore, the effect of IHI modulation may be minimal because the bilateral up-regulation of the sensorimotor excitability via univariate BCI-based neurofeedback may inhibit the other hemispheres. We did not investigate whether the conventional univariate neurofeedback that exploits SMR-ERD from one hemisphere achieves bidirectional modulation of the target-hemisphere-dependent SMR-ERD and the accompanying IHI magnitude, but it is assumed that the sensorimotor excitability in the opposite hemisphere would be also up-regulated through univariate neurofeedback, leading to a weaker range of IHI manipulation.</p><p>Based on the aforementioned factors, we presumed that it is difficult to produce a similar effect as this study via univariate BCI-based neurofeedback. Even if IHI-state manipulation is equally achieved via univariate BCI-based neurofeedback, our scientific significance remains established. Direct comparison would be executed beyond this work.</p><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised the discussion and limitations in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>[Lines 709-723] “In addition, it is not clear from previous experiments whether the bivariate neurofeedback approach is superior to the conventional BCI-based neurofeedback that exploits SMR-ERD from one hemisphere. Since both hemispheres are connected by intrinsic transcallosal projections and exhibit functional crosstalk (Arai et al., 2011; Hofer and Frahm, 2006; Meyer et al., 1995; Waters et al., 2017), it is expected that the sensorimotor excitability in the opposite hemisphere would also be up-regulated through univariate (i.e., ipsilateral hemisphere to the imagined hand) BCI-based neurofeedback. Consistent with the findings that the unilateral up- or down-regulation of the sensorimotor excitability manipulates the IHI magnitude, such sensorimotor activation without spatial specificity may inhibit the other hemisphere, leading to weaker range of IHI manipulation. Thus, we presumed that it is difficult to produce a similar effect as this study via univariate BCI-based neurofeedback. A future study is required to directly compare the effect size of IHI manipulation between bivariate and univariate BCI-based neurofeedback in a within-participant cross-over design with adjusting experimental time by omitting certain experimental conditions.”</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>Arai N, Müller-Dahlhaus F, Murakami T, Bliem B, Lu M-K, Ugawa Y, Ziemann U.
