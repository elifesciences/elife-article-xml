increase oral absorption and potency of phosphonate antibiotics. Prodrugging can mask problematic chemical features that prevent cellular uptake and may enable tissue-specific compound delivery. However, many carboxy ester promoieties are rapidly hydrolyzed by serum esterases, limiting their therapeutic potential. While carboxy ester-based prodrug targeting is feasible, it has seen limited use in microbes as microbial esterase-specific promoieties have not been described. Here we identify the bacterial esterases, GloB and FrmB, that activate carboxy ester prodrugs in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus.</italic> Additionally, we determine the substrate specificities for FrmB and GloB and demonstrate the structural basis of these preferences. Finally, we establish the carboxy ester substrate specificities of human and mouse sera, ultimately identifying several promoieties likely to be serum esterase-resistant and microbially labile. These studies will enable structure-guided design of antistaphylococcal promoieties and expand the range of molecules to target staphylococcal pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>antibacterial</kwd><kwd>prodrug</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd><kwd>esterase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI103280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Odom John</surname><given-names>Audrey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI123808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Odom John</surname><given-names>Audrey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI130584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Odom John</surname><given-names>Audrey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1 RR024992</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jez</surname><given-names>Joseph M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PATH</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Odom John</surname><given-names>Audrey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15-GM110641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>R Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prodrug antibiotics can be designed that are serum-stable but readily cleaved inside bacterial pathogens.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antimicrobial resistance presents a major challenge to public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antimicrobial resistance in the age of COVID-19, 2020</xref>). In 2019, 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occurred in the United States, resulting in 35,000 deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">CDC, 2019</xref>). Some estimates have suggested that antimicrobial-resistant infections will cause as many as 10 million deaths annually by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">WHO (World Health Organisation), 2019a</xref>). <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a devastating human pathogen. Methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) has been labeled a ‘serious threat’ by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">CDC, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kourtis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Turner et al., 2019</xref>). New antimicrobials, especially those with novel mechanisms of action, are urgently needed; however, most anti-infectives under development take advantage of existing antibiotic scaffolds with proven efficacy and established safety profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Global Antimicrobial Resistance Hub, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">WHO (World Health Organisation), 2019b</xref>). New, chemically distinct antibiotics are highly desirable as a strategy to circumvent antimicrobial resistance.</p><p>Many metabolic processes are essential for microbial growth and/or pathogenesis, although few existing antimicrobials exploit metabolism as an anti-infective target. Metabolic drug design can be facile, as natural substrates serve as a template for competitive inhibitors. As metabolism often involves the transformation of highly charged and polar metabolites, inhibitors of metabolic enzymes often take advantage of phosphonate functional groups for target engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azema et al., 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, negatively charged phosphonates are readily excluded from cell membranes and often exhibit poor drug-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edwards et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hecker and Erion, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heidel and Dowd, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kornberg et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mackie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKenney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wiemer and Wiemer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). New strategies enabling effective deployment of antimetabolites will serve to expand the druggable space for antimicrobials.</p><p>One means of improving phosphonate cellular permeability is to chemically mask the undesirable negative charge with lipophilic groups. This strategy (termed prodrugging) can employ labile promoieties that are removed during absorption, distribution, or intracellularly to yield the original phosphonate antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hecker and Erion, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heidel and Dowd, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wiemer and Wiemer, 2015</xref>). We have previously designed a series of MEPicide antibiotics, in which phosphonate isoprenoid biosynthesis inhibitors are modified with a lipophilic pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) promoiety. MEPicide prodrugs bypass the need for active cellular transport, while simultaneously increasing compound potency against zoonotic staphylococci, <italic>S. schleiferi</italic> and <italic>S. pseudintermedius</italic>, as well as <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edwards et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKenney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">San Jose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">San Jose et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Uh et al., 2011</xref>). However, POM promoieties are rapidly hydrolyzed by serum carboxylesterases, which limits the in vivo efficacy of POM prodrugs as a strategy to improve the drug-like features of charged antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Prodrug activation model (<bold>A</bold>) and proposed enzymatic mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Carboxy ester promoieties highlighted in green.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66657-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>To enable effective cellular delivery of phosphonate antibiotics, new lipophilic prodrug moieties that are resistant to serum carboxylesterases – yet cleavable by microbial esterases – are required. This strategy has been effectively used to achieve tissue-specific selective prodrug activation. For example, liver-targeted prodrug delivery was achieved by harnessing the distinct substrate specificity of the liver-specific isoform of P450, CYP3A4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erion et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erion et al., 2004</xref>). Accordingly, understanding the enzymatic and structural mechanisms of microbial prodrug activation will facilitate the development of microbe-specific prodrugs.</p><p>We recently described the staphylococcal enzyme, GloB, which facilitates activation of carboxy ester prodrugs in <italic>S. schleiferi</italic> and <italic>S. pseudintermedius</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mikati et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, GloB is insufficient to fully activate prodrugs in vitro, suggesting that at least one additional enzyme is necessary for complete phosphonate release. In this work, we identify and characterize the role of two <italic>S. aureus</italic> esterases, GloB and FrmB, which each catalyze carboxy ester prodrug hydrolysis and contribute to carboxy ester prodrug activation. We demonstrate that both esterases have defined substrate specificities, which diverge from the substrate specificities of human and mouse sera. Finally, we present the three-dimensional structures of GloB and FrmB to enable ongoing structure-guided design of FrmB- and GloB-targeted prodrugs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of microbial esterases responsible for carboxylesterase activity</title><p>In the zoonotic staphylococcal species <italic>S. schleiferi</italic> and <italic>S. pseudintermedius</italic>, loss of the enzyme GloB, a hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase, or glyoxalase II enzyme confers resistance to carboxy ester prodrugs because carboxy ester prodrugs are not activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mikati et al., 2020</xref>). However, purified GloB alone is insufficient to activate carboxy ester prodrugs in vitro, suggesting that at least one additional cellular enzyme is required. Based on the hypothesized carboxy ester activation pathway, we predicted that the missing enzyme(s) might be either another carboxylesterase or a phosphodiesterase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To establish the pathway for carboxy ester prodrug activation in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we made use of the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library (NTML), in which nearly 2000 non-essential <italic>S. aureus</italic> genes have been individually disrupted by a stable transposon insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fey et al., 2013</xref>). Using the gene ontology feature on the NTML website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://app1.unmc.edu/fgx/gene-ontologies.html">https://app1.unmc.edu/fgx/gene-ontologies.html</ext-link>), we identified 6 carboxylic ester hydrolases (including <italic>gloB</italic>), 11 phosphatases, and 9 phosphoric diester hydrolases as candidate activators of carboxy ester prodrugs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Each identified transposon mutant was screened for resistance to the carboxy ester prodrug, POM-HEX. POM-HEX is a pivaloyloxymethyl prodrug of the compound HEX, which inhibits the glycolytic enzyme enolase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Of the 26 candidate esterase transposon mutants, only two strains were significantly more resistant to POM-HEX than the <italic>S. aureus</italic> parental strain, JE2, as determined by half-maximal growth inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). One of these strains had a transposon disrupting the gene that encodes the glyoxalase II enzyme, GloB. The GloB ortholog in <italic>S. scheiferi</italic> is a prodrug-activating enzyme, mutation in which confers resistance to POM-HEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mikati et al., 2020</xref>). The second POM-HEX-resistant strain harbored a transposon insertion in the locus encoding the predicted carboxylesterase annotated as FrmB. FrmB has been previously identified as FphF, a serine hydrolase, and is the primary <italic>S. aureus</italic> target of the sulfonyl fluoride compound JCP678 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lentz et al., 2018</xref>).

This finding is in agreement with a previous characterization of FrmB as having a preference for short-chain and unbranched hydrophobic lipid substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fellner et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, GloB has no detectable activity against these substrates and neither GloB nor FrmB hydrolyzes 4-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate despite its structural similarity to POM-HEX. This may be due to the absence of the acyloxymethyl ether moiety in 4-nitrophenyl substrates, which is found in POM-prodrugs.</p><p>We also sought to directly assess the role of GloB and FrmB in POM-HEX activation. We incubated each enzyme with POM-HEX and characterized the products via <sup>31</sup>P-<sup>1</sup>H-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We have previously shown that GloB removes only one POM moiety, resulting in an accumulation of mono-POM-HEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mikati et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, FrmB is capable of removing only one POM moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We hypothesized that the two esterases may be stereoselective and incubated both enzymes with POM-HEX. We find that incubation of POM-HEX with GloB and FrmB still results in an accumulation of mono-POM-HEX, suggesting that neither of the two esterases efficiently cleaves the charged mono-POM species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GloB and FrmB substrate specificity</title><p>To facilitate design of microbially targeted prodrug activation using these two enzymes, we next sought to extensively characterize GloB and FrmB substrate specificity.

This library systematically varies ester substrate length, branching patterns, and ether and sulfide positioning, thereby allowing for the precise determination of structure-activity relationships. Kinetic measurements were performed for both FrmB and GloB over a range of substrate concentrations for the entire library, allowing for the calculation of catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) for each enzyme and substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and 2).</p><p>We find that FrmB and GloB tend to have the highest activity toward oxygen ethers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). GloB has the highest activity against short-chain ethers (compounds 1–3), with some tolerance for branching at the first carbon beyond the ester carbonyl (compounds 7–9), while extensive branching strongly reduces activity (compound 10). Remarkably, GloB is tolerant of the extreme steric bulk introduced with the phenoxyacetic acid substrate, if the substrate contains an oxygen or sulfur ether (compound series 11). GloB exhibits a strong preference for oxygen at the β-position to the carbonyl over the γ-position but is indifferent to the positioning of sulfur. While GloB has a wider range of catalytic specificities, FrmB exhibits lower overall activity and a narrower range of catalytic efficiency. FrmB hydrolyzes unbranched substrates with little regard for chain length or the end-of-chain bulk within the tested substrates (compound series 1–3, 11). Branching at the position following the ester carbonyl (compound series 7–9, 12) is deleterious to FrmB activity. When oxygen is included in the chain, positioning at the β-position to the carbonyl is strongly preferred over the γ-position. For both GloB and FrmB, expanding the library of substrates tested will be revelatory of the true limitations of enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Importance of substrate specificity in vivo</title><p>While in vitro enzymatic substrate profiling is informative for how individual enzymes activate prodrugs, it may not reflect the complex biochemical processes happening in vivo, where additional cellular esterases may impact overall compound activation.

Serine hydrolases classically bind the substrate carbonyl oxygen in an oxyanion hole, and substrate hydrolysis is initiated through attack of the catalytic serine on the ester carbonyl. The docking of 1O on FrmB mimics the initial state of a serine hydrolase reaction, with the carbonyl oxygen buried and the catalytic serine poised for attack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The pocket directly next to the oxyanion hole is relatively narrow, suggesting that steric hindrance explains the poor activity of FrmB against branched substrates. The active site pocket extends and opens significantly after passing by the oxyanion hole, supporting the capacity of FrmB to hydrolyze substrates that contain large steric groups distant from the carbonyl carbon, such as 11O.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Three-dimensional structure of GloB</title><p>We also solved the structure of SaGloB to 1.65 Å, using selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted GloB, and molecular replacement, using metallo-β-lactamase TTHA1623 from Thermus thermophilus as a search model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamamura et al., 2009</xref>).

The GloB active site channel appears moderately wide, explaining why extensively branched substrates are not tolerated. Toward the end of the active site channel, GloB appears to form a tunnel. This tunnel is not reached by substrate 1O, but presumably would be occupied in more sterically bulky substrates such as 11O. One arm of this tunnel is comprised of the highly flexible loop, which is only partially visible in our electron density, suggesting that during catalysis this flexible loop may accommodate larger substrates, such as 11O.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Esterase specificity of human and mouse sera</title><p>We sought to evaluate whether ester promoieties could be designed for microbe-specific activation. Using the same 32-compound fluorescent substrate library, we determined each substrate’s serum half-life. Both reconstituted and fresh sera functions are comparable in their activity and substrate preferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We performed full kinetic profiling of lyophilized human sera to define its ester substrate specificity. As sera is a mixture of multiple proteins instead of a single protein species, we report the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> normalized to the total amount of protein added to the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). As observed for FrmB and GloB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), human sera has highest activity for oxygen and sulfur ether compounds. In contrast to FrmB and GloB, human sera is relatively uniform in its esterase activity across the substrate library. Short-chain substrates exhibit the highest catalytic efficiency, and though branching slightly reduces efficiency, it does not have as profound an impact as was observed with FrmB. The substrates displaying the poorest catalytic efficiency are universally the carbon series, in which added branching resulting in decreased substrate utilization.</p><p>As murine models are frequently used in the development and testing of novel pharmaceuticals, we also characterized the substrate preferences of mouse sera. Notably, mice are well known for their extremely active and broad serum esterase activity. Indeed, we find that mouse sera exhibit ~100-fold higher activity per mg serum protein than human sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>). This increase in activity is not uniform across the substrate library. Human sera is not as active on the carbon series and do comparatively better on the oxygen and sulfur ether compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that mouse sera poorly predict human serum stability of ester prodrugs.</p><p>Finally, we sought to evaluate whether GloB and FrmB substrate specificities could be used for microbe-targeted prodrug design. As each esterase is likely to encounter multiple potential substrates in vivo, we utilized our modified <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> as a comparator.

Using a cutoff of 2<sup>10</sup>-fold enrichment in activity for the microbial enzymes over the serum enzymes, FrmB displays a preference over human sera for two compounds – 3C and 6C, whereas GloB displays a preference for six compounds – 2S, 3C, 10C, 11C, 11O, and 11S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Conversely, mouse sera hydrolyze all compounds within this cutoff. Lowering the cutoff to a 2<sup>5</sup>-fold enrichment in catalytic efficiency over mouse sera, FrmB and GloB are both more specific for compound 2S, and GloB additionally displays specificity for compound 11O.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Comparison between microbial esterase and serum esterase catalytic efficiency.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Volcano plots of catalytic efficiency.

Identification of microbe-specific promoieties is crucial to this goal. Here, we identify two discrete esterases in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, FrmB and GloB, that activate the carboxy ester prodrug, POM-HEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Sequence homologues of FrmB and GloB are found broadly within microbes, though substantial sequence variation exists. FrmB and GloB have distinct ester substrate specificities, which are supported by the structures of their active sites. Importantly, enzymatic substrate specificity correlates with the rate of ester activation in live bacterial cells. Accordingly, simple modifications to ester prodrugs are sufficient to change their rates of activation in vivo.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of antistaphylococcal prodrug activation.</title><p>Lipophilic carboxy ester prodrugs transit the cell membrane, are first activated by either GloB or FrmB and at least one additional enzyme, before inhibiting the cellular target.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66657-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Simple ester modifications can also change the pattern of prodrug activation. For the successful development of microbially targeted ester prodrugs, compounds must resist human enzymes. Here we demonstrate that, although commonly considered ‘nonspecific’, human serum esterases exhibit specific ester substrate preferences. These preferences are distinct from mouse sera, suggesting that rodents are an inadequate model for ester prodrug activation, serum stability, and thus therapeutic potential of ester produgs in humans. We also find that the staphylococcal esterases, FrmB and GloB, utilize distinct patterns of substrates compared to the preferred substrates utilized by human sera, indicating the feasibility of developing microbially targeted ester prodrugs.</p><p>Further evaluation of these ester promoieties and their potential metabolic and pharmacological liabilities is necessary before extensive clinical application. For example, while human serum de-esterifies carboxy-ester compounds, the liver also contributes significantly to drug metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laizure et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2005</xref>). Hepatocytes not only express human carboxylesterases 1 and 2, but also include a suite of cytochrome P450 enzymes that are important in facilitating drug clearance. Introduction of lipophilic promoieties such as those tested in this work also increases the logP, or hydrophobicity, of the drug. For highly charged phosphonates, such as POM-HEX, this increase in lipophilicity may be beneficial in improving intestinal absorption or cell penetration, as has been observed for the beta lactam cefditoren, which was formulated with a POM-prodrug moiety as cefditoren-pivoxyl to improve bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuchs, 2007</xref>). However, higher logP values raise concern for increased plasma protein binding and reduced efficacy in vivo. Whether increasing lipophilicity decreases the in vivo efficacy of these antibiotics remains to be tested, though decoration of the ester promoiety with more hydrophilic moieties is always possible.</p><p>Here, we have highlighted how <italic>S. aureus</italic> activates carboxy ester prodrugs. How microbes beyond <italic>S. aureus</italic> activate prodrugs, as well as the substrate specificities of pathogenic and commensal microbes, remains an important open question that will dictate the antimicrobial spectrum of a given ester prodrug. In past work, we have observed that lipophilic prodrugging with the POM-promoiety dramatically reduces compound activity in Gram-negative organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edwards et al., 2020</xref>). The cause for this reduction remains unclear but may be explained by a lack of activating esterases in the tested Gram-negatives or an exclusion of the prodrugged molecule from the cell. Understanding this variability in compound activation will ultimately determine how selective targeted prodrug anti-infectives can be as well as their potential applications. Overall, this work paves the way for structure-guided development of <italic>S. aureus</italic>-specific prodrugs and establishes a pipeline for the identification of additional microbial prodrug-activating enzymes. We anticipate that these approaches will both guide the development of novel antimicrobials and lead to a more robust arsenal of anti-infective compounds with targeted specificity for the microbe over the human host.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Prior to cell loading, the microfluidics plate lines were flushed with 1× PBS + 1% DMSO or 10 µM fluorescent pro-substrate in 1× PBS + 1% DMSO, and the plate was preincubated at 37°C. The microfluidics plate was loaded onto a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments, Inc) equipped with a 100× Plan N (N.A. = 1.45) Ph3 objective, SOLA SE Light Engine (Lumencor), heated control chamber (OKO Labs), and an ORCA-Flash4.0 sCMOS camera (Hammamatsu Photonics). The GFP filter set was purchased from Chroma Technology Corporation. Cells were loaded into the chamber until a single field of view contained 50–150 cells or cell clusters. Following cell loading, 1× PBS was slowly flown through the flow cell (t = 0), and cells were observed in both phase and fluorescence microscopy for 10 min before the flow media was rapidly switched over a period of two min to 1× PBS containing 1% DMSO and 10 µM fluorescent prosubstrate before slow flow for the remainder of the experiment. Images were acquired every two min for a total of 44 min, and all experiments were undertaken at 37°C. The phase-contrast exposure time was kept constant at 200 ms, and the fluorescent channel exposure time was kept constant at 500 ms. For fluorescent images, the gain remained constant across all experiments. Image capture and analysis was performed using Nikon Elements Advanced Research software. Individual cells or clusters of cells were auto detected in the fluorescent channel using the intrinsic background fluorescence of each cell. Manual curation followed autodetection to remove debris or cells that did not stay within the field of view throughout the experiment. Fluorescent intensity for each individual cell or cluster of cells was measured through the duration of the experiment and normalized to the area of the identified cell to yield the mean fluorescent intensity. Background cell autofluorescence was corrected by subtracting the average fluorescence across all identified objects from t = 0 through t = 10. Each experiment was performed in duplicate, with &gt;50 individual cells or clusters analyzed in each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Protein crystallography, phasing, and data refinement</title><p>Crystals of <italic>S. aureus</italic> FrmB were grown at 16°C using vapor diffusion in 20 µL hanging drops containing a 1:1 mixture of protein (6 mg/mL) and crystallization buffer (0.1 M Tricine pH 7.7, 15% PEG6K, 2.5 M NaCl, 0.125% <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-D-glucoside).

The premise is that charged functional groups found in some antibiotics prevent entry of these into bacteria, an effect that can be circumvented through esterification of the antibiotic to allow entry. Thereafter, activation of the antibiotic will occur in the bacterial cytoplasm through hydrolysis by bacterial esterases. The study reports an interesting and generalisable approach to discovery of prodrug-activating enzymes for use in developing new treatments for microbes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structure-guided microbial targeting of anti-staphylococcal prodrugs&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The issue of resistance is not addressed sufficiently. This strategy relies on the necessity of non-essential bacterial enzymes for drug activation, which be circumvented by bacteria through mutation of the drug activating enzymes. The dependence on microbial activation is always a liability as has been shown for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> agents such as isoniazid and pyrazinamide. Ultimately this can be tested experimentally, for example determining the resistant frequencies for HEX or another prodrug and comparing to frequencies for known antibiotics. This will strengthen the work and provide a more balanced view.</p><p>2. While serum esterase would clearly be a concern, there are also abundant esterases in the liver. No mention was made of stability using liver microsomes or, even better, hepatocytes to get a picture of overall metabolic stability of the leading pro-moieties.</p><p>3. There is little data on the effect of the ether group of the ester on activity, as experiments were done using a fluorescence based system.

Although GloB and FrmB are dispensable in vitro in rich media, this may not be the case in ecological niches (such as infection) where nutrients are more limited and/or additional selective pressures exist. Our findings that GloB and FrmB have extremely high sequence conservation across <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates (Figure 2 supplement 1) suggests that both proteins have an important biological function that is not immediately evident in rich media.

These results reveal that spontaneous resistance to POM-HEX occurs in rich media somewhat more frequently than rifampicin, and is now included as a new Figure 2, supplement 3 and discussed in the results (lines 166-177).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Our prior work on staphylococcal GloB indicates that GloB homologs de-esterify POM promoieties from structurally diverse antibacterial “warheads” (PMID: 33118347, including the FDA-approved cefditoren pivoxil, see Figure 4 of that manuscript), and our ongoing studies address the degree to which this is true for FrmB and mammalian serum esterases. We believe that our current studies provide novelty in the use of comparative serum vs. microbial esterase specificity to facilitate design of selective esters that may be useful for selective pathogen targeting, irrespective of the warhead.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and is largely free of typical typographic errors or poorly rendered figures.

We agree that resistance via GloB and FrmB will be a concern for the development of prodrugs utilizing these enzymes for activation. However, while GloB and FrmB are dispensable in vitro in rich media, this may not be the case during an infection setting where nutrients are more limited and additional selective pressures exist.

We believe that this work is novel in that it isolates the activity of serum esterases on specific esters and enables one to design selective ester promoieties.

Creation of prodrugs that successfully mask phosphonate moieties in vivo expands the chemical inhibitor space that can be used to inhibit targets with highly charged active sites (such as many metabolic enzymes). We have previously found that prodrugging improves cellular potency against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria parasites and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, both of particular public health concern (PMIDs: 28827774, 27676224). We believe that our studies outline a generalizable approach to addressing improving potency of highly polar compounds through specific prodrugging, which may be useful for those organisms as well. Examples of other anti-infective compounds in development where such prodrugging may be of use include the following references: PMIDs 31567411, 33361818, 31483651, 30730737, and reviewed in 31469328.</p><p>Our previously published studies give a strong indication as to the antimicrobial spectrum of prodrugs modified with lipophilic esters like POM, as we have previously characterized the activity of a series of analogs that target the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis. Similar to HEX, these “MEPicide” compounds possess a phosphonate warhead that requires active transit to pass the cell membrane. Non-prodrug (parent) analogs of these inhibitors readily engage and inhibit the highly conserved antimicrobial target enzyme (DXR) from multiple organisms in vitro and therefore have a broad antimicrobial spectrum. However, POM-prodrug variants of these MEPicides have markedly reduced antibacterial efficacy against many Gram-negative organisms (PMID: 32497104). Tested organisms included the following: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei, Serratia marcescens, and Burkholderia thailandensis. Notable exceptions are Francisella novicida and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PMIDs: 23077474, 22024034). These previously published findings are echoed in our preliminary studies of POM-HEX (outside the scope of this current manuscript that focuses on S. aureus), in which we find that POM-HEX and POM-SF are much more potent against S. aureus than HEX or SF, but the reverse is true for <italic>E. coli</italic>. We believe that either POM-containing prodrugs are excluded from most Gram-negatives or they are not activated by their intracellular esterases, and in response to the reviewers’ concern, we now include these hypotheses in the discussion (lines 478 – 485).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Antimicrobial resistance is a serious problem and S. aureus infections are also still a serious public health threat.

However, small molecule substrate-mimetic phosphonates (e.g., fosmidomycin, PubChem CID 572; and SF2312, PubChem CID 52913330) have excellent engagement of their protein targets in vitro but poor drug-like properties (logP &lt; -2); in such cases, lipophilic ester prodrugging may improve both bioavailability, cellular permeability, and PK, thus improving in vivo efficacy.
