Non-replicating and infectious elementary bodies (EBs) bind to and are internalized by target cells. Following internalization, EBs within a membrane vacuole, termed the inclusion, differentiate into replicating reticulate bodies (RBs). After replication, RBs undergo secondary differentiation into EBs, which are released from cells to initiate another round of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelrahman and Belland, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In evolving to obligate intracellular dependence, <italic>Ct</italic> has eliminated several gene products essential for cell division in other bacteria, including the central coordinator of divisome formation, FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stephens, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ouellette et al., 2020</xref>). This tubulin-like protein forms filaments that associate to form a ring at the division plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrows and Goley, 2021</xref>), which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the other components of the bacterial divisome that regulate the processes of septal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis and chromosomal translocation. Of the twelve divisome proteins shown to be essential for cell division in the model gammaproteobacterial organism, <italic>E. coli, Ct</italic> encodes homologs of FtsK, a chromosomal translocase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ouellette et al., 2012</xref>; FtsQLB, regulators of septal PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ouellette et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kaur and Lynn, 2022</xref>), FtsW, a septal transglycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putman et al., 2019</xref>), and penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3/FtsI), a septal transpeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ouellette et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the divisome, rod-shaped bacteria employ another multiprotein complex, the elongasome, which directs sidewall PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) necessary for cell lengthening and the maintenance of cell shape prior to division. Although <italic>Ct</italic> is a coccoid organism, it encodes several elongasome proteins, including MreB, MreC, RodA, RodZ, and penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2), a sidewall transpeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ouellette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ouellette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox et al., 2020</xref>). The actin-like protein MreB is essential for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ouellette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdelrahman et al., 2016</xref>) and forms septal rings in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kemege et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liechti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). These observations led to the proposal that MreB replaces FtsZ in <italic>Ct</italic> and serves as a scaffold necessary for the assembly of the chlamydial divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While inhibitor studies suggest that chlamydial cell division is dependent upon elements of the divisome and elongasome from other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ouellette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdelrahman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox et al., 2020</xref>), the composition and ordered assembly of the chlamydial divisome and its distribution during polarized budding are undefined. We hypothesized that FtsK, a chromosomal translocase, serves a critical function in regulating the division process of <italic>Ct,</italic> given previous observations demonstrating it interacts with elements of both the elongasome and divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ouellette et al., 2012</xref>). We show here that FtsK is critical for the assembly of the hybrid divisome complex of <italic>Ct</italic> and that MreB does not serve as a scaffold necessary for the assembly of the chlamydial divisome. Rather, chlamydial MreB associates with this hybrid divisome complex late in the chlamydial divisome assembly process, and MreB filament formation is necessary for the formation of septal PG rings. Therefore, our data identify FtsK as a key regulator of the cell division process of <italic>Ct</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FtsK forms foci in <italic>Ct</italic> that mark the location of divisome complexes</title><p>In the <italic>E. coli</italic> linear divisome assembly pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du and Lutkenhaus, 2017</xref>), FtsK is the first protein downstream of FtsZ encoded by <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In other organisms, FtsK is uniformly distributed at the septum of dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Veiga and Pinho, 2017</xref>). To investigate the localization of FtsK during cell division in <italic>Ct</italic>, HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic>. To overcome the challenges associated with assessing cell morphologies in densely packed inclusions in infected cells, we analyzed FtsK localization in <italic>Ct</italic> derived from lysates of infected HeLa cells at 21 hr post-infection (hpi) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ouellette et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Ct</italic> were stained with an antibody against the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP) and an antibody that recognizes endogenous FtsK. Blotting analysis revealed that this FtsK antibody recognizes a single protein with the predicted molecular mass of FtsK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Our results showed that, unlike FtsK in other organisms, chlamydial FtsK accumulates in discrete foci in the membrane of coccoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In cell division intermediates, FtsK localized in foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, or foci at the base of the progenitor mother cell only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The chlamydial FtsK foci observed during cell division were not uniformly distributed at the septum, rather septal foci of FtsK were restricted to one side of the MOMP-stained septum. In addition, the FtsK foci were often above or below (marked with arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) the MOMP-stained septum. Similar analyses were performed using <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with the pBOMB4-Tet (-GFP) plasmid encoding FtsK with a C-terminal mCherry tag. The expression of this mCherry fusion is under the control of an anhydrotetracycline (aTc)-inducible promoter. HeLa cells were infected with the transformant, and the expression of the fusion was induced by the addition of 10 nM aTc to the media of infected cells at 19 hpi. The induced cells were harvested at 21 hpi and a lysate was prepared from <italic>Ct</italic> present in the infected cells. Blotting analysis of the lysate with mCherry antibodies revealed that a single protein with the predicted molecular mass of FtsK-mCherry was present in the lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Imaging analyses of <italic>Ct</italic> in the lysate revealed that like endogenous FtsK, FtsK-mCherry accumulated in foci in coccoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and in division intermediates, it localized in foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, or foci at the base of the progenitor mother cell only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The foci of FtsK-mCherry, like endogenous FtsK, were often offset relative to the plane defined by MOMP staining at the septum (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Inclusion forming unit (IFU) assays demonstrated that overexpression of the FtsK-mCherry fusion had no effect on chlamydial developmental cycle progression and the production of infectious EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). While it is possible that the population of FtsK at the base of the mother cell is a remnant of FtsK from a previous division, ~20% of dividing cells have a secondary bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and FtsK and FtsK-mCherry accumulate in foci at the base of secondary buds (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that the population of FtsK at the base of the mother cell corresponds to a nascent divisome complex that forms at the site where the daughter cell will arise in the next round of division.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Localization of FtsK and FtsK-mCherry in coccoid cells and in dividing <italic>Ct</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The linear divisome assembly pathway of <italic>E. coli</italic> is shown. <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (<italic>Ct)</italic> encodes the divisome proteins boxed in red.

Imaging analyses revealed that the PBP2, PBP3, and MreC fusions accumulated in foci in coccoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and in cell division intermediates, the fusions accumulated in foci at the septum, in foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, or in foci only at the base of the progenitor mother cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar analyses with an MreB_6xHis fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2020</xref>) revealed that MreB exhibited a similar localization profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Each of these fusions, like FtsK, were restricted to one side and were often slightly above or slightly below (marked with arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) the MOMP-stained septum in dividing cells.

Quantification of the localization profiles of endogenous FtsK and the various fusion proteins revealed that the distribution profile of FtsK-mCherry accurately reflected the distribution of endogenous FtsK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, a greater percentage of FtsK was associated with the base of dividing cells (including cells with septum and base, and cells with base alone) suggesting that FtsK associates with nascent divisomes at the base of dividing cells prior to the other putative divisome proteins assayed. Finally, this analysis suggested that MreB associated with nascent divisomes at the base of dividing cells after mCherry-PBP2 and mCherry-PBP3 (marked with # in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The localization profiles of the chlamydial divisome proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) likely reflect the assembly of divisome complexes at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, and the disassembly of the septal divisome when divisome proteins are only present at the base of the mother cell.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Localization of the fusions of PBP2, PBP3, MreC, and MreB in <italic>Ct</italic> and a comparison of their localization to the localization of endogenous FtsK.</title><p>HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with PBP2, PBP3, or MreC with an N-terminal mCherry tag, or with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with a MreB_6xHis fusion (Lee, 2020).

Our data indicate that the foci at the base of the mother cell correspond to nascent divisome complexes that form prior to the formation of a secondary bud at the base of the progenitor mother cell. Our analyses further revealed there was no correlation between the stage of bud formation by the initial bud (early, mid-late; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ouellette et al., 2022</xref>), and the appearance of nascent divisomes at the base of the progenitor mother cell (data not shown).</p><p>The <italic>Ct</italic> divisome is hybrid in nature, containing elements of the divisome (FtsK and PBP3) and elongasome (PBP2, MreB, and MreC) from other bacteria.

The relevance of the angled orientation of PG and MreC rings relative to the MOMP-stained septum in division intermediates is unclear.

They find that divisome assembly is initiated by the protein FtsK in Ct by showing that it forms discrete foci at the septum and future division sites. Additionally, knocking down ftsK prevents divisome assembly and inhibits cell division, further supporting their hypothesis that FtsK regulates divisome assembly. Finally, they show that MreB is one of the last chlamydial divisome proteins to arrive at the site of division and is necessary for the formation of septal peptidoglycan rings but does not act as a scaffold for division assembly as previously proposed.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use microscopy to clearly show that FtsK forms foci both at the septum as well as at the base of the progenitor cell where the next septum will form. They also show that the Ct proteins PBP2, PBP3, MreC, and MreB localize to these same sites suggesting they are involved in the divisome complex.</p><p>Using CRISPRi the authors knockdown ftsK and find that most cells are no longer able to divide and that PBP2 and PBP3 no longer localized to sites of division suggesting that FtsK is responsible for initiating divisome assembly. They also performed a knockdown of pbp2 using the same approach and found that this also mostly inhibited cell division. Additionally, FtsK was still able to localize in this strain however PBP3 did not suggest that FtsK acts upstream of PBP2 in the divisome assembly process while PBP2 is responsible for the localization of PBP3.</p><p>The authors also find that performing a knockdown of ftsK also prevents new PG synthesis further supporting the idea that FtsK regulates divisome assembly. They also find that inhibiting MreB filament formation using A22 results in diffuse PG, suggesting that MreB filament formation is necessary for proper PG synthesis to drive cell division.</p><p>Overall the authors propose a new hypothesis for divisome assembly in an organism that lacks FtsZ and use a combination of microscopy and genetics to support their model that is rigorous and convincing. The finding that FtsK, rather than a cytoskeletal or &quot;scaffolding&quot; protein is the first division protein to localize to the incipient division site is unexpected and opens up a host of questions about its regulation. The findings will progress our understanding of how cell division is accomplished in bacteria with non-canonical cell wall structure and/or that lack FtsZ.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>No major weaknesses were noted in the data supporting the main conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104199.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Chlamydial cell division is a peculiar event, whose mechanism was mysterious for many years. <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> division was shown to be polar and involve a minimal divisome machinery composed of both homologues of divisome and elongasome components, in absence of an homologue of the classical division organizer FtsZ.

It lacks FtsZ, but still has many other proteins that regulate synthesis of septal peptidoglycan, including FtsW and FtsI (PBP3) as well as divisome proteins that recruit and activate them, such as FtsK and FtsQLB. Interestingly, MreB is also required for division of Ct cells, perhaps by polymerizing to form an FtsZ-like scaffold. Here, Harpring et al. show that MreB does not act early in division and instead is recruited to a protein complex that includes FtsK and PBP2/PBP3. This indicates that Ct cell division is organized by a chimera between conserved divisome and elongasome proteins. Their work also shows convincingly that FtsK is the earliest known step of divisome activity, potentially nucleating the divisome as a single protein complex at the future division site.

They find that divisome assembly is initiated by the protein FtsK in Ct by showing that it forms discrete foci at the septum and future division sites. Additionally, knocking down ftsK prevents divisome assembly and inhibits cell division, further supporting their hypothesis that FtsK regulates divisome assembly. Finally, they show that MreB is one of the last chlamydial divisome proteins to arrive at the site of division and is necessary for the formation of septal peptidoglycan rings but does not act as a scaffold for division assembly as previously proposed.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use microscopy to clearly show that FtsK forms foci both at the septum as well as at the base of the progenitor cell where the next septum will form. They also show that the Ct proteins PBP2, PBP3, MreC, and MreB localize to these same sites suggesting they are involved in the divisome complex.</p><p>Using CRISPRi the authors knock down ftsK and find that most cells are no longer able to divide and that PBP2 and PBP3 no longer localized to sites of division suggesting that FtsK is responsible for initiating divisome assembly. They also performed a knockdown of pbp2 using the same approach and found that this also mostly inhibited cell division. Additionally, FtsK was still able to localize in this strain, however PBP3 did not, suggesting that FtsK acts upstream of PBP2 in the divisome assembly process while PBP2 is responsible for the localization of PBP3.</p><p>The authors also find that performing a knockdown of ftsK also prevents new PG synthesis further supporting the idea that FtsK regulates divisome assembly. They also find that inhibiting MreB filament formation using A22 results in diffuse PG, suggesting that MreB filament formation is necessary for proper PG synthesis to drive cell division.</p><p>Overall the authors propose a new hypothesis for divisome assembly in an organism that lacks FtsZ and use a combination of microscopy and genetics to support their model that is rigorous and convincing. The finding that FtsK, rather than a cytoskeletal or &quot;scaffolding&quot; protein is the first division protein to localize to the incipient division site is unexpected and opens up a host of questions about its regulation. The findings will progress our understanding of how cell division is accomplished in bacteria with non-canonical cell wall structure and/or that lack FtsZ.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>No major weaknesses were noted in the data supporting the main conclusions. However, there was a claim of novelty in showing that multiple divisome complexes can drive cell wall synthesis simultaneously that was not well-supported (i.e. this has been shown previously in other organisms). In addition, there were minor weaknesses in data presentation that do not substantially impact interpretation (e.g. presenting the number of cells rather than the percentage of the population when quantifying phenotypes and showing partial western blots instead of total western blots).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the weaknesses identified by the reviewer. We removed the statements in the Results and Discussion that multiple independent divisome complexes can simultaneously direct PG synthesis. We presented the data in Figs. 3-5 as % of the cells in the population, and complete western blots are shown in Supp. Fig. S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Chlamydial cell division is a peculiar event, whose mechanism was mysterious for many years. <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> division was shown to be polar and involve a minimal divisome machinery composed of both homologues of divisome and elongasome components, in the absence of an homologue of the classical division organizer FtsZ.

Quantification of divisome component localization is well performed, number of replicas and number of cells assessed are sufficient to get convincing data. The use of a CRISPRi approach to knock down some divisome components is an asset and allows a mechanistic understanding of the hierarchy of divisome components.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors did not analyse the role of all potential chlamydial divisome components and did not show how FtsK may initiate the positioning of the divisome. Their conclusion that FtsK initiates the assembly of the divisome is an overinterpretation and is not backed by the data.

It lacks FtsZ, but still has many other proteins that regulate the synthesis of septal peptidoglycan, including FtsW and FtsI (PBP3) as well as divisome proteins that recruit and activate them, such as FtsK and FtsQLB. Interestingly, MreB is also required for the division of Ct cells, perhaps by polymerizing to form an FtsZ-like scaffold. Here, Harpring et al. show that MreB does not act early in division and instead is recruited to a protein complex that includes FtsK and PBP2/PBP3. This indicates that Ct cell division is organized by a chimera between conserved divisome and elongasome proteins. Their work also shows convincingly that FtsK is the earliest known step of divisome activity, potentially nucleating the divisome as a single protein complex at the future division site. This is reminiscent of the activity of FtsZ, yet fundamentally different.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is very well written and presented, and the data are convincing and rigorous. The data underlying the proposed localization dependency order of the various proteins for cell division is well justified by several different approaches using small molecule inhibitors, knockdowns, and fluorescent protein fusions. The proposed dependency pathway of divisome assembly is consistent with the data and with a novel mechanism for MreB in septum synthesis in Ct.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The paper could be improved by including more information about FtsK, the &quot;focus&quot; of this study. For example, if FtsK really is the FtsZ-like nucleator of the Ct divisome, how is the Ct FtsK different sequence-wise or structurally from FtsK of, e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic>? Is the N-terminal part of FtsK sufficient for cell division in Ct like it is in <italic>E. coli</italic>, or is the DNA translocase also involved in focus formation or localization? Addressing those questions would put the proposed initiator role of FtsK in Ct in a better context and make the conclusions more attractive to a wider readership.</p></disp-quote><p>We will be submitting another manuscript soon that details the conserved domain organization of FtsK from different bacteria, and the role of the various domains of chlamydial FtsK (including the N-terminus and the C-terminal translocase domain) in directing its localization in dividing <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. We have added text to the discussion (pg. 16 of the revised manuscript) that describes the sequence homology of chlamydial FtsK to FtsK from <italic>E. coli.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another weakness is that the title of the paper implies that FtsK alone initiates divisome assembly. However, the data indicate only that FtsK is important at an early stage of divisome assembly, not that it is THE initiator. I suggest modifying the title to account for this--perhaps &quot;FtsK is required to initiate....&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and modified the title to âFtsK is Critical for the Assembly of the Unique Divisome Complex of the FtsZ-less <italic>Chlamydia trachomatisâ.</italic> We have also modified the text throughout to indicate that FtsK is required for the assembly of the hybrid divisome of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Suggestions for improvement (mostly minor):</p><p>(1) For several of the graphs, the authors plot the number of cells with a given phenotype on the y-axis, but then describe percentages of cells in the text.

These should be on the same graph as they are directly comparing these two different conditions.

Regarding Figures 3 and 5, we believe the figures in the original submission effectively demonstrate the +/- drug conditions, so these figures remain unchanged in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 2 the authors show microscopy of the colocalization of FtsK with several other divisome proteins from Ct. Quantification of the colocalization of FtsK with these other proteins would provide a more holistic understanding of their colocalization and help further support their argument that FtsK initiates the assembly of the divisome.</p></disp-quote><p>Supp. Fig. S4A of the revised manuscript contains images showing the colocalization of FtsK with the fusions at the septum and the base of dividing cells, and the colocalization of FtsK with the fusions that are only at the base of dividing cells. Supp. Fig. S4B quantified the percentage of dividing cells where FtsK overlaps the localization of each of the fusions at the septum, at the septum and the base, and at the base alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 6 the authors mention that the PG ring was at a slight angle relative to the MOMP-stained septum. What is the significance of this? The authors mention it several times but do not explain its relevance to divisome assembly. It is not really evident in the images presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We mention in the discussion pgs. 17-18 of the revised manuscript that âThe relevance of the angled orientation of PG and MreC rings relative to the MOMP-stained septum in division intermediates is unclear. However, it appears to be a conserved feature of the cell division process and may arise because the divisome proteins are often positioned slightly above or below the plane of the MOMP-stained septum. The positioning of divisome proteins above or below the septum is indicated in Figs. 1 and 2.</p><p>We included cartoons in Fig. 6C of the revised manuscript to assist the reader in visualizing the angled orientation of the PG ring relative to the MOMP-stained septum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In line 270 the authors claim that &quot;these are the first data in any system to suggest that septal PG synthesis/modification is simultaneously directed by multiple independent divisome complexes.&quot; However, their experiments do not demonstrate that multiple divisome complexes are active at the same time. They show that multiple foci of FtsK etc. are present at sites where PG synthesis has occurred, but that does not necessarily mean that each focus/complex was actively synthesizing PG at the same time. Moreover, similar approaches were used to support a claim that septal PG synthesis is directed by multiple discrete divisome complexes previously (e.g. in Figure 1 of Bisson-Filho et al. 2017 (PMID: 28209898) in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and in Perez et al 2021 (PMID: 33269494) in Streptococcus pneumoniae). This claim is not central to the main conclusions of the study and could just be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>This statement has been removed from the Results and the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In Figure 6B the authors see three distinct FtsK foci. Why is this the only place in the manuscript where they see three foci? They mentioned previously that they saw foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, but why are there three foci here?</p></disp-quote><p>The vast majority of dividing cells displayed one foci at the septum and/or the base. Representative images were chosen that reflected the localization profiles observed in the majority of cells. While we observed cells with multiple foci, as shown in Figure 6C, these cells were relatively rare (~2% of cells for all the divisome proteins in 3 independent experiments). Since the number of cells with multiple foci were relatively rare, we chose to group these cells with the cells that had single foci at the septum, the septum and base, or base alone categories in the quantification shown in Fig. 2C. This is stated in the legend of Fig. 2 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The Discussion section is lacking a couple of things that would put the data in a broader context. Can the authors speculate on how FtsK knows how to find the division site? I.e. what might be upstream of FtsK localization? Additionally, the authors do not talk about the FtsK sequence or domains at any point in the paper. Does Ct FtsK have a similar sequence/structure to FtsKs from other bacteria? Are there any differences in sequence/structure that might tell us about its function in Ct?</p></disp-quote><p>We will be submitting another manuscript soon that examines how the site of assembly of the divisome is defined in dividing <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. This manuscript will also define the localization of the different sub-domains of chlamydial FtsK during cell division. For this manuscript, we added a paragraph in the Discussion (pg. 16 of the revised manuscript) that states the domain organization is conserved in FtsK proteins from different bacteria. This paragraph includes information regarding the % sequence identity of the C-terminus and the N-terminus of chlamydial FtsK when compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) For Supplementary Figure S1B-C.

We do not see the need for including a loading control for these blots because we are not making arguments about the relative level of the proteins that were assayed.
