polymerase II (RNAP) with chromatin in a core-shell organization, reminiscent of microphase separation where the cores comprise dense chromatin and the shell, RNAP and chromatin with low density. These observations motivate our physical model for the regulation of core-shell chromatin organization. Here, we model chromatin as a multiblock copolymer, comprising active and inactive regions (blocks) that are both in poor solvent and tend to be condensed in the absence of binding proteins. However, we show that the solvent quality for the active regions of chromatin can be regulated by the binding of protein complexes (e.g., RNAP and transcription factors). Using the theory of polymer brushes, we find that such binding leads to swelling of the active chromatin regions which in turn modifies the spatial organization of the inactive regions. In addition, we use simulations to study spherical chromatin micelles, whose cores comprise inactive regions and shells comprise active regions and bound protein complexes. In spherical micelles the swelling increases the number of inactive cores and controls their size. Thus, genetic modifications affecting the binding strength of chromatin-binding protein complexes may modulate the solvent quality experienced by chromatin and regulate the physical organization of the genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin organization</kwd><kwd>microphase separation</kwd><kwd>chromatin-binding protein complexes</kwd><kwd>active and inactive chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>98 197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Safran</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001811</institution-id><institution>Feinberg Graduate School, Weizmann Institute of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bajpai</surname><given-names>Gaurav</given-names></name><name><surname>Adame-Arana</surname><given-names>Omar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>750/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lorber</surname><given-names>Dana</given-names></name><name><surname>Volk</surname><given-names>Talila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chromatin-binding proteins regulate the effective solvent quality experienced by chromatin and impact global chromatin organization in the nucleus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The spatiotemporal organization of the genome is of utmost importance for the normal functioning of cells. The genome of eukaryotic cells is packaged in the chromatin fiber, which is the biomolecular complex made of DNA wound around histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kornberg and Thomas, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kornberg, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). The chromatin fiber is a long chain of nucleosomes connected by sections of linker DNA with a typical size of 20–60 base pairs. At low salt concentrations, in vitro experiments characterize chromatin by a beads-on-a-spring architecture with a width of 10 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Olins and Olins, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oudet et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodcock et al., 1976</xref>). In solutions with a higher salt content, a 30 nm more compact fiber of chromatin is measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oudet et al., 1975</xref>). However, 30 nm fibers have not been found in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Holde and Zlatanova, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eltsov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajpai et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, chromatin organizes in domains of different sizes that seem to be formed by many interdigitated fibers of chromatin of different sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maeshima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bajpai and Padinhateeri, 2020</xref>). This suggests several different mechanisms of chromatin compaction, which has been examined in more detail in in vitro reconstitution of short arrays of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maeshima et al., 2016b</xref>). There it was established that these short strands of chromatin self-associate to form globular structures. Although the liquid-like behavior of chromatin was described for chromatin in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maeshima et al., 2016a</xref>), the material properties of such chromatin globular structures which behave like liquid drops was not established at that time.</p><p>More recently, however, in vitro experiments have shown that the globular chromatin structures arising from self-association are related to an intrinsic tendency of chromatin to form liquid-like phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson et al., 2019</xref>). This phase separation can be disrupted by acetylation of histone tails, but phase separation is recovered with the addition of a protein with multiple bromodomains. These liquid-like drops composed of acetylated chromatin and bromodomains coexist and associate with the phase-separated, non-modified chromatin droplets, suggesting that liquid-liquid phase separation may play a role on the regulation of genome organization. Further evidence of the intrinsic ability of chromatin to phase separate in vitro has been given (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strickfaden et al., 2020</xref>), although these authors reached different conclusions regarding the material properties of such condensed phases. In addition, there is a growing body of in vivo evidence, of phase separation of chromatin from the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Popken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strickfaden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiad-Pavlov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belew et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, it has been shown in several different cell types that chromatin organizes preferentially at the nuclear periphery and is depleted in the central region of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhattacharya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Popken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiad-Pavlov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajpai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belew et al., 2021</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiad-Pavlov et al., 2021</xref>, it was further shown that in intact, live <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, both acetylated chromatin (commonly associated with active genes in euchromatin) and inactive chromatin (commonly associated with heterochromatin) are preferentially found in the periphery of the nucleus and depleted in the central region. Furthermore, at the nuclear periphery they observed a spatial pattern in which regions of chromatin with H3K9ac modifications and regions of high chromatin density were further demixed. Thus both types of chromatin tend to demix from the aqueous phase and then from each other. The experiments also show chromatin regions in which there are no H3K9ac modifications positioned near the lamina in an organization similar to a wetting droplet. In this paper, we address how the organization of active and inactive regions of chromatin can be regulated by the reversible binding of protein complexes. Hereafter, we use the name active for regions of chromatin which are found in regions of lower chromatin density that would commonly be associated with genes that may undergo transcription, It is important to note that this use of active is different from activity as used in the physics literature (e.g., active swimmers) on non-equilibrium forces in systems with internal energy sources.</p><p>The observed patterns described above are reminiscent of microphase separation of block copolymers, in which two phases, each enriched in one or the other type of blocks, separate from each other. In contrast to a system undergoing macrophase separation, the microphases do not fully coarsen due to the chain connectivity and the length scales defining the spatial patterns are determined by the size of the blocks and their intrinsic properties, such as self-attraction and bending rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Gennes, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leibler, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Semenov, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ohta and Kawasaki, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olvera de la Cruz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halperin, 1991</xref>). Chromatin microphase separation seems to be a natural consequence of the distribution of active and inactive regions within a chromosome that are similar to a long, multiblock copolymer. Such regions may correlate with epigenetic modifications (e.g., H3K9ac, as mentioned above) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jost et al., 2014</xref>) and different guanine-cytosine (GC) content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jabbari and Bernardi, 2017</xref>). The fact that there are chromatin regions (or blocks) with different biochemical properties, naturally raises the possibility of microphase separation, which might be responsible for the compartmentalization of chromatin into so-called A and B compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, this idea has been put forth by a number of authors where microphase separation has been invoked to explain the formation of such compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jost et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sazer and Schiessel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nuebler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brackley and Marenduzzo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belaghzal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sommer et al., 2022</xref>). The differences in chromatin density in the compartments might dictate whether the transcription machinery can interact with and activate genes. Such physical mechanism was considered in describing how small transcription complexes binding to active genes can be used to keep these genes at the surface of more condensed chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maeshima et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, recent high-resolution microscopy has revealed that the transport of nano-particles of different sizes strongly depends on the chromatin density (degree of condensation), and demonstrate that active chromatin regions are more accessible as compared to inactive regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelléri et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Several papers called attention to the fact that chromatin might organize in a microphase-separated state with strings of spherical micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostashevsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ostashevsky, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sommer et al., 2022</xref>). One model proposed that micelle cores comprise chromatin regions with high GC content (associated with genes that are more active) that can be cross-linked by multi-protein complexes while the micelle shells contain AT-rich chromatin regions (associated with inactive genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostashevsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ostashevsky, 1998</xref>). Although the aforementioned model is questionable in light of experimental observations that show that inactive regions of chromatin, such as heterochromatin, form spherical, phase-separated domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strom et al., 2017</xref>), it correctly points to the fact that chromatin will very likely form micellar structures due to its block copolymer nature. Moreover, despite the relevance of microphase separation to compartmentalization of chromatin, there is not yet an intuitive and minimal analytical model of the regulation of such microphase separation. A previous theoretical paper focused on the effect of RNA Pol II, in chromatin organization by considering chromatin polymer brushes in which transcription can lead to <italic>lateral</italic> phase separation of nucleosome-rich and nucleosome-poor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamamoto and Schiessel, 2016</xref>). Another recent article showed that transcription seems to organize euchromatin as a microphase-separated state, with RNA Pol II acting like an amphiphile that connects a DNA-rich phase with an RNA-rich phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilbert et al., 2021</xref>). The authors performed Monte Carlo simulations to explain the experimentally observed microphase separation. In subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pancholi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hajiabadi et al., 2022</xref>), it was shown that RNA Pol II exhibit different types of organization depending on its phosphorylation state and interactions with active genes. Our findings complement these previous studies by showing experimental evidence of a robust core-shell organization of chromatin and RNA Pol II. These observations are made in intact, live organisms (<italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae muscle fibers), which exhibit peripheral chromatin organization and additionally exhibit microphase separation since the chromatin domains do not fully coarsen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiad-Pavlov et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Based on our new observations we propose a minimal model of chromatin in which the microphase separation between active and inactive regions is regulated by the reversible binding of protein complexes to active chromatin regions. Our model is based on the observed self-association of chromatin (in the absence of chromatin-binding protein complexes) and shows that the relatively uncondensed nature of active chromatin can be regulated by reversible binding of protein complexes, resulting in an inner core of condensed (inactive) chromatin connected to a corona of relatively uncondensed (active) chromatin to which protein complexes are bound. We predict the relative sizes and organizations of these regions into a structure that contains an assembly of such core-shell micelles. Those are all connected and thus localized in space since they arise from the block copolymer-like structure of the chromatin with regions of acetylated and non-acetylated (e.g., unmodified and methylated) chromatin. Interestingly, the binding of protein complexes can lead to changes in the organization of both, active and inactive chromatin regions, despite protein complexes interacting only with the active regions.</p><p>Our manuscript is organized as follows. We first show observations of a core-shell organization of chromatin and RNA Pol II. Inspired by these observations, we introduce our minimal model of regulation of microphase separation by the binding of protein complexes and discuss the equilibrium conditions in the system. We then discuss analytical and simulation results, which show that the binding of protein complexes to chromatin can regulate the solvent quality for the active chromatin regions. We conclude by discussing our findings in the context of chromatin organization in the nucleus and briefly comment on an extension to non-equilibrium binding of protein complexes to chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatial organization of chromatin and RNA Pol II in intact, live <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells</title><p>Chromatin in intact, live tissue <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells organizes peripherally, with a chromatin-depleted central region in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiad-Pavlov et al., 2021</xref>). Such organization differs from the conventional picture of chromatin as a polymer network that fills the entire nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bickmore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Misteli, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kempfer and Pombo, 2020</xref>) and motivates further investigation of the smaller scale structure of the peripheral chromatin layer. Experimental evidence shows that despite the tendency of chromatin to phase separate from the nucleoplasm, it does not behave like a simple liquid that wets the entire nuclear lamina. Instead, it further assembles into a series of dense chromatin domains distributed along the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiad-Pavlov et al., 2021</xref>). The physical mechanisms leading to such a distribution of dense chromatin cores parallel to the nuclear envelope remain elusive. Some hints come from evidence showing that chromatin regions with H3K9ac modification, a marker of active chromatin, are also found along the periphery, but they are distributed around the dense chromatin domains. This seems to be a microphase-separated state, in which dense chromatin occupies the core of such domains and chromatin with H3K9ac modifications is only found at the shell, such that the chromatin domains exhibit a core-shell organization. If indeed active marks are related to transcription, where is the transcription machinery located? In particular, what is its role in shaping genome organization?</p><p>Live imaging of intact, live <italic>Drosophila</italic> third instar larvae in which total chromatin, labeled with His2B-mRFP expressed by its own promoter, and RNA Pol II complex, visualized by muscle-specific expression of Rpb3-GFP driven by the Mef2-GAL4 driver, was performed by the following procedure: Live larvae with both fluorescent marks were inserted in a special device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lorber et al., 2020</xref>), and visualized by high-resolution imaging using an inverted Leica SP8 STED3A microscope as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiad-Pavlov et al., 2021</xref>.

This novel observation and previous experiments in zebrafish embryos in the late blastula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilbert et al., 2021</xref>) motivate our theory of a minimal model of chromatin organization in which we consider different regions of chromatin that are microphase separated and that can additionally be regulated by the reversible binding of protein complexes, such as RNA Pol II but more generally, by any of the proteins that interact with active regions of chromatin.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatial organization of RNA Pol II and chromatin.</title><p>Representative image of a muscle nucleus of live <italic>Drosophila</italic> third instar larvae labeled with Histone2B-mRFP (<bold>A</bold>, red, expressed under endogenous promoter) and with Rpb3-GFP (<bold>A’</bold>, green, expressed in muscles under Mef2-GAL4 driver), and their merged images (<bold>A”</bold>). <bold>B–B”</bold> panels are corresponding enlargements of the rectangle area illustrated in <bold>A”</bold>.

For simplicity we consider the case where both types of monomers have the same molecular size <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Motivated by recent experimental and theoretical studies on chromatin organization showing that chromatin behaves as a self-attractive polymer (polymer in poor solvent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiad-Pavlov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajpai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adame-Arana and Safran, 2021</xref>), we model both blocks (in the absence of chromatin-binding protein complexes) as being in poor solvent conditions; both blocks phase separate from the aqueous phase, consistent with the experiments. However, due to the difference in attraction of AA vs. BB, the two types of blocks will undergo a further, microphase separation, reminiscent of the data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiad-Pavlov et al., 2021</xref>, where acetylated chromatin is mostly found surrounding regions of higher density of chromatin. This is in agreement with the well-established fact that chromatin separates into different compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mirny et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hildebrand and Dekker, 2020</xref>). In general, microphase separation can take different forms, where the selectivity of the solvent (poorer solvent for the inactive blocks) leads to lamellar, spherical, or cylindrical organization depending on the length of the different blocks, the type of solvent, and the interactions between the blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Gennes, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Semenov, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ohta and Kawasaki, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olvera de la Cruz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhulina et al., 2005</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, as an example, we show a string of micelles where the core is made of strongly attractive inactive blocks and the shell is composed of active blocks. In what follows we describe a minimal model of the regulation of chromatin microphase separation where the inactive blocks form a dense core (inactive core) and the active blocks are in a more dilute shell (active shell) which can be accessed by protein complexes that reversibly bind to the active blocks. Our model considers microphase separation in the strong segregation limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Semenov, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ohta and Kawasaki, 1986</xref>) with sharp interfaces, the strong incompatibility arises here from the strong selectivity of the solvent, in which inactive blocks experience very strong compaction, reminiscent of the much higher density of DNA in inactive compartments. Hereafter, we omit the word reversibly and binding should be understood in the remaining of the text as equilibrium reversible binding unless otherwise stated. Our assumption that protein complexes only bind to active monomers stems from the observed lack of penetration of RNA Pol II into the dense chromatin cores as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

One core assumption in our model is that the presence of bound protein complexes reduces the effective attraction between active monomers. The rationale is based in the following: The protein complexes that bind to active chromatin tend to be relatively large (e.g., RNA Pol II pre-initiation complex), in which a myriad of proteins assemble jointly with RNA Pol II in order to initiate transcription, which can lead to steric repulsion due to the large macromolecular volume of such complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hahn, 2004</xref>). Moreover, while RNA Pol II interacts with the DNA in the chromatin fiber via positively charged patches at its surface, most of its surface is negatively charged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cramer et al., 2001</xref>). Hence, we assume that when RNA Pol II is bound to the chromatin fiber, those Pol II regions that are negatively charged would effectively provide a repulsive force within the chromatin fibers. Another possible explanation is that in the vicinity of active monomers, the transcription complex carries mRNA, which is known to segregate from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilbert et al., 2021</xref>). While a more thorough analysis of the molecular interactions would be interesting, it is out of the scope of our paper that uses a coarse-grained, polymer physics approach. This approach also allows our model to be predictive as to the physical organization and growth of the domains, independent of those molecular details that are as yet unknown.</p><p>The free energy we consider in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 5</xref> is appropriate in the limit that the surface density of the contacts between active and inactive blocks always remains relatively high; therefore, active blocks are heavily influenced by the presence of neighboring blocks.

Let us consider a single active block connected to a single inactive block in the layer geometry, as we have shown in the previous sections, increasing the binding strength of the protein complexes to the active chromatin monomers tends to swell the active blocks and concomitantly increase the surface area per block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The swelling of the active chromatin blocks then leads to a compression of the inactive block, which in the global organization of the microphase-separated state translates into a decrease in the thickness of the core and an increase in the interfacial area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). If we now consider a single active block connected to a single inactive block in the spherical geometry, each block spans a conical surface. The solid angle of such cones increases with the binding of protein complexes and we intuitively suggest that just as in the case of the blocks in the layer geometry, the inactive blocks will be more compressed when the binding of the protein complexes to the active block is stronger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). If we now focus on the global organization of the microphase-separated state, the number of inactive cores as well as their size is regulated by the binding of protein complexes; the stronger such binding is, more and smaller inactive cores there are (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, our minimal model suggests that nuclear size regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deviri and Safran, 2022</xref>) may have a strong impact in the spatial organization of chromatin in living cells via changes in the concentration of chromatin-binding protein complexes.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the chromatin microphase separation by the binding of protein complexes in layer and spherical geometries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single pair of active (green) and inactive blocks (green) in the layer geometry with no (left), few (middle), and many (right) protein complexes bound to a chromatin active block.

These <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf85"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> beads are divided between periodic blocks of active and inactive monomers. Attractions between inactive monomers are taken to be larger than those between active monomers and the cross-interaction of active and inactive monomers. This gives rise to the core-shell structure observed in the experiments, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In the simulations, when any two beads of the polymer approach each other within a distance <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf86"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf87"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the diameter of bead), they interact via a truncated Lennard-Jones potential, whose strong repulsive regime also prevents them from overlapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajpai et al., 2021</xref>). The polymer contains two types of beads: active and inactive, that represent respectively, the active and silent genes in the chromosome. The protein complexes are modeled by additional, single beads that only bind to the active polymer beads; there are no attractive interactions between protein-protein and protein-inactive beads. For simplicity, we assume the size of the protein complex beads to be equal to the size of a chromatin bead, whose diameter is <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf88"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.

For other separations of the protein and the active bead, the bond energy increases beyond its minimal value and is modeled by a harmonic potential with bonding strength <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf90"><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Once an active bead and a protein complex bead form a bond, their valencies are saturated and they are not available for bonding. Our model also allows existing bonds to break.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, we show snapshots of simulations for different binding strengths. It is clear from such snapshots that the increase in binding strength leads to more extended configurations of the active chromatin regions, an increase of the number of inactive cores, and a reduction in their size (as required by the conservation of inactive monomers). We also show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> that the number of cores at steady state, increases as a function of binding strength but then saturates to a value of around 100. The saturation is a simple consequence of the fact that in this saturation limit, all active monomers have a protein complex bound to them. The shell extends no further even if the binding energy or protein concentration is increased and the core size is also saturated at its minimal value. We show the probability distribution of core sizes measured in bead units in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.

This is accomplished via stretching of the active chromatin blocks when they are bound to protein complexes, which leads to compaction of the region in which the inactive blocks are located. This then results, in the case of the spherical core-shell organization, in an increase in the number of cores comprising inactive chromatin regions and a reduction of their size. We used a minimal, generic model of chromatin as a multiblock copolymer to which protein complexes can bind, this in turn modulates the effective solvent quality vis a vis the chromatin. The effect is strongly dependent on the concentration of the protein complexes and their binding energy. Depending on these two parameters, there are two different regimes, weak and strong binding. In each regime we predict different scaling relations for the extension of the active chromatin brushes and core thickness, as well as the global organization of the core-shell assemblies, as a function of the number of monomers in each of these blocks. We predict that the number of micelles and the relative core-shell sizes in living cells, such as the ones shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, are not fixed but will change as the RNA Pol II and other chromatin-binding protein concentration are varied. We show a sketch in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> exemplifying such change. Moreover, if we contrast our results with experimental observations in which chromatin exhibits several different nuclear types of organization, depending on whether the cell is fixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cremer et al., 2015</xref>), live cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eshghi et al., 2021</xref>), or in intact live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiad-Pavlov et al., 2021</xref>), we suggest that changes in the hydration of the nucleus can lead to different local concentrations of chromatin-binding proteins which in turn can regulate the nature of the microphase separation of active and inactive chromatin.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Sketch of chromatin microphase separation in confinement.</title><p>Left: Weak binding of protein complexes (yellow) to active chromatin (green) results in larger inactive chromatin domains (red) that wet the nuclear envelope (black) as spherical caps. Right: Strong binding of protein complexes to the active chromatin leads to smaller inactive chromatin domains and might also result in changes of their shape going from spherical to cylindrical-like domains. It must be noted that the volume of the inactive domains is conserved in the three-dimensional organization.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82983-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In this work, we have provided a generic description at the mesoscale, that is independent of the microscopic details that determine chromatin microphase separation. Instead, we suggest a minimal mechanism that can play a role in regulating the microphase separation between active and inactive chromatin regions. Although this has been previously observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilbert et al., 2021</xref>), a model such as ours has not been proposed. With our generic model we provide a complementary interpretation of previously published experiments on the effect of transcription in chromatin microphase separation. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilbert et al., 2021</xref>, the authors show that transcription organizes chromatin in microphase-separated states, with RNA Pol II connecting an RNA-rich phase with a chromatin-rich phase. In that study, drug treatments that lead to unbinding of RNA Pol II from chromatin result in an <italic>increase</italic> in the sizes of high-density chromatin domains; notably, those domains are fewer in number than in the wild type and they do not seem to fully coarsen. This is in agreement with our minimal theory, where in the absence of protein complexes, the dense cores become larger but not fully coalesce due to the selectivity of the solvent. Another treatment they used stopped transcription but did not lead to the unbinding of RNA Pol II from chromatin; in those cells, they still observed a similar distribution of dense chromatin domains, pointing to the fact that chromatin remains in its microphase-separated state despite the fact that there are no active processes regulating it. The authors of that study relate Pol II to its ‘amphiphilic’ role in connecting the DNA-rich region which is transcribed to produce nascent RNA. We suggest a complementary scenario in which binding of RNA Pol II to chromatin is the important factor that regulates the sizes and number of dense (inactive) chromatin domains as we discuss above. It has also been shown recently in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leidescher et al., 2022</xref>, that long transcription loops span very large regions of the nucleus and are coated by RNA Pol II. The authors rationalized the extension of the loops as a consequence of the large size of the nascent RNAs that are produced. This provides an interesting direction in which our work could be extended, in which one introduces not only the binding of protein complexes but also the transcription products that are carried by such protein complexes.</p><p>In addition to the observations provided in this article for chromatin being in a microphase-separated state, previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Popken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cremer et al., 2015</xref>) has focused on the different chromatin compartments in terms of their density, classifying them into active and inactive nuclear compartments, and showing clear boundaries between them. More recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelléri et al., 2022</xref>), those authors showed evidence of dense chromatin cores surrounded by extended chromatin regions, which seems to be in agreement with our proposed model of chromatin microphase separation.</p><p>Our equilibrium approach can be extended by considering non-equilibrium effects such as acetylation and methylation of the histone tails of nucleosomes, which would lead to different sizes of active and inactive chromatin blocks. The simplest non-equilibrium scenario, would be one where the fraction of protein complexes bound to chromatin, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf109"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, is fixed by kinetic binding and unbinding rates, instead of detailed balance (and the Boltzmann factor) as in equilibrium. In this scenario, the results obtained for the equilibrium system will hold as long as the reaction kinetics are much faster than the equilibration of the core-shell system. The core-shell organization would then be controlled by the steady-state bound fraction <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf110"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> set by the binding and unbinding rates instead of by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ19">Equation 18</xref>. Another extension to the model would be to investigate the possible interplay arising from protein complexes that actively extend the active chromatin blocks and by doing so create a positive feedback for histone tail acetylation by enzymes, which in turn, would create more binding sites for the protein complexes. Finally, it would be relevant to asses the role of nuclear confinement in chromatin microphase separation by including the possibility of the association of chromatin with the nuclear envelope via its lamina-associated domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Steensel and Belmont, 2017</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. This would further regulate the organization of chromatin and might give rise to different microphase-separated states. The binding of chromatin to the nuclear lamina might further regulate the size and shape of the inactive domains and have an additional effect on the spatiotemporal organization of chromatin and DNA transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="model"><title>Model</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Brownian dynamics simulations</title><p>In order to model the chromatin system, we use the following potential energies.

There are six conditions coming from the minimization of the unconstrained grand potential which determine the six (unknown) degrees of freedom listed above. These conditions fix the equalities of the exchange chemical potentials of the protein complexes (in the bulk, bound to the A blocks, and in the solution within the shell) as well as the equality of the osmotic pressure of the bulk solution and the brush (shell region) (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10">Equation 9</xref>). There are two ways to change the volume: (i) by changing the interfacial of the core-shell and (ii) by changing the extent of the shell due to stretching of the A blocks. These give two osmotic pressure conditions. Since we work in the limit in which the bulk solution is much larger than the core and the active chromatin brush regions, we consider that the exchange chemical potential and osmotic pressures in the bulk solution can be varied independently.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-3"><title>Appendix 3</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Equality of exchange chemical potentials and osmotic pressures in the core-shell system</title><p>We now use the composition variables introduced in the main text, namely, the volume fraction of free protein complexes, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf169"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mi>fc</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, the fraction of active monomers with a protein complex bound to them, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf170"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, the volume fraction of active monomers in the active brush, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf171"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, and the surface area per block <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf172"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, to express the exchange chemical potentials and osmotic pressures in the system.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulation of chromatin microphase separation by binding of protein complexes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alexander Y. Grosberg (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Explain to the reader the non-trivial and counter-intuitive character of their central assumption – that RNAPs, although attracted to DNA, make solvent effectively better, not worse.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors should additional data for the existence of the micro-domains studied in this work and for the dependence of their sizes on at least one parameter that also enters the theoretical analysis.</p><p>2. Improve the explanation of physics concepts for biologists. This does not mean repeating passages from textbooks, but it should have the aim of providing intuition of various physical expressions to biologists.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As a polymer physicist, first and foremost, I encourage authors to clarify the confusion which may or may not be purely terminological, but definitely precludes a complete understanding of the work. The issue is most obvious around Equation 20, where authors explicitly claim that the negative second virial coefficient corresponds to the good solvent regime, while the positive one to the poor solvent. This is the exact opposite of the commonly accepted nomenclature, as any polymer physics textbook can confirm (e.g., Rubinstein and Colby, or Grosberg and Khokhlov, etc).</p><p>My second recommendation is to take into account the fact that presently a lot of work is being done on the statistical physics of the so-called active systems. Due to this, when authors mention that some parts of the chromatin are active – the implication is that they are consuming energy by some mechanism, which would then preclude the use of equilibrium statistical mechanics. I encourage authors to clean up the terminology appropriately.</p><p>My third recommendation is to pay significantly more attention to the discussion of applicability conditions of the (many!) approximations adopted in the work. This includes the assumption that core density is fixed and is not affected by proteins as well as the assumption that the shell phase consists of loops (starting from a core and coming back to the same core) rather than numerous strands connecting different cores.</p><p>My fourth recommendation is to consider framing the work in terms of the strong segregation limit of block copolymers (properly referring to the appropriate papers, starting, e.g., from Semenov, Macromolecules 1993, 26, 24, 6617) instead of referring to the seminal papers treating the weak segregation limit. I think that the work really considers structures with sharp interfaces between microphases.</p><p>My fifth recommendation for the authors is to emphasize the nature of their assumption about the role of proteins in changing interactions between parts of the chromatin fiber. The usual situation with DNA-binding proteins is that they are positively charged. As such, they can usually serve as cross-links or condensing agents for DNA, as evidenced by the example of DNA behavior in presence of even three- or four-valent ions (such as spermine and spermidine). Authors assume that RNA polymerase complexes do something almost entirely opposite to the fiber, they attach to one place on the fiber and somehow generate the repulsion from another section (i.e, provide, in common nomenclature, a positive contribution to the second virial coefficient). This is a highly unusual assumption that is at the heart of the suggested model and should be properly stated and explained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is written very clearly. But please explain in more detail two points:</p><p>1) The factor (1-\Omega)<sup>2</sup> in Equation 5: Do I understand right that this factor means that you assume that monomers that are bound by proteins are not attracted to each other anymore? This, I guess, might be the crucial place where you change the effective solvent quality of the active blocks through the binding of the proteins. If so, this should be explicitly stated close to the formula and a rationalization of this assumption should be provided.</p><p>2) On page 13 you write: &quot;When any two beads of the polymer approach each other within a distance 2.5 \σ a […], they are attracted by a truncated LJ potential.&quot; For me this sounded like all monomers interact with the same strength which then made the micellar structure observed on top of Fig, 5A puzzling. Only after reading the appendix, it became clear to me that inactive beads attract each other stronger. This (namely that inactive monomers have a stronger attraction to each other) should simply be mentioned already in the main text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82983.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

We include a new figure in Appendix 1 showing that the coreshell organization is also observed in salivary glands. There is published evidence in Hilbert, et al. Nat. Comm. 2021, showing that dissociation of protein complexes (RNA Pol II and transcription factors) from the chromatin fiber leads to the coarsening of chromatin domains, consistent with our model predictions. We refer to this in the discussion and write the following in line 567:</p><p>“In Hilbert et al. (2021), the authors show that transcription organizes chromatin in microphase separated states, with RNA Pol II connecting an RNA-rich phase with a chromatin-rich phase. In that study, drug treatments that lead to unbinding of RNA Pol II from chromatin result in an increase in the sizes of high density chromatin domains; notably, those domains are fewer in number than in the wild type and they do not seem to fully coarsen. This is in agreement with our minimal theory, where in the absence of protein complexes, the dense cores become larger but not fully coalesce due to the selectivity of the solvent. Another treatment they used, stopped transcription but did not lead to the unbinding of RNA Pol II from chromatin; in those cells, they still observed a similar distribution of dense chromatin domains, pointing to the fact that chromatin remains in its microphase separated state despite the fact that there are no active processes regulating it.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Improve the explanation of physics concepts for biologists. This does not mean repeating passages from textbooks, but it should have the aim of providing intuition of various physical expressions to biologists.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now provided other explanatory remarks in the revised version of our manuscript, as follows:</p><p>Lines 252 to 274</p><p>“…where we introduced the interaction between active monomers, <italic>v</italic>, which we consider to be attractive (in the absence of protein binding), that is <italic>v</italic> &lt; 0. One core assumption in our model is that the presence of bound protein complexes reduce the effective attraction between active monomers. The rationale is based in the following: The protein complexes that bind to active chromatin tend to be relatively large, (e.g., RNA Pol II pre-initiation complex), in which a myriad of proteins assemble jointly with RNA Pol II in order to initiate transcription, which can lead to steric repulsion due to the large macromolecular volume of such complexes Hahn (2004). Moreover, while RNA Pol II interacts with the DNA in the chromatin fiber via positively charged patches at its surface, most of its surface is negatively charged Cramer et al. (2001). Hence, we assume that when RNA Pol II is bound to the chromatin fiber, those Pol II regions that are negatively charged would effectively provide a repulsive force within the chromatin fibers. Another possible explanation is that in the vicinity of active monomers, the transcription complex carries mRNA, which is known to segregate from chromatin Hilbert et al. (2021). While a more thorough analysis of the molecular interactions would be interesting, it is out of the scope of our paper that uses a coarse-grained, polymer physics approach. This approach also allows our model to be predictive as to the physical organization and growth of the domains, independent of those molecular details that are as yet unknown.</p><p>The free energy we consider in Equation 5 is appropriate in the limit that the surface density of the contacts between active and inactive blocks always remains relatively high; therefore active blocks are heavily influenced by the presence of neighboring blocks. In this limit, the system behaves like a polymer brush. In the other limit that the surface density of contacts of the active and inactive brushes is sufficiently low, the appropriate expression would be that of isolated mushrooms in which each block is independent of each other and their description is equivalent to that of single polymers which obey simple scaling laws, depending on the solvent quality Szleifer (1996).”</p><p>Lines 330 to 339</p><p>“In general, the different solvent regimes correspond to different scaling properties of the radius of gyration of single homopolymers in solution as a function of the number of monomers in the polymer. The different scaling regimes R<sub>G</sub> ∼<italic>N</italic> <sup>3/5</sup>, R<sub>G</sub> ∼<italic>N</italic> <sup>1/2</sup>, and R<sub>G</sub> ∼<italic>N</italic> <sup>1/3</sup>, correspond to good, theta, and poor solvent regimes, respectively Rubinstein et al. (2003). However in the case of polymer brushes, the scaling laws also depend on the grafting density of such polymers. In our model, only the active monomers experience different solvent regimes depending on whether the protein complexes bind to them and their surface density is fixed from a balance of the different free energy contributions in the system. This self-assembling situation differs from a polymer brush in which the surface density is considered to be fixed.”</p><p>Referring to a theta solvent, we added some text between lines 378 to 380</p><p>“…at the so called theta point de Gennes (1979), where the second virial coefficient in the system vanishes (the effective second virial coefficient in our case) and the active blocks behave as if they were ideal polymer chains.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As a polymer physicist, first and foremost, I encourage authors to clarify the confusion which may or may not be purely terminological, but definitely precludes a complete understanding of the work. The issue is most obvious around Equation 20, where authors explicitly claim that the negative second virial coefficient corresponds to the good solvent regime, while the positive one to the poor solvent. This is the exact opposite of the commonly accepted nomenclature, as any polymer physics textbook can confirm (e.g., Rubinstein and Colby, or Grosberg and Khokhlov, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for pointing out the inconsistency with the polymer physics literature. This inconsistency stems from the fact that we explicitly wrote a minus sign in the definition of the interaction between monomers belonging to what we called active blocks in order to emphasize their attractive nature. In the revised version, we rewrote the equations in a manner that is consistent with the established literature. Namely we defined negative, zero and positive virial coefficients corresponding to poor, theta and good solvent conditions.</p><p>To keep our nomenclature in line with the polymer physics literature, we made changes in Equations 5, 19, 22, 24, 25, 29, 31, 32, 35 and 36.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My second recommendation is to take into account the fact that presently a lot of work is being done on the statistical physics of the so-called active systems. Due to this, when authors mention that some parts of the chromatin are active – the implication is that they are consuming energy by some mechanism, which would then preclude the use of equilibrium statistical mechanics. I encourage authors to clean up the terminology appropriately.</p></disp-quote><p>The biology literature refers to active and inactive chromatin, and generally denote euchromatin (less condensed) and heterochromatin (more condensed) regions. The less condensed regions correspond to parts of the chromatin that can be transcribed whereas those that are more condensed are less or not transcribed at all. Thus, active and inactive in this literature refer to transcription and not necessarily to self-propelled systems etc. that are the concern of “active matter physics”. It is true, however, that energy consumption via ATP may be involved in transcription; but this is outside the level of description of our polymeric model. To prevent confusion, we have now added the following clarification when the terms are introduced in the manuscript to avoid confusion. In line 68 we write:</p><p>“Hereafter we use the name active for regions of chromatin which are found in regions of lower chromatin density that would commonly be associated with genes that may undergo transcription, It is important to note that this use of active is different from activity as used in the physics literature (e.g., active swimmers) on non-equilibrium forces in systems with internal energy sources.”</p><p>Our use of the terms active and inactive is consistent with the nomenclature used by different authors in the biological and biophysical literature who also denote active and inactive compartments, for example, Cremer, et al., BioEssays 42, 2020 and Hildebrand and Dekker, Trends Biochem Sci. 2020 May; 45(5): 385–396.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My third recommendation is to pay significantly more attention to the discussion of applicability conditions of the (many!) approximations adopted in the work. This includes the assumption that core density is fixed and is not affected by proteins as well as the assumption that the shell phase consists of loops (starting from a core and coming back to the same core) rather than numerous strands connecting different cores.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised paper we point out the approximations more explicitly. For example, the approximation of protein complexes being unable to penetrate the dense chromatin cores due to its high density, is inspired by the experimental observations of the lack of penetration of RNA Pol II to the dense chromatin cores as shown in Figure 1. There is further evidence showing that large particles cannot diffuse within inactive chromatin domains, shown by Gelléri, et al., bioRxiv 2022.03.23.485308, 2022. In line 207 we included the following text:</p><p>“Our assumption that protein complexes only bind to active monomers stems from the observed lack of penetration of RNA Pol II into the dense chromatin cores as shown in Figure 1. Additionally, there is further evidence showing that large particles cannot diffuse into inactive chromatin domains Gelléri et al. (2022).”</p><p>We also state more clearly that our approximation of a fixed concentration of the core which contains the inactive chromatin blocks, is appropriate when the interactions between heterochromatic domains is the largest energy scale in the system, compared to the protein binding, polymer entropy etc. This is also related to a finding in Gelléri, et al., bioRxiv 2022.03.23.485308, 2022, where the chromatin density in heterochromatic domains is much higher than that of chromatin found in active compartments (transcriptionally active domains). We write in line 226:</p><p>“Such an approximation is motivated by the fact that dense chromatin domains are known to have much higher concentrations that chromatin found in transcriptionally active compartments Gelléri et al. (2022).”</p><p>Regarding considering the loop conformations instead of bridging between different micelles, the main reason to consider such a scenario is to simplify the calculations; we do not know the exact conditions in the nucleoplasm but we expect the qualitative trends of our model to apply independent of the as yet unknown details of the looping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My fourth recommendation is to consider framing the work in terms of the strong segregation limit of block copolymers (properly referring to the appropriate papers, starting, e.g., from Semenov, Macromolecules 1993, 26, 24, 6617) instead of referring to the seminal papers treating the weak segregation limit. I think that the work really considers structures with sharp interfaces between microphases.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for referring us to the seminal work by Semenov. We now cite it appropriately and mention that our model considers the strong segregation limit with sharp interfaces. In line 201 we write:</p><p>“Our model considers microphase separation in the strong segregation limit (Semenov (1985), Ohta and Kawasaki (1986)) with sharp interfaces, the strong incompatibility arises here from the strong selectivity of the solvent, in which inactive blocks experience very strong compaction, reminiscent of the much higher density of DNA in inactive compartments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My fifth recommendation for the authors is to emphasize the nature of their assumption about the role of proteins in changing interactions between parts of the chromatin fiber. The usual situation with DNA-binding proteins is that they are positively charged. As such, they can usually serve as cross-links or condensing agents for DNA, as evidenced by the example of DNA behavior in presence of even three- or four-valent ions (such as spermine and spermidine). Authors assume that RNA polymerase complexes do something almost entirely opposite to the fiber, they attach to one place on the fiber and somehow generate the repulsion from another section (i.e, provide, in common nomenclature, a positive contribution to the second virial coefficient). This is a highly unusual assumption that is at the heart of the suggested model and should be properly stated and explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the fact that the interactions that we describe are different in essence than that of cross-bridging molecules such as spermine and spermidine. One reason for this is that chromatin consists of DNA and positively charged histones (with hydrophobic tails) and in the cell, with additional chromatin-binding proteins. Chromatin is known to condense in aqueous solvent (see Gibson, et al., Cell. 2019, 179) and has been shown (see Amiad-Pavlov, et al., Science Advances, 2021) to phase separate from the nucleoplasm. This means that water is a poor solvent for chromatin – in contrast to DNA. In our model, the binding of protein complexes to the chromatin disrupts the self-attraction of the chromatin and effectively results in good solvent conditions for those parts of the chain to which the protein complexes have bound. The less condensed nature of transcriptionally active chromatin (to which Pol-II binds) allows us to treat that part of the chromatin as being in good solvent conditions. The treatment of the electrostatics is more complex than for DNA and multivalent proteins since the histone proteins, histone tails, and other associated proteins must be taken into account. We therefore coarse grain all of these effects by distinguishing only between the poor solvent conditions of the transcriptionally inactive chromatin (to which the Pol-II does not bind) and the relatively good solvent conditions of transcriptionally active chromatin to which Pol-II binds. In addition, the main difference between the two molecules, spermine and spermidine and RNA Pol II, among others, is that the surface of RNA Pol II is mainly negatively charged, but with some patches of positive charges that allow for the specific association of RNA Pol II with DNA (see Cramer, et al., Science, 2001). Our model seems to be closely related to the observations made in Hilbert, et al. Nat. Comm. 2021, in which the association of RNA Pol II (and very likely other factors involved in transcription) prevent coarsening of high density chromatin domains even in the absence of transcription. We include a clarification of this effect in the description of our model in line 253:</p><p>“One core assumption in our model is that the presence of bound protein complexes reduce the effective attraction between active monomers.

But please explain in more detail two points:</p><p>1) The factor (1-\Omega)<sup>2</sup> in Equation 5: Do I understand right that this factor means that you assume that monomers that are bound by proteins are not attracted to each other anymore? This, I guess, might be the crucial place where you change the effective solvent quality of the active blocks through the binding of the proteins. If so, this should be explicitly stated close to the formula and a rationalization of this assumption should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful that the referee appreciated a crucial feature of our model: the chromatin monomers, in the absence of protein, are self-attractive (are in poor solvent) and the protein binding disrupts this selfattraction, resulting in relatively good solvent conditions for the parts of the chain bound to the Pol II proteins. We expanded our description of the model and make this assumption more explicit in line 252 we write:</p><p>“…where we introduced the interaction between active monomers, <italic>v</italic>, which we consider (in the absence of protein binding) to be attractive, that is <italic>v</italic> &lt; 0.
