To understand the biological mechanisms underlying protein function – and how they can go awry in disease – scientists therefore need to understand the structure of each of these molecules with a high degree of detail. Researchers use computer-based systems, such as AlphaFold, to predict protein structures based on the properties of their building blocks. However, these predictions may not be accurate, and still need to be verified experimentally.</p><p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a technique that allows researchers to directly visualize proteins. The approach first requires flash-freezing a sample at extremely low temperatures, and then sending a beam of electrons through the specimen from several angles. The resulting series of two-dimensional images are analysed using advanced algorithms to construct a final three-dimensional protein model.</p><p>Despite its power, cryo-EM also has limitations, including requiring very large quantities of protein in the initial sample. The algorithms currently available for Cryo-EM analyses also struggle to determine the structure of smaller molecules.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, Arimura et al. developed MagIC-cryo-EM, a new method for preparing samples that relies on magnetic nano-beads. Proteins of interest are directly attached onto these particles using a short linking molecule, and the entire complex is then concentrated onto the imaging surface using a magnet. This greatly reduces the amount of protein needed in the initial sample. A refined analysis method, called DuSTER, was designed in parallel to help capture the structure of smaller molecules.</p><p>Arimura et al. successfully tested both approaches on the histone protein H1.8, which normally binds to cellular DNA and helps ‘package’ it stably. The experiments showed, for the first time, that H1.8 could exist in two distinct three-dimensional shapes. They also revealed the structure of a much smaller molecule associated with H1.8, NPM2.</p><p>MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER will allow scientists to use cryo-EM to examine the structure of proteins which are smaller, challenging to isolate or present in minute quantities inside cells. The knowledge gained from these findings could help us better understand a wide range of biological processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MagIC-cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>linker histone</kwd><kwd>nucleoplasmin</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>DuSTER</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM132111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Funabiki</surname><given-names>Hironori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Overseas Research Fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Konishi</surname><given-names>Hide A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Osamu Hayaishi Memorial Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholarship for Study Abroad</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arimura</surname><given-names>Yasuhiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004343</institution-id><institution>Stavros Niarchos Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SNF Institute for Global Infectious Disease Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Funabiki</surname><given-names>Hironori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A technique that enables single-particle cryo-EM analysis of targets on a magnetic bead and a particle curation method that helps structural classification of small particles has been developed.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent advances in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) technology have enabled the structural characterization of biomolecules isolated from their native conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Azinas and Carroni, 2023</xref>). However, the necessity for high sample concentration restricts its applicability to abundant targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Natchiar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arimura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arimura and Funabiki, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leesch et al., 2023</xref>). The vitrification step of cryo-EM is a major contributor to this bottleneck. In a conventional plunge vitrification method, 3 µL of aqueous samples greater than 1 mg/mL are typically required to acquire sufficient numbers of particle images on cryo-EM micrographs for 3D structure reconstruction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bhella, 2019</xref>). This is because most of the target complexes in the sample solution applied on a cryo-EM grid must be removed by a blotting paper to make a thin ice layer suitable for analysis. Several methods are currently available to lower sample volume/concentration needed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Jet vitrification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ravelli et al., 2020</xref>) and Spotiton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dandey et al., 2018</xref>) require sub-nanoliters of the sample volume, but they still require high-concentration samples. Affinity grids, such as Ni-NTA lipid monolayer grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>), chemically functionalized grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Llaguno et al., 2014</xref>), antibody-attached grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), and streptavidin monolayer grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), are amenable for lower concentration samples (~0.05 mg/mL), but concentrating natively isolated targets to such a level and reproducibly generating the affinity grids remains challenging.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The required sample amount for analyzing chromatin samples.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Methods</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Purity</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Concentration</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Volume</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Amount</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Advantage</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Disadvantage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cryo-EM (conventional)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Purified</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.5~5.0 mg/mL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3~4 µL/grid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&gt;10 µg/sample</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">simple</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High concentration of sample is required</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cryo-EM (Jet vitrification)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Purified</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4 mg/mL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.001 µL/grid</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">&gt;4 ng/sample</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Very low volume of sample is required</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High concentration of sample is required</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cryo-EM (Affinity grid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crude</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.05 mg/mL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3~4 µL/grid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&gt;1 µg/sample</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sample can be isolated and concentrated on grid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The maximum sample volume is limited</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ChIP-seq</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crude</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10~50 ng DNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sample can be isolated and concentrated by beads</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SDS-PAGE (CBB stain)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crude</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.005~0.100 mg/mL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1~20 µL/lane</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">&gt;30 ng/band</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">MagIC-cryo-EM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crude</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">&lt;0.0005 mg/mL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1~2000 µL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&gt;5 ng (2 ng DNA) /grid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sample can be isolated and concentrated by beads</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cryo-EM data collection points are selected manually.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SDS-PAGE (Silver stain)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crude</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0001~0.001 mg/mL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1~20 µL/lane</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">&gt;1 ng/band</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Structural characterization of native chromatin-associated protein complexes is particularly challenging due to their heterogeneity and scarcity: more than 300 proteins directly bind to the histone core surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Skrajna et al., 2020</xref>), while each of these proteins is targeted to only a fraction of nucleosomes in chromatin. For their structural analysis, it is a common practice to assemble nucleoprotein complexes using purified recombinant proteins and a specific short (10–1000 bp) linear DNA. However, this reconstitution approach has a limitation since the structure and function of chromatin proteins can be altered by several variances under native conditions, such as DNA sequence, DNA and protein modifications, and short- and long-scale DNA folding. Although isolation of the endogenous chromatin-associated complexes can be achieved through <italic>ch</italic>romatin <italic>i</italic>mmuno<italic>p</italic>recipitation (ChIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hebbes et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Solomon et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilmour and Lis, 1986</xref>) to determine the associated DNA sequences and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), the amount obtained by this method is too little to apply for conventional structural analysis.</p><p>To obtain high-resolution cryo-EM structures of chromatin-associated protein complexes while they are functioning on the native chromosomes, we previously analyzed structural variation of nucleosomes isolated from interphase and metaphase chromosomes formed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arimura et al., 2021</xref>). We found that the averaged structures of the nucleosome core particle (NCP) in interphase and metaphase chromosomes are essentially identical to the NCP crystal structure assembled with histone proteins and DNA with strong nucleosome positioning sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chua et al., 2012</xref>). We also observed that the major structural variation of the nucleosome structures between interphase and metaphase chromosomes was attributable to the binding status of the oocyte-specific linker histone H1.8. We were able to resolve the 3D structure of the H1.8-bound nucleosome isolated from metaphase chromosomes but not from interphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arimura et al., 2021</xref>). The resolved structure indicated that H1.8 in metaphase is most stably bound to the nucleosome at the on-dyad position, in which H1 interacts with both the entry and exit linker DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bednar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dombrowski et al., 2022</xref>). This stable H1 association to the nucleosome in metaphase likely reflects its role in controlling the size and the shape of mitotic chromosomes through limiting chromatin accessibility of condensins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choppakatla et al., 2021</xref>), but it remains unclear why H1.8 binding to the nucleosome in interphase is less stable. Since the low abundance of H1.8-bound nucleosomes in interphase might have prevented us from determining their structure, we sought to solve this issue by enriching H1.8-bound nucleoprotein complexes through adapting ChIP-based methods.</p><p>Aiming to reduce sample requirements for single particle cryo-EM analyses to levels lower than those widely used for ChIP-seq (10–50 ng DNA, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zou et al., 2022</xref>), here we developed <italic>Ma</italic><underline>g</underline>netic <italic>I</italic>solation and <italic>C</italic>oncentration (MagIC)-cryo-EM, which enables direct cryo-EM analysis of target molecules enriched on superparamagnetic nanobeads. By adapting the ChIP protocol to MagIC-cryo-EM, we successfully determine the ~4 Å resolution structures of H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes using highly heterogeneous dilute fractions isolated from metaphase and interphase chromosomes. In addition, by combining the particle curation method, <italic>Du</italic>plicated <italic>S</italic>election <italic>T</italic>o <italic>E</italic>xclude <italic>R</italic>ubbish particles (DuSTER), which effectively removes particles with a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we revealed structural variations of the H1.8-bound chaperone NPM2 isolated from interphase chromosomes, providing structural insights into the cell cycle regulation of H1.8 stabilization on nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development and optimization of MagIC-cryo-EM using nucleosomes</title><p>Inspired by a report using 200–300 nm superparamagnetic beads directly loaded onto a cryo-EM grid to image viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bonnafous et al., 2010</xref>), we examined the feasibility of 50 nm streptavidin nanobeads for cryo-EM single-particle analysis using poly-nucleosome arrays as pilot targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Nanobeads were easily identified on the grid as black dots in the intermediate-magnification montage map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), facilitating target identification for subsequent high-magnification data collection.

Using nucleosome-like particles selected from 550 micrographs by the machine-learning-based software Topaz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bepler et al., 2019a</xref>), we successfully determined the 3D structure of the nucleosome at sub-nanometer resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

nanobody-MagIC-cryo-EM beads and applied to grids for cryo-EM analysis. MS analysis of the captured MagIC-cryo-EM beads confirmed selective enrichment of H1.8 over other nonhistone proteins found in fraction 5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). To quantitatively assess the population of the H1-bound structural modes of interphase and metaphase nucleosomes, we employed in silico mixing 3D classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arimura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hite and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). Micrographs of interphase and metaphase MagIC-cryo-EM were mixed and used for particle picking and decoy classification to isolate the nucleosome-containing classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Subsequently, particles were classified into three nucleosome-containing 3D models (A, B, C), which were generated by ab initio reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Further 3D classification on the class A, which has weak H1.8 density, yielded three new nucleosome-containing structures, A1, A2, and A3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Then, the populations of interphase and metaphase particles in each class were assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Only class A1 had an apparent H1.8 density at the on-dyad position of the nucleosome, with 27% and 23% of the nucleosome particles assigned to this class coming from interphase and metaphase conditions, respectively. Although class A2 had linker DNA densities on both sides of the entry/exit sites of the nucleosome in a closed conformation, it did not have a clear H1.8 density. This suggested that the structures of H1.8 in the particles assigned to this class were not uniform, and that the H1.8 density was averaged out during the cryo-EM processing. Class A3, to which 3–4% of the nucleosome particles were assigned, had ambiguous extra densities outside of the on-dyad position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, red arrows), possibly representing H1.8 bound to non-dyad positions. Overall, the relative distributions of these five classes were largely similar between interphase and metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and the structures of H1.8-bound nucleosomes in interphase and metaphase were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The structures of GFP-tagged H1.8-bound nucleosomes isolated from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract chromosomes are essentially identical to the endogenous H1.8-bound nucleosome structure we previously determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arimura et al., 2021</xref>. Therefore, although the usage of GFP-tagged H1.8 and MagIC-cryo-EM potentially affect the structure of the H1.8-bound nucleosome, we consider these influences to be minimal. Altogether, the results suggest that differential positional preferences of H1.8 on the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, positioning model) are unlikely to drive the reduced H1.8 association to interphase nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER reconstructed cryo-EM structure of interphase-specific H1.8-containing complex, NPM2</title><p>Although we could not discern structural differences of H1.8-bound mono-nucleosomes from metaphase and interphase samples, we noticed that substantial portions of H1.8 were enriched in sucrose fractions 3 and 4 isolated from interphase chromosomes but not from metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As these interphase-specific H1.8 fractions were lighter than mono-nucleosome-containing fractions, we thought that they may contain regulatory proteins that preferentially dissociate H1.8 from nucleosomes in interphase, in line with the chaperone model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>To characterize these interphase-specific fractions, we sought to determine their structural features using MagIC-cryo-EM. However, our initial attempt failed to reconstitute any reasonable 2D classes of the interphase-specific H1.8-containing complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), even though Topaz successfully picked most of the 60~80 Å particles that are visible on motion-corrected micrographs and enriched around the MagIC-cryo-EM beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This was likely due to their small size; most of the particles did not have a high enough S/N to be properly classified during the 2D classifications as they were masked by background noise from the ice and/or spacer proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To solve this issue, we devised the particle curation method DuSTER that does not requires the successful 2D classifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The principle of DuSTER is based on our realization that low S/N ratio particles were not reproducibly recentered during 2D classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). On the particles that were successfully recognized during 2D classification, picked points were shifted to the center of the particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, black arrows). However, on the low S/N ratio particles that could not be recognized during 2D classification, picked points were shifted outside the center of the particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, green arrows). To assess the reproducibility of the particle recentering during 2D classification, two independent particle pickings were conducted by Topaz so that each particle on the grid has up to two picked points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, second left panel). Some particles that only have one picked point will be removed in a later step. These picked points were independently subjected to 2D classification. After recentering the picked points by 2D classification, distances (<italic>D</italic>) between recentered points from the first picking process and other recentered points from the second picking process were measured. DuSTER keeps recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than a threshold distance (<italic>D<sub>TH</sub></italic>). By setting <italic>D<sub>TH</sub></italic> = 20 Å, 2D classification results were dramatically improved in this sample; a five-petal flower-shaped 2D class was reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This step also removes the particles that only have one picked point. Although approaches to utilize the reproducibility of 2D class assignments have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), the advantage of DuSTER is that it can be applied to small particles that cannot even be properly classified in 2D classification.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER reconstructed cryo-EM structures of interphase-specific H1.8-bound NPM2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of DuSTER workflow.

Due to its structural similarity to a flower, we call the highly acidic putative substrate-binding surface the petal side, whereas the other more charge neutral surface the sepal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The major structural differences between the two forms are found at C-terminal and N-terminal segments of NPM2 core and at the A1 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the closed form, β8 runs straight from the sepal to the petal sides of each pentamer and has an extended C-terminal segment that protrudes past the petal side of the pentamer. In the open form, however, the C-terminal portion of β8 is bent outward to the rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Notably, extra cryo-EM densities, which may represent H1.8, are clearly observed in the open form but much less in the closed form near the acidic surface regions proximal to the N terminus of β1 and the C terminus of β8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Supporting this idea, the acidic tract A1 (aa 36–40) and A2 (aa 120–140), which are both implicated in the recognition of basic substrates such as core histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dutta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Platonova et al., 2011</xref>, respectively interact with and are adjacent to the putative H1.8 density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition, the NPM2 surface that is in direct contact with the putative H1.8 density is accessible in the open form while it is internalized in the closed form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This structural change of NPM2 may support more rigid binding of H1.8 to the open NPM2, whereas H1.8 binding to the closed form is less stable and likely occurs through interactions with the C-terminal A2 and A3 tracts, which are not visible in our cryo-EM structures.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Structural variations of NPM2 bound to H1.8.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural differences between the opened and closed forms of NPM2.

This significant improvement was achieved through the four unique benefits of MagIC-cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). First, the on-bead-cryo-EM approach minimizes preparation steps, which can lead to sample loss, such as target isolation, enrichment, and buffer exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Second, sample loss during the grid-freezing process is reduced by magnet-based enrichment of the targets on cryo-EM grids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E–I</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). Third, magnetic beads are easily identifiable on the grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>).

By combining MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER, we were able to determine the sub-nanometer structure and structural variations of the NPM2-H1.8-GFP complex, in which the mass of the ordered region is only 60 kDa. Notably, particle curation by DuSTER does not require human supervision or machine learning, except for determining the distance threshold between repeatedly picked particles. This feature may allow for automating particle curation via DuSTER in the future.</p><p>MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER approaches hold the potential for targeting a wide range of biomolecules, including small ones, for two main reasons. First, the target-capturing module could be replaced with various other proteins, such as different nanobodies, single-chain variable fragments (scFv), protein A, dCas9, or avidin, to capture a wide range of biomolecules. Second, the sample requirement for MagIC-cryo-EM is a mere 5 ng per grid, which is comparable to or even lower than the requirements of widely used ChIP-seq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zou et al., 2022</xref>. Coupling next-generation sequencing with MagIC-cryo-EM beads would help the field determine structural features of functionally distinct chromatin regions, such as heterochromatin, euchromatin, transcription start sites, telomeres, and centromeres. The low sample requirement of MagIC-cryo-EM also opens the door to structural analysis using limited specimens, including patient tissues.</p><p>Combining MS, MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER, we found that the majority of chromatin-bound H1.8 in interphase existed as a complex with NPM2 rather than with nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). This contrasts to the reports suggesting that NAP1 is the major H1.8-bound chaperone in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shintomi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freedman et al., 2010</xref>, while it is consistent with our previous MS analysis that also detected NPM2, but not NAP1, in fractions enriched with nucleosomes in interphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arimura et al., 2021</xref>. Our observation is also in line with a previous report that NPM2 is able to remove linker histones but not core histones from somatic nuclei that are introduced to <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dimitrov and Wolffe, 1996</xref>. Since the amounts of H1.8-associated NAP1 or NPM2 in the egg cytoplasm did not change between interphase and metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), a mechanism must exist such that NPM2 interacts with H1.8 on chromatin specifically in interphase and suppresses H1.8-nucleosome interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Two basic patches at the C-terminal tail of NPM2 may contribute to cell-cycle-dependent DNA binding as they are flanked with potential Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. NPM2 may maintain nucleosome-bound H1.8 at a low level in interphase during early developmental cell cycles to support rapid DNA replication, while mitotic induction of H1.8 association with nucleosomes tunes condensin loading on chromosomes and ensures proper chromosome size to facilitate chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choppakatla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Structural studies based on in vitro reconstitution previously suggested that NPM2 binds to its substrate as a homo-decamer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dutta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Platonova et al., 2011</xref>, or a homo-pentamer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ramos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Taneva et al., 2009</xref>. Our cryo-EM structure strongly suggests that the NPM2 binds to H1.8 as a homo-pentamer. Structure variation analyses suggest that NPM2 subunits can exhibit two structural configurations, open and closed forms, of which H1.8 is stably associated with only the open form. Since the closed form is more similar to the reported crystal structure and AF2-predicted structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), both of which are determined in the absence of the substrates, our analysis points toward a possibility that substrate binding induces the structural transition of NPM2 to the open form. The conformational changes of the NPM family have been proposed in other studies, such as NMR and negative stain-EM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lorton et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">González-Arzola et al., 2022</xref>. Our cryo-EM structures of NPM2 indicate the potential mechanisms of NPM2 conformational changes and potential substrate binding sites. Among NPM2 acidic tracts A1, A2, and A3, which are important for substrate recognition, our atomic models visualize A1 and the edge of A2 at the petal side of the structure, where the density corresponding to the predicted H1.8 can be found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As the A2 and A3 belong to the disordered C-terminal tail that extends from the petal side of the NPM2 complex, our data suggest that the open form provides a stable association platform by exposing the acidic surface at the petal side for the substrate recognition, while the C-terminal A2 and A3 at the flexible tail may facilitate recruitment and possibly also entrapment of the substrate. Since our structural analysis further suggests that each NPM2 subunit may independently adapt open and closed form within a pentamer, this flexibility in the core domain may enable the association of substrates with diverse sizes and structures to support its molecular chaperone functionality.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>While MagIC-cryo-EM is envisioned as a versatile approach suitable for various biomolecules from diverse sources, including cultured cells and tissues, it has thus far been tested only with H1.8-bound nucleosome and H1.8-bound NPM2, both using anti-GFP nanobodies to isolate GFP-tagged H1.8 from chromosomes assembled in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts after pre-fractionation of chromatin. To apply MagIC-cryo-EM for the other targets, the following factors must be considered: <italic>(1) Pre-fractionation</italic>. This step (e.g. density gradient or gel filtration) may be necessary to enrich the target protein in a specific complex from other diverse forms (such as monomeric forms, subcomplexes, and protein aggregates). <italic>(2) Avoiding bead aggregation</italic>. Beads may be clustered by targets (if the target complex contains multiple affinity tags or is aggregated), nonspecific binders, and target capture modules. To directly apply antibodies that recognize the native targets and specific modifications, optimization to avoid bead aggregation will be important. <italic>(3) Stabilizing complexes</italic>. The target complexes must be stable during the sample preparation. Crosslink was necessary for the H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosome. <italic>(4) Loading the optimum number of targets on the bead</italic>. The optimal number of particles per bead differs depending on target sizes, as larger targets are more likely to overlap. For H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes, 500–2000 particles per bead were optimal. We expect that fewer particles should be coated for larger targets.</p><p>Regarding the cryo-EM data acquisition, the selection of data collection points is currently performed through the manual picking of magnetic beads on the MMM map. This method does not support image-shift-based data collection and serves as a bottleneck for data collection speed, limiting throughput to approximately 500–1000 micrographs per day. The development of machine learning-based software to automatically identify magnetic beads on MMM maps and establish parameters for image-shift-based multiple shots could substantially enhance data collection efficiency.</p><p>The efficiency of magnetic bead capture can be further improved. In the current MagIC-cryo-EM workflow, the cryo-EM grid is incubated on a magnet before being transferred to the Vitrobot for vitrification. However, since the Vitrobot cannot accommodate a strong magnet, the vitrification step occurs without the magnetic force, potentially resulting in bead loss. This limitation could be addressed by developing a new plunge freezer capable of maintaining magnetic force during vitrification.</p><p>While DuSTER enables the structural analysis of NPM2 co-isolated with H1.8-GFP, the resulting map quality is modest, and the reported numerical resolution may be overestimated. Furthermore, only partial density for H1.8 is observed. Although structural analysis of small proteins is inherently challenging, it is possible that halo-like scattering further hinders high-resolution structural determination by reducing the S/N ratio. More detailed structural analyses of the NPM2-substrate complex will be addressed in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></title><p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> was purchased from <italic>Xenopus</italic> 1 (female, 4270; male, 4235).

To respond to the reviewer's criticism, we revised the “Limitation of the study” section (page 12, line 420) as indicated by the underlines below.</p><p>“While MagIC-cryo-EM is envisioned as a versatile approach suitable for various biomolecules from diverse sources, including cultured cells and tissues, it has thus far been tested only with H1.8-bound nucleosome and H1.8-bound NPM2, both using antiGFP nanobodies to isolate GFP-tagged H1.8 from chromosomes assembled in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts after pre-fractionation of chromatin. To apply MagIC-cryo-EM for the other targets, the following factors must be considered: (1) Pre-fractionation. This step (e.g., density gradient or gel filtration) may be necessary to enrich the target protein in a specific complex from other diverse forms (such as monomeric forms, subcomplexes, and protein aggregates). (2) Avoiding bead aggregation. Beads may be clustered by targets (if the target complex contains multiple affinity tags or is aggregated), nonspecific binders, and the target capture modules. To directly apply antibodies that recognize the native targets and specific modifications, optimization to avoid bead aggregation will be important. (3) Stabilizing complexes. The target complexes must be stable during the sample preparation. Crosslink was necessary for the H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosome. (4) Loading the optimum number of targets on the bead. The optimal number of particles per bead differs depending on target sizes, as larger targets are more likely to overlap. For H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes, 500 to 2,000 particles per bead were optimal. We expect that fewer particles should be coated for larger targets.”</p><p>We would like to note that while the use of bacterially expressed GFP-tagged H1.8 and MagIC-cryo-EM may potentially influence the structure of the H1.8-bound nucleosome, the structures of GFP-tagged H1.8-bound nucleosomes isolated from chromosomes assembled in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract are essentially identical to the endogenous H1.8bound nucleosome structure we previously determined. In addition, we have shown that GFP-H1.8 was able to replace the function of endogenous H1.8 to support the proper mitotic chromosome length (Fig. S3), which is based on the capacity of H1.8 to compete with condensin as we have previously demonstrated (PMID 34406118). Therefore, we believe that the effects of GFP-tagging to be minimal. This point incorporated into the main result section (page 6, line 215) to read as “The structures of GFP-tagged H1.8bound nucleosomes isolated from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract chromosomes are essentially identical to the endogenous H1.8-bound nucleosome structure we previously determined. Therefore, although the usage of GFP-tagged H1.8 and MagIC-cryo-EM potentially influence the structure of the H1.8-bound nucleosome, we consider these influences to be minimal.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the GFP-pulled down H1.8 nucleosomes should be better characterized biochemically to determine the actual linker DNA lengths (which are known to have a strong effect of linker histone affinity) and presence or absence of other factors such as HMG proteins that may compete with linker histones and cause the multiplicity of nucleosome structural classes (such as shown on Fig. 3F) for which the association with H1.8 is uncertain.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the concerns brought by the reviewer as following:</p><p>(1) DNA length</p><p>As the reviewer correctly pointed out, linker DNA length is critical for linker histone binding, and conventional ChIP protocols often result in DNA over-digestion to lengths of 140–150 bp. To minimize DNA over-digestion and structural damage, we have optimized a gentle chromosomal nucleosome purification protocol that enabled the cryoEM analysis of chromosomal nucleosomes (PMID: 34478647). This protocol involves DNA digestion with a minimal amount of MNase at 4ºC, producing nucleosomal DNA fragments of 180–200 bp. Additionally, before each chromatin extraction, we performed small-scale MNase assays to ensure that the DNA lengths consistently fell within the 180–200 bp range (Fig. S4B).

The authors additionally devised an image-processing workflow termed &quot;DuSTER&quot;, which increases the true positive detections of the partially ordered NPM2 complex.

The authors could probably publish the NPM2 results separately, which would make the core MagIC results (sans DusTER) easier to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for constructive comments. We regret to realize that the last portion of the result section, where we have described a detailed analysis of NPM2 structures, was erroneously omitted from the submission due to MS Word's formatting error. We hope that the inclusion of this section will justify the inclusion of the NPM2 analysis. Specifically, we decided to include NPM2 structures to demonstrate that our method successfully determined the structure that had never been reported. Conformational changes in the NPM family have been proposed in previous studies using techniques such as NMR, negative stain EM, and simulations, and these changes are thought to play a critical role in regulating NPM function (PMID: 25772360, 36220893, 38571760), but there has been a confusion in the literature, for example, on the substrate binding site and on whether NPM2 recognizes the substrate as a pentamer or decamer. Despite their low resolution, our new cryo-EM structures of NPM2 suggest that NPM2 recognizes the substrate as a pentamer, identifies potential substrate-binding sites, and indicates the mechanisms underlying NPM2 conformational changes. We believe that publishing these results will provide valuable insights into the NPM research field and help guide and inspire further investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Arimura et al report a new method, termed MagIC-Cryo-EM, which refers to the method of using magnetic beads to capture specific proteins out of a lysate via, followed immunoprecipitation and deposition on EM grids. The so-enriched proteins can be analzyed structurally. Importantly, the nanoparticles are further functionalized with protein-based spacers, to avoid a distorted halo around the particles. This is a very elegant approach and allows the resolution of the stucture of small amounts of native proteins at atomistic resolution.</p><p>Here, the authors apply this method to study the chromatosome formation from nucleosomes and the oocyte-specific linker histone H1.8. This allows them to resolve H1.8-containing chromatomosomes from oocyte extract in both interphase and metaphase conditions at 4.3 A resolution, which reveal a common structure with H1 placed right at the dyad and contacting both entry-and exit linker DNA.</p><p>They then investigate the origin of H1.8 loss during interphase. They identify a nonnucleosomal H1.8-containing complex from interphase preparations. To resolve its structure, the authors develop a protocol (DuSTER) to exclude particles with ambiguous center, revealing particles with five-fold symmetry, that matches the chaperone NPM2. MS and WB confirms that the protein is present in interphase samples but not metaphase. The authors further separate two isoforms, an open and closed form that coexist. Additional densities in the open form suggest that this might be bound H1.8.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Together this is an important addition to the suite of cryoEM methods, with broad applications. The authors demonstrate the method using interesting applications, showing that the methods work and they can get high resolution structures from nucleosomes in complex with H1 from native environments.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The structures of the NPM2 chaperone is less well resolved, and some of the interpretation in this part seems only weakly justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the significance of our methods and for constructive comments. We regret to realize that the last portion of the result section where we have described detailed analysis of NPM2 structures was erroneously omitted from the submission due to the MS word's formatting error. We hope that inclusion of this section will justify the inclusion of NPM2 analysis. Specifically, we agree that our NPM2 structures are low-resolution and that our interpretations may be revised as higher-resolution structures become available, although we believe that publishing these results will provide valuable insights into the NPM research field and also will illustrate the power of MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER. To respond to this criticism, the revised manuscript now clearly describes the limitations of our NPM2 structures while highlighting the key insights. In page 12 line 452, the sentence was added to read, “While DuSTER enables the structural analysis of NPM2 co-isolated with H1.8-GFP, the resulting map quality is modest, and the reported numerical resolution may be overestimated. Furthermore, only partial density for H1.8 is observed. Although structural analysis of small proteins is inherently challenging, it is possible that halo-like scattering further hinder high-resolution structural determination by reducing the S/N ratio. More detailed structural analyses of the NPM2-substrate complex will be addressed in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) To assess the advantage provided by the new technique for imaging of isolated pure or enriched fractions of native chromatin, the nucleosome structure analysis should be matched by a proper biochemical characterization of the isolated nucleosomes. Nucleosome DNA size is known to greatly affect linker histone affinity and additional proteins like HMG may compete with linker histone for binding. SDS-PAGE of the sucrose gradient fractions (Fig. 3E) shows many nonhistone proteins where H1-GFP appears to be a minor component. However, the gradient fractions contain both bound and unbound proteins.

To apply MagIC-cryo-EM for the other targets, the following factors must be considered: (1) Pre-fractionation. This step (e.g., density gradient or gel filtration) may be necessary to enrich the target protein in a specific complex from other diverse forms (such as monomeric forms, subcomplexes, and protein aggregates). (2) Avoiding bead aggregation. Beads may be clustered by targets (if the target complex contains multiple affinity tags or is aggregated), nonspecific binders, and the target capture modules. To directly apply antibodies that recognize the native targets and specific modifications, optimization to avoid bead aggregation will be important. (3) Stabilizing complexes. The target complexes must be stable during the sample preparation. Crosslink was necessary for the H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosome. (4) Loading the optimum number of targets on the bead. The optimal number of particles per bead differs depending on target sizes, as larger targets are more likely to overlap. For H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes, 500 to 2,000 particles per bead were optimal.

We have retrieved the missing sentences:</p><p>“Supporting this idea, the acidic tract A1 (aa 36-40) and A2 (aa 120-140), which are both implicated in recognition of basic substrates such as core histones(43,50), respectively interact with and are adjacent to the putative H1.8 density (Figure 5B). In addition, the NPM2 surface that is in direct contact with the putative H1.8 density is accessible in the open form while it is internalized in the closed form (Figure 5C). This structural change of NPM2 may support more rigid binding of H1.8 to the open NPM2, whereas H1.8 binding to the closed form is less stable and likely occurs through interactions with the C-terminal A2 and A3 tracts, which are not visible in our cryo-EM structures.</p><p>In the aforementioned NPM2-H1.8 structures, for which we applied C5 symmetry during the 3D structure reconstruction, only a partial H1.8 density could be seen (Figure 5B). One possibility is that H1.8 structure in NPM2-H1.8 does not follow C5 symmetry. As the size of the NPM2-H1.8 complex estimated from sucrose gradient elution volume is consistent with pentameric NPM2 binding to a single H1.8 (Figure 3C and Table S2), applying C5 symmetry during structural reconstruction likely blurred the density of the monomeric H1.8 that binds to the NPM2 pentamer. The structural determination of NPM2-H1.8 without applying C5 symmetry lowered the overall resolution but visualized multiple structural variants of the NPM2 protomer with different degrees of openness coexisting within a NPM2-H1.8 complex (Figure S14), raising a possibility that opening of a portion of the NPM2 pentamer may affect modes of H1.8 binding. Although more detailed structural analyses of the NPM2-substrate complex are subject of future studies, MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER revealed structural changes of NPM2 that was co-isolated H1.8 on interphase chromosomes.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>MagIC-cryo-EM offers sub-nanometer resolution structural determination using a heterogeneous sample that contains the target molecule at 1~2 nM, which is approximately 100 to 1000 times lower than the concentration required for conventional cryo-EM methods, including affinity grid approach(9–11).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S13: I am not sure how robust these assignments are at this low resolution. Are these real structures or classification artifacts? It feels very optimistic to interpret these structures</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our NPM2 structures are low-resolution and that our interpretations may be revised as higher-resolution structures become available, although we believe that publishing these results will provide valuable insights into the NPM research field and also will illustrate the power of MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER. Conformational changes in the NPM family have been proposed in previous studies using techniques such as NMR, negative stain EM, and simulations, and these changes are thought to play a critical role in regulating NPM function (PMID: 25772360, 36220893, 38571760), but there has been a confusion in the literature, for example, on the substrate binding site and on whether NPM2 recognizes the substrate as a pentamer or decamer. Despite their low resolution, our new cryo-EM structures of NPM2 suggest that NPM2 recognizes the substrate as a pentamer, identify potential substrate-binding sites, and indicate the mechanisms underlying NPM2 conformational changes. We believe that publishing these results will provide valuable insights into the NPM research field and help guide and inspire further investigations.</p><p>To respond to this criticism, we have revised the manuscript to clearly describe the limitations of our NPM2 structures while highlighting the key insights. On page 12, line 452, the sentence was added to read, “While DuSTER enables the structural analysis of NPM2 co-isolated with H1.8-GFP, the resulting map quality is modest, and the reported numerical resolution may be overestimated. Furthermore, only partial density for H1.8 is observed. Although structural analysis of small proteins is inherently challenging, it is possible that halo-like scattering further hinders high-resolution structural determination by reducing the S/N ratio. More detailed structural analyses of the NPM2-substrate complex will be addressed in future studies.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
