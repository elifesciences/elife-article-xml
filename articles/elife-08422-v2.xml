How specific processes reflect such adaptations are difficult to model experimentally. We tested whether environmental shifts in oxygen tension lead to events in the adult newt brain that share features with processes occurring during neuronal regeneration under normoxia. By experimental simulation of varying oxygen concentrations, we show that hypoxia followed by re-oxygenation lead to neuronal death and hallmarks of an injury response, including activation of neural stem cells ultimately leading to neurogenesis. Neural stem cells accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) during re-oxygenation and inhibition of ROS biosynthesis counteracts their proliferation as well as neurogenesis. Importantly, regeneration of dopamine neurons under normoxia also depends on ROS-production. These data demonstrate a role for ROS-production in neurogenesis in newts and suggest that this role may have been recruited to the capacity to replace lost neurons in the brain of an adult vertebrate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08422.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08422.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08422.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During the winter, red-spotted newts remain active in water that is covered by ice. The oxygen levels under the ice tend to drop and so the newts adjust their metabolism to cope with these conditions. However, when oxygen levels return to normal, this may result in the newts producing larger amounts of chemically reactive molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS). These molecules form naturally as a by-product of oxygen metabolism, but in high quantities they can damage cells and tissues.</p><p>It has been proposed that red-spotted newts and other animals that experience periods of low oxygen may have evolved processes to repair such damage. Unlike us, red-spotted newts are able to replace nerve cells in the brain that have died or been injured. This regeneration is fuelled by stem cells called ependymoglia cells, which divide to produce new nerve cells. Here, Hameed et al. investigated whether the return of oxygen to normal levels after a period of low oxygen can damage nerve cells in the newts, and whether this is followed by regeneration.</p><p>The experiments show that nerve cells in the newt brain do indeed die when oxygen levels return to normal. Also, the brain activates an injury response that triggers the ependymoglia cells to divide. During this process, the ependymoglia cells accumulate ROS and their ability to divide is impaired if the production of ROS is blocked. The replacement of injured brain cells in normal oxygen conditions also depends on increased ROS levels.</p><p>Together, Hameed et al.'s findings demonstrate a key role for ROS production in controlling the regeneration of damaged nerve cells in the red-spotted newt. A future challenge is to identify the genes that control the survival and activation of ependymoglia cells in response to increased ROS levels in the brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08422.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08422.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>newt</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>András</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002706</institution-id><institution>AFA Försäkring</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>András</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yihai</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>András</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>András</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007464</institution-id><institution>Torsten Söderbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yihai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yihai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Control of neural stem cells by reactive oxygen species (ROS) provides a link between systemic shifts in oxygen tension and neuronal regeneration, and suggests an evolutionary driving force for the inherent ability of newts to regenerate their brain cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals that experience episodes of low oxygen concentration use different strategies to protect their organs, particularly those that are metabolically highly active, such as heart and brain. These species are in general capable of adjusting their metabolic rate and to cope with the accumulation of anaerobic by-products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larson et al., 2014</xref>). Re-oxygenation upon return to normoxia may lead to the production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS), and it has been proposed that these animals need to repair tissues that might become damaged during re-oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bickler and Buck, 2007</xref>). In this article, we set out to test this latter hypothesis in the highly regenerative aquatic salamander, the red-spotted newt. We specifically asked whether hypoxia and re-oxygenation leads to events in the newt brain that share common features with processes taking place after experimental ablation and subsequent regeneration of neurons under normoxia.</p><p>Adult red-spotted newts are post-metamorphic amphibians with lungs. They remain active all year round and can be found in deep water under ice during winter—an environment known to become hypoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berner and Puckett, 2010</xref>). The red-spotted newt also possesses a wide spectrum of abilities of regenerating complex structures, including the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parish et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brockes and Kumar 2008</xref>). Of particular importance in the context of the present study is their capacity to replace specific neuronal subtypes in the brain following chemical ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parish et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berg et al., 2010</xref>). Neuronal regeneration leads to complete restoration of the original status in terms of functional recovery and in the terms of reaching the correct number of neurons in all brain regions tested so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Regeneration of neurons is fuelled by the activation and subsequent neurogenesis by neural stem cells (NSCs), the so-called ependymoglia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirkham et al., 2014</xref>). Ependymoglia cells line the brain ventricles, express the intermediate filament protein GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and have radial extensions, reaching the pial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parish et al., 2007</xref>). Regeneration in homeostatically non-germinal niches is independent of the normal constitutive neurogenesis occurring in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirkham et al., 2014</xref>), thus the newt brain is an ideal model for studying both constitutive and injury-induced adult neurogenesis, as well as the relationship between the two.</p><p>In order to test whether environmental shifts in oxygen tension lead to events in the adult newt brain that share features with processes taking place during neuronal regeneration under normoxia, we carried out studies on neurogenesis both during shifting and normal oxygen tension. We find that modulation of oxygen tension leads to loss of neurons, activation of microglia, accumulation of ROS in ependymoglia cells concomitant with their cell cycle reentry, and increased neurogenesis in the forebrain. Inhibition of microglia activation does not abolish ependymoglia activation upon re-oxygenation, and NSCs cultured as neurospheres respond by increased proliferation in vitro, both observations indicating a cell autonomous role for ROS in NSCs. We further show that ROS production is required for cell cycle reentry by ependymoglia cells as well as for neuronal regeneration in the normally quiescent midbrain also during normoxia. Thus, we show that ROS production is an important component of NSC regulation and propose that this role of ROS may have been recruited during evolution to the capacity of regenerating neuronal subpopulations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypoxia followed by re-oxygenation induces neuronal death and an inflammatory response</title><p>First, we tested whether red-spotted newts were able to cope with hypoxia. We placed animals into an aquarium sealed with a plastic lid in which the oxygen level was manipulated by perfusing the water with nitrogen gas. The oxygen concentration was monitored by electrodes, which were feeding back to a unit controlling the gas supply to the water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We tested various regimens of shifting oxygen tension and found that newts were able to cope with hypoxic conditions as low as 10% of the normal oxygen tension provided that the decrease was gradual over a period of 48 hr. Hence, animals were kept in 10% of the normal oxygen tension for five days, and brought subsequently back instantly to normoxic conditions, and analyzed at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine whether hypoxia and subsequent re-oxygenation causes injury to the brain, we performed TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) staining, which identifies cells in the late phase of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arama and Steller, 2006</xref>). We found a 2.0-fold increase in the number of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells after 5 days of hypoxia in the forebrain. The number of apoptotic cells was further increased to 3.3-fold of the normal, after 1 day of re-oxygenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To determine whether neurons are lost during hypoxia/re-oxygenation, we carried out double immunostaining for the pan-neuronal marker NeuN and TUNEL. We found that the number of neurons with apoptotic phenotype was elevated showing a 3.2-fold increase after re-oxygenation compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results indicated that hypoxia/re-oxygenation leads to neuronal loss in the newt brain.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08422.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypoxia/re-oxygenation-induced neuronal cell death and microglia response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells are shown in the forebrain parenchyma at low magnification.

Following re-oxygenation, we injected animals with apocynin, which is an inhibitor of ROS production by interfering with the NADPH oxidase complex (NOX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muijsers et al., 2000</xref>). First, we observed that twice daily apocynin injection over a period of 3 days led to reduced ROS levels as detected by HEt staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Double immunostaining with PCNA and GFAP revealed that apocynin on its own did not reduce cell proliferation during normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, after re-oxygenation, the number of proliferating ependymoglia cells was reduced by 2.0-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>) in apocynin-injected compared to vehicle-injected animals.</p><p>In addition to NOX, ROS may also be generated by the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prozorovski et al., 2015</xref>) and we first tested whether mitochondrial ROS increased during re-oxygenation. To detect mitochondrial ROS, we incubated newt brains with mitochondrial superoxide indicator Mitosox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>). We observed excellent co-localization of the signal with the mitochondrium marker mitofusin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rojo et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Animals that were undergoing hypoxia/re-oxygenation displayed accumulation of mitochondrial ROS compared to control animals, which could be blocked with administration of the mitochondrially targeted antioxidant, Mitotempo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dikalova et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, in contrast to the effect of NOX-inhibition with apocynin, Mitotempo administration did not reduce the number of PCNA<sup>+</sup> ependymoglia cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>To address whether inhibition of ROS production ultimately interfered with neurogenesis, we carried out pulse/chase experiments with EdU. Animals were pulsed with EdU during 5 days following re-oxygenation and injected with apocynin for twice per day over a period of 8 days starting directly after re-oxygenation. Following a 35-day chase, we found that the number of EdU<sup>+</sup>/Hu<sup>+</sup> cells was reduced by 2.0-fold compared to vehicle-injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). These results show that the neurogenic response to hypoxia/re-oxygenation induced neuronal loss depends on ROS production.</p><p>Previous studies indicated increased ROS production in newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsatmali et al., 2006</xref>), and we aimed to quantify ROS in newborn neurons in the newt brain but this was not feasible due to technical reasons. As an alternative, we used an in vitro culture system. Newt ependymoglia cells form neurospheres under appropriate conditions as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirkham et al., 2014</xref>). Sphere growth occurs over time as the cells within proliferate, and shifting cells to growth factor free media induces differentiation. In such cultures, we compared the intensity of the ROS indicators HEt in GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells and in cells expressing the early neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX). These analyses did not show any difference in signal intensity indicating that ependymoglia cells and young neurons do not differ in terms of ROS production.

To do so, we ablated midbrain dopamine neurons by injecting the neurotoxin, 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine), without applying the hypoxia/re-oxygenation protocol. We previously showed that, in contrast to the forebrain, the newt midbrain is non-germinal and essentially quiescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parish et al., 2007</xref>). However, after administration of 6-OHDA, which kills dopamine neurons in the midbrain within 3 days after injection, newts regenerate lost midbrain dopamine neurons within four weeks. Regeneration is fuelled by the local activation of normally non-proliferating ependymoglia cells, which subsequently undergo a neurogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parish et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berg et al., 2010</xref>). First, we noticed that injection of 6-OHDA led to accumulation of ROS in ependymoglia cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we tested whether inhibition of ROS biosynthesis during the regeneration phase interfered with the ablation-responsive cell cycle reentry by ependymoglia cells, by treating animals with apocynin for five days starting from day 4 post-ablation. We found a 3.3-fold reduction in the number of proliferating ependymoglia cells in apocynin- vs control-injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). In addition, while apocynin treatment alone did not reduce the number of TH (Tyrosine Hydroxylase)-expressing neurons in sham-lesioned control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), apocynin inhibited regeneration of dopamine neurons after 6-OHDA-injection assessed by a reduction in the number of midbrain neurons expressing TH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>).

However, conflicting data exist as to whether ROS impairs or contributes to normal stem cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim and Wong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuikov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dickinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Belle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). We used systemic manipulation of oxygen tension as a means to manipulate ROS levels in a naturally regenerating organism. In contrast to most previous studies, which were heavily based on mixed cultures of stem and progenitor cells, we here took advantage of the fact that the vast majority of the ependymoglia cells lining the ventricles of the adult newt brain are rarely dividing stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirkham et al., 2014</xref>). Our data support the view that increased ROS signaling is important for the activation of NSCs, ultimately leading to replacement of lost neurons.</p><p>There are multiple sources of ROS in the cell and the evoked cellular response depends on the subcellular localization of ROS production. Specifically, it has been suggested that mitochondrial- and NOX-derived ROS play opposing roles in NSC and progenitor cell proliferation with mitochondria-derived ROS inhibiting and NOX-derived ROS promoting proliferation of neural progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prozorovski et al., 2015</xref>). In the newt brain however, mitochondrially targeted antioxidant administration neither increased nor reduced the proliferation of ependymoglia cells, although it apparently reduced mitochondrial ROS accumulation following re-oxygenation. This is in sharp contrast to the effect we found upon NOX inhibition. Since inhibiting NOX-derived ROS production counteracted re-oxygenation induced proliferation, our data indicate a dominating role for NOX-derived ROS in the control of ependymolgia cell proliferation. Other studies showed ROS accumulation in newly formed neurons, indicating a function in neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsatmali et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsatmali et al., 2005</xref>). While we could not evaluate the effect of ROS production on neuronal differentiation in vivo, our assessment did not show any increase in ROS levels in young neurons compared to NSCs in vitro. Although these observations do not demonstrate that ROS signaling is not important for differentiation, the results indicate that differentiation of neurons does not require increased ROS production.</p><p>Our experimental strategy allowed us to address a potential link between the apparent neuronal regeneration capacity of these animals and the ecological challenges within their normal habitat known to provide varying oxygen tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berner and Puckett, 2010</xref>). Completely faithful recapitulation of such constrains is not possible under laboratory conditions, not the least due to the variability of such events in nature. However, our findings are consistent with the model suggesting that shifts between hypoxic and normoxic conditions cause tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bickler and Buck, 2007</xref>). We can conclude that return to physiological oxygen tension from hypoxia leads to injury response in the newt brain, shown by loss of neurons, microglia activation, cell cycle reentry by NSCs, and increased neurogenesis. Importantly, increased ROS levels are also detectable in NSCs not only after re-oxygenation but also during replacement of midbrain dopamine neurons during constantly normoxic condition. Hence, it is plausible that ROS-production in NSC has been co-opted to the capacity of replacing lost neuronal population in the newt brain. It should also be pointed out that many hypoxia tolerant vertebrates are good regenerators. Two examples for this are zebrafish and crucian carp, both of which having marked brain regeneration capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirsche and Kirsche, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wolburg and Bouzehouane, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kroehne et al., 2011</xref>). Zebrafish, which live in tropical waters known to become hypoxic during nighttime, is able to survive at low levels of oxygen for days and the crucian carp remains active for months in anoxic water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nilsson and Renshaw, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2010</xref>). ROS signaling has also been linked to regeneration in several contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vriz et al., 2014</xref>) and the dependence of appendage regeneration on ROS accumulation has been found in <italic>Xenopus</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Love et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The potential evolutionary relevance of this finding can also be discussed in the context of why certain animals are highly regenerative, displaying a broad spectrum of regenerative abilities in many of their tissues and body parts, while other animals are not. <italic>Hydra</italic>, planaria, zebrafish, and salamanders show exceptional regenerative responses as they can regrow several body parts. The seemingly random, phylogenetically uneven distribution of animals capable of regenerating multiple structures in their bodies suggests that a regeneration capacity of an organism on such scale could be a purely ancestral phenomenon, which has been lost in most species for reasons that are unclear at present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Simon and Tanaka, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, specific micro-evolutionary selection mechanisms, such as loss of neurons during hypoxia/re-oxygenation as we demonstrate in the present work, may contribute to how an inherent regeneration capacity is manifested or whether it is manifested at all. Several recent findings support this view. First, closely related salamander species have non-overlapping range of regeneration capacities. For example, adult newts but not axolotls are able to regenerate the lens of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grogg et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, some planarian species have more extensive regeneration capacities than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sikes and Newmark, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Umesono et al., 2013</xref>). Second, we found that axolotls and newts display key cellular and molecular differences during limb regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sandoval-Guzman et al., 2014</xref>). Third, it has been shown that a central molecular component of salamander limb regeneration, Prod1, is only found in the salamander genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garza-Garcia et al., 2010</xref>) suggesting local evolution of limb regeneration in salamanders. Fourth, work on pectoral fin regeneration in zebrafish revealed an intriguing example of a sex-specific obstruction of regeneration, likely due to interference with a signaling pathway maintaining key secondary sexual attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In a cross-species comparative setting, it is also noteworthy that cell cycle reentry by NSCs appears to be dependent on accumulation of inflammatory cells and microglia activation in the zebrafish brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kyritsis et al., 2012</xref>). The hypoxia/re-oxygenation experimental paradigm that we employed does not provide evidence for such an interaction in the newt brain and our data rather suggest a cell autonomous process. Although the experimental manipulations used in zebrafish and in the newt brain here are different from each other, and we cannot rule out the possibility that microglia could activate NSCs in the newt brain under certain conditions, our observations indicate that the two animal species embark on at least partially non-overlapping signaling mechanism during neuronal regeneration.</p><p>While the systemic manipulation of oxygen tension and ROS accumulation led to increased neuronal death, we could not detect NSCs with apoptotic phenotype. This difference indicates that NSCs resist to ROS related damages. Future studies should address the identity of the molecular programs underlying NSCs survival and cell cycle re-activation as a response to increased ROS levels in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were performed on adult red-spotted newts, <italic>Notophthalmus viridescens</italic> (Charles Sullivan, Nashville, TN, USA) according to European Community and local ethics committee guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental manipulation of oxygen tension</title><p>Newts were placed in an aquarium sealed with plastic lid.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior Editor), Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado (Reviewing Editor), and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Hameed et al. demonstrate the importance of ROS in neuronal regeneration in the red spotted newt. The authors first show that neuronal death and ependymoglia proliferation occur during the reoxigenation phase during hypoxia and then proceed to demonstrate that ROS levels increase in the ependymoglia during this time. More importantly, the authors show that by interfering with ROS activity, they can experimentally and significantly reduce both ependymoglia proliferation and the ensuing neurogenesis to replace dead neurons. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the work presented in the manuscript is the evidence that ROS levels are also elevated in the 6OHDA model killing dopaminergic neurons and required also here for regenerative neurogenesis. In sum, the work reveals an important role for ROS levels during regenerative neurogenesis with will likely be of great significance in studies of regeneration of various organs in other organisms, including mammals.</p><p>Before this interesting article can be considered for publication, the Reviewing Editor and the reviewers would like the authors to consider and address the following essential issues:</p><p>1) A central issue of the present manuscript is that we do not know what the molecular consequence of ROS are in the experimental context, i.e. the down-stream mechanisms. ROS has been involved in neurogenesis (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prozorovski et al., 2015</xref>) and depending on the precise localization within the cell, different effects are mediated: NSC self-renewal via a NOX-mediated pathway; or neuronal differentiation via mitochondrial ROS increase. It would be desirable, therefore, to see if mechanistic insight can be derived from the experimental paradigm reported by Hameed et al., specifically whether blockers with further specificity of the NOX- or mitochondrial pathways alter the reported outcomes. Alternatively, it would also be interesting to determine the duration of the ROS response and the time at which adding the apocynin blocker has no longer an effect. For example in the 6OHD model, the authors start giving apocynin at 4 days after the lesion – what about starting after 7 days – would this have no effect anymore? Do young generated neurons also have elevated ROS levels? This could help explaining whether ROS is relevant only to initiate the proliferative response but no longer required for later neuronal differentiation.</p><p>2) The authors need to refine the focus of their manuscript. Given the emphasis on mechanism in the Introduction and Results sections, a more in-depth treatment of the findings and results in the Discussion section seems appropriate. Presently, the Discussion focuses primarily on evolutionary considerations, and while these are important, they should be a part, but not the central content of the Discussion section.</p><p>3) The stringency of data analyses needs to be increased. For example, the reviewers would like to better understand the statistics presented. It is understood that one “<italic>n”</italic> is one animal, but how many sections/cells were counted? It is also understood that the authors used a <italic>t</italic>-test, but did the authors tested whether the data follow a Gaussian normal distribution? If this was not the case, then the <italic>t</italic>-test is not the appropriate statistical analysis method.</p><p>4) The authors should be more consistent in the use of cell proliferation assays in order to facilitate comparisons between experiments within the manuscript.

ROS has been involved in neurogenesis (see review by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32"><italic>Prozorovski et al., 2015</italic></xref><italic>) and depending on the precise localization within the cell, different effects are mediated: NSC self-renewal via a NOX-mediated pathway; or neuronal differentiation via mitochondrial ROS increase. It would be desirable, therefore, to see if mechanistic insight can be derived from the experimental paradigm reported by Hameed et al., specifically whether blockers with further specificity of the NOX- or mitochondrial pathways alter the reported outcomes. Alternatively, it would also be interesting to determine the duration of the ROS response and the time at which adding the apocynin blocker has no longer an effect. For example in the 6OHD model, the authors start giving apocynin at 4 days after the lesion – what about starting after 7 days – would this have no effect anymore? Do young generated neurons also have elevated ROS levels? This could help explaining whether ROS is relevant only to initiate the proliferative response but no longer required for later neuronal differentiation.</italic></p><p>We performed several experiments to address the specific questions.</p><p>Subcellular localization of ROS production: We first determined whether mitochondrial ROS increased during re-oxygenation. To detect mitochondrial ROS we injected animals with the mitochondrial superoxide indicator Mitosox and could conclude that animals that underwent hypoxia/re-oxygenation displayed accumulation of mitochondrial ROS compared to control animals. This accumulation could be blocked by administration of the mitochondrially targeted antioxidant, Mitotempo. However, in contrast to the effect of NOX-inhibition with apocynin, Mitotempo administration did not reduce the number of PCNA<sup>+ </sup>ependymoglia cells. Thus our data indicate a dominating role for NOX derived ROS in the control of ependymoglia cell proliferation. These new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and are referred to in the Results, subsection “Ependymoglia cell proliferation and neurogenesis following re-oxygenation depends on ROS production”.</p><p>ROS and differentiation: To address whether ROS impinges on differentiation of young neurons in the newt brain, we carried out pulse chase experiments with the nucleotide analogue EdU in combination with subsequent inhibition of mitochondrial and NOX derived ROS. Unfortunately most animals did not tolerate the number of sequential injections required for this study and hence these experiments could not be evaluated. The suggested alternative way to address this question using the 6-OHDA mediated ablation model is unfortunately not feasible because the proliferation and differentiation phases are not temporally distinct during regeneration. Differentiation of TH neurons occurs gradually over time rather than in a separate burst after an initial proliferation phase. This precludes us to disentangle differentiation and proliferation from each other in a temporal dimension. However, as an indirect way we measured ROS levels in GFAP<sup>+</sup> NSCs and Dcx<sup>+</sup> young neurons and did not detect a difference comparing the two cell types. Although these observations do not demonstrate that ROS signaling is not important for differentiation, the results indicate that differentiation of neurons does not require increased ROS production. The data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> and described in the Results, subsection “Ependymoglia cell proliferation and neurogenesis following re-oxygenation depends on ROS production”.</p><p><italic>2) The authors need to refine the focus of their manuscript. Given the emphasis on mechanism in the Introduction and Results sections, a more in-depth treatment of the findings and results in the Discussion section seems appropriate. Presently, the Discussion focuses primarily on evolutionary considerations, and while these are important, they should be a part, but not the central content of the Discussion section.</italic></p><p>We complemented the Discussion according to this request. In the revised version the first part of the Discussion entirely focuses on mechanisms of ROS generation. The second part of the Discussion addresses the hypotheses put forward in the Introduction, namely that animals need to repair tissues that become damaged during hypoxia/re-oxygenation, and that hypoxia/re-oxygenation leads to events in the newt brain that share common features with processes taking place after experimental ablation and subsequent regeneration of neurons during normoxia.</p><p><italic>3) The stringency of data analyses needs to be increased. For example, the reviewers would like to better understand the statistics presented. It is understood that one “</italic>n” <italic>is one animal, but how many sections/cells were counted? It is also understood that the authors used a</italic> t<italic>-test, but did the authors tested whether the data follow a Gaussian normal distribution? If this was not the case, then the</italic> t<italic>-test is not the appropriate statistical analysis method.</italic></p><p>We incorporated a description of the statistical analyses including counting procedures and determination of normal distribution (see Methods, subsections “Image Analysis and counting” and “Statistical analyses”). In addition we indicate now in each figure legend which statistical test was used.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should be more consistent in the use of cell proliferation assays in order to facilitate comparisons between experiments within the manuscript. In some conditions the authors chose direct incorporation of nucleotides as a clear measure of cell-cycle reentry, while in others they use PCNA immunostaining. Because PCNA positive cells can be detected in the absence of S-phase reentry, comparison between the two types of experimental sets is complicated. Given the comparative nature of the experiments performed, it seems necessary to use one consistent assay, preferentially EdU incorporation.</italic></p><p>In the in vivo assays ependymoglia proliferation were consistently determined by PCNA staining and only differentiation was determined in EdU pulse/chase studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). We have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berg et al., 2010</xref>; Development) that PCNA staining and EdU pulsing give with each other consistent results regarding ependymoglia proliferation. In addition, as a proof of principle in the context of the present study, we performed EdU pulse experiments during re-oxygenation and compared the results with data obtained from PCNA staining. Importantly, there was no difference in the conclusions from the two types of measurements, as both PCNA staining and EdU pulsing indicated a 1.8 increase in ependymoglia proliferation upon re-oxygenation compared to control animals. These data are presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> and are referred to in Results (in the subsection “Re-oxygenation leads to cell cycle reentry by forebrain ependymoglia cells and increased neurogenesis”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
