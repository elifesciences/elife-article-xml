when we walk despite the retinal images of these objects moving with every step we take. Here, we showed our brains solve this optical illusion by adopting an allocentric spatial reference frame. We measured perceived target location after the observer walked a short distance from the home base. Supporting the allocentric coding scheme, we found the intrinsic bias , which acts as a spatial reference frame for perceiving location of a dimly lit target in the dark, remained grounded at the home base rather than traveled along with the observer. The path-integration mechanism responsible for this can utilize both active and passive (vestibular) translational motion signals, but only along the horizontal direction. This asymmetric path-integration finding in human visual space perception is reminiscent of the asymmetric spatial memory finding in desert ants, pointing to nature’s wondrous and logically simple design for terrestrial creatures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual space perception</kwd><kwd>allocentric reference frame</kwd><kwd>depth perception</kwd><kwd>path integration</kwd><kwd>slef-motion</kwd><kwd>hippocampal formation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY 033190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ooi</surname><given-names>Teng Leng</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Zijiang J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fitting our terrestrial niche, the human visual system adopts a ground-based reference frame for spatial computation in concert with the attention, memory, and path-integration processes for space perception during self-motion.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When viewing natural scenes, we readily appreciate the visual space expanse that ‘fills’ the scene being enveloped by the sky above and terrain below our feet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). Notably, within this phenomenological visual space, our visual system employs the prevalent ground surface, where creatures and objects frequently interact, as a reference frame for coding spatial locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gibson, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sedgwick, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sinai et al., 1998</xref>). Empirical findings have revealed the ground-based spatial coding scheme accurately localizes objects when the horizontal ground surface is continuous and carries rich depth cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thomson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rieser et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Loomis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Loomis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sinai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meng and Sedgwick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">He et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bian et al., 2005</xref>). Attesting to the significant role of the ground surface, it has been found that object localization becomes inaccurate when the ground surface is disrupted by a gap or an occluding box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sinai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">He et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, object localization is inaccurate in the dark when the ground is not visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ooi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ooi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Philbeck and Loomis, 1997</xref>). In fact, research conducted in total darkness to prevent the visual system from obtaining depth information from the ground reveals the visual system defaults to using an implicit semi-elliptical curved surface representation that we refer to as the <italic>intrinsic bias</italic> to localize objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ooi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ooi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gogel and Tietz, 1979</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> illustrates the intrinsic bias’ semi-elliptical representation in the dark (dashed white curve) that leads to an observer perceiving a dimly lit target (green ring) at the intersection (green disc) between its projection line from the eye and the intrinsic bias. Furthermore, when a parallel row of texture elements on the ground serves as the depth cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), object localization becomes more accurate. It is as if the objects are now located along a curved reference (solid white curve), which is less slanted than the intrinsic bias. This suggests the intrinsic bias, acting as the prototype spatial reference of the ground surface when visual cues are not visible, integrates with the visible depth cues such as texture gradients on the ground to form a new ground surface representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). In this way, the ground surface representation depends on the weighted contributions of the depth information on the ground and the intrinsic bias.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The ground-based spatial coding scheme.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) and (<bold>b</bold>) Natural scenes are largely enveloped by the prevalent sky above us and the ground on which we stand. Evidence suggests target locations are judged with respect to the ground surface, which is our terrestrial niche. (<bold>c</bold>) The visual system uses the intrinsic bias, an implicit semi-elliptical surface representation in the dark (illustrated as dashed white curve), to locate a dimly lit target (illustrated as unfilled green disc). The target is perceived (filled green disc) at the intersection between the projection line from the eye to the target and the intrinsic bias. Essentially, the intrinsic bias acts like the visual system’s internal model of the ground surface. (<bold>d</bold>) When the ground becomes visible, the intrinsic bias integrates with the visible depth cues to form a ground surface representation, which serves as a reference frame to code target location. For example, the parallel rows of texture elements on the ground (illustrated as filled red circles) provide the depth cue for the visual system to construct a ground surface representation (solid white curve) that is less slanted than the intrinsic bias. This leads to a more accurate target localization than in the dark (<bold>c</bold>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88095-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Nevertheless, current understanding of the ground-based spatial coding scheme is limited to situations where the tested observer stood still. Namely, just as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, now redrawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and referred to as the <italic>baseline-stationary</italic> condition, the observer is instructed to stand still at one location during the test, which anchors his/her intrinsic bias on the ground under his/her feet. In this way, object location in visual space can be computed relative to the intrinsic bias. However, because retinal images of the stationary environment move when one moves (e.g., walk), it is unclear what additional computation the ground-based spatial coding scheme requires to construct a stable perceptual space. We proposed that during translational movements, such as walking, the brain anchors the intrinsic bias at one location on the ground surface using a <italic>path-integration</italic> mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mittelstaedt and Mittelstaedt, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wehner and Srinivasan, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rieser, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Etienne et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McNaughton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Loomis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mittelstaedt and Mittelstaedt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Loomis et al., 2013</xref>). The path-integration mechanism generates an estimate of the observer’s current position relative to their original location (home base) by integrating each step of traveled length and direction (vector). For example, when the observer walks forward in the dark, the path-integration mechanism estimates the walked length by integrating each step length based on inputs from the vestibular and/or proprioception systems. The intrinsic bias accordingly shifts behind the body over a distance equaling the estimated walked distance; effectively placing the intrinsic bias at the home base should the estimated walked distance be accurate. This leads the visual system to construct the ground surface representation from the (allocentric) intrinsic bias that is fixed to the ground surface at the home base. By doing so, the visual system can obtain a stable allocentric ground surface representation. Accordingly, the ground-based reference frame can use an allocentric, that is, world-centered, coordinate system to code locations in visual space.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hypotheses and predictions of Experiment 1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) <italic>Baseline-stationary</italic> condition.

(<bold>b</bold>) The allocentric hypothesis predicts when the observer walks forward from the home base (illustrated as blue cross) to a new location (illustrated as red cross), the visual system relies on the path-integration mechanism to keep the intrinsic bias (illustrated as dashed blue curve) at the home base while monitoring the homing error vector (illustrated as white arrow).

This hypothesis stands in contrast to an alternative egocentric coordinate system hypothesis, which predicts the intrinsic bias moves along with the observer’s body. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we began by measuring the intrinsic bias when the observer walked in the dark. Consider the scenario where an observer walks from his/her home base (blue cross added in figure for illustrative purpose) in the dark and stops at a new location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; red cross added for illustration). According to the allocentric hypothesis, the intrinsic bias (blue) would remain at the home base. Thus, when he/she stops and is presented with a dimly lit test target (illustrated by the green ring), the observer would perceive the target to be nearer and higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) than if he/she had not walked from the home base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; we shall dub this the <italic>baseline-stationary</italic> condition). In contrast, if the intrinsic bias had moved along with the observer to the new location (illustrated as the gray curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), as predicted by the alternative egocentric hypothesis, the observer would perceive the target at the same location as that in the <italic>baseline-stationary</italic> condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><p>We have premised the allocentric hypothesis on the ground-based spatial coding scheme employing the path-integration (or spatial updating) system to maintain the intrinsic bias at the home base (blue cross in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Previous studies have found that when performing spatial memory tasks, in conditions where visual cues are not visible in the dark, the path-integration mechanism computes the traveled distance based on (non-visual) idiothetic distance information, such as from the vestibular, proprioceptive, and efference copy of motor control signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mittelstaedt and Mittelstaedt, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Etienne et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Loomis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Loomis et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we extended this study to characterize the behaviors of the path-integration mechanism in a visual spatial perception task, to investigate if the path-integration mechanism behaved in a similar manner as in the spatial memory task.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: testing allocentric vs. egocentric hypothesis</title><p>We first verified the prediction of the allocentric hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) by testing a <italic>baseline-stationary</italic> condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and a <italic>walking</italic> condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

The two sets of data points are fitted by the same shaped intrinsic bias curve with about 1.35 m horizontal separation, which is close to the initially walked distance from the home base (1.5 m; in the <italic>walking</italic> condition).

To test this assumption, we investigated whether the path-integration mechanism requires some attentional resources to function normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amorim et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavanagh et al., 2010</xref>).

Specifically, the perceptual effects found were similar between an action-based task (blind walking-gesturing) and a perception-based task (e.g., verbal reports and perceptual matching) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sinai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ooi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>).

This dependence on the ground surface, that is, an ecological constraint, predicts when the observer travels on a sloping surface in the dark, the visual system would not be able to simultaneously maintain the intrinsic bias at the home base in the vertical and horizontal directions. To investigate this prediction of asymmetric path integration, we tested a new, <italic>stepladder</italic> condition, where the observer descended a stepladder in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

Yet, we reliably localize objects as we navigate our environment. This raises the question of how our visual system creates a stable visual space for us to operate and plan future actions, such as walking, despite the inadequate retinal inputs. While it was known the visual system relies predominantly on the ground surface to accurately localize objects, it was unclear what coordinate system it uses for coding visual space. In this study, we proposed the visual system uses an allocentric, or world-centered, coordinate system for the ground-based reference. In this way, the visual system could alleviate the challenge of constant retinal motion during self-motion by streamlining online location computation to only the moving observer and the object of interest. The locations of surrounding objects are anchored to a fixed position on the ground negating excessive computation, thereby reducing coding redundancy. Our main finding provides support for the allocentric hypothesis. We showed during self-motion, the intrinsic bias that acts as the spatial reference of the ground surface when visual cues are not visible, is fixed to the ground location before the motion begins (home base) and remains at the same ground location during self-motion.</p><p>Previous studies mainly tested location judgments of observers who stood stationary at one location on the ground while viewing a stationary target (similar to our <italic>baseline-stationary</italic> condition). Because the observers need not generate significant self-motion in those studies, it was not possible to investigate the allocentric hypothesis. The previous findings with stationary observers showed that the visual system uses the ground surface representation as a reference frame for representing object locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gibson, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sedgwick, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sinai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meng and Sedgwick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ooi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">He et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Philbeck and Loomis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gogel and Tietz, 1979</xref>). One may thu s claim that the ground-based spatial coordinate system is world-centered or allocentric. However, it is hard to reject the egocentric hypothesis since the origin of the spatial coordinate system is attached to the surface underneath one’s feet while standing still on the ground. In a way, the egocentric hypothesis is implicitly assumed because it is less complex than the allocentric hypothesis. After all, without body motion, the allocentric coordinate system does not have an advantage over the egocentric coordinate system in terms of processing efficiency.</p><p>The visual system relies on the path-integration mechanism to ground the intrinsic bias at the home base. The path-integration mechanism can function when the observer’s motion is passive, suggesting the traveled distance can be based on the vestibular signals alone. Also, the path-integration mechanism fails to operate efficiently when the observer’s attention is distracted to an unrelated cognitive demand during walking. This suggests some degree of attentional effort is required to reliably path integrate an observer’s body location relative to the environment. Lastly, we showed the path-integration mechanism is more efficient in the horizontal than the vertical direction (assymetric with a ground bias). This observation further highlights one of the most important design principles underlying our sensory and motor systems, namely, fitting our terrestrial niche. We inhabit a land-based environment and most of our daily activities are structured relative to the ground. The current finding on the vertical–horizontal asymmetry of the path-integration mechanism for visual space perception is consistent with previous studies on spatial memory, which revealed the path-integration systems of land-dwelling animals are more efficient in estimating horizontally traveled distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wohlgemuth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jovalekic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hayman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zwergal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ronacher, 2020</xref>). In particular, our observation is reminiscent of the behavioral studies of the desert ants, <italic>Cataglyphis fortis.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wohlgemuth et al., 2001</xref> found desert ants used path integration to return from foraging excursions on a shortcut way to their nests (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ronacher, 2020</xref>). Specifically, it was revealed when the ants were crawling over a slope surface with uphill and downhill trajectory, their path-integration system computed only the horizontal component of the traveled distance. We note, however, further research is needed to investigate whether the same path-integration mechanism is employed for a spatial memory task (previous studies by others) and a spatial perception task (current study).</p><p>Overall, our study suggests the visual system can create a world-centered visual space by anchoring its spatial reference frame to the ground during navigation. One advantage of adopting this space coding strategy is that when we travel, the spatial representations of most surrounding objects, which are static relative to the ground, will remain constant (static) despite the retinal image motion. Accordingly, our visual system only needs to dynamically update the spatial representations of our bodies and the few objects that are moving relative to an allocentric origin on the ground (within a world-centered context). A consequential byproduct of operating within the framework of an allocentric, world-centered visual space is the perceived stability of our visual environment during locomotion.</p><p>Let us consider the following hypothetical situation of a forward walking condition in the dark. The observer sees a target briefly before walking forward over a short distance, and again after they reach the new destination. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref> illustrate the perceived target locations, respectively, if the visual system adopts the allocentric or egocentric coding strategy. Noticeably, the perceived target locations differ before (open red circle) and after walking (closed circle) as shown in both figures. However, the separation between the perceived target locations is smaller in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> (allocentric coding) than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> (egocentric coding), indicating more perceived location stability in the former. Although, this position stability has an accuracy trade-off as the perceived target locations after the short walk are more underestimated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> (allocentric) than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> (egocentric). Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that the location inaccuracy from using the allocentric spatial coding strategy will be minimized in the full cue environment, where the influence of the intrinsic bias is less. This is because when the ground is not visible in the dark, the surface slant of the intrinsic bias is responsible for the distance underestimation of a target on the ground (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). When there is some sparse texture information on the ground (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), the ground surface representation becomes less slanted than the intrinsic bias and the distance underestimation error is less. Accordingly, the underestimation error due to using the allocentric spatial coding strategy will be further reduced (unpublished data). Therefore, a full cue condition with rich texture gradient information on the ground will render the ground surface representation largely veridical, resulting in accurate distance perception.</p><p>The observations reported here support the proposal that during observer self-motion the brain establishes an allocentric intrinsic bias by employing the path-integration mechanism. By utilizing the allocentric intrinsic bias, the visual system is able to construct an allocentric ground reference frame. Accordingly, the ground-based visual space can effectively program and guide navigation of terrestrial creatures on the ground surface. Given its significance, it is natural to ask where in the brain the intrinsic bias, a prototype model of the ground surface, is implemented. In this respect, we are reminded that the two-dimensional cognitive map (long-term spatial memory) employed by land-dwelling animals is also linked to the terrain where they travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jovalekic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hayman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tolman, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moser et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the intrinsic bias could be a function of the mammalian hippocampal formation that is well known to be responsible for directing navigation when spatial sensory inputs are impoverished or lacking such as in the dark. Consistent with this speculation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nau et al., 2018</xref> pointed to growing evidence that ‘the mammalian hippocampal formation, extensively studied in the context of navigation and memory, mediates a representation of visual space that is stably anchored to the external world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nau et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Following this line of thinking, we further speculate that the intrinsic bias that represents the internal model of the visual ground surface is implemented in the spatial memory system. As we mentioned earlier, our visual system employs the ground surface representation as a spatial reference frame for spatial coding, fitting our terrestrial niche. It is thus tempting to adopt the idea that the spatial memory systems of land dwellers employ the same spatial coding, with the cognitive map serving as an internal model of the ground and the associated spatial features (walls and obstacles) that are supported by the ground. As such, the intrinsic bias is the basis not only for the cognitive map within the medial temporal lobe but also for visual ground surface representation within the perceptual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bottini and Doeller, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Future investigations should explore the broader notion that the concept of the intrinsic bias could be genetically or epigenetically coded, serving as an important priori knowledge for the brain to represent the ground surface and to construct our inner spatial world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gibson, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kant, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Von Uexküll, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Observers</title><p>Fourteen observers (age = 24.47 ± 1.45 years old; eye height = 1.60 ± 0.02 m; 7 males and 7 females) participated in Experiments 1–4 with eight observers for each experiment. Nine observers (age = 22.78 ± 1.22 years old; eye height = 1.58 ± 0.04 cm; 6 males and 3 males) participated in Experiment 5. They were naïve to the purpose of the study. All observers had normal, or corrected-to-normal, visual acuity (at least 20/20) and a stereoscopic resolution of 20 arc sec or better. They viewed the visual scene binocularly. A within-subject experimental design was used. The study protocol was approved by The University of Louisville Institutional Review Board (approved IRB number 94.0302) and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects signed the informed consent form approved by the IRB at the start of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>General stimulus and testing environment</title><p>All Experiments 1–4 were performed in a dark room whose layout and dimensions were unknown to the observers. One end of the room, just before the testing area, served as the waiting area (~3 m<sup>2</sup>) for the observer. The waiting area had a chair facing the wall for the observer to sit in between trials so that his/her back faced the testing area. Two white LED lights on the ceiling provided ambient illumination while the observer waited in between trials. The testing and waiting areas were separated by a black curtain. A long guidance rope (0.8 m above the floor) was tied to both ends of the room and served to guide the observer while walking blindly. A plastic wrap was tied to the guidance rope on the part of the rope located in the waiting area near the curtain to mark the start point (home base). To ready for a trial, the observer walked to this start point and faced the test area while holding onto the plastic wrap on the rope and called out ‘ready’. The curtain was then drawn open for the trial to begin.</p><p>The dimly lit test target used in all experiments was a diffused green LED (0.16 cd m<sup>−2</sup>). The LED was placed in the center of a ping-pong ball that was encased in a small opaque box. An adjustable iris-diaphragm aperture was placed at the front of the ping-pong ball to keep its visual angular size constant at 0.22° when measured at the eye level. During testing, the target was displayed with a 5-Hz flicker for 1 s. Music was played aloud during the entire experimental session to mask extraneous auditory information during the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Observer’s response tasks</title><p>The main task used in all experiments was the <italic>blind walking-gesturing task</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ooi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ooi et al., 2006</xref>). For each trial, the observer stood by the guidance rope in the dark and judged the location of the 1-s flickering target. After which he/she then put on the blindfold and called out ‘ready to walk’. This signaled the experimenter to quickly remove the target and shook the guidance rope to indicate it was safe to walk. The observer walked while sliding his/her right hand along the guidance rope until he/she reached the remembered target location. Once there, he/she indicated the remembered target height with his/her left hand and called out ‘done’. The experimenter turned on the flashlight, marked the observer’s feet location, measured the gestured height, and asked the observer to turn around and walk back to the start point using the guidance rope. When the observer arrived at the start point, the experimenter turned on the ceiling LED lights in the waiting area. The observer then removed the blindfold, sat down, and waited for the next trial.</p><p>An additional task used, in Experiment 4, was the <italic>verbal reporting task</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ooi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Here, the observer stood next to the guidance rope in the dark and viewed the target for 5 s to judge its absolute distance between the target and his/her eyes. Once the target was turned off, an audio tone was presented to signal the observer to immediately report the estimated distance either in meters or feet. For both this and the blind walking-gesturing task, the observer was provided five practice trials before each test session. No feedback regarding performance was provided to the observer during the practice or test session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Design</title><p>Two viewing conditions were tested: <italic>walking</italic> and <italic>baseline-stationary</italic>.

Four locations were on the floor at 3, 4.25, 5.25, or 6.5 m from the observer, the fifth location was 0.5 m above the floor at 6.5 m from the observer, and the sixth location was at the observer’s eye level and 6.5 m from the observer. Testing of the 4.25, 5.25, and 6.5 m targets on the floor were repeated three times while testing of the remaining targets was repeated twice. A total of 60 trials were run over 2 days.

After that, an audio tone was presented to signal to the observer to walk to the start point (home base) and face the black curtain in the direction of the testing area. About 30 s later, the experimenter turned off the ambient LED lights in the waiting area and the observer drew the curtain open in the dark.</p><p>For the <italic>baseline-stationary</italic> condition, the observer stood in the dark at the start point (home base) over the predetermined waiting duration (12 or 60 s). He/she was instructed to stand upright with minimal head motion during the waiting period, and to expect hearing a pure tone at the end of the waiting period. Roughly, 2 s after hearing the tone, the test target was presented at one of the six predetermined locations. The observer’s task was to judge its location and perform the blind walking-gesturing task. For the <italic>walking</italic> trial, the observer stood at the start point until a white noise (instead of pure tone) was heard. He/she then walked forward until his/her right hand touched a plastic wrap tied on the guidance rope at the new location (1.5 m from the start point). He/she then stopped walking, called out ‘ready’ and waited there for either 12 or 60 s before the test target was presented.

A second audio signal was presented after 30 s. A pure tone indicated to the observer to stay (<italic>baseline-stationary</italic> condition), while a white noise indicated to walk (<italic>walking</italic> condition) or to be pushed forward (<italic>vestibular-forward</italic> condition). At the same time, Experimenter A turned off the LED lights in the waiting area, and the observer drew the curtain open.

Authors firstly manipulated the waiting time before walking to tease apart the influence from spatial working memory in guiding locomotion. They demonstrated that the intrinsic bias in perceiving distance remained constant during walking and that the establishment of a new spatial layout in the brain took a relatively longer time beyond the visual-spatial working memory. In the following experiments, the authors then uncovered that the strength of the intrinsic bias in distance perception along the horizontal direction is reduced when participants' attention is distracted, implying that world-centered path integration requires attentional effort. This study also revealed horizontal-vertical asymmetry in a spatial coding scheme that bears a resemblance to the locomotion control in other animal species such as desert ants.</p><p>The revised version of the study effectively situates the research within the broader context of terrestrial navigation, focusing on the movement of land-based creatures and offers a clearer explanation for the potential neurological basis of the human brain's allocentric odometer.

Several empirical studies have not been able to obtain evidence to support the claim. For example, empirical studies by Hutchison &amp; Loomis (2009) and Durgin et al. (2009) did not find wearing a heavy backpack significantly influenced distance perception, in contrast to the findings by Proffitt et al (2003). We respectfully request not to discuss this issue in our revision since it is not closely related to the focus of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Furthermore, it would be more comprehensive and fit into the Neuroscience Section if the authors can add in current understandings of the spatial reference frames in neuroscience in the introduction and discussion, and provide explanations on how the findings of this study supplement the physiological evidence that supports our spatial perception as well. For instance, world-centered representations of the environment, or cognitive maps, are associated with hippocampal formation while self-centered spatial relationships, or image spaces, are associated with the parietal cortex (see Bottini, R., &amp; Doeller, C. F. (2020). Knowledge Across Reference Frames: Cognitive Maps and Image Spaces.

To provide more context for the general audience, it would be beneficial for the authors to address this issue in their discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this on pages 3-4. In brief, our hypothesis is that during self-motion, the visual system constructs an allocentric ground surface representation (reference frame) by integrating the allocentric intrinsic bias with the external depth cues on the natural ground surface. Supporting this hypothesis, we recently found that when there is texture cue on the ground, the representation of the ground surface is influenced by the allocentric intrinsic bias (Zhou et al, unpublished results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The current findings on the &quot;allocentric&quot; coding scheme raise some intriguing questions as to why such a mechanism would be developed and how it could be beneficial. The finding that the &quot;allocentric&quot; coding scheme results in less accurate object localization and requires attentional resources seems counterintuitive and raises questions about its usefulness. However, this observation presents an opportunity for the manuscript to discuss the potential evolutionary advantages or trade-offs associated with this coding mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>The revision has discussed these important issues on page 12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The manuscript lacks a thorough description of the data analysis process, particularly regarding the fitting of the intrinsic bias curve (e.g., the blue and gray dashed curve in Figure 3c) and the calculation of the horizontal separation between the curves. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide more detailed information on the specific function and parameters used in the fitting process and the formula used for the separation calculation to ensure the transparency and reproducibility of the study's results.</p></disp-quote><p>The results of the statistical analysis were presented in the supplementary materials. We had stated in the original manuscript that we fitted the intrinsic bias curve by eye (obtained by drawing the curve to transcribe the data points as closely as possible) (page 26). This is because we do not yet have a formula for the intrinsic bias. A challenge is the measured intrinsic bias in the dark can be affected by multiple factors. One factor is related to individual differences as the intrinsic bias is shaped by the observer’s past experiences and their eye height relative to the ground surface. However, it is certainly our goal to develop a quantitative model of the intrinsic bias in the future.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3:</bold></p><p>(1) I am a bit confused by Figure 2b. Allocentric coordinate refers to the representation of the distance and direction of an object relative to other objects but not relative to the observer. In Figure 2, however, the authors assumed that the perceived target was located on the interception between the intrinsic bias curve and the viewing line from the NEW eye position to the target. This suggests that the perceived object depends on the observer's new location, which seems odd with the allocentric coordinate hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectively disagree with the Reviewer’s statement that “Allocentric coordinate refers to the representation of the distance and direction of an object relative to other objects but not relative to the observer.” The statement conflates the definitions of allocentric representation with exocentric representation. We respectfully maintain that the observer’s body location, as well as observer-object distance, can be represented with the allocentric coordinate system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) According to Fig 2b, the perceived size should be left-shifted and lifted up in the walking condition compared to that in the stationary condition. However, in Figure 3C and Fig 4, the perceived size was the same height as that in the baseline condition.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume by “target size”, the Reviewer actually meant, “target location”. It is correct that figure 3c and figure 4 showed judged distance changed as predicted, while the change in judged height was not significant. One explanation for this is that the magnitude of the height change was much smaller than the distance change and could not be revealed by our blind walking-gesturing method. Please also note our figures used difference scales for the vertical height and horizontal distance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Is the left-shifted perceived distance possibly reflecting a kind of compensation mechanism? Participants could not see the target's location but knew they had moved forward. Therefore, their brain automatically compensates for this self-movement when judging the location of a target. This would perfectly predict the left-shifted but not upward-shifted data in Fig 3C. A similar compensation mechanism exists for size constancy in which we tend to compensate for distance in computing object size.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the Reviewer suggested that the path-integration mechanism first estimates the traveled distance in the dark, and then the brain subtracts the estimated distance from the perceived target distance. We respectfully maintain that this explanation is unlikely because it does not account for our empirical findings. We found that walking in the dark did not uniformly affect perceived target distance, as the Reviewer’s explanation would predict. As shown in figures 3 and 4, walking affected the near targets less than the far targets (i.e., the horizontal distance difference between walking and baseline-stationary conditions was smaller for the near target than far target).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) According to Fig 2a, the target, perceived target, and eye should be aligned in one straight line. This means that connecting the physical targets and the corresponding perceived target results in straight lines that converge at the eye position. This seems, however, unlikely in Figure 3c.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added in the revision, the averaged eye positions on the y-axes of figures 3 and 4. To reveal the impact of the judged angular declination, we also added graphs that plotted the estimated angular declination as a function of the physical declination of the target. In general, the slopes are close to unity.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) This study is very well-designed and written.
