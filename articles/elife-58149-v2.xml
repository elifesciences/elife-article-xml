diverse cellular protrusions, but intermediate filaments, the strongest and most stable cytoskeletal elements, are not known to directly participate in the formation of protrusions. Here we show that keratin intermediate filaments directly regulate the morphogenesis of microridges, elongated protrusions arranged in elaborate maze-like patterns on the surface of mucosal epithelial cells. We found that microridges on zebrafish skin cells contained both actin and keratin filaments. Keratin filaments stabilized microridges, and overexpressing keratins lengthened them. Envoplakin and periplakin, plakin family cytolinkers that bind F-actin and keratins, localized to microridges, and were required for their morphogenesis. Strikingly, plakin protein levels directly dictate microridge length. An actin-binding domain of periplakin was required to initiate microridge morphogenesis, whereas periplakin-keratin binding was required to elongate microridges. These findings separate microridge morphogenesis into distinct steps, expand our understanding of intermediate filament functions, and identify microridges as protrusions that integrate actin and intermediate filaments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells adopt a wide array of irregular and bumpy shapes, which are scaffolded by an internal structure called the cytoskeleton.

The three major classes of cytoskeletal elements—microtubules, actin filaments, and intermediate filaments (IFs)—each have distinct mechanical and biochemical properties and associate with different regulatory proteins, suiting them to different functions. Actin filaments create a wide variety of well-studied protrusions, including filopodia, lamellipodia, invadopodia, and microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchoin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pollard and Cooper, 2009</xref>). Similarly, microtubules form cilia and flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mirvis et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, IFs are not commonly believed to directly participate in the formation of cellular protrusions.</p><p>IFs are diverse, including nuclear lamins, neurofilaments, glial fibrillary acidic proteins, vimentins, and keratins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Etienne-Manneville, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>). Although each IF type is biochemically distinct, they all share structural properties. Whereas actin filaments and microtubules lengthen by preferentially adding filaments to one end, IFs are unpolarized. Tetrameric IF subunits incorporate not only at filament ends, but also within filaments, a process called ‘intercalary exchange’ that allows IFs to replace subunits without altering filament structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colakoğlu and Brown, 2009</xref>). The viscoelastic properties of IFs make them the strongest of the cytoskeletal elements. IFs deform at low strains, but, whereas actin filaments and microtubules break at high strains, IFs rigidify and resist breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Janmey et al., 1991</xref>). Their stability and strength together make IFs ideal for maintaining cellular integrity.</p><p>Keratins are the most abundant IFs in epithelial cells. They organize and reinforce epithelial tissues by anchoring cells to one another and to the extracellular matrix at desmosomes and hemi-desmosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Osmani and Labouesse, 2015</xref>), and they are bundled and cross-linked during the process of keratinization to create the cornified outer layers of mammalian skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eckhart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smack et al., 1994</xref>). Although keratins are not known to be directly involved in the morphogenesis of protrusions, they support microvilli as part of the terminal web at their base, where they interact with F-actin rootlets extending from microvilli, as well as myosin and other actin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hirokawa et al., 1982</xref>). Keratins, along with the IF vimentin, have also been detected in long invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schoumacher et al., 2010</xref>). Although keratins themselves are not required for invadopodia morphogenesis, disrupting vimentin prevents their full lengthening, suggesting that IFs may play a role in the late stages of invadopodia extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schoumacher et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Cytolinker proteins bind to multiple cytoskeletal elements to integrate them into cellular structures. For example, keratins are connected to F-actin in the terminal web of intestinal microvilli, potentially by the cytolinker plastin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grimm-Günter et al., 2009</xref>). Another family of cytolinkers, the plakins, consist of several large, multi-domain proteins that link cytoskeletal elements to cell junctions or to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jefferson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sonnenberg and Liem, 2007</xref>). The plakin family members periplakin (Ppl) and envoplakin (Evpl), which dimerize with each other and form hetero-oligomeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalinin et al., 2004</xref>), localize to desmosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DiColandrea et al., 2000</xref>) and are components of the cornified envelope in mammalian skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruhrberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ruhrberg et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>ppl</italic> and <italic>evpl</italic> knockout mice are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Määttä et al., 2001</xref>), though skin barrier formation is delayed in <italic>evpl</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Määttä et al., 2001</xref>). Evpl and Ppl have large N-terminal regions with direct actin-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalinin et al., 2005</xref>), as well as domains that associate with actin-binding proteins in other plakin family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jefferson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sonnenberg and Liem, 2007</xref>). Plakins also have rod domains that form coiled-coils mediating dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalinin et al., 2004</xref>), and C-terminal domains that bind to IFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karashima and Watt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kazerounian et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, Evpl and Ppl have the potential to link F-actin with keratin filaments.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the relationship between keratins, F-actin, and plakins in the morphogenesis of microridges, which are laterally elongated protrusions arranged in maze-like patterns on the apical surface of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Depasquale, 2018</xref>). Microridges are formed on a variety of mucosal epithelial cells, including cells that make up the outer layer of the zebrafish epidermis, called the periderm, where they are required to maintain glycans on the skin surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>). Microridge protrusions are filled with F-actin but are more persistent than several better studied actin-based structures, such as lamellipodia and filopodia. Microridges are formed from the coalescence of finger-like, actin-based precursor protrusions called pegs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>), a process dependent on the F-actin nucleator Arp2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>) and the relaxation of surface tension by cortical myosin-based contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>). Although studies of microridge morphogenesis have exclusively focused on F-actin regulation, like microvilli, microridges have keratins at their base, and ultrastructural studies have reported the occasional presence of IFs within microridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schliwa, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Uehara et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Using a combination of live imaging, mutant analysis, and structure-function studies, we found that keratins are integral components of microridges, and that Evpl and Ppl control microridge stability and length by recruiting keratin cytoskeletal filaments. Thus, F-actin-keratin cytolinkers create a hybrid cytoskeletal scaffold that enables the morphogenesis of microridge protrusions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Keratins are core components of mature microridges</title><p>To investigate keratin localization in the zebrafish periderm, we tagged six type I keratin proteins expressed in periderm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cokus et al., 2019</xref>) with GFP or mRuby at their C-termini, using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Imaging periderm cells in live zebrafish expressing these reporters revealed that all keratins localized in two distinct patterns within a cell: As expected, they formed a filamentous network filling cells; remarkably, they also formed what appeared to be thick bundles in the pattern of microridges at the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

At an early stage of microridge morphogenesis (19 hr post-fertilization, hpf), when periderm surfaces are dominated by pegs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>), Krt17 formed the filamentous pattern in cells but did not localize within pegs. At a later stage (48hpf), when mature microridges have formed, Krt17 invaded microridges, where it appeared to form filaments alongside F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Scoring the presence of keratin in protrusions of different lengths confirmed that the smallest protrusions, pegs, are largely devoid of keratin, and that keratin localization to microridges increased as they lengthened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Intriguingly, the average microridge length per cell, as measured by imaging the actin reporter Lifeact-mRuby, was slightly longer in Krt17-GFP over-expressing cells than in wild-type (WT) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These observations confirm that keratins are components of mature microridges and suggest that they may play a role at later stages of microridge morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Keratins are stable microridge components</title><p>Since IFs are the strongest and most stable of the cytoskeletal filaments, we wondered if they might contribute to microridge stability. To destabilize F-actin in microridges, we treated animals for 30 min with the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666, which causes the F-actin in microridges to disassemble and redistribute back into peg-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>).

To determine the localization of Evpl and Ppl in zebrafish periderm cells, we made Ppl-GFP, Evpl-GFP, and Evpl-mRuby BAC reporter fusions and imaged them in transient transgenic animals. These reporters were expressed in periderm cells throughout the animal and, as expected from genomic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cokus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), were apparently exclusive to periderm cells.

Similar to its behavior in mammalian cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DiColandrea et al., 2000</xref>), when expressed on its own, Evpl formed prominent aggregates, which were reduced when Ppl was co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with the possibility that the two plakin proteins dimerize or oligomerize.

The Ppl rod domain, which is required for dimerization in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalinin et al., 2004</xref>), localized variably to microridges. However, the Evpl rod domain did not localize to microridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that it is not sufficient for dimerization, and implying that the Ppl rod domain may weakly homodimerize, as previously suggested by biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalinin et al., 2004</xref>).

We, therefore, hypothesized that plakin-mediated recruitment of keratins into microridges stabilizes them, and that stabilization permits their elongation. To test our hypothesis, we first compared the stability of short, nascent microridges at early development (24hpf), when keratins are not found abundantly in microridges, to their stability at a later stage (48hpf), when microridges are longer and contain keratins. Over the course of 5 minute time-lapse movies, the microridge pattern changed more rapidly at 24hpf than at 48hpf, indicating that shorter microridges likely lacking keratins are less stable than longer keratin-containing microridges in older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

Of the three classes of cytoskeletal elements, only IFs were not previously thought to directly contribute to the morphogenesis of cellular protrusions. However, our findings suggest that keratin IFs play a key role in stabilizing and elongating microridge epithelial protrusions. Plakin proteins, which can bind to both actin and keratin filaments, are required and sufficient for microridge elongation, implying that this process involves the integration of two distinct cytoskeletal components. In contrast to other membrane protrusions, which grow and shrink as a single unit, microridges form from the coalescence of peg precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>). Dissecting plakin functions in microridge development uncovered an additional, cryptic step of morphogenesis—the elongation of short, dynamic microridges into long, stable microridges. Thus, microridge morphogenesis proceeds through at least three molecularly separable steps: (1) peg formation, (2) peg coalescence to form nascent microridges, and (3) microridge elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>Evpl and Ppl are first required for the coalescence of pegs into microridges, since periderm cells in <italic>evpl</italic> and <italic>ppl</italic> mutants retain pegs, but microridges are reduced or absent in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). A role for the plakins at this step of morphogenesis was also supported by the observation that Ppl formed longer and more continuous structures than F-actin during the process of peg coalescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). This observation suggests the intriguing possibility that the plakins, which can form oligomers on their own in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalinin et al., 2004</xref>), guide peg coalescence. Plakins lacking their N-terminal head domains failed to rescue peg coalescence in plakin mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>), indicating that this protein region is required at this early morphogenetic step. The plakin head domains have direct actin-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jefferson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalinin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sonnenberg and Liem, 2007</xref>) and also contain spectrin repeats and a SRC homology domain 3 (SH3) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jefferson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sonnenberg and Liem, 2007</xref>), which in other proteins can bind to actin interacting proteins, including the Arp2/3 activator WAVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cestra et al., 2005</xref>). Peg coalescence requires not only the plakin proteins, but also the Arp2/3 actin branch nucleating complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>) and actomyosin contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is likely that Evpl and Ppl contribute to peg coalescence by interacting directly with F-actin or actin regulators, helping to incorporate the actin bundles within pegs into the larger actin network of microridges.</p><p>The next step of microridge morphogenesis, the elongation of dynamic nascent microridges into mature microridges, was revealed by removing the C-terminal domains of Evpl and Ppl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>), and by mutating a few amino acids in Ppl required for IF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Without this keratin-binding domain, plakins could promote peg coalescence, but not full microridge elongation, indicating that Evpl and Ppl’s role in the earlier step is independent of keratin-binding. Consistent with this notion, we detected keratin in microridges only at later stages, when microridges were longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). We thus propose that Evpl and Ppl recruit keratins into microridges to instigate the subsequent elongation step of morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Evpl and Ppl were both necessary and sufficient for lengthening microridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and, remarkably, microridge length correlated tightly with plakin expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The fact that overexpressing Krt17 also lengthened microridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) lends support to the notion that plakins determine microridge length by recruiting keratins.</p><p>How do keratins promote microridge elongation? Our observation that short protrusions, which tend to lack keratin, are less stable than long microridges, which contain keratin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>), suggests that keratin stabilization of microridges might permit their elongation. Indeed, although plakin proteins lacking IF-binding domains enabled the formation of short, relatively unstable microridges, they never matured into long, stable structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>). Perhaps most compellingly, overexpressing Krt17 preserved the three-dimensional structure of microridges upon F-actin disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Together these observations indicate that keratins provide microridges with stability. Notably, the IF vimentin has also been hypothesized to play a role in the growth of invadopodia at a late morphogenetic step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schoumacher et al., 2010</xref>). Perhaps vimentin, similar to keratin in microridges, stabilizes invadopodia to allow them to elongate.</p><p>A role for IFs as microridge stabilizers is consistent with the fact that IFs are intrinsically stronger than the other cytoskeletal elements, and can preserve their form even as subunits are replaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colakoğlu and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Janmey et al., 1991</xref>). By contrast, actin filaments are more dynamic, consistent with their role in forming transient protrusions, like lamellipodia, filopodia, and dorsal ruffles. Microridges remodel but do not form and disassemble as rapidly as the aforementioned protrusions. In terms of stability, microridges may be more similar to stereocilia or microvilli, although each of these structures likely use different strategies to maintain their forms. The extreme stability of stereocilia reflects the fact that there is little F-actin turnover within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), whereas microvilli maintain their morphologies despite constant actin turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loomis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meenderink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tyska and Mooseker, 2002</xref>). Like microvilli, microridges constantly replace their F-actin scaffolds, since inhibiting Arp2/3 leads to disassembly of the microridge F-actin network within thirty minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>). However, in contrast to microvilli, microridges require keratins to preserve their forms in the face of F-actin turnover, perhaps because their more extended morphologies and less organized F-actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>) require additional stabilization. A landmark study comparing the three classes of cytoskeletal elements speculated that the mechanical ‘differences between F-actin and vimentin are optimal for the formation of a composite material with a range of properties that cannot be achieved by a single polymer network’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Janmey et al., 1991</xref>). By combining F-actin with IFs, microridges may achieve an optimal balance between plasticity and stability.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were grown at 28.5°C on a 14 hr/10 hr light/dark cycle.

An automated pipeline implemented in FIJI was used to analyze average microridge length per cell, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To analyze fluorescence intensity, all images were acquired with identical imaging parameters. Cells were outlined by hand, and the background was subtracted using the ‘rolling ball’ radius 50.0 pixels method. The area outside cells was cleared before the mean fluorescence intensity was measured.</p><p>To analyze overlap coefficients, cells were outlined by hand, brightness and contrast were automatically enhanced, and the area around cells was cleared. Lifeact-GFP images were blurred using the Smoothen function three times, and passed through a Laplacian morphological filter from the MorphoLibJ plugin, using the square element and a radius of 1, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Loon et al., 2020</xref>). Images were thresholded using the Triangle method for Lifeact-GFP images and the Percentile method for Krt17-GFP images. Thresholded images were analyzed to obtain overlap coefficients using the JACoP FIJI plugin.</p><p>Statistical analyses and graphs were generated with RStudio. Details of statistics for each experiment are listed in Figure Legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Sally Horne-Badovinac, Manish Butte, Jeff Rasmussen, Margot Quinlan, and members of the Sagasti lab for comments on the manuscript, Khaled Nassman for help with analysis, Son Giang and Linda Dong for excellent fish care, and Nat Prunet of the MCDB/BSCRC microscopy core for help with microscopy.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Michel Bagnat as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Chen-Hui Chen (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional new experiments, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus, the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation, and minor addition of data that we hope you might already have at hand.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript by Inaba et al. the authors investigate the role of intermediate filaments (Ifs) in the formation and growth of actin-based microridges in epithelial cells of the zebrafish epidermis. The identify a role for a complex of actin-interacting plakins evoplakin (Evpl) and periplakin (Ppl) in the initiation of microridges and their link to keratin in their elongation.</p><p>The authors present beautiful imaging data along with a compelling combination of genetics and cell biology to dissect the molecular processes underlying microridge morphogenesis. This work provides insight into a valuable new role for intermediate filaments and plakin family cytolinker proteins in cellular morphogenesis. The manuscript is well written and is easy to read.</p><p>Overall, the data supports well their conclusions and the beautiful imaging presented illustrate well their work. There are however some missing pieces of support data and areas were additional data and/or editing of the text is needed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors report new BAC transgenics for Evpl and Ppl that are used to characterize the role of these proteins in microridge morphogenesis.</p><p>1A) What is their pattern of expression? Whole mount pictures of live embryos and larvae and, if possible, cross sections of larvae should be provided as supplemental info.</p><p>1B) Are these BAC transgenes functional? i.e. do they rescue the mutants.</p><p>2) New mutant alleles for <italic>evpl</italic> and <italic>ppl</italic> are reported, but more basic info needs to be added.</p><p>2A) Please provide whole mount pictures of Mut/WT larvae, even if the phenotype is not obvious. Those can be in supplement and would be valuable for ZFIN.</p><p>2B) What happens to the transcripts? RT data is needed.</p><p>3) In Figure 3—figure supplement 2 the authors show images that suggest epidermal cells may show size and/or morphological differences compared to WT, please check if this is indeed the case and add results as part of the figure.</p><p>4) Dots in a dot plot should reflect independent replicates (e.g., different animals). One could argue that different cells from the same animal are not completely independent replicates. So, dependent (cells from the same animal) and independent samples (cells from different animals) are better not thrown together for graphing and statistical testing.

Whole mount pictures of live embryos and larvae and, if possible, cross sections of larvae should be provided as supplementary information.</p></disp-quote><p>We now clarify in the revised manuscript that we detected expression of these reporters exclusively in periderm cells, as expected from RNA-seq data. We have not made stable transgenic lines with these reporters--all the images of them in the manuscript are of transient transgenic animals. Since transient expression of BAC reporters is highly mosaic, whole mount pictures would not provide an accurate representation of their expression patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1B) Are these BAC transgenes functional? i.e. do they rescue the mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes--we now show that the BAC reporters rescue microridge development, which is evident from comparing BAC-expressing cells in mutants to neighboring non-BAC-expressing cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). We have not quantified this effect, but have extensively quantified rescue with tagged cDNAs elsewhere in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) New mutant alleles for evpl and ppl are reported, but more basic info needs to be added.</p><p>2A) Please provide whole mount pictures of Mut/WT larvae, even if the phenotype is not obvious. Those can be in supplement and would be valuable for ZFIN.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not note any differences between the morphologies of mutant and WT fish. We have added whole mount pictures of mutant and wild-type larvae and adults (Figure 4—figure supplement 7).</p><p>Although not requested by reviewers, in the spirit of including data that may be useful to other zebrafish researchers, we have also added morpholino data showing that morpholino knockdown phenocopies the genetic mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2B) What happens to the transcripts? RT data is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added RT-PCR data confirming that the genomic deletions are indeed reflected in the mutant transcripts (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Although we have not conducted rigorous quantitative RT-PCR, PCR products from mutants were notably weaker than from controls, indicating that the aberrant transcripts were likely destabilized by nonsense-mediated decay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3—figure supplement 2 the authors show images that suggest epidermal cells may show size and/or morphological differences compared to WT, please check if this is indeed the case and add results as part of the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>The supplementary figure noted by the reviewer was of epidermis covering adult scales. Since cells vary markedly in size and shape across the adult epidermis, determining if cell sizes or shapes are affected in mutant adults would require a broad survey of cells, which we felt could distract from the focus of the manuscript. However, to address the reviewer’s concern, we measured apical periderm cell areas in larvae (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). The distribution of cell areas was indistinguishable between WT, <italic>evpl-</italic>/-, and <italic>ppl-</italic>/- animals, indicating that defects in microridge morphogenesis in these mutants are not a consequence of broader defects in cell morphology. Interestingly, we found that cells in <italic>evpl-/-,ppl-/-</italic> double mutants were significantly smaller than in the other genotypes. Since this cell size defect does not correlate with microridge morphology, this phenotype likely reflects a distinct, redundant role for these proteins in inhibiting apical constriction. This observation is now noted in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Dots in a dot plot should reflect independent replicates (e.g., different animals). One could argue that different cells from the same animal are not completely independent replicates. So, dependent (cells from the same animal) and independent samples (cells from different animals) are better not thrown together for graphing and statistical testing. Alternatively, you may take the averages from each animal, dot those, and test them against each other between samples.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we averaged the cell microridge length averages for each animal and reconducted the analysis of microridge lengths in different genotypes (Figure 4B). This analysis yielded similar results to our initial analysis, which treated each cell separately. The only exception was that differences between <italic>ppl+/-</italic> and WT or <italic>evpl+/-</italic> animals were no longer significant, likely because of the substantially reduced sample size. The p-values for both analyses are now reported in Figure 4—figure supplement 3A-B. Since cell-to-cell variation in microridge length was greater than animal-to-animal variation (suggesting that microridge length is determined cell-autonomously), plotting the average of the averages would minimize the range of variation, so continue displaying the data from all cells, but, to allow readers to appreciate animal-to-animal variation in cell averages, we have also provided an alternative version of the plot of average microridge length/cell in each genotype, with color coded data points to indicate which cells were from the same animals (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A).</p><p>Finally, to provide an alternative analysis of these data similar to analyses in previous studies of microridges (Raman et al., 2016; Magre et al., 2019; van Loon et al., 2020), we now also show the distribution of the lengths of all protrusions in all cells pooled as violin plots, with accompanying statistical analyses (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, and Figure 4—figure supplement 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Does latrunculin has the same effect as CK666. A second actin inhibitor could strengthen the drug results.</p></disp-quote><p>Latrunculin indeed causes microridges to disassemble, but it also disassembles pegs, disrupts cell-cell junctions, makes cells and animals sick, and causes significant cell death in the skin. For these reasons it would not be an appropriate tool for these experiments. By contrast, the CK666 treatment regime we used did not notably affect cell-cell junctions or cell viability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Plakin-keratin interactions stabilize microridges”, related to Figure 7: the authors compare double mutant animals expressing full-length Evpl and Ppl to those expressing Evpl and Ppl head-rod domains, &quot;to test if Plakin-keratin binding plays a role in stabilization.&quot; While the videos are convincing as to the differences in dynamics, can the authors look directly at keratin localization (perhaps using the Krt17 BAC transgenic?) to determine whether the loss of the Plakin tail domains did indeed affect keratin localization in microridges? This would be a useful control.</p></disp-quote><p>This was an excellent suggestion. Unfortunately, although we made considerable efforts to carry out this experiment, we were unable to overcome technical challenges. To address this question we injected two separate plasmids encoding the head-rod domains of Evpl and Ppl, along with a Krt17 BAC reporter, into double mutants, and needed to identify cells expressing all three constructs simultaneously. Unfortunately, we were not able to achieve rescue with tripartite expression, even in controls expressing full-length Evpl and Ppl. This experiment should be possible when we have transgenic lines, which we plan to create for future studies. For now, we realize that our interpretation (i.e. protrusions in cells expressing the head-rod domains are less stable due to a deficit in keratin recruitment) is based on an assumption that these protrusions lack keratin. Although the suggested experiment would have been the definitive way to test this assumption, we believe that the rest of the data in our paper, and previous biochemical work with these proteins, make this a reasonable assumption.</p></body></sub-article></article>
