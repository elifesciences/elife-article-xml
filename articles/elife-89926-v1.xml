In the lateral line sensory system of the zebrafish, developing sensory axons reorganize their terminal arborization patterns to establish precise neural microcircuits around the mechanosensory hair cells. However, a quantitative understanding of the changes in the sensory arbor morphology and the regulators behind the microcircuit assembly remain enigmatic. Here, we report that Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) acts as an important mediator of these processes. Utilizing a semi-automated three-dimensional neurite tracing methodology and computational techniques, we have identified and quantitatively analyzed distinct topological features that shape the network in wild-type and Sema7A loss-of-function mutants. In contrast to those of wild-type animals, the sensory axons in Sema7A mutants display aberrant arborizations with disorganized network topology and diminished contacts to hair cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of a secreted form of Sema7A by non-hair cells induces chemotropic guidance of sensory axons. Our findings propose that Sema7A likely functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuromast</kwd><kwd>lateral line nerve</kwd><kwd>neural circuitry</kwd><kwd>semaphorin</kwd><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>arbor patterning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012007</institution-id><institution>Rockefeller University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Kavli Neural Systems Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dasgupta</surname><given-names>Agnik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hudspeth</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation Graduate Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1946429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reagor</surname><given-names>Caleb C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Semaphorin7A sculpts the collective arbor architecture of the lateral line nerve and facilitates neural contacts with the hair cells for synaptogenesis during neuromast development in the zebrafish.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pathfinding axons are directed to their appropriate synaptic targets by a variety of guidance cues. While approaching or traversing the target field, the growth cones of migrating axons encounter secreted or cell-surface-attached ligands and respond by steering toward or away from their sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lykissas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vaccaro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeroen Pasterkamp et al., 2003</xref>). Fine-grained control of these factors is critical for the establishment of proper neural circuitry.</p><p>The zebrafish’s lateral line provides a tractable in vivo system for exploring the mechanisms that guide the assembly of neural circuits in a peripheral nervous system. In particular, it is possible to detect individual hair cells and the sensory axons that innervate them throughout the first week of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagiel et al., 2008</xref>). The primary posterior lateral line on each side of the zebrafish’s tail consists of about seven neuromasts, which contain mechanoreceptive hair cells of opposing polarities—half sensitive to headward (rostrad) water motion and the complementary half to tailward (caudad) water motion—that cluster at their centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacobo et al., 2019</xref>). The sensory axons of the lateral-line nerve branch, arborize, and consolidate around the basolateral surfaces of the hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To aid in an animal’s swimming behavior, these hair cells sense water currents and relay signals to the brain through the sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Valera et al., 2021</xref>). The well-defined structure of the ramifications and synaptic contacts of the sensory axons highlight the need to determine the molecular signals behind the assembly of such precise microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dow et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of Semaphorin7A in the zebrafish’s lateral line.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A volumetric rendering of a PLL neuromast depicts the sensory axons (magenta) that branch from the lateral line nerve to arborize around the basolateral surface of the hair cell cluster (green).

Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data identified the <italic>semaphorin7a</italic> (<italic>sema7a</italic>) gene to be highly expressed in hair cells of that organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lush et al., 2019</xref>). Semaphorins are important regulators of axonal growth and target finding during the patterning of diverse neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carulli et al., 2021</xref>). The semaphorin family includes proteins that are secreted, transmembrane, and cell-surface-attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yazdani and Terman, 2006</xref>). Among these, Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) is the only molecule that is anchored to the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yazdani and Terman, 2006</xref>). Unlike many other semaphorins, which act as repulsive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Winter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coate et al., 2015</xref>), Sema7A is involved in promoting axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeroen Pasterkamp et al., 2003</xref>) and imparting directional signals by interacting with the integrin and plexin families of receptors residing on the pathfinding axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carcea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inoue et al., 2021</xref>). Sema7A likely occurs in vivo in both GPI-anchored and soluble forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morote-Garcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishide and Kumanogoh, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Köhler et al., 2020</xref>), and studies of neuronal explants confirm that both forms can induce directed axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeroen Pasterkamp et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the GPI anchor is cleaved by membrane-resident GPI-specific phospholipases (GPI-PLs) or matrix metalloproteases to release the Sema7A into the extracellular environment and thus regulate dynamic cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pham et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xie and Wang, 2017</xref>). Because these observations indicate that Sema7A might influence neuronal development both as a juxtracrine and as a diffusive signal, we investigated the role of Sema7A in sculpting a vertebrate peripheral sensory organ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sema7A expression and localization in hair cells</title><p>The zebrafish genome contains a single <italic>sema7a</italic> gene that produces two transcripts. One transcript encodes Sema7A-GPI, a full-length, GPI-linked, cell-surface-attached protein. The second transcript yields Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>, a protein with a truncated C-terminus, which we conjecture is secreted into the local environment. Each transcript encodes an N-terminal signal sequence and a single copy of the conserved Sema domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yazdani and Terman, 2006</xref>). To detect the presence of both <italic>sema7a</italic> transcripts in the hair cells of the lateral-line neuromasts, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to capture the labeled hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek et al., 2022</xref>) and isolated total RNA. Using primers that flank the regions encoding the conserved Sema domain and the distinct C-termini of the two transcripts, we performed reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) to identify both the membrane-anchored and the secreted transcript in developing larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Single-cell RNA sequencing data also have shown that the GPI-linked <italic>sema7a</italic> transcript is particularly enriched in the immature and mature hair cells of the neuromast during early larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lush et al., 2019</xref>), a period when sensory axons of the posterior lateral line contact hair cells and form synapses with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dow et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we have observed Sema7A to be specifically localized in both mature and immature hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>).</p><p>As neuromasts mature, the contacts between sensory axons and hair cells increase in number, become stabilized, and establish synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dow et al., 2015</xref>). Because Sema7A can modulate axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeroen Pasterkamp et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carcea et al., 2014</xref>) and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>), we wondered whether the level of Sema7A also changes during neuromast development. Upon quantifying the average intensity of Sema7A, we found similar expression in rostrally and caudally polarized hair cells of neuromasts at 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 days post fertilization (dpf). The average Sema7A intensity increased significantly over this period in both rostrally and caudally polarized hair cells. At 1.5 dpf, the neuromasts harbor primarily immature hair cells that make minimal contacts with sensory axons and do not form stable association with axonal terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dow et al., 2015</xref>). At this stage the average Sema7A intensity in hair cells remained low. By 2–4 dpf the hair cells mature to form stable contacts and well-defined synapses with the sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pujol-Martí et al., 2014</xref>). The average Sema7A intensity in hair cells at each of these stages rose to levels that significantly exceeded those of 1.5 dpf neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This rise in the amount of Sema7A during neuromast maturation supports a role for Sema7A in the guidance of sensory axons and their interaction with hair cells.</p><p>We additionally demonstrated an anisotropic distribution of Sema7A along the apicobasal axis of each hair cell. As neuromasts develop through 2, 3, and 4 dpf, Sema7A remained highly enriched in the subapical region of the hair cell, the site of the Golgi network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This localization suggests that Sema7A—like other proteins of the semaphorin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Wit et al., 2005</xref>)—is directed to the plasmalemma through Golgi-mediated vesicular trafficking. Using the transgenic line <italic>Tg(cldnb:lyn-mScarlet</italic>) that expresses membrane-tethered mScarlet in all cells of the neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dalle Nogare et al., 2020</xref>), we detected Sema7A at the plasma membrane and potentially in vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F–I</xref>). While Sema7A maintained a high level in the subapical region, the protein increasingly accumulated at the base of the hair cell: the Sema7A level at the hair cell base was low at 2 dpf, but increased sharply by 3 dpf and 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J</xref>). During this period the hair cells increase in number and mature, whereas the associated sensory axons arborize to contact multiple hair cells and form robust synaptic boutons at their bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pujol-Martí et al., 2014</xref>). Does progressive basal accumulation of Sema7A facilitate association of sensory axon terminals to the hair cell? To address this question, we utilized doubly labeled transgenic fish <italic>Tg(myo6b:actb1-EGFP;neurod1:tdTomato</italic>) that marked the hair cells and the sensory axons of the posterior lateral line with distinct fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). We quantified the average Sema7A intensity and the accumulation of sensory arbors, measured by td-Tomato intensity, at the bases of the hair cells. Across developmental stages, the basal association of the sensory arbors showed a positive correlation with Sema7A accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The progressive enrichment of Sema7A at the hair cell base with the sensory axons suggests that Sema7A acts as a mediator of contacts between sensory axons and hair cells.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-89926-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Sema7A is enriched at the hair cell base and sensory-axon interface.</title><p>A through-focus scan of a 4 dpf control neuromast depicts the hair cells (green) that are innervated by the sensory axons (magenta) at their basolateral surfaces where the Sema7A protein (orange) is highly enriched.

a neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dow et al., 2018</xref>). Pathfinding of sensory axons around the hair cell cluster results in the formation of axonal fascicles that form numerous loops and bare terminals, which determine the microcircuit topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dow et al., 2018</xref>). To optimally surround and contact the hair cell cluster, do the sensory arbors prefer to adopt one topological feature over the other? To address this question, we measured the correlation between the number of bare terminals and the number of loops across individuals, developmental stages, and genotypes. In both 2 dpf and 3 dpf larvae, the distributions remained highly scattered across individuals and genotypes. However, by 4 dpf in the control larvae the arbor network contained either a high number of loops with a low number of bare terminals or a high number of bare terminals with a low number of loops. This result suggests that the stereotypical circuit topology observed in the mature organ may emerge through transition of individual arbors from forming bare terminals to forming closed loops encircling topological holes. That we did not observe a similar transition in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts of the same age suggests that Sema7A may direct the switch between these two distinct topological features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Measurement of the contour length of both bare terminals and loops additionally revealed that across developmental stages in control larvae the sensory arbors followed a three-step process to choose the appropriate topological feature: arbors shorter than 10 µm always formed bare terminals; arbors between 10 µm and 30 µm began to switch between features, with arbors longer than 20 µm strongly preferring to form loops; and arbors longer than 30 µm always formed loops. These results imply that the switch between bare terminals and loops is partly dependent on the length of the arbors. However, this characteristic topological preference was significantly perturbed in the <italic>sema7a<sup>–/–</sup></italic> larvae across developmental stages, as many of the sensory arbors longer than 30 µm remained as bare terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, in 4 dpf control neuromasts the majority of the loops contained four nodes and utilized 30–40 µm of arbors to form closed cycles. These conserved topological attributes were significantly perturbed in the <italic>sema7a<sup>–/–</sup></italic> larvae of same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These findings indicate that Sema7A tightly monitors the sensory arbor loop formation, including the preferred loop length and number of nodes per loop, to properly surround and contact the hair cell cluster.</p><p>As observed previously, bare terminals in control neuromasts project transverse to the organ and linger nearby, often curving back to form new loops and contact the hair cell cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref>). To analyze the propensity of the bare terminals to curl backward, we measured their total curvatures, defined as the sum of the curvature at each point along the length of an arbor. Henceforth, we address the total curvature as the curvature of a bare terminal. We classified the bare terminals in two categories: high-curvature arbors with curled morphology and curvature greater than <italic>π</italic>/6 (30 degrees); and low-curvature arbors with linear morphology and curvature less than <italic>π</italic> /6. In control neuromasts 44.8% of arbors had low curvature compared to 56.4% in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts at 4 dpf. Concomitantly, 55.2% of arbors had high curvature in control neuromasts compared to 43.6% in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts at 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These observations further confirm our hypothesis that a Sema7A-mediated attractive cue is involved in orienting bare neural arbors toward the hair cell cluster to potentially form loops.</p><p>In summary, we propose that Sema7A mediates four key aspects of the topology of the arborization network: (1) the node degree complexity along the organ’s axis; (2) the transition of arbors from bare terminals to loops; (3) the preference for forming loops containing four nodes with 30–40 µm of arbors; and (4) the preference of bare terminals to adopt higher curvature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> is a sufficient chemoattractive cue for sensory axon guidance</title><p>Because genetic inactivation of the <italic>sema7a</italic> gene disrupts both signaling modalities of the cognate protein, we could not assess the specific activity of the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue in guiding lateral-line sensory axons. To independently verify the potential role of that isoform, we therefore expressed the secreted variant ectopically and investigated the resultant arborization patterns.</p><p>Analysis of the microcircuit connectivity of the neuromasts has demonstrated bare sensory-axonal terminals in the perisynaptic compartments, where they do not contact the hair cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dow et al., 2018</xref>). We speculate that these bare terminals are attracted by a Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue. To test this hypothesis, we ectopically expressed Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> protein tagged with the fluorophore mKate2, then analyzed its effect on the morphology of sensory arbors. Fertilized one-cell embryos were injected with the <italic>hsp70:sema7a<sup>sec</sup>-mKate2</italic> plasmid and raised to 3 dpf. Larvae expressing the transgenesis marker—the lens-specific red fluorescent protein mCherry—were heat-shocked, incubated to allow expression, and subsequently mounted for live imaging. In these larvae, a random mosaic of cells—often embryonic muscle progenitors in the dermomyotome or mature myofibers—expressed the exogenous Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>-mKate2 protein. We selected only those neuromasts in which a single mosaic ectopic integration had occurred near the network of sensory arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). In all 22 such cases, we observed robust axonal projections from the sensory arbor network toward the ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cells. When the exogenous <italic>sema7a<sup>sec</sup></italic> integration occurred in embryonic muscle progenitor cells, which reside in a superficial layer external to the muscle fibers and adjacent to the larval skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>), the projections were able to form direct contacts with them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>). But more often, when mature myofibers expressed the exogenous Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> deep in the myotome, the axonal projections approached those targets but failed to contact them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">8</xref>). This behavior likely arose because other components in the myotomal niche—including the fibrous epimysium, other myofibers, myoblasts, and immature myotubes whose surroundings are permeable to diverse diffusive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keenan and Currie, 2019</xref>)—physically obstructed direct interaction of the extended neurites with the ectopically expressing myofibers. All 18 of the injected but not heat-shocked control larvae did not express ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>, and we did not observe aberrant projections from the sensory arbor network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue provides neural guidance in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagrammatic overview depicts the generation of a transgenic animal that expresses the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> protein ectopically under the control of a thermally inducible promoter.

We quantified these parameters from 18 of the 22 mosaic integration events; in the remainder the extended axonal projections–although following the ectopic source–reentered the posterior lateral-line nerve so that identification of the axon terminals was not possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–A&quot;</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). The projection paths of the extended axons reached from 27.1 µm to 142.5 µm while following the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cues. When we plotted the projection path length against the source-path length, we observed a nearly perfect correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This result signifies that irrespective of the location of the ectopic source–whether proximal or distal to the sensory arbor network–the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cue sufficed to attract axonal terminals from the sensory arbor. Furthermore, the low average projection-proximity length of 3.5±0.7 µm (mean ± SEM) indicated that the extended projection terminals remained either in contact (8 of 18) or in the vicinity (10 of 18) of the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Neural GPI-anchored proteins can act as regulators of various synaptic-adhesion pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Um and Ko, 2017</xref>). In the mouse olfactory system, GPI-anchored Sema7A is enriched in olfactory sensory axons and mediates sustained interaction with the dendrites of mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb to establish synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>). In the developing mouse brain–particularly in Purkinje cells–GPI-anchored Sema7A instead regulates the elimination of synapses onto climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uesaka et al., 2014</xref>). The role of anchored Sema7A in regulating synaptic architecture can thus vary according to the cell type and developmental stage. Our demonstration that Sema7A is necessary to consolidate the contact between sensory axons and hair cells during neuromast development suggests a possible role in regulating synaptic structure.</p><p>Proper synaptogenesis requires the correct spatial organization of the presynaptic and postsynaptic apparatus at the apposition of two cells. At the interface between hair cells and sensory axons, the synaptic network involves two scaffolding proteins in particular: ribeye, a major constituent of the presynaptic ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sheets et al., 2014</xref>), and membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK), a conserved group of proteins that organize postsynaptic densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oliva et al., 2012</xref>). Utilizing these scaffolding proteins as markers, we investigated the impact of the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutation on synapse formation. To analyze the distribution of presynaptic densities–immunolabeled with an antibody against the ribeye-associated presynaptic constituent C-terminal binding protein (CTBP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sheets et al., 2014</xref>)–we counted the number and measured the area of CTBP punctae from multiple neuromasts at several stages of neuromast development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). The CTBP punctae in each hair cell ranged from zero to seven across developmental stages. In the zebrafish’s posterior lateral line, the formation of presynaptic ribbons is an intrinsic property of the hair cells that does not require contact with lateral-line sensory axons. However, sustained contact with the sensory axon influences the maintenance and stability of ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suli et al., 2016</xref>). As neuromasts matured from 2 dpf to 4 dpf, we identified similar distribution patterns with a characteristic increase in the number of CTBP punctae in both control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This result implies that the formation of new presynaptic ribbons is not perturbed in the mutants, even though there are on average fewer CTBP punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Measurement of the areas of CTBP punctae also showed similar distributions in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>) but the average area of presynaptic densities was reduced in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In the lateral-line neuromast of the zebrafish, we have identified Sema7A as an essential cue that regulates the interaction between hair cells and sensory axons. We have discovered two isoforms of the <italic>sema7a</italic> gene in vivo: the chemoattractive diffusible form is sufficient to guide the sensory arbors toward their target, whereas the membrane-attached form likely participates in sculpting accurate neural circuitry to facilitate contact-mediated formation and maintenance of synapses. Our results suggest a potential mechanism for hair cell innervation in which a local Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue likely consolidates the sensory arbors at the hair cell cluster and the membrane-anchored Sema7A-GPI molecule guides microcircuit topology and synapse assembly. Establishing the exact function of each of the <italic>sema7a</italic> isoforms will necessitate studies that include transcript-specific targeted mutagenesis and rescue of the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant phenotype by each of the transcript variants.</p><p>The role of Sema7A in regulating diverse topological features of the arborization network suggests that microcircuits of control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts have important functional differences. Loss of Sema7A disrupts the hierarchical organization of the node-degree distribution along the organ’s axis, as well as the preference towards forming loops containing four nodes with 30–40 µm of arbors. What benefit does the network gain from surrounding the hair cell cluster with closed loops instead of bare terminals? The network may actively form loops to contribute to the neuromast’s overall structure and function, or else emerge as a consequence of the arbors navigating the intervening spaces between the hair cells and support cells. The preferential localization of the postsynaptic aggregates in the loops and an enrichment near the nodes of the arbor network suggest that the precise patterning of the network—with characteristic looping behaviors—is not merely a byproduct of neuromast architecture, but may contribute to the network’s ability to gather sensory inputs through properly placed postsynaptic aggregates and to faithfully transmit sensory information to higher processing centers in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Valera et al., 2021</xref>). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the potential role of these topological features in regulating the distribution of synaptic bodies and optimizing robust neural transmission in the lateral-line microcircuit.</p><p>Recent studies have begun to dissect the molecular mechanisms of semaphorin signaling in axonal navigation. In explants derived from the murine olfactory bulb, Sema7A interacts directly with integrinβ1 to trigger downstream signaling effectors involving focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are critical regulators of the cytoskeletal network during axonal pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeroen Pasterkamp et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Myers and Gomez, 2011</xref>). Moreover, the interaction between Sema7A and its receptor plexinC1 activates the rac1-cdc42-PAK pathway, which alters the actin network to promote axonal guidance and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O’Donnell et al., 2009</xref>). We speculate that lateral-line sensory axons utilize similar mechanisms to sense and respond to Sema7A in the establishment of microcircuits with hair cells.</p><p>During early development of the posterior lateral line, the growth cones of sensory axons intimately associate with the prosensory primordium that deposits neuromasts along the lateral surface of the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilmour et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Metcalfe, 1985</xref>). The growth of the sensory fibers with the primordium is regulated by diverse neurotrophic factors expressed in the primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gasanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuster et al., 2010</xref>). Impairing brain-derived or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factors and their receptors perturbs directed axonal motility and innervation of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gasanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuster et al., 2010</xref>). Lateral-line hair cells are particularly enriched in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Germanà et al., 2010</xref>) and other chemotropic cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Because the sensory axons of <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants reliably branch from the lateral-line nerve to reach hair cell clusters, these chemoattractive factors might compensate in part for the absence of Sema7A function. Although sensory axons are strict selectors of hair cell polarity and form synapses accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagiel et al., 2008</xref>), diverse chemoattractant cues including Sema7A occur uniformly between hair cell polarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Germanà et al., 2010</xref>). It seems likely that unbiased attractive signals bring sensory arbors toward hair cells, after which polarity-specific molecules on hair cell surfaces dictate the final association between axonal terminal and hair cells.

Specifically, the inclusion of the heat shock controls and FM labeling to show hair cell mechanotransduction were crucial to interpretation of the results. However, there are still concerns about the specificity of the results. My primary concern is if the change in axon patterning is specifically due to loss of Sema7a in the mutant hair cells. These animals are morphologically very abnormal and, in the rebuttal, the authors state that hair cell number is reduced. This is not quantified in the manuscript and should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have included the data in the manuscript in lines 137-139, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, and in the source data for Figure 2 and Figure 2-figure supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If there is not a function for Sema7a in hair cells themselves, why is the number reduced?</p></disp-quote><p>The sema7a-/- homozygous mutants are not viable and they die by 6 dpf. The loss of Sema7A protein produce other developmental defects including brain edema and a curved body axis. We believe a slight but not significant decrease in hair cell number may arise from a minute developmental delay in the morphogenesis of the neuromast. We have accordingly quantified our data at three distinct developmental stages-at 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf-and have incorporated them in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, FM data should be quantified and presented in animals without a transgene in the same excitation/emission spectra for clearer interpretation of the staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the intensities of labeling with FM 4-64 styryl dye from the control and the sema7a-/- mutant larvae and incorporated the data in lines 139-146, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, and in source data for Figure 2 and Figure 2-figure supplements. We Kept the transgenes to concurrently show the arborization phenotype, hair cell morphology, and the FM 4-64 incorporation between the genotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Rescue analysis using the myo6d promotor would allow the authors to ensure that the axon deficits can be rescued by putting Sema7a back into the sensory hair cells. Transient transgenesis could be useful for this approach and would not require the creation of a stable line. This could be done with both forms of Sema7a allowing the true assessment of whether or not the secreted and GPI-anchored form have disparate functions as claimed in lines 418424.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we recognize the importance of the rescue of the sema7a-/- mutant phenotype with the sema7asec and the sema7aGPI transcripts, it is not possible for us to perform that experiment at the moment, for the first author will leave the lab next week.

Based on the speed of axon outgrowth and the time necessary for transcription and translation after heat shock induction of the transgene, it is unclear to me how the axon growth defects could occur in the timeline provided. Imaging two hours after the start of the heat shock is very rapid and speaks to either an indirect effect of the transgenesis on the axon growth or a leaky promotor/induction paradigm. It is possible I am just misunderstanding the set up but, from what I could gather, the imaging is being done 2 hrs after the start of the heat shock. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The axons of the zebrafish posterior lateral line migrate relatively fast. The pioneering axons migrate at around 120 μm/hour (Sato et. al., 2010) and the follower axons migrate at almost 30-80 μm/hour (Sato et. al., 2010). The heat-shock promoter that we have utilized, hsp70l, is highly effective in inducing gene expression and subsequent protein formation within 30 to 60 mins. We believe an hour of heat shock and an hour of incubation post heat shock is sufficient to induce directed axon migration to a distance that spans from 27 μm to 140 μm.</p><p>We strongly believe that the directed arborization of the sensory axons towards the Sema7Asec source is not due to an indirect effect of transgenesis or leaky promoter induction, as in all 18 of the injected but not heat-shocked control larvae we did not observe ectopic Sema7Asec expression, and no aberrant projection was formed from the sensory arbor network. We highlight this observation in lines 297-299 and in Figure 4E.</p><p>Sato et. al., 2010: Single-cell analysis of somatotopic map formation in the zebrafish lateral line system.

I ask only because there is a lot of immune-signal outside of the hair cells and I am curious whether that is secreted or might come from other cell types. For neurons and supporting cells, simply demonstrating absence of Sema7a overall would suffice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have utilized the transgenic line Tg(myo6b:actb1-EGFP) that expresses the fluorophore GFP specifically in the hair cells of the neuromast. Unfortunately, we do not possess a transgenic line that reliably and specifically labels the support cells in the neuromast. Hence, in our sorting experiment the GFP-negative cells that are collected from the trunk segments of the larvae contain all the non-hair cells including epidermal cells, neuronal cells, and immune cells etc. Such a mixture of varied cellular identity may not serve as a reliable negative control.</p><p>In Figure 7, we have plotted the normalized expression values of the sema7a gene in the neuromast. The plot clearly depicts that the source of Sema7A is the young and the mature hair cells, not the support cells. We further confirm this observation by</p><p>immunostaining where the Sema7A signal is highly restricted to the hair cells and not in any other cell in the neuromast (Figure 1E). Immunostaining further demonstrates that the lateral line sensory arbors also do not produce the Sema7A protein (Figure 1H; Video 1).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are diverse immune cells, including macrophages in and around the neuromast. These macrophages are dynamic and possess highly ramified structure (Denans et. al., 2022). In all our Sema7A immunostainings, we never observed structures that resemble macrophages. Albeit we cannot confirm that Sema7A is not expressed in a distant immune cell, but we highly doubt that signal coming from immune cells is impacting hair cell innervation by the sensory arbors during homeostatic development.</p><p>Denans et. al., 2022: Nature Communications volume 13, Article number: 5356 (2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 1, Supplement 4, I do not see the immunogen labeled in blue.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the figure legend.

However, there is no direct evidence that the membrane-bound form is responsible for local effects. It is formally possible still that the phenotypes are a result of dual roles for the secreted form. It is clear that another manuscript is forthcoming that will expand on the role of the transmembrane form, but for this manuscript, the authors should make firm conclusions only about the data presented herein.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.
