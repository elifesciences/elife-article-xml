Previously, a forward genetic screen for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> host factors identified erythrocyte CD55 as essential for invasion, but its specific role and how it interfaces with the other factors that mediate this complex process are unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 editing, antibody-based inhibition, and live cell imaging, here we show that CD55 is specifically required for parasite internalization. Pre-invasion kinetics, erythrocyte deformability, and echinocytosis were not influenced by CD55, but entry was inhibited when CD55 was blocked or absent. Visualization of parasites attached to CD55-null erythrocytes points to a role for CD55 in stability and/or progression of the moving junction. Our findings demonstrate that CD55 acts after discharge of the parasite’s rhoptry organelles, and plays a unique role relative to all other invasion receptors. As the requirement for CD55 is strain-transcendent, these results suggest that CD55 or its interacting partners may hold potential as therapeutic targets for malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>erythrocytes</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2HL13718601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Egan</surname><given-names>Elizabeth S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32DK098132-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shakya</surname><given-names>Bikash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Egan</surname><given-names>Elizabeth S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007491</institution-id><institution>Donald E. and Delia B.

One of the world’s major public health problems, malaria causes an estimated 216 million infections and ~445,000 deaths annually, primarily among young children and pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">WHO, 2018</xref>). <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has a complex life cycle involving stages in the human and mosquito, but disease only occurs during the blood stage, when parasites infect and replicate in human red blood cells (RBCs). As <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is an obligate intracellular parasite, understanding the molecular determinants of its developmental cycle within RBCs may lead to new therapies. For example, a number of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins that play key roles during erythrocyte invasion have shown promise as vaccine candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ord et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sack et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>). Since natural genetic variation in red cells can influence innate susceptibility to malaria, host erythrocyte factors may also hold potential as therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor and Fairhurst, 2014</xref>). The identification and study of such factors, however, has been severely limited by the intractability of mature RBCs, which lack a nucleus and DNA.</p><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion of erythrocytes involves a series of coordinated events that unfold rapidly over the course of ~2 min. These events can be divided into three phases: pre-invasion, active invasion, and echinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilson and Crabb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>). The process is initiated with the rupture of a ‘mother’ parasite, termed a schizont, which releases up to 32 daughter merozoites. During the pre-invasion phase, a free merozoite makes initial contact with the red cell, stimulating shallow deformation of the host cell plasma membrane. Next, the merozoite reorients so its apically-localized organelles are abutting the cell surface. Reorientation is associated with significant membrane deformation and involves interactions between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ligands such as the erythrocyte binding antigen (EBA) and reticulocyte binding-like homologues (Rh) family proteins, and receptors on the red cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilson and Crabb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riglar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>). Several ligand and receptor pairs have been shown to act at this stage, often in a strain-specific manner (e.g. PfEBA-175 and GYPA; PfEBA-181 and GYPB PfEBA-140 and GYPC; and PfRh4 and CR1), but experimental data suggest their roles in apical reorientation and host cell deformation are largely functionally redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tham et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The only receptor-ligand interaction known to be essential during the pre-invasion phase involves basigin and PfRH5, which exists in a complex with PfRipr and CyRPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crosnier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dreyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reddy et al., 2015</xref>). Binding of the PfRH5 complex to basigin is required for discharge of the rhoptry organelles into the invaded cell and is associated with a calcium spike, potentially due to formation of a pore at the erythrocyte surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Volz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>). Blocking the interaction between PfRH5 and basigin with specific antibodies prevents invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crosnier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Discharge of the rhoptry organelles heralds the start of active invasion. Among the proteins injected from the rhoptries are those of the RON complex (RON 2, RON 4 and RON 5), which together form a receptor for binding by the PfAMA1 protein localized on the merozoite surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richard et al., 2010</xref>). The interaction between PfAMA1 and the RON complex forms a moving junction between the parasite and host cell that is believed to be entirely parasite-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besteiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besteiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harvey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koch and Baum, 2016</xref>). The moving junction provides an anchoring point for the merozoite to actively invade using its own actinomyosin motor; inhibiting the interaction between PfAMA1 and RON prevents invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Srinivasan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yap et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>As invasion proceeds, a parasitophorous vacuole is formed from components of the host cell membrane and rhoptries, yielding a protective niche for development of the new daughter parasite. The third phase, echinocytosis, is a transient period of cell dehydration and shrinkage observed after invasion; current evidence suggests it is triggered by discharge of the rhoptry contents, prior to and independent of active invasion. Echinocytosis is inhibited by reagents that prevent rhoptry discharge, such as antibodies targeting basigin or PfRH5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Most host factors known to play a role in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion have been identified based on their ability to bind to established invasion ligands or from studies of rare natural mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bei and Duraisingh, 2012</xref>). Given the inherent intractability of mature RBCs, which lack a nucleus and DNA, the use of genetic approaches to identify and characterize malaria host factors presents a logistical challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egan, 2018</xref>). Recently, an shRNA-based forward genetic screen using cultured red cells (cRBCs) derived ex-vivo from primary human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) identified erythrocyte CD55 (aka DAF) as a critical host factor for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2015</xref>). A 70 kD extracellular glycoprotein anchored to the red cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage, CD55 is broadly distributed in different tissues and secretions, including blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooling, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Storry et al., 2010</xref>). On erythrocytes, CD55 acts as a complement regulatory protein to prevent complement-mediated damage. On epithelial cells, it has been shown to act as a receptor for Group B coxsackie virus and Dr+ <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooling, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coyne and Bergelson, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion efficiency was reduced by ~50% in CD55-knockdown cRBCs, and natural CD55-null erythrocytes from two rare donors with the Inab phenotype were resistant to invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the requirement for CD55 was strain-transcendent, suggesting that it plays a conserved role in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion. However, the precise function of CD55 during invasion and how it may interface with established ligands or receptors is unknown.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the functional role of CD55 during <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, antibody-based inhibition and live cell microscopy. We found that CD55 plays a critical role during <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion of mature erythrocytes, where it is specifically required for parasite internalization. As a host factor that acts after discharge of the parasite’s rhoptry contents, CD55 plays a unique role relative to other receptors required for invasion, providing a crucial link between the ligand-receptor interactions important for adhesion and deformation and effective internalization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of CD55-null red blood cells using CRISPR-Cas9</title><p>Previously, we observed that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoites from several laboratory-adapted strains and clinical isolates displayed impaired invasion into cryopreserved CD55-null RBCs from two rare patients with the Inab phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2015</xref>). To study the requirement for CD55 in an isogenic background, we sought to generate CD55-null cRBCs from HSPCs using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing by co-delivering single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and Cas9 in a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), a method that has been used previously to generate null mutants in primary human CD34 + cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hendel et al., 2015</xref>). We designed two chemically modified sgRNAs targeting the 5’ end of <italic>CD55</italic>, and delivered them individually or together into primary human CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs via nucleofection, in complex with recombinant Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As a control, isogenic CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs from the same donor were nucleofected with Cas9 alone. After inducing the cells to differentiate down the erythroid lineage for 18 days, we observed a high percentage of CD55-null cRBCs in the RNP-transfected populations; a single sgRNA targeting exon one resulted in ~70% CD55-null cRBCs, while the combination of two sgRNAs targeting exons 1 and 2 increased the knockout efficiency to ~90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The cells proliferated ~10,000 fold and the enucleation rate was &gt;90% in both the CD55-null cells and wild-type controls, demonstrating that the progenitors differentiated efficiently and that CD55 is not required for this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While invasion into the CD55-CRISPR cRBCs was impaired relative to the control cells, it was only reduced by ~40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This subtle phenotype was reminiscent of the results for CD55-knockdown cRBCs, and differed from the strong invasion phenotype observed in erythrocytes from two CD55-null patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2015</xref>). Since cRBCs are less mature than erythrocytes from peripheral blood, we hypothesized that the relatively mild invasion phenotype observed in the CD55-null cRBCs may be explained by the overall maturation state of the ex vivo cultures on day 18.</p><p>To begin to determine whether cell maturity modifies the requirement for CD55 during <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion, we assessed the surface expression of CD71 in the cRBCs, which is highly expressed on erythroblasts and young reticulocytes, but quickly disappears as reticulocytes mature into erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Flow cytometry on day 17 demonstrated that approximately 50% of the enucleated cRBCs were CD71-positive and ~50% were CD71 negative, indicating a mix of cell maturity in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This was further validated using a reticulocyte stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), which showed that day 17 cells were ~50% reticulocytes and 50% erythrocytes. A timecourse over seven additional days of terminal differentiation revealed a progressive loss of CD71 expression, consistent with a change in the population structure to one dominated by erythrocytes rather than reticulocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To isolate a more homogeneous population of mature cRBCs for invasion assays, we differentiated the cRBCs for 21–22 days and then used anti-CD71 antibody-immobilized magnetic beads to deplete CD71-positive cells and enrich for CD71-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Using these highly mature cells, invasion assays with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain 3D7 showed a ~75% reduction in invasion into the CD55-CRISPR cRBCs as compared to isogenic control cRBCs in three biological replicate experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Since our CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy yielded a mixed population of ~90% CD55-null and 10% CD55-positive cells, we suspected that the residual invasion observed in the ‘CD55-CRISPR’ population was attributable to wild-type cells. This was confirmed by immunofluorescence assays showing that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion was restricted to the cells expressing CD55: the parasitemia in the minority, CD55-positive cells in the population was 22.5%, whereas less than 0.5% of the CD55-null cRBCs were infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). These results demonstrate that CD55 is critical for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion of fully differentiated cRBCs, mimicking the prior observations with natural CD55-null erythrocytes, and validating CD55 as an essential host factor for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion.

Prior studies of RAP1 have demonstrated that it localizes to the rhoptry bulb as punctate staining in merozoites prior to rhoptry secretion, but after rhoptry secretion it can be detected on the merozoite surface or in/on an attached RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howard et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riglar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schofield et al., 1986</xref>). When free merozoites were allowed to attach to RBCs in the presence of cyt-D, we observed RAP1 staining in a donut or C-shape for merozoites attached to both the WT and CD55-null cells, indicating that rhoptry discharge had occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In rare instances, we observed RAP1 staining associated with the RBC, as a ‘whorl’ in WT cells with an attached merozoite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, row 2), and spreading across the RBC surface in CD55-null cells with attached merozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, row 4). Spreading of RAP1 across the RBC surface has been previously described for merozoites attached in the presence of the R1 peptide, and has been postulated to reflect insufficient sealing of the tight junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riglar et al., 2011</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that CD55 acts downstream of the interaction between RH5 and basigin, facilitating a step of invasion that occurs after release of the rhoptry organelles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>CD55 may be required for progression of the moving junction</title><p>The moving junction that forms between the cell membranes of an invading merozoite and the erythrocyte during internalization involves interactions between PfAMA1, which derives from the micronemes, and the PfRON complex, which localizes to the rhoptries. To investigate a possible role for CD55 in formation of the moving junction, we sought to visualize PfAMA1 and PfRON4 as merozoites attempted to invade CD55-null (Inab) or wild-type erythrocytes in the presence of cyt-D. Using a flow cytometry-based attachment assay, we observed a ~ 50% reduction in the number of merozoites attached to CD55-null erythrocytes as compared to WT cells 90 min after addition of late-stage schizonts, as has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2015</xref>). Using confocal microscopy, we found that PfAMA1 and PfRON4 were frequently co-localized at the cellular interface for merozoites attached to WT control cells (~85%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). In comparison, for merozoites attached to CD55-null erythrocytes, PfAMA1 and PfRON4 were co-localized at the cellular interface in only ~40% of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). For those merozoites in which PfAMA1 and PfRON4 were colocalized at the interface, we observed that approximately half of the WT control cells had an indentation at the point of merozoite contact, suggesting the merozoites were mid-invasion, whereas this was never observed for the CD55-null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Together, these results support a model where CD55 is required for stability or progression of the moving junction, acting downstream of junction formation. Consistent with this model, in the flow cytometry-based attachment assay we observed distinct attachment phenotypes for merozoites in the presence of the R1 peptide, which inhibits junction formation, versus merozoites interacting with CD55-null RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In the presence of R1, we detected almost no merozoites attached to WT cells 90 min after adding late-stage schizonts, whereas attachment to CD55-null cells was only reduced by ~40% at the same timepoint. Together with the immunofluorescence results, these findings suggest that CD55 acts after the moving junction is formed, and instead plays a role in its stability and/or progression.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Invasion fails to progress in the absence of CD55.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Attachment efficiency of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoites to CD55-null versus control RBCs in the presence of cyt-D, as measured by flow cytometry 90 min after the addition of synchronized schizonts (N = 3, n = 3).

Previously, an RNAi-based forward genetic screen in cultured red cells derived from HSPCs identified two new candidate host factors for invasion: CD44 and CD55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we used a combination of genetics and inhibitory antibodies to determine the precise steps of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion during which CD55 functions. We have demonstrated that CD55 is specifically required for merozoite internalization, and plays a unique role relative to the other host receptors known to act during invasion.</p><p>Prior work has shown that the efficiency of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection is reduced by ~50% in CD55-deficient cRBCs where expression is downregulated using shRNAs. While experiments using erythrocytes from two rare, CD55-null donors suggested that CD55 is essential for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion, this has never been demonstrated genetically. A major roadblock to such experiments has been the technical challenges associated with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in primary human hematopoietic stem cells, including cytotoxicity from nucleic acids and low rates of transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hendel et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we showed for the first time that fully mature, CD55-null cRBCs can be generated efficiently from primary human HSPCs using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. Using isogenic wild-type and mutant cells, we have demonstrated that CD55-null cRBCs are resistant to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion, confirming that CD55 is an essential host factor for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of generating truly mature erythrocytes ex-vivo for the study of malaria host factors, as these cells closely mimic the target cell for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in the human bloodstream. Our approach involving the co-delivery of two chemically modified sgRNAs together with Cas9 as a ribonucleoprotein complex has been shown to be an effective strategy for CRISPR-based gene knockout in primary HSPCs and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hendel et al., 2015</xref>). This method obviates the toxicity associated with plasmid delivery, minimizes off-target activity, and improves sgRNA stability. Combined with our ex vivo erythropoiesis culture system, this method can efficiently generate terminally differentiated, enucleated, CD71-low red cells with a high rate of gene knock out that can be used to study host genetic determinants for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in an isogenic background.</p><p>We observed that the reliance of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> on CD55 for invasion increased significantly as enucleated cRBCs matured into erythrocytes, likely reflecting the substantial changes in protein abundance that occur during terminal maturation of human red cells, including for proteins known to act as receptors, such as basigin and CR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gautier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). The efficiency of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion is further influenced by the deformability of the red cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tiffert et al., 2005</xref>), a biophysical property that also changes as red cell progenitors proceed through enucleation and final maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giarratana et al., 2005</xref>). As clinical malaria is primarily a disease of mature, peripheral blood erythrocytes, our results showing that terminal red cell maturation modifies the requirement for CD55 during invasion highlights the potential drawbacks of using cell lines to study host factors for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. While considered erythroid in nature, immortalized cell lines such as JK-1, EJ and BEL-A have low rates of enucleation and terminal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Satchwell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scully et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting their utility for genetic experiments on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion may be limited by incomplete phenotypes.</p><p>Antibodies targeting a variety of specific host receptors for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> have been shown to have invasion inhibitory activity, including those against GYPA, CR1, and basigin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crosnier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pasvol et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spadafora et al., 2010</xref>). While we found that individual monoclonal antibodies against three distinct SCR domains of CD55 had no discernable effect on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> growth, in combination they had potent dose-dependent inhibitory activity, suggesting CD55’s role in invasion is not restricted to a specific SCR domain. Our demonstration that both the polyclonal anti-CD55 antibody and anti-CD55 Fab fragments can inhibit <italic>P. falciparum</italic> growth aligns with the results from our genetic studies, and corroborates the conclusion that CD55 is a critical host factor for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. In contrast to CR1, where antibodies are only inhibitory in the absence of red cell sialic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spadafora et al., 2010</xref>), anti-CD55 antibody blocked both sialic-acid-dependent and -independent invasion. This finding is consistent with prior studies showing that the requirement for CD55 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion is strain-transcendent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2015</xref>), and implies a model where CD55 acts distinctly from CR1 and the other alternative, strain-specific receptors.</p><p>Given the inherent limitations associated with studying invasion on a population scale in longer term assays, live microscopy has been increasingly employed to visualize individual <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion events in real time. Analysis of the morphology and kinetics of discrete invasion steps in the context of blocking antibodies or soluble proteins has contributed to a model describing the molecular events that occur during invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Volz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>). Our live microscopy experiments have added a new dimension to this model by revealing that merozoite internalization is inhibited in the presence of anti-CD55 antibody or with CD55-null erythrocytes, demonstrating for the first time that CD55 is specifically required for parasite entry. Where and how does CD55 act in relation to the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ligands and erythrocyte receptors known to function during invasion? We observed no impact of the anti-CD55 antibody on the number of merozoite contacts with the RBC, pre-invasion kinetics, or merozoite-induced erythrocyte deformability, findings that were validated using CD55-null erythrocytes from a rare donor. These results suggest that CD55 functions distinctly from the ‘alternative’ receptors required for apical reorientation and red cell deformation (e.g. glycophorins and CR1), as blocking interactions between these receptors and their ligands strongly inhibits merozoite-induced deformability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Echinocytosis is a phenomenon of transient red cell shrinkage that commences soon after merozoite internalization. Current evidence suggests that it is stimulated by changes in the red cell cytoplasm that occur once an irreversibly attached merozoite discharges its rhoptry contents into the erythrocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Volz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>). Echinocytosis is inhibited by antibodies that block the interaction between PfRH5 and basigin, implying that this interaction is necessary for rhoptry discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>). These blocking antibodies also inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux into the erythrocyte, possibly reflecting formation of a pore at the cellular interface when PfRH5 and basigin interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Volz et al., 2016</xref>). The glycophorins and CR1 act early in the pre-invasion phase during apical reorientation, and blocking their interactions with ligands using genetics, enzyme treatments, or antibody blockade also inhibits echinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Volz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, echinocytosis is not prevented by treatment with the actin polymerization inhibitor cyt-D or reagents that block the interaction of PfAMA1 and the RON complex. Together, these findings demonstrate that the stimulus for echinocytosis occurs after the interaction of PfRH5 with basigin, but before establishment of the moving junction.</p><p>Our observation that anti-CD55 antibody had no effect on the efficiency of merozoite-induced echinocytosis suggests that CD55 acts after discharge of the parasite’s rhoptry organelles. Consistent with this idea, we found that merozoites could stimulate CD55-null RBCs to undergo echinocytosis, which should not happen if rhoptry discharge were prevented. Since the overall rate of echinocytosis was highly variable in the previously cryopreserved WT and CD55-null RBCs used in this study and the anti-CD55 antibody only partially inhibits invasion, we also sought to obtain direct evidence for rhoptry secretion in the absence of CD55. Using immunofluorescence assays, we showed that the rhoptry protein RAP1 localized in a pattern consistent with secreted protein in merozoites attached to both WT and CD55-null RBCs, indicating that rhoptry discharge had occurred. Together, these findings demonstrate that CD55 acts after discharge of the rhoptries, highlighting its role as distinct from basigin and the other established host receptors for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion.</p><p>Merozoite internalization requires the formation of a moving junction between the cell membranes of the invading merozoite and the erythrocyte that moves posteriorly down the parasite as it invades. The current model of the moving junction involves interactions between PfAMA1 expressed on the merozoite surface and the PfRON complex inserted into the red cell membrane, independent of any host-encoded receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besteiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riglar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Srinivasan et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to its key role in internalization, the moving junction has also been proposed to be important for formation of the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yap et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Could CD55 function as a component of the moving junction during invasion? We observed that PfAMA1 and PfRON4 were almost always co-localized at the cellular interface for merozoites attempting to invade WT cells, whereas this was significantly less common for merozoites attempting to invade CD55-null erythrocytes. For the minority of merozoites that attached to CD55-null erythrocytes and had PfAMA1 co-localized with RON at the cellular interface, none were observed to have progressed past early invasion, unlike those attached to WT cells. Together, these findings support a model in which CD55 is required for progression of the moving junction, either directly or indirectly. Consistent with this model, irreversible attachment of merozoites to RBCs was completely inhibited in the presence of the junction-blocking R1 peptide, but only moderately inhibited in the absence of CD55, suggesting that CD55 is required not for formation of the moving junction, but for its stability or progression. Additionally, in our immunofluorescence assays of RAP1 localization, we observed a few instances where RAP1 was spread across the RBC surface only in CD55-null RBCs, a phenotype that has been described previously for merozoites attached to RBCs in the presence of R1, and has been speculated to reflect impaired sealing of the moving junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riglar et al., 2011</xref>). Future studies involving higher resolution microscopy such as cryo-EM will be necessary to better characterize how absence of CD55 may impact the moving junction or architecture of the PV after invasion.</p><p>Our findings showing that the function of CD55 during invasion can be narrowed to the internalization step are consistent with a model where CD55 acts distinctly from the other known receptors for invasion, potentially by interacting with a specific parasite ligand. As there is a precedent for CD55 on epithelial cells to act as a pathogen receptor that transmits signals to the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coyne and Bergelson, 2006</xref>), it is tantalizing to hypothesize that this molecule functions similarly in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion of erythrocytes. Ultimately, biochemical identification of parasite and erythrocyte interaction partners of CD55 will yield important additional insights into the molecular function of CD55 during merozoite internalization. Given the complexity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion and the unique and essential role of CD55 relative to other established receptors, targeting its activity or interaction partners in novel intervention strategies may enhance the effectiveness of future therapies or vaccines for malaria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>P. falciparum</italic> culture, invasion assays, and growth inhibition assays</title><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain 3D7, a laboratory-adapted strain obtained from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (Melbourne, Australia) was routinely grown in human erythrocytes (Stanford Blood Center) at 2% hematocrit in complete RPMI-1640 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 50 mg/L hypoxanthine, 2.42 mM sodium bicarbonate and 0.5% Albumax (Invitrogen) at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 1% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Parasite invasion assays were performed using synchronized late-stage schizont parasites isolated using a MACS magnet (Miltenyi) and added at 1.0–1.5% initial parasitemia to the cultured red blood cells (cRBCs) or peripheral red blood cells (pRBCs) at 0.3% hematocrit.

After nucleofection, cells were transferred to 6 ml fresh cPIMDM and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 in air.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Enrichment of CD71-negative cRBCs</title><p>Fully differentiated cRBCs were washed in degassed and chilled bead buffer (PBS + 0.5% bovine serum albumin +2 mM EDTA), resuspended in the same buffer (45 µl for 6 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells), and incubated the anti-CD71 antibody-immoblized beads (Miltenyi) (10 µl beads for 6 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells) at 4°C for 15 min. The cells were washed in 1 ml of bead buffer and passed through an LS magnetic column (Miltenyi) and washed three times with 2 ml of the buffer. The flow through containing CD71- negative cells was collected, washed with cRPMI medium and used for invasion assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Detection of cell surface proteins by flow cytometry</title><p>Expression of RBC surface proteins was measured in control or knockout cRBCs by flow cytometry. A total of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cRBCs were washed two times with PBS/0.3% BSA and incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies or fluorochrome conjugated antibodies at 4°C for 1 hr. Antibodies used: anti-CD55 (BRIC 216-PE, IBGRL; 1:50) and anti-CD71-PE (Miltenyi; 1:20). After incubation, the cells were washed two times in PBS/0.3% BSA, followed by flow cytometry analysis on a MACSQuant flow cytometer (Miltenyi).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence assays (IFA)</title><p>IFAs were performed as previously described, with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tonkin et al., 2004</xref>). For IFAs of CD55-CRISPR cRBCs infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, cells were fixed in 4.0% paraformaldehyde and 0.0015% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and blocked for 1 hr in 3% BSA/PBS. The cells were incubated with anti-CD55 antibody (BRIC 216-PE from IBGRL) at 1:50 concentration for 1 hr at 4°C. Cells were mounted Fluoromount-G with DAPI mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Services) and the fluorescent images were captured with a 60X objective on a Keyence BZ-X700 fluorescence microscope. For IFAs of merozoites attached to pRBCs using anti-AMA1 and anti-RON4, samples were prepared as in the attachment assays (see below), and 60 µl of the samples were fixed in the fixative containing 4.0% Paraformaldehyde and 0.015% Glutaraldehyde for 20 min, washed twice in PBS, and allowed to settle onto a Poly-L-Lysine coated coverslip (Corning). The samples were then incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and incubated in 0.1 mg/ml of NaBH4/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Following a wash in PBS, the cells were blocked overnight in fresh PBS/3.0% BSA at room temperature. Samples for RAP1 IFAs were prepared in a similar manner, except these assays utilized free merozoites prepared from E64-treated schizonts by syringe lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle et al., 2010</xref>), which were incubated with previously cryopreserved WT or CD55-null RBCs at 37°C for ~10 min. Primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-PfAMA1 1F9 (1:200) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coley et al., 2001</xref>), rabbit polyclonal anti-PfRON4 (1:200) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richard et al., 2010</xref>), or mouse monoclonal anti-PfRAP1 209.3 (1:500) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howell et al., 2005</xref>) were diluted in blocking buffer applied to cells for 2 hr at room temperature. Following three washes, the cells were incubated in corresponding secondary antibodies at 1:500 dilution: Alexa Fluor 555 (goat anti-rabbit IgG) and Alexa Fluor 488 (goat anti-mouse IgG) for 1 hr at room temperature. The cells were washed in PBS supplemented with 0.1 ng/µl of DAPI (Thermofisher) and mounted in Vectashield anti-fade mounting medium. Imaging for RAP1 IFAs was performed using a Keyence BZ-X700 All-in-One Fluorescence microscope and the image analysis was performed with Fiji. Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope and the image analysis was performed using Fiji/imageJ (Version 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52i). Apical orientation was defined as PfAMA1 and PfRON4 co-localization at the cellular interface, and non-apical orientation was defined as PfAMA1 and PfRON4 not co-localized at the cellular interface. Merozoites were defined as being mid-invasion if AMA1 and RON4 were co-localized at cellular interface and the merozoite appeared to protrude into the RBC, creating an indentation. Scoring for apical versus non-apical orientation and early versus mid-invasion was performed in a blinded manner by two investigators.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Anti-CD55 polyclonal antibody generation</title><p>A CD55 cDNA (Asp 35-Ser 353) was cloned into a modified pTT5 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raymond et al., 2011</xref>), whose expression cassette consists of eGFP fused to a puromycin resistance gene followed by a 2A skip peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Funston et al., 2008</xref>) and a BiP signal peptide, and the resulting plasmid was verified by sequencing. 1.8L of 293-6E cells grown in Freestyle 293 media (Invitrogen) to 0.8 × 10e6 cells/ml were transiently transfected with linear PEI (Polysciences) with 397 ug DNA at a 1:3 DNA:PEI ratio. TN1 tryptone (Organotechnie) was added to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) one day after transfection, and cells were grown for an additional 5 days. Cells were spun down and discarded, and the following reagents were added to the harvested media (final concentration listed): 20 mM Tris pH8, 350 mM NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole pH8, 0.2 mM NiCl2. 6 ml GE IMAC sepharose six beads, and the sample was rocked at 4C for 1 hr. The sample was then poured into a glass column, and washed with 50 ml of TBS (10 mM Tris pH8, 500 mM NaCl) with imidazole at the following concentrations sequentially: 5 mM, 10 mM, 50 mM, and 250 mM. Nickel was stripped from the column with 10 ml 100 mM EDTA. The majority of the CD55-8xHis protein eluted in the 250 mM Imidazole fraction, with a smaller amount of equal purity in the 50 mM imadazole fraction. These were dialyzed separately into PBS pH 7.4 overnight at 4C, concentrated to 10 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra 15 with 30 kDa cutoff (Millipore), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80C until further use. A total of 2.5 mg of CD55-8xHis was used for three immunizations of two New Zealand white-SPF rabbits by New England Peptide. Approximately 50 ml of recovered antiserum was used for negative affinity purification with an 8X HIS column, and subsequently purified with a protein A column. Approximately 15 ml of purified IgG at 1.209 mg/ml concentration was purified and stored at −80C until further use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Live cell imaging</title><p>Schizont stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain 3D7 parasites at 4–5% parasitemia and 2% hematocrit were tightly synchronized with 2 µM Compound two to prevent schizont rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2013</xref>). After ~4–6 hr incubation, they were washed three times and allowed to recover in fresh cRPMI for 45–90 min at 37° C. After recovery, anti-CD55 antibody or IgG isotype control was added to the cells at final antibody concentration of 400 µg/ml and 1% hematocrit. In experiments involving previously cryopreserved CD55-null pRBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>) or control WT pRBCs, late stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> schizonts were isolated using a MACS magnet, synchronized with Compound 2, and then mixed with the pRBCs at 4–5% parasitemia and 1% hematocrit. The assays were loaded into a 20 mm diameter Hybriwell sealing system (Grace Bio-labs) customized for live cell imaging. Rupture of the parasite-infected red blood cells and subsequent invasion events were video recorded using a 60X objective Keyence BZ-X700 live microscopy setup at 37°C supplied with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 1% O<sub>2</sub> gaseous environment. Kinetics and morphology of distinct steps of invasion in the video were measured by using ImageJ (ImageJ 1.50i) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, the following events were quantified in each video: (a) Contacts between merozoites and RBCs that culminated in successful invasion; (b) successful invasion that resulted echinocytosis; (c) contacts between merozoites and RBCs that could not proceed beyond initial contact/deformation; (d) RBCs contacted before successful invasion; (e) period of pre-invasion (initial contact to end of deformation); (f) during of internalization; (g) time to the onset of echinocytosis; (h) efficiency and degree of merozoite-induced deformation of the target RBC using a four-point deformation scale (0,1,2,3); (i) number of egress events. For the live cell imaging of echinocytosis, 1 µM Cytochalasin D was added to inhibit merozoite internalization. Assays were conducted at 1% hematocrit and 4–5% parasitemia as above, except for those comparing echinocytosis in WT versus CD55-null RBCs, in which parasites were synchronized with ML-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2017</xref>), 35 mm fluorodishes were used rather than Hybriwells, and assays were conducted in room air at 37°C. For each echinocytosis assay video, the following events were quantified: (a) Egress events; (b) merozoite-RBC contacts lasting at least 30 s; (c) merozoite-induced echinocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Merozoite attachment assays</title><p>Purified schizonts were added at 12.0% parasitemia to previously cryopreserved CD55-null pRBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>) or control WT pRBCs at 1.0% hematocrit in the presence of 1 µM Cytochalasin D, 50 U/ml Heparin or none in a final volume of 100 ul per well in a 96 well plate. Experiments assessing the effect of the R1 inhibitory peptide were performed under similar conditions, except synchronized schizonts were added at 20% parasitemia to RBCs at 0.5% hematocrit, and R1 was added at 1 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riglar et al., 2011</xref>). The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 90 min and the schizonts were allowed to rupture. To quantify merozoite attachment by flow cytometry, the samples were fixed in 2% Glutaraldehyde and 0.116M sucrose in PBS, washed in PBS/0.3% BSA, and stained with SYBR Green one nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen) at 1:2000 dilution in PBS/0.3% BSA for 20 min, followed by flow cytometry analysis on a MACSQuant flow cytometer (Miltenyi). The assays were performed two to three times with two to three technical replicates. The merozoite attachment rates to control or CD55-null RBCs were calculated as the percent of RBCs with an attached merozoite, and were normalized for background attachment in the presence of heparin. The merozoite attachment efficiency was calculated for each genetic background in each biological replicate by normalizing to the mean of the attachment rates in WT RBCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Stastistical analyses were performed and the graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 8 Version 8.0.2 (159) for macOS.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study that combines CRISPR-Cas9 editing, antibody-based inhibition and live cell imaging to investigate the role of host CD55 during <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion of erythrocytes. The targeting of CD55 for invasion by malaria parasites has been established previously and there is a rare CD55-null blood group that was utilized to show the parasites require the protein for invasion. Here, the authors generated CD55-deficient erythrocytes using CRISPR-Cas9 in erythroid precursors, and confirm the important role of CD55 during invasion by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> using erythrocytes differentiated in culture. The authors then show that anti-CD55 antibodies inhibit <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion of normal red blood cells, but have no effect on erythrocyte deformation or echinocytosis. Based on these data, the authors conclude that CD55 acts after discharge of the parasite's rhoptries and plays a unique role relative to all other invasion receptors, possibly for progression of the moving junction during internalization. The manuscript is well written and the work well performed. The study provides important novel insights into the process of host cell invasion by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and is of broad interest, and the developed methodology will be useful for the study of malaria but also in general erythrocyte biology. However, the conclusion that CD55 acts downstream of rhoptry release is only based on indirect evidence, and additional data are required to clarify the role of CD55 relative to other known receptors and during merozoite attachment.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A crucial question that needs to be addressed is whether CD55 acts upstream of AMA1/RON complex mediated tight junction formation or downstream by preventing the tight junction from moving over the merozoite surface. The conclusion that CD55 acts downstream of rhoptry discharge and junction formation is an important claim and actually the principal novel finding of the study. This conclusion is based mainly on indirect evidence showing that anti-CD55 antibodies do not inhibit echinocytosis, which results from Rh5-Basigin interaction. The authors should provide direct evidence that rhoptry discharge is not altered by antibodies or in the absence of CD55. For example, the authors could use anti-RAP1 antibodies to visualize the progression of invasion/formation of the junction as it is much clearer than AMA1 since secreted RAP1 can be visualized, depending on the orientation, as either a larger &quot;donut&quot; encircling the smaller RON4 donut or a sort of C-shaped form wrapping around the invading merozoite and stopping at the tight junction as defined by the RON4 signal. In cytD treated merozoites, RAP1 can also be seen as whorls inside the host cell. This would help the authors to determine if the tight junction is sealed as if it isn't, the RAP1 signal will not be released inside the RBC but instead will be seen on the merozoite and/or the RBC surface as previously published using the R1 peptide. This would thus provide clear evidence as to whether CD55 is involved at a step upstream of downstream.</p><p>In Figure 7A, erythrocyte binding assays indicate that the merozoites do not bind as well to CD55-null erythrocytes as merozoites on WT erythrocytes. To add some precision to this work, an additional two treatments are suggested where WT erythrocytes are treated with anti-basigin IgG and AMA1-blocking R1 peptide. It would be anticipated, that basigin blocked merozoites would attach the most weakly with tight junction blocking R1 peptide binding more strongly. It is expected that if CD55 functions upstream of the AMA1/RON tight junction complex then merozoites should bind similarly to R1 treated WT erythrocytes as to CD55-null erythrocytes. If merozoites bind to CD55-null erythrocytes better than R1 treated merozoites then CD55 may function downstream of the tight junction. The authors may also consider using super-resolution microscopy to document whether merozoites can form a moving junction in CD55-null cells.</p><p>2. The role of CD55 in merozoite attachment is not clear. In their previous study, Egan and colleagues reported that CD55-null erythrocytes were refractory to invasion by all isolates of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> because parasites failed to attach properly to the erythrocyte surface. Here, the authors make the same observation with CD55-null erythrocytes (line 415-418). This is in contradiction with the conclusion that CD55 is not involved during the pre-invasion phase, drawn from experiments with antibodies. This discrepancy needs to be addressed. In particular, Figure 3B and 3C show the invasion efficiency per contact or per egress, but it would be useful to directly quantify attachment in these experiments and show the number of contacts established in the absence or presence of the antibody.</p><p>Line 291-296, the authors conclude that blocking CD55 does not impact pre-invasion kinetics, at least not for the merozoites that manage to invade in the presence of antibody. Since the antibody only partially inhibits (40-50%), this statement is problematic. What about the subset of merozoites that ultimately did not invade? In fig3D, if CD55 plays a role in internalization, why is there no increase in the length of the pre-invasion time? Along the same line, the AMA1-RON4 localization data (fig7) show that AMA1 and RON4 are less commonly found at the erythrocyte interface. Based on these observations the authors propose that CD55 could play a role for progression of the moving junction. However, the graph in Figure 7B rather suggests a defect in merozoite reorientation, which is not consistent with the main conclusion of the paper.</p><p>3. As the anti-CD55 only partially block invasion, it would be more convincing to document that echinocytosis and rhoptry discharge also occur in CD55-null or CD55-knockout cells as efficiently as in WT cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Erythrocyte CD55 mediates the internalization of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasites&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They included additional data showing that CD55 is not required for rhoptry discharge based on echinocytosis in CD55-null cells (new Figure 6D) and RAP1 IFA (new Figure 6E). They also provide evidence that tight merozoite attachment to RBCs is not abrogated in CD55-deficient RBCs, in contrary to WT cells in the presence of R1 peptide (new Figure 7E), pointing at a possible role downstream of junction formation.</p><p>This is a very nice piece of work. However there are a few points that could be addressed in the text to further improve the manuscript.</p><p>The RAP1 results point to a defect in sealing of the junction, therefore the authors cannot exclude a role of CD55 in stability of the junction rather than progression.

A crucial question that needs to be addressed is whether CD55 acts upstream of AMA1/RON complex mediated tight junction formation or downstream by preventing the tight junction from moving over the merozoite surface. The conclusion that CD55 acts downstream of rhoptry discharge and junction formation is an important claim and actually the principal novel finding of the study. This conclusion is based mainly on indirect evidence showing that anti-CD55 antibodies do not inhibit echinocytosis, which results from Rh5-Basigin interaction. The authors should provide direct evidence that rhoptry discharge is not altered by antibodies or in the absence of CD55. For example, the authors could use anti-RAP1 antibodies to visualize the progression of invasion/formation of the junction as it is much clearer than AMA1 since secreted RAP1 can be visualized, depending on the orientation, as either a larger &quot;donut&quot; encircling the smaller RON4 donut or a sort of C-shaped form wrapping around the invading merozoite and stopping at the tight junction as defined by the RON4 signal. In cytD treated merozoites, RAP1 can also be seen as whorls inside the host cell. This would help the authors to determine if the tight junction is sealed as if it isn't, the RAP1 signal will not be released inside the RBC but instead will be seen on the merozoite and/or the RBC surface as previously published using the R1 peptide. This would thus provide clear evidence as to whether CD55 is involved at a step upstream of downstream.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion to obtain direct evidence of rhoptry discharge to help support and further characterize our conclusion that CD55 acts downstream of rhoptry discharge. To address this recommendation, we performed immunofluorescence assays of free <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoites incubated with WT or CD55-null erythrocytes in the presence of cyt-D to determine localization of the rhoptry protein PfRAP1.</p><p>We observed that merozoites attached to RBCs in the presence of cyt-D demonstrated RAP1 staining on the exterior of the merozoite in a donut shape consistent with secreted RAP1, regardless of the genetic background of the RBCs (Figure 6E). These results provide direct evidence that rhoptry discharge occurs in merozoites attached to both WT and CD55-null cells, supporting the main conclusion of the paper that CD55 acts after rhoptry discharge. In the WT RBCs, we identified a few cases where RAP1 staining could be detected inside the cell as a whorl (Figure 6E, 2nd row). In the CD55-null cells, we identified a few cases where RAP1 staining could be seen spreading along the erythrocyte surface (Figure 6E, bottom row), reminiscent of what has been reported for RAP1 localization in the presence of the inhibitory peptide R1 (Riglar et al., 2011). These results suggest that the tight junction may not properly seal in the absence of CD55. Given the rarity of both the whorl and the spreading RAP1 in our data, more work will need to be done to fully understand these phenotypes. However, our results provide additional support for our conclusion that CD55 acts downstream of rhoptry discharge, and we feel that the manuscript is strengthened by inclusion of these data. We have included new text in the results and discussion to describe these findings (Lines 370-387, 531-539, and 562-566).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7A, erythrocyte binding assays indicate that the merozoites do not bind as well to CD55-null erythrocytes as merozoites on WT erythrocytes. To add some precision to this work, an additional two treatments are suggested where WT erythrocytes are treated with anti-basigin IgG and AMA1-blocking R1 peptide. It would be anticipated, that basigin blocked merozoites would attach the most weakly with tight junction blocking R1 peptide binding more strongly. It is expected that if CD55 functions upstream of the AMA1/RON tight junction complex then merozoites should bind similarly to R1 treated WT erythrocytes as to CD55-null erythrocytes. If merozoites bind to CD55-null erythrocytes better than R1 treated merozoites then CD55 may function downstream of the tight junction.</p></disp-quote><p>While Figure 7A shows an attachment phenotype in the CD55-null cells, it is important to note that these attachment assays measured long-term attachment because they assessed the percentage of RBCs with attached merozoites in the presence of cyt-D ~90 minutes after addition of late-stage schizonts, and thus reflect a mixed population of attached merozoites, some of which egressed up to ~90 minutes prior. Our previously published timecourse of merozoite attachment to WT versus CD55-null cells in the presence of cyt-D showed that an early timepoint after adding schizonts (30 minutes), merozoites are found attached to WT and CD55-null RBCs with similar efficiency, but that over time fewer remain attached to the CD55-null RBCs, leading to the phenotype at 90 min seen in Figure 7A (Egan et al., 2015). These results suggest that CD55 is not required for initial attachment, but rather for long-term (junction-mediated) attachment (see also response to #3). We have revised text in ~ lines 395-398 to clarify the results shown in 7A.</p><p>Previous work has shown that the R1 peptide inhibits junction-mediated attachment of merozoites to WT RBCs by preventing the interaction between AMA1 and RON and formation of the moving junction (Riglar et al., 2011). To directly address the question of CD55’s role in long-term attachment relative to formation of the moving junction, we followed the reviewers’ suggestion to quantify merozoite attachment to WT RBCs in the presence or absence of R1 peptide, compared to CD55-null RBCs. Similar to the attachment assays shown in Figure 7A, these assays measured the percent of RBCs with attached merozoites in the presence of cyt-D ~90 minutes after addition of synchronized, mature schizonts, and thus reflect long-term attachment. The results show that in the presence of R1 peptide, almost no RBCs had an attached merozoite at 90 minutes (Figure 7E). In contrast, attachment to the CD55-null RBCs was only reduced by ~ 40% compared to WT RBCs (consistent with Figure 7A and (Egan et al., 2015)). Together, these findings support a model where R1 disrupts formation of the moving junction, leading to a strong phenotype for long-term attachment, whereas CD55 likely acts downstream of junction formation, resulting in a more moderate phenotype for long-term attachment in the CD55-null RBCs. We have added text to the results (Lines 415-422) and discussion (559-562) to describe these findings and how they advance our understanding of the role of CD55 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors may also consider using super-resolution microscopy to document whether merozoites can form a moving junction in CD55-null cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that super-resolution microscopy would be a powerful approach to document whether merozoites can form a moving junction in CD55-null cells, and plan to pursue this in future experiments focused on specifically understanding the role of CD55 for stability or progression of the moving junction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The role of CD55 in merozoite attachment is not clear. In their previous study, Egan and colleagues reported that CD55-null erythrocytes were refractory to invasion by all isolates of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> because parasites failed to attach properly to the erythrocyte surface. Here, the authors make the same observation with CD55-null erythrocytes (line 415-418). This is in contradiction with the conclusion that CD55 is not involved during the pre-invasion phase, drawn from experiments with antibodies. This discrepancy needs to be addressed. In particular, Figure 3B and 3C show the invasion efficiency per contact or per egress, but it would be useful to directly quantify attachment in these experiments and show the number of contacts established in the absence or presence of the antibody.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity around our understanding of the role of CD55 in merozoite attachment, and have sought to clarify our thinking here and in the manuscript. This issue is also addressed above in our second response.</p><p>Attachment of merozoites to RBCs can be viewed as a three-step process: initial contact, apical reorientation, and junction-mediated (long-term) attachment. In our previous work, we reported a time course of attachment to CD55-null or WT RBCs in the presence of cyt-D in order to measure both initial contact and long-term attachment. We observed that initially attachment was similar to WT or CD55-null cells, but over time there was reduced merozoite attachment to the CD55-null RBCs compared to WT RBCs. Since these experiments were performed using a population of late-stage schizonts that rupture over the course of the assay, we interpret this result as indicating that initial attachment is not affected by CD55, but that long-term (junction-mediated) attachment requires CD55. The role of CD55 in long-term attachment is further addressed in our second response above, and in Figure 7.</p><p>In the live microscopy experiments reported in this manuscript, we directly observed and quantified contacts between merozoites and RBCs in the presence of anti-CD55 or control antibody for the first time, defined as contact lasting at least three frames (&gt;0.5 seconds). As suggested by the reviewers, in the revised manuscript we have included a figure panel showing the number of merozoite-RBC contacts per egress in the presence or absence of anti-CD55 antibody (new Figure 3D). The results show that the number of merozoite-RBC contacts per egress was similar in the presence of control antibody versus anti-CD55 antibody, indicating that blocking CD55 does not impact the ability of merozoites to attach to RBCs. This has also been added to the text in lines 259-263.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 291-296, the authors conclude that blocking CD55 does not impact pre-invasion kinetics, at least not for the merozoites that manage to invade in the presence of antibody. Since the antibody only partially inhibits (40-50%), this statement is problematic. What about the subset of merozoites that ultimately did not invade?</p></disp-quote><p>While we can only quantify the pre-invasion time for merozoites that ultimately invade, we feel that it is important to include these data showing that the merozoites that ultimately invaded in the presence of anti-CD55 antibody did not have a prolonged pre-invasion time. For the subset of merozoites that ultimately fail to invade in the presence of anti-CD55 antibody, we show that they do not have any defects in establishing contact with the RBC (Figure 3D), in mediating RBC deformation (Figure 4), nor in eliciting echinocytosis (Figure 6C). We observed similar results for merozoites attempting to invade CD55-null cells (Figure 5 B-D). Together, these findings support our model that CD55 acts during internalization and does not play a role in the pre-invasion period.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In fig3D, if CD55 plays a role in internalization, why is there no increase in the length of the pre-invasion time?</p></disp-quote><p>The pre-invasion time encompasses the period between initial contact and the start of internalization (Figure 3A). The data on pre-invasion time shown in Figure 3E only includes merozoites that ultimately invaded, as it is not possible to quantify the pre-invasion time for merozoites that never invade. While we do not know why some merozoites are able to invade in the presence of anti-CD55 antibody, these data show that they do not have an extended pre-invasion time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same line, the AMA1-RON4 localization data (fig7) show that AMA1 and RON4 are less commonly found at the erythrocyte interface. Based on these observations the authors propose that CD55 could play a role for progression of the moving junction. However, the graph in Figure 7B rather suggests a defect in merozoite reorientation, which is not consistent with the main conclusion of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 7B we show that in merozoites attached to CD55-null RBCs, AMA1 and RON4 were less commonly co-localized at the cellular interface compared to merozoites attached to WT RBCs. In the context of our live imaging results which show normal levels of merozoite-induced RBC deformation for both CD55-null RBCs and in the presence of anti-CD55 antibody as well as our attachment assay results, we interpret these data to indicate that the moving junction is less stable in CD55-null versus WT RBCs. The new data in Figure 7E help to distinguish between CD55 acting before or after tight junction formation; since long-term attachment was completely inhibited in the presence of R1 but only partially inhibited in CD55-null cells, these data support the model that the interaction between AMA1 and RON is required for tight junction formation, whereas CD55 is likely required for stability or progression of the tight junction. An unstable moving junction in CD55-null cells would be predicted to alter the merozoite’s apical orientation over the long-term. We have enhanced the Discussion section on this topic (Lines 551-569).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. As the anti-CD55 only partially block invasion, it would be more convincing to document that echinocytosis and rhoptry discharge also occur in CD55-null or CD55-knockout cells as efficiently as in WT cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an important point that it would be more convincing to document that echinocytosis and rhoptry discharge occur in CD55-null cells, instead of focusing solely on the phenotypes in the presence of anti-CD55 antibody. As described in response to Critique 1, in the revision we have included direct evidence of rhoptry discharge for merozoites attached to CD55-null RBCs (Figure 6E). We have also performed live cell imaging echinocytosis assays in WT versus CD55-null erythrocytes, as recommended (Figure 6D). In these experiments, late stage schizonts were incubated with WT or CD55-null erythrocytes in the presence of cyt-D, and the frequency of echinocytosis was quantified for merozoites that attached to an RBC for at least 30 seconds. The results showed that merozoite-induced echinocytosis can occur in CD55-null RBCs, consistent with our model that CD55 acts after rhoptry discharge. However notably there was a wide range of echinocytosis efficiencies per egress for both genetic backgrounds, with low or no echinocytosis more commonly observed in the CD55-null cells. While this finding may indicate a difference in the susceptibility of WT versus CD55-null RBCs to merozoite-induced echinocytosis, the variation largely occurred at the level of egress events (e.g. for some egress events the echinocytosis rate in CD55-null cells was 40-60% whereas for others it was 0%). Therefore our main conclusion from this series of experiments is that CD55-null RBCs can be stimulated to undergo echinocytosis, demonstrating that CD55 is not required for rhoptry discharge (Videos 9 and 10). The RAP1 IFA experiments requested by the reviewers provide further support for this conclusion.
