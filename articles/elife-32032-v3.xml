fluctuations. However, the complexity of circadian clocks in higher organisms has prevented a clear understanding of how natural environmental conditions affect circadian clocks and their physiological outputs. Here, we dissect the interaction between circadian regulation and responses to fluctuating light in the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic>. We demonstrate that natural changes in light intensity substantially affect the expression of hundreds of circadian-clock-controlled genes, many of which are involved in key steps of metabolism. These changes in expression arise from circadian and light-responsive control of RNA polymerase recruitment to promoters by a network of transcription factors including RpaA and RpaB. Using phenomenological modeling constrained by our data, we reveal simple principles that underlie the small number of stereotyped responses of dusk circadian genes to changes in light.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32032.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living things face daily, predictable challenges due to the regular day and night cycle imposed by the Earth’s rotation. Many of them have evolved an internal ‘circadian’ clock to anticipate daily changes in the environment. However, nature can also change in unpredictable ways, and in order to survive, organisms must account for both the time of day stipulated by their clocks and changes in their present environment. For example, cyanobacteria depend on the sun for survival and must cope with light variations throughout the day and the absence of light at nighttime.</p><p>Circadian clocks are made up of specific genes and their proteins. Most of what we know about how these clocks control the behavior of an organism comes from experiments performed under constant conditions. Previous research has shown that under such circumstances, the circadian clock of cyanobacteria periodically turns on a set of genes every 24 hours via a protein called RpaA. However, to understand how cyanobacteria use this clock, we must know how it works in a fluctuating environment.</p><p>To test this, Piechura, Amarnath and O’Shea measured the activation of genes in cyanobacteria that had been exposed to changes in light mimicking those in nature. Compared to constant conditions, fluctuating light drastically changed the timing of activation of circadian genes. When light decreased – as it would in nature during sunset or if a cloud blocks the sun – the circadian genes were activated.</p><p>Changes in light did not change the ‘ticking’ of the clock, but did affect the ability of RpaA to turn on circadian genes. Moreover, the activity of a second protein called RpaB increased when light decreased and the genes were activated. Thus, cyanobacteria switch on circadian genes as the sun is setting or during unexpected shade, likely through RpaA and RpaB, to help them survive without light.</p><p>This study shows that circadian clocks activate genes differently in the real world compared to unnatural, constant conditions. This may prompt scientists to think carefully about how an organism’s natural environment can affect its inner workings. A next step will be to see how else light affects circadian gene levels. A deeper understanding of how cyanobacteria control their genes in a natural environment will be useful for scientists who engineer these organisms to produce biofuels from sunlight.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>S. elongatus</kwd><kwd>circadian clock</kwd><kwd>response regulators</kwd><kwd>cyanobacteria</kwd><kwd>fluctuating light</kwd><kwd>transcription networks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Shea</surname><given-names>Erin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cyanobacteria cope with both predictable day/night changes and natural fluctuations in light during the day by adjusting the expression dynamics of circadian-clock-controlled genes via a network of transcriptional regulators.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian clocks allow organisms from almost all branches of life to alter physiology in anticipation of diurnal changes in the environment. Circadian clocks are autonomous core oscillators that keep time even in the absence of environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunlap et al., 2004</xref>). Output pathways interpret timing information from the core oscillator to generate oscillating outputs, such as oscillations in the mRNA levels (expression) of genes and higher order behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunlap et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wijnen and Young, 2006</xref>). Laboratory studies of the outputs of circadian clocks have been primarily performed under constant conditions to isolate circadian regulation from environmental responses. In nature, however, organisms with circadian clocks must also cope with unexpected fluctuations in the environment. Thus a major challenge in chronobiology is to understand circadian regulation in dynamic environments.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that circadian clock output pathways interact with responses to the environment to tailor physiology to both the time of day and the current state of the environment. For example, sleep/wake cycles in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and photosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> are controlled by both the circadian clock and environmental variables like day length or light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamaze et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Millar and Kay, 1996</xref>). Further, circadian clocks can modulate responses to the environment based on the time-of-day in a process called circadian gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hotta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenham and McClung, 2015</xref>). However, the complexity of higher organisms has prevented a detailed understanding of the interaction between circadian timing information and environmental responses. In contrast, the circadian clock in the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942, an obligate photoautotroph, has a simple architecture which controls gene expression oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to influence metabolism and growth. <italic>S. elongatus</italic> must carefully monitor its environment, as the sunlight required for photosynthesis fluctuates on the minute, day, and seasonal timescales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petty and Weidner, 2017</xref>]). While it is well understood how the circadian clock in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> behaves under constant conditions, it is unclear how this system changes in natural, fluctuating light.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32032.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The circadian and light response pathways in cyanobacteria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of gene expression output of the circadian clock under Constant Light conditions.

It is unclear whether natural fluctuations in light directly affect the clock and its output pathways and how light-induced changes in RpaB activity might be involved.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32032-fig1-v3"/></fig><p>In <italic>S. elongatus</italic> grown under ‘Constant Light’ conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, dashed navy blue line), genes which show oscillatory expression (circadian genes) can be divided into two groups, the dawn and the dusk genes, which peak at subjective dawn and subjective dusk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vijayan et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subjective dawn and subjective dusk refer to the times at which dark-to-light or light-to-dark transitions would occur in a 12 hr light-12 hr dark environmental cycle. The dawn genes consist of the core metabolic and growth genes for <italic>S. elongatus</italic>, including the photosystems, ATP synthase, carbon fixation/Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle enzymes, and ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vijayan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diamond et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of regulation by the circadian clock under Constant Light, <italic>S. elongatus</italic> constantly expresses dawn genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markson et al., 2013</xref>). The clock primarily regulates the expression of dusk genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markson et al., 2013</xref>), which include the genes required to utilize glycogen as an energy source in the absence of sunlight, such as glycogen phosphorylase and cytochrome c oxidase. As such, the circadian clock serves a critical function in switching <italic>S. elongatus</italic> from a daytime state of photosynthesis to a nighttime state of carbon metabolism through glycogen breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diamond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diamond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pattanayak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puszynska and O'Shea, 2017</xref>). In Constant Light conditions, the dusk and dawn genes show oscillatory expression with a 24 hr period, resulting in broad peaks of maximal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, solid green line and dashed maroon line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vijayan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2009</xref>). Recent whole-cell modeling of metabolism, protein levels, and growth predict that this picture of circadian gene expression should change under the dynamic light conditions of a natural, clear day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, navy blue line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reimers et al., 2017</xref>). The modeling suggests that making and using glycogen is a major cost to cell growth and thus the expression of genes required to switch metabolism from photosynthesis to glycogen breakdown should be delayed until absolutely necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reimers et al., 2017</xref>). However, gene expression in natural light conditions has not been measured in <italic>S. elongatus</italic>.</p><p>Consistent with predictions of light-dependent changes in circadian gene expression, current evidence suggests interaction between the circadian and light regulatory pathways. The cyanobacterial clock keeps track of the time of day using a core post-translational oscillator (PTO) that consists of three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, whose enzymatic activities result in 24 hr oscillations in the phosphorylation state of KaiC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakajima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rust et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). In vivo under Constant Light conditions the Kai PTO modulates circadian gene expression by controlling oscillations in phosphorylation state of the master OmpR-type transcription factor RpaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takai et al., 2006</xref>) to peak at subjective dusk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, dotted black line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutu and O'Shea, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takai et al., 2006</xref>). Phosphorylated RpaA (RpaA<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>P) binds to the promoters of some dusk genes to activate their expression, leading to indirect activation of other dusk genes and repression of dawn genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markson et al., 2013</xref>). As <italic>kaiBC</italic> is a dusk gene target of RpaA, the Kai PTO directs its own expression, resulting in a transcription-translation feedback loop that stabilizes the phase of the clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Teng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zwicker et al., 2010</xref>). Exposure to complete darkness at specific times of day causes phase shifts in the PTO to align clock output with the external day/night cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rust et al., 2011</xref>), in a process called entrainment. However, it is not understood whether any aspect of this model, such as the dynamics of RpaA activity or the transcription-translation feedback loop, changes in the presence of more subtle natural light changes during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Meanwhile the OmpR-type transcription factor RpaB binds to some circadian gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanaoka et al., 2012</xref>), and the phosphorylation state and DNA binding activity of this protein decreases in response to high light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">López-Redondo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moronta-Barrios et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is not clear how natural light changes like sunset or shade pulses affect RpaB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). RpaB clearly plays some role in altering circadian gene expression in response to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Espinosa et al., 2015</xref>), but it is unclear how (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While light likely exerts global, growth-rate-dependent regulation of protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnap, 2015</xref>), the interaction between circadian and light regulation to control the activities of RpaA and RpaB represents a particularly tractable scenario for dissecting the mechanisms underlying interaction between clock and environment to control circadian gene expression.</p><p>Here we measure and model circadian gene expression and several layers of regulation in cyanobacteria grown under the fluctuating light intensities typically experienced in nature. We find that fluctuations in light alter the expression patterns of almost all circadian genes. We identify key regulatory steps at which information about changes in light interact with clock output pathways to control gene expression, and reveal a complex regulatory network underlying circadian gene expression in natural conditions. Finally, we show that phenomenological models effectively describe the integration of the circadian clock with responses to environmental fluctuations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sunlight on a clear day delays the timing of circadian gene expression relative to constant light conditions</title><p>To grow and assay cyanobacteria in natural light conditions, we custom-built a culturing setup with a light source that can be programmed to mimic natural fluctuations in sunlight.

We acclimated cultures in their respective condition for 2 light/dark cycles, and sampled them (arrows) over the next (third) light period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Setup). We focused our analysis on a set of high amplitude circadian genes that show oscillatory expression under Constant Light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; see Materials and methods, Definition of circadian genes). The Low Light condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panel) reproduces the expression profile previously observed under Constant Light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, in the Clear Day condition 159 of the 281 dusk genes were expressed at least two fold higher after midday compared to Low Light, demonstrating light-dependent expression. Dawn genes show the opposite behavior — they have higher expression at midday under Clear Day conditions, although this trend is less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, Clear Day conditions significantly influence the expression dynamics of almost all circadian genes, with the strongest effects on dusk genes.</p><p>To look more closely at how the Clear Day condition affects the dusk genes, which are the primary regulatory targets of the clock, we analyze the gene expression dynamics of the representative dusk gene <italic>Synpcc7942_1567</italic>. Under Low Light conditions, <italic>Synpcc7942_1567</italic> exhibits an increase in expression from dawn to dusk, reaching a plateau by 8 hr after dawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, solid black line). Under Clear Day conditions, however, the expression of this gene remains low through the midday peak of light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, solid magenta line; 4–8 hr after dawn), and its expression sharply increases just prior to dusk as light intensity decreases, reaching maximal expression just as the dark period begins. This delayed pattern of gene expression can be seen in almost all dusk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>Synpcc7942_1567</italic> indicated with arrows). Thus Clear Day conditions significantly alter the dynamics and amplitude of dusk gene expression to peak just before dusk.</p><p>The delay of dusk gene expression likely enables cyanobacteria to switch to glycogen breakdown only when absolutely necessary so that they can survive the extended darkness of night. The two glycogen breakdown genes, <italic>glgP</italic> and <italic>glgX</italic>, are both light-dependent dusk genes that strongly peak in Clear Day at dusk, while <italic>glgC</italic>, which codes for the rate limiting enzyme of glycogen synthesis, is a dawn gene whose expression is higher in Clear Day conditions compared to Low Light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). These gene expression dynamics would favor both the maintenance of glycogen synthesis until the end of the day and a delay in the activation of glycogen breakdown until just before it is required at nighttime, in agreement with predictions from metabolic modeling during the same Clear Day conditions used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reimers et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, environmental conditions are integrated into the output of the circadian clock to potentially optimize resource allocation in naturally-relevant diurnal cycles, as recently suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reimers et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, though in both light conditions the cells experience 50 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>mol photons m<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:msup><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> s<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:msup><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> at the end of the day just before night, light-dependent dusk genes have substantially higher expression in the Clear Day conditions relative to the Low Light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). Indeed, 95/281 dusk genes were expressed at least three fold higher in Clear Day relative to Low Light at 12 hr after dawn. This strong activation of dusk genes occurs concomitant with the decrease in light intensity during Clear Day that mimics Sunset, which hinted that <italic>changes</italic> in light intensity affect activation of dusk genes as opposed to absolute light intensity levels. Dusk gene expression could thus happen ‘just-in-time’ before the sustained darkness of nighttime regardless of the seasonal timing of Sunset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Changes in light intensity control the transcription of circadian genes</title><p>To test whether changes in light intensity are a key factor controlling the expression of circadian genes, we exposed cells to a High Light pulse or a Shade pulse and measured genome-wide gene expression using RNA sequencing. We grew cultures in either Low Light or Clear Day conditions for three days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, Setup). On the fourth day at 8 hr after dawn, when RpaA is most active, we exposed the cells to a High Light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or a Shade pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) for 1 hr before returning to the original condition. We sampled the cells before, during, and after the perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, Setup, arrows). The expression of dusk genes rapidly changed in a direction opposite to the change in light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, all dusk genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, example dusk gene; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, all dusk genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, example dusk gene), as expected from the effects of the decrease in light intensity at Sunset of the Clear Day condition on circadian gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). A large subset of dusk genes were affected by the light pulses, with 105/281 repressed by at least three fold by the High Light condition, and 136/281 induced by at least three fold by the Shade condition. Further, many genes responded rapidly and changed in expression at least three fold after just 15 min into the pulse (75/281 repressed by High Light, 79/281 induced by Shade). When cultures were restored to their original condition (High Light to Low Light, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>; Shade to Clear Day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>), dusk gene expression quickly reverted to a level comparable to that before the pulse. Thus, light-induced changes in dusk gene expression are reversible and responsive to successive shifts in light availability. Dawn gene expression showed the opposite behavior of dusk genes, albeit with less dramatic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, decreases in light intensity favor the expression of dusk genes (Sunset in Clear Day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; Clear Day to Shade and High Light to Low Light, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), while increases in light favor the expression of dawn genes (midday peak in Clear Day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; Shade to Clear Day and Low Light to High Light, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We reasoned that changes in transcription would manifest as differences in the amount of RNA polymerase (RNAP) localized to dusk genes. To determine whether changes in light intensity regulate the recruitment of RNAP to dusk gene promoters, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) of RNAP in cells immediately before the High Light or Shade pulse (8 hr after dawn in Low Light or Clear Day), and then again 15 or 60 min following the start of the pulse. Changes in RNAP enrichment upstream of dusk genes correlated with changes in downstream dusk gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, changes in light affect RNAP recruitment to dusk gene promoters, suggesting that light conditions substantially affect the rates of transcription of dusk gene mRNAs. Because mRNAs in bacteria have very short steady state half lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hambraeus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salem and van Waasbergen, 2004</xref>), we argue that changes in transcription rates of dusk gene mRNAs are sufficient to lead to the rapid changes in dusk gene mRNA levels given a fast basal degradation rate, though we cannot rule out that changes in light may affect the rates of degradation of some mRNAs. These results point to a potential interaction between sunlight and signaling pathways upstream of RNAP. We next explored how the observed changes in dusk gene expression in the presence of natural light fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) could be achieved via gene regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Regulation of dusk gene expression by RpaA and RpaB under dynamic light regimes</title><p>Given the strong dependence of dusk gene expression on RpaA<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf43"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>P levels under Constant Light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markson et al., 2013</xref>]) and the drastic change in dusk gene expression dynamics under our dynamic light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>), we hypothesized that light conditions alter RpaA<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>P dynamics to alter dusk gene expression.

While previous studies have measured genome-wide gene expression in a single natural light condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Waldbauer et al., 2012</xref>), here we compare genome-wide circadian gene expression in several physiologically-relevant conditions, including Clear Day, High Light pulse, Shade pulse, and Low Light, to carefully dissect the effects of light on clock output. Natural light changes most greatly affected a large fraction of the dusk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C,D</xref>), possibly because most of the direct targets of RpaA are dusk genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markson et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that the opposing trends we observe in dawn gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) may in part be due to competition for RNAP between the dusk and dawn genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gruber and Gross, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mauri and Klumpp, 2014</xref>) or by growth-rate-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scott et al., 2010</xref>), as this group of genes contains the primary growth genes. A systematic exploration of the effects of light on circadian genes will be necessary to fully elaborate the contributions of light, clock, and growth rate on circadian gene dynamics.</p><p>We find that large groups of light-responsive dusk genes are activated by diminished light conditions to different extents depending on the time of day the stimulus is applied. These differences in activation may serve to optimally change metabolism for a given light condition and time of day. The light-responsive dusk genes grouped into three clusters - Early, Middle, and Late - with different activation dynamics during Sunset at the end of the Clear Day versus the Shade pulse in the afternoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref> for full lists of genes in each cluster). Glycogen breakdown genes and the central carbon metabolism genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and oxalate decarboxylase belong to the Middle dusk genes, which are activated to similar levels by Shade and Sunset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This suggests that cyanobacteria delay the activation of glycogen breakdown pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reimers et al., 2017</xref>) until just before dusk when grown under Clear Day conditions, but can transiently activate these genes in response to Shade to access alternate energy reserves if necessary. Interestingly, genes encoding pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase, which reversibly converts NADH to the NADPH required for electron transport, belong to the Late cluster and are strongly activated only by Sunset and not afternoon Shade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Such a response might delay the adjustment of the relative levels of NADH/NADPH until only when absolutely needed at night, when NADPH is potentially important for defense against reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diamond et al., 2017</xref>). The cytochrome c oxidase genes belong to the Early cluster, which respond more intensely to Shade than to Sunset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This enzyme is essential for preventing photodamage in response to rapid changes in light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lea-Smith et al., 2013</xref>); such changes are not expected to occur during the night, where it serves solely as the terminal electron acceptor for respiration.

However, our attempts to cleanly perturb RpaB activity to further explore its role as a regulator of dusk genes were unsuccessful, in part because the <italic>rpaB</italic> gene is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">López-Redondo et al., 2010</xref>). The role of sigma factors in this network of regulation, while strongly implied, remains ambiguous and attempts to assess this role using genetic deletion of sigma factors yielded inconclusive results. More subtle approaches such as anchors away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>) might allow perturbation experiments that clearly explicate the roles of the sigma factors and RpaB in mediating circadian gene expression.</p><p>Although complex molecular mechanisms underlie the light-responsive expression of dusk genes, we demonstrate that phenomenological models effectively describe the differential activation of large groups of dusk genes to afternoon Shade and Sunset. These models suggest that transcription factors with the dynamics of RpaA<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf197"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>P and RpaB<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf198"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) are sufficient to reproduce much of the activation of the Early, Middle, and Late clusters in response to a Shade pulse in the afternoon or Sunset just before night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–E</xref>). Our models suggest that additional feedback from the other gene clusters may be necessary to achieve the extent of circadian gating observed for the Early and Late clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–I</xref>). Our models suggest that interactions between the major dusk clusters can diversify the responses of these clusters to signals from RpaA and RpaB. Regulatory interactions between the sigma factors RpoD6, RpoD5, and SigF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), which belong to the Early, Middle, and Late clusters, respectively, could generate feedback downstream of RpaA and RpaB similar to that in our models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">4</xref>) to generate the diverse responses of the dusk clusters to light conditions. However, feedback could also come from other sources with similar dynamics to the cluster expression levels. Indeed we could not simultaneously fit our models to all four light conditions, likely because of global growth-rate-dependent differences between the Low Light and Clear Day conditions. Thus, complete modeling of transcription dynamics of light-dependent dusk genes likely requires explicitly including the effects of metabolism and growth on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reimers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnap, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scott et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Closing remarks</title><p>RpaB and its cognate upstream histidine kinase NblS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Waasbergen et al., 2002</xref>) have been implicated in a variety of stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mikami et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shoumskaya et al., 2005</xref>), which suggests that the mechanisms and regulatory circuits defined here may apply to other environmental changes such as temperature or osmolarity.

The intensity of the LEDs was controlled by varying the voltage input into the DIM line of the Flexblock between 0 and 10 V. We used a digital potentiometer (AD7376, Analog Devices) as a controllable 10 V source. The voltage output of the digipot was controlled via serial peripheral interface with an Arduino Uno board (Arduino) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>, p. 4). Each LED array was controlled separately, and a single array was sufficient to grow a single 750 mL culture of <italic>S. elongatus</italic>. All wires carrying substantial currents from the main power supply to the LED arrays were rated 18 AWG, and all other wires were rated 22 AWG. The relatively low voltage of the main power supply (18 V) is essential for being able to turn off the LED arrays completely.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32032.038</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Fitting bounds.</title><p>Bounds used for fitting the variables in our simple model of gene expression.

We calculated the correlation coefficient between the change in RpaA/B ChIP enrichment and the change in RNAP ChIP enrichment for all RpaA/B - RNAP peak pairs of the relevant factor in the High Light pulse, and then calculated the same correlation in Shade pulse conditions separately.

We repeated these calculations for each peak-gene pair in 15 or 60 min in Shade pulse compared to 8 hr since dawn in Clear Day conditions. We used hierarchical clustering on the collective RpaA/B and RNAP ChIP data from both conditions to determine the plotting order of the RpaA/RpaB - RNAP peak pairs in the heat maps, and then plotted the log<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf272"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> change in RpaA/B ChIP enrichment and RNAP ChIP enrichment in the two conditions in separate heat maps.

However, we can argue that both the changes and the dynamic range of intensities we used are relevant for <italic>S. elongatus</italic>. First, we argue that the gradual changes in intensity due to the earth’s rotation in our Clear Day condition, and the rapid changes in light in our Shade pulse and High Light pulse conditions due to changes in cloud cover are relevant for any organism exposed to ambient light in nature, as shown by the measured sunlight dynamics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Second, we measured the growth rate of <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942 under both of our Low Light and Clear Day conditions after two days of acclimation to the respective condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and found that the strain grows roughly twice as fast under the higher light intensities of the Clear Day condition at 6 hours after dawn compared to growth under the Low Light condition. These data indicate that <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942 is capable of acclimating to the higher light intensities of our Clear Day condition and using this energy for faster growth compared to lower light intensities. Thus, we added a sentence to the main text in the first paragraph of section A of the Results to highlight this comparison – ‘Cultures grown under the Clear Day condition adjusted their pigment content after two days of exposure to the Clear Day condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). […] These data indicate that <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC7942 is capable of acclimating to the higher light intensities of the Clear Day condition and thus that the intensities used in our measurements are relevant for this strain.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusions are generally supported by the data throughout, but I did have a concern about the statement: '…mRNA levels primarily by regulating…transcription'. This has not been proven and the other possibility – changes to degradation rates (or dilution) – was not tested. The dramatic changes observed from the data (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) in just 15 min actually suggest to me the opposite. Namely, a rapid decrease on such short timescales can only be explained by degradation. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that mRNA degradation or dilution may play a part in generating the rapid changes in mRNA levels we observe in response to pulse changes in light. We observe that both RNA polymerase and RpaA/B occupancy at promoters tracks closely with these fast dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>). Moreover, genome-wide measurements of mRNA half lives in bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic> (Chen et al., 2015, DOI 10.15252/msb.20145794) and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Hambraeus et al., 2003, DOI: 10.1007/s00438-003-0883-6) reveal that most transcripts have half lives on the order of 3-7 minutes and are thus highly unstable, and measurements of single transcript half lives in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC7942 fall within this range (Salem et al., 2004, DOI: 10.1128/JB. 186.6.1729-1736.2004). This rate of degradation is an order of magnitude greater than the growth rate of <italic>S. elongatus</italic>, and thus it dominates over loss of transcripts due to dilution. Taken together, these data strongly suggest a model in which there is a high constant degradation rate of transcripts, with the rate of synthesis tightly controlled in response to circadian and light-responsive regulation. Restated more specifically in the context of the example you cite, our model is that changes in the regulation of RNA Polymerase recruitment to dusk genes after the exposure to High Light leads to a rapid decrease in the synthesis rate of dusk mRNAs, and basal rapid turnover of dusk gene mRNAs causes a rapid decrease in mRNA levels. However, we have not directly tested genome-wide mRNA half lives under our conditions, and cannot rule out that some transcripts have regulated changes in degradation under our conditions. We clarify this model by adding to the text in the last paragraph of section B of the Results – ‘To cause these reversible changes in the mRNA levels of dusk genes, changes in light intensity must affect either the transcription <italic>and/</italic>or the degradation of dusk gene mRNAs. […] Because mRNAs in bacteria have very short steady state half lives (Chen et al., 2015, Hambraeus et al., 2003, Salem et al., 2004), we argue that changes in transcription rates of dusk gene mRNAs are sufficient to lead to the rapid changes in dusk gene mRNA levels given a fast basal degradation rate, though we cannot rule out that changes in light may affect the rates of degradation of some mRNAs.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Beginning of Part C. It might clarify this rationale to highlight the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The incongruence between this and levels of RpaA-P is a simpler justification for the narrative.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and agree that this argument helps motivate Part C. Thus, we now begin the first paragraph of section C of the Results as follows – ‘Given the strong dependence of dusk gene expression on RpaA~P levels under Constant Light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Markson et al., 2013) and the drastic change in dusk gene expression dynamics under our dynamic light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-F</xref>), we hypothesized that light conditions alter RpaA~P dynamics to alter dusk gene expression. However, levels of RpaA~P increased from dawn to dusk... by the Kai PTO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). […] Interestingly, ChIP-seq showed that light intensity fluctuations alter RpaA~P binding upstream of dusk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) in conjunction with RNAP binding upstream of the same gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).’ We also found a couple of other places in the text where we could make the larger narrative a bit more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> highlights the fact that only a minor number of dusk responsive genes (~25%) are directly regulated by RpaA / RpAB.

Bact.) and light availability modulating the stringent response (Hood et al., 2016 PNAS) which should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that it is entirely possible that dusk gene expression is affected by transcriptional regulatory pathways that are independent of circadian regulation downstream of RpaA. The reviewer’s reference for light affecting the stringent response is particularly salient for our work. We altered the last paragraph of Section C of the Results to read as follows: ‘It is also possible that changes in light intensity affect dusk gene expressionindependently of RpaA~P and RpaB~P. For instance, global growth-rate-dependent gene regulatory mechanisms such as the stringent response (Scott et al., 2010; Ryals et al., 1982, Hood et al., 2016, Burnap et al., 2015), likely cause some of the light-dependent changes in circadian gene expression…” As shown in Ryals et al., 1982 and Scott et al., 2010, the current understanding of the stringent response in <italic>E. coli</italic> is that ppGpp levels respond to the total metabolic flux of the cell, the growth rate. Burnap et al., 2015 extends this understanding to cyanobacteria, and Hood et al., 2016 shows that the effects of changes in ppGpp levels in cyanobacteria resembles those observed for <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Evaluation of paper</p><p>The question this paper asks is of basic interest and it is good it is tackled head on.

Indeed, 95/281 dusk genes were expressed at least 3 fold higher in Clear Day relative to Low Light at 12 hours after dawn.”</p><p>First paragraph of section B of the Results – “The expression of dusk genes rapidly changed in a direction opposite to the change in light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, all dusk genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, example dusk gene; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, all dusk genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, example dusk gene), as expected from the effects of the decrease in light intensity at Sunset of the Clear Day condition on circadian gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-E</xref>).

However, at present, there is little known about this relationship in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC7942. Proteins such as the σ factor RpoD3 have been shown to increase in abundance after just 30 minutes of high light exposure in conjunction with induction of the <italic>rpoD3</italic> mRNA (Seki, et al., 2007, DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M707582200), suggesting that rapid changes in mRNA levels can lead to changes in protein levels in cyanobacteria. Still, there is limited proteomic data (Guerrero, Mol Cell Proteomics, 2015) on <italic>S. elongatus</italic> both in constant light and variable light conditions. Hence, we agree and suggest that careful proteomic work is a critical next step in exploring the physiology of cyanobacteria under natural conditions. As these experiments are beyond the scope of our current study, we suggest this work for future study in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There are quite a few figures in the paper, but I am missing seeing some raw expression levels plots (before delving into the supplementary information, which many readers will not do).

Here we point out our efforts to do so graphically in addition to the quantified metrics we added to the text from the previous comment. In an effort to impress upon the reader the magnitude of the expression of changes to this large group of genes, we highlight the expression of a single example gene in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, and then present the expression of all 281 dusk genes in heat maps in which the data are expressed as the log change in expression from the average expression of the gene under the Low Light condition. This normalization allows a direct comparison of the magnitude of change of the dusk genes from a standard expression level that is specific to each gene. To allow a direct comparison between the example dusk gene for which we show raw data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A, B</xref> (<italic>Synpcc7942_1567</italic>), we indicate the position of this gene in the heat maps with an arrow. This arrow allows the reader to identify large groups of genes within the heatmaps that show comparable magnitude changes to the example dusk gene <italic>Synpcc7942_1567.</italic> Further, we use scatter plots to demonstrate the magnitude of change in expression of circadian genes after exposure to the High Light and Shade pulses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref> (subsets of genes), and 6B (all dusk genes). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows the full range of responses of dusk genes to rapid changes in light intensity, and demonstrates that many dusk genes change in expression by 2 fold or greater after exposure to the High Light and Shade Pulse, but some genes are not as drastically affected. Further, we show raw expression data for 8 other dusk genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4G, J, H, K, I, L</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G, J, H, K, I, L</xref>.
