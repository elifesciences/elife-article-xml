required for the stabilization of pairing interactions and the completion of crossover (CO) formation between homologs during meiosis I. Here, we identify a novel role for a central region component of the SC, SYP-4, in negatively regulating formation of recombination-initiating double-strand breaks (DSBs) via a feedback loop triggered by crossover designation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found that SYP-4 is phosphorylated dependent on Polo-like kinases PLK-1/2. SYP-4 phosphorylation depends on DSB formation and crossover designation, is required for stabilizing the SC in pachytene by switching the central region of the SC from a more dynamic to a less dynamic state, and negatively regulates DSB formation. We propose a model in which Polo-like kinases recognize crossover designation and phosphorylate SYP-4 thereby stabilizing the SC and making chromosomes less permissive for further DSB formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23437.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23437.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23437.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The majority of DNA in animal cells is stored in structures called chromosomes. Most cells contain two sets of chromosomes, one inherited from the mother and one from the father. Sperm and egg cells, however, contain only a single set of chromosomes. A specialized type of cell division called meiosis generates these cells. During meiosis, the chromosomes in a cell replicate to produce a cell that contains four copies of each chromosome. The equivalent chromosomes from the mother and the father are initially kept close together by a zipper-like structure called the synaptonemal complex. This allows the chromosomes to exchange segments of DNA, before the cell divides twice in successive rounds to produce four cells, each containing one set of chromosomes.</p><p>Severing both of the DNA strands that make up a DNA molecule forms what is known as a double-strand break. To exchange DNA segments with another chromosome, double-strand breaks that form in the DNA of one chromosome are repaired in a process known as crossover formation. Only a subset of the double-strand breaks are designated to be repaired by crossover formation, but at least one crossover needs to form between each chromosome pair. This generates diversity and ensures that the chromosomes separate correctly at the first cell division.</p><p>Since the synaptonemal complex holds equivalent chromosomes close together it ensures that at least some of the breaks are repaired by crossover formation. Nadarajan et al. have now investigated how a chemical modification called phosphorylation affects how the synaptonemal complex behaves in the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. A combination of genetic and cell-based approaches revealed that enzymes called polo-like kinases phosphorylate one of the proteins – called SYP-4 – that makes up the synaptonemal complex. This phosphorylation occurs after double-strand break sites have been designated to become crossovers.</p><p>The synaptonemal complex is normally a dynamic structure, with the proteins that it consists of being continuously replaced. However, Nadarajan et al. found that phosphorylating SYP-4 made the synaptonemal complex less dynamic than it had previously been, which prevented further double-strand breaks from forming.</p><p>Polo-like kinases are found in many organisms, from yeast to humans. Further work is now needed to investigate whether polo-like kinases phosphorylate the synaptonemal complex – and hence prevent the continuous formation of double-strand breaks – in animals such as mice and humans. This is important because failing to shut down the formation of double-strand breaks can result in cancer, infertility, miscarriages and birth defects in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23437.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23437.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Polo-like kinase</kwd><kwd>double-strand breaks</kwd><kwd>SYP-4</kwd><kwd>synaptonemal complex</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM072551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colaiácovo</surname><given-names>Monica P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lalor Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nadarajan</surname><given-names>Saravanapriah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PLK-1/2-mediated SYP-4 phosphorylation is dependent on crossover precursor formation, triggering a switch in the dynamic state of the synaptonemal complex that reduces the formation of further double-strand breaks at late meiotic prophase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division program during which the diploid germ cell genome is halved to generate haploid gametes, and therefore it is critical for sexual reproduction. This halving is achieved by following one round of DNA replication with two consecutive rounds of cell division where homologs segregate away from each other at meiosis I, and sister chromatids segregate at meiosis II. Accurate chromosome segregation at meiosis I depends on several earlier key steps including pairing and the assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC) between homologous chromosomes (homologs), formation of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the repair of a subset of these DSBs as interhomolog crossover (CO) recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Page and Hawley, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The SC plays a conserved and central role during meiosis. The assembly of the SC is required for the stabilization of pairing interactions between the homologs and for interhomolog CO formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nag et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Storlazzi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Page and Hawley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colaiácovo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smolikov et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smolikov et al., 2007b</xref>). While the components of the SC do not share a high degree of sequence conservation between species, this tripartite proteinaceous structure is conserved at the ultrastructural level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colaiácovo, 2006</xref>). The SC is comprised of lateral element components that assemble along chromosome axes and central region components that bridge the gap between each pair of axes, much like the steps on a ladder. In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, there are four central region components of the SC, SYP-1, SYP-2, SYP-3 and SYP-4, which begin to localize between the homologs in the leptotene/zygotene stage of meiotic prophase and are fully assembled throughout the interface between homologs by pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colaiácovo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smolikov et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smolikov et al., 2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smolikov et al., 2007a</xref>). However, the SC is not static and has been shown to be a dynamic structure that undergoes continuous turnover. In budding yeast, Zip1, the central region component of the SC, has been shown to be continuously incorporated into a fully assembled SC in a non-uniform spatial pattern influenced by recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Voelkel-Meiman et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, recent studies have shown that the central region of the SC contains mobile subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rog et al., 2017</xref>) and that the SC persists in a more dynamic state in the absence of DSBs, leading to the suggestion that CO-committed intermediates may stabilize the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Machovina et al., 2016</xref>). However, how these changes in SC dynamics are regulated is not well understood.</p><p>Interhomolog CO formation is extremely important not only for producing genetic diversity but also for generating physical linkages (chiasmata) between homologs, which are essential for the proper bi-orientation and separation of homologs at meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Page and Hawley, 2003</xref>). Meiotic recombination initiates with the formation of programmed DSBs induced by the conserved topoisomerase-like protein Spo11/SPO-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>). DSBs are made in excess to ensure that at least one CO (obligate CO) is established for each pair of homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones, 1984</xref>). However, the engagement of homologous chromosomes during recombination and/or SC assembly has been proposed to turn off further programmed DSB formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keeney et al., 2014</xref>). One possibility is that once a DSB is designated to become a CO a feedback mechanism turns off further programmed DSBs from forming. An alternative, albeit non-mutually exclusive possibility, is that SC formation may result in structural changes along the chromosomes which suppress further DSB formation. The molecular basis for transmission of this feedback regulation remains an open question.</p><p>Here, we provide a mechanistic basis for how the switch in SC dynamics and the transmission of feedback regulation on further DSB formation work during meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We show that the Polo-like kinases, PLK-1 and PLK-2, are critical components of this negative feedback loop that couple CO designation with DSB formation. We show that a central region component of the SC, SYP-4, is phosphorylated at Serine 269 in a PLK-1/2-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of SYP-4 coincides with the appearance of CO-promoting factor CNTD1/COSA-1 and is dependent on the formation of DSBs and CO designation/precursor formation, which in turn inhibits additional DSBs from being formed. Further, phosphorylation of SYP-4 by PLK-1/2 switches the central region of the SC from a more dynamic to a less dynamic state. Thus, we propose a model in which PLK-1/2 mediate the phosphorylation of SYP-4 in response to CO designation/precursor formation, which in turn stabilizes SC dynamics and prevents further DSB formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PLK-2 localization on chromosomes during pachytene is dependent on the SYP proteins</title><p><italic>plk-2</italic> encodes one of the three Polo-like kinases in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and is the ortholog of mammalian PLK1. PLK-2 localizes to chromosome-associated patches at the nuclear periphery of leptotene/zygotene nuclei, which correspond to the regions of the chromosomes referred to as pairing centers that are tethered to the nuclear envelope at this stage, and relocalizes to synapsed chromosomes in pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Labella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harper et al., 2011</xref>).

We found that PLK-2 localized to the chromosome-associated patches at the nuclear periphery in leptotene/zygotene stage nuclei, but we did not detect PLK-2 signal on chromosomes in pachytene nuclei in <italic>syp-1</italic> and <italic>syp-4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> PLK-1 functions redundantly with PLK-2 and it can partially substitute for the function of PLK-2 during pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Labella et al., 2011</xref>). To determine whether PLK-1 also localized to synapsed chromosomes, we examined the immunolocalization of PLK-1 in wild type germlines. While PLK-1 is observed on chromosome-associated aggregates at the nuclear periphery during leptotene/zygotene as expected, we did not detect any PLK-1 signal in pachytene stage nuclei even in the absence of PLK-2, although we cannot rule out the possibility that PLK-1 signal could be below threshold levels of detection by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given that all of the four SYP proteins are interdependent on each other for their localization and for SC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colaiácovo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smolikov et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smolikov et al., 2007a</xref>), we infer from our analysis of the <italic>syp-1</italic> and <italic>syp-4</italic> mutants that PLK-2 localization to chromosomes during pachytene is dependent on all four SYP proteins.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23437.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PLK-2 localization on synapsed chromosomes is dependent on the SYP proteins.</title><p>High-magnification images of leptotene/zygotene (<bold>A</bold>) and pachytene stage (<bold>B</bold>) nuclei from wild type, <italic>syp-4,</italic> and <italic>syp-1</italic> mutant gonads stained with HTP-3 (green), PLK-2 (red), and DAPI (blue).

We identified S269 in SYP-4 as a potential Polo-like kinase phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test whether the S269 site is phosphorylated in vivo, we generated a phosphopeptide antibody against the SYP-4 S269 site. Phospho-specificity of the pSYP-4 antibody was confirmed by lack of pSYP-4 signal in the <italic>syp-4(S269A)</italic> phosphodead mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Affinity purified phospho-specific SYP-4 antibody signal (pSYP-4) was detected on chromosomes starting at early pachytene, even though SYP-4 localizes at the interface between homologous chromosomes earlier, starting at the leptotene/zygotene stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smolikov et al., 2009</xref>). pSYP-4 was first observed as foci and short stretches on chromosomes in early pachytene nuclei and then fully colocalized with SYP-1 throughout the full length of the chromosomes by mid-pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In late pachytene, as the SC starts to disassemble, pSYP-4 signal was also lost from most of the interface between homologs and was restricted to a single portion of each bivalent referred to as the short arm of the bivalent, which also retains residual SC proteins until later in prophase I and which we have previously shown to correspond to the shortest distance from the position of the single CO event to a chromosome end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>).

Since PLK-1 can substitute for the function of PLK-2 during the pairing of homologous chromosomes, we examined whether SYP-4 was phosphorylated in the absence of both PLK-1 and PLK-2.

However, the extent of recovery of the fluorescence signal was higher in leptotene/zygotene nuclei compared to mid-pachytene nuclei in wild type (p&lt;0.0001 by the Dunn’s multiple comparisons test), suggesting that the central region of the SC transitions from a more dynamic state into a less dynamic or more stable state as meiotic prophase progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>.

Although SC assembly is DSB-dependent in many organisms, it is DSB-independent in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loidl et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baudat et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Romanienko and Camerini-Otero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that DSB formation and recombination are required for phosphorylation of SYP-4. In mutants defective in DSB formation and recombination (<italic>spo-11, dsb-1, dsb-2, mre-11, rad-51, rad-54, zhp-3,</italic> and <italic>cosa-1</italic>), SYP-4 is no longer phosphorylated (except along one chromosome track for early recombination mutants) at the S269 site in pachytene nuclei. This raises an important question: does the Polo-like kinase-dependent phosphorylation of SYP-4 at the S269 site occur in response to recombination? We found that the appearance of foci for the pro-crossover factor COSA-1 coincides with the phosphorylation of SYP-4. Recent studies showed that central region components of the SC impose CO interference and prevent additional CO formation in response to CO designation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Libuda et al., 2013</xref>). We did not see any significant difference in CO number in <italic>syp-4</italic> phosphodead and phosphomimetic mutants compared to wild type, which rules out the possibility that phosphorylation of SYP-4 at S269 mediates the regulation of CO interference. Instead, we found that SYP-4 phosphorylation at S269 mediates the regulation of DSB formation. Recent studies, and this study, show that the central region of the SC exists in different dynamic states at different stages of meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Voelkel-Meiman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Machovina et al., 2016</xref>): more dynamic at the leptotene/zygotene stage and less dynamic at the mid-pachytene stage in wild type. Our data suggest that the more dynamic state of the central region of the SC in leptotene/zygotene corresponds to the region in the germline where homologs are permissive for DSB formation, whereas the less dynamic state of the central region of the SC coincides with the stage of meiosis where homologs are less permissive to DSB formation. Thus we propose that upon CO designation/precursor formation, PLK-1/2 mediates the phosphorylation of the S269 site in SYP-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This phosphorylation event leads to the stabilization of the central region of the SC and makes it less dynamic. Therefore, phosphorylation of SYP-4 functions as a signaling mechanism to alter the SC structure thereby inhibiting further DSB formation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Consistent with our model, the central region of the SC remains dynamic in later stages of meiosis in <italic>syp-4</italic> phosphodead mutants (this study) and in meiotic recombination defective mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Machovina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pattabiraman et al., 2017</xref>).

In the phosphodead mutant, in the absence of phosphorylation of SYP-4 at the S269 site, the SC fails to stabilize and the absence of a feedback loop results in continued DSB formation along the homologous chromosomes.

Studies in different model organisms have described the existence of feedback mechanisms to regulate meiotic DSB number and distribution.</p><p>Work done in both mice and Drosophila has shown that ATM kinase, which is activated in response to DNA damage, is also activated by SPO11-mediated DSBs and is implicated in controlling meiotic DSB levels by inhibiting further DSB formation via a negative feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lange et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joyce et al., 2011</xref>). Studies in yeast, have shown both <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulation of DSB formation acting respectively either along the same or between different homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids. During regulation in <italic>cis</italic>, presence of a strong DSB hotspot inhibits DSB formation nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu and Lichten, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu and Kleckner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukuda et al., 2008</xref>) whereas during regulation in <italic>trans</italic>, DSB formation at one site inhibits DSB formation at either the same site or a nearby site on the homologous partner. Communication between interhomolog interaction and DSB formation is important to establish an even spacing of total recombination events, and the Mec1 (ATR) DNA damage response kinase is proposed to mediate this by <italic>trans</italic> inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Meanwhile, the Tel1 (ATM) kinase exerts <italic>cis</italic> inhibition at the local scale, on the same chromatid and between sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia et al., 2015</xref>). Following meiotic DSB formation, Tel1 and Mec1 may phosphorylate Rec114, a Spo11-accessory protein required for DSB formation, which has been proposed to inhibit further DSB formation by reducing the interaction of Rec114 with DSB hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballo et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, our data suggests that PLK-1/2-dependent phosphorylation of SYP-4 functions as a signal to constrain further DSB formation when one of the DSBs undergoes CO designation/precursor formation. However, we cannot rule out a role for ATM/ATR kinases in PLK-1/2-mediated DSB inhibition.</p><p>Studies in yeast and mice suggest that defects in interhomolog engagement result in increased DSB formation. In yeast, the ZMM proteins (Zip1-4, Msh4-5, Mer3, and others) are required for both SC and CO formation and studies in <italic>zmm</italic> mutants implicate interhomolog engagement as directly responsible for inhibiting DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keeney et al., 2014</xref>). In mice, unsynapsed chromosomes exhibit elevated DSB levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kauppi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thacker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lam and Keeney, 2015</xref>) and the illegitimate (non-homologous) synapsis observed in <italic>Spo11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants is sufficient to evict the HORMA-domain proteins HORMAD1/2 from chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wojtasz et al., 2009</xref>) suggesting a role for SC formation in the feedback mechanism that inhibits further DSB formation once interhomolog engagement is achieved. However, the molecular basis for transmission of the interhomolog engagement-mediated feedback loop on DSB formation is not understood. Axial element proteins Hop1 and Red1 in yeast, HTP-1 and HTP-3 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and HORMAD1, which is a component of unsynapsed axes in mice, have been shown to be required for normal levels of programmed DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mao-Draayer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Woltering et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carballo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lam and Keeney, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Couteau and Zetka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martinez-Perez and Villeneuve, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanchez-Moran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Latypov et al., 2010</xref>).

letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Polo-like kinase-dependent phosphorylation of SYP-4 regulates double-strand break formation via a negative feedback loop&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Scott Keeney) and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Nadarajan et al. addresses an important question of the interplay between synapsis and recombination, particularly how PLK-2 phosphorylation of SYP-4 regulates recombination by affecting the ability to continue to form DSBs.</p><p>Recent work has revealed the existence of mechanisms that ensure that meiotic DSB formation is shut off when certain conditions along homologous chromosomes are met. In addition, signal transduction pathway(s) that limit DSBs have been identified. In a number of organisms, including yeast, mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the ATM kinase signal transduction pathway limits DSBs, both along the genome and locally. Moreover, assembly of the SC central element is implicated in limiting DSB formation, as suggested by increased DSB formation in budding yeast mutants that abrogate SC assembly. In general, however, these regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood.</p><p>This manuscript describes the function of PLK-2 dependent phosphorylation of SYP-4 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Phosphorylation of SYP-4 depends on double strand break formation (DSB), correlates with the initiation of meiosis specific crossover recombination and is required for wildtype levels of DSB formation. Evidence is presented that this phosphorylation event controls the dynamics of the synaptonemal complex: In early meiotic prophase, the SC is more dynamic, incorporating new components of the SC, such as SYP-3, more readily. This dynamicity is lost later in meiotic prophase and correlates with SYP-4 phosphorylation. When the SYP-4 phosphoacceptor site is mutated to alanine, preventing phosphorylation, the SC is dynamic longer than in wildtype worms and when the SYP-4 phosphoacceptor site is mutated to aspartic acid, mimicking constitutive phosphorylation, the SC is less dynamic earlier than in wildtype worms. The authors present a model in which the phosphorylation of SYP-4 in a PLK dependent manner occurs in response to the formation of a crossover precursor, inhibiting the formation of additional DSBs and promoting the stability of the SC.</p><p>The authors' experiments support most of the conclusions of the paper and the model they propose. The manuscript is clearly written and provides important information about a crucial mechanism that links the stability of synaptonemal complex, the progression of meiotic recombination and the regulation of DSB formation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers and reviewing editor raised a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. Some of the required revisions will likely require further experimentation within the framework of the presented studies and techniques.</p><p>Additional experimental data needed:</p><p>1) More evidence/validation for phospho-specific antibody is needed, since this is such a critical tool. For example, structural changes may be happening that might affect e.g. epitope accessibility. Does the anti-pSYP-4 work for western? If so, show a western of anti-pSYP-4 and sensitivity of the band to phosphatase treatment. At a bare minimum, the authors need to show that SYP-4 is still recruited along chromosomes under conditions where the presumed phospho-specific SYP-4 antibody does not detect a signal, especially in the <italic>plk</italic> mutant condition. The principal evidence for SYP-4-phopho-specificity of the antibody is that the signal is delayed or disappears in the plk-2 and/or plk-1 mutant. But in the same mutant, SYP-1 assembly is also compromised, at a similar stage (e.g. Harper et al., 2011, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D; 6A</xref>). The interdependence between the SYPs was shown in null mutants, but <italic>syp-4(S269A)</italic> could be functional for SC assembly but unstable/reduced later assuming it is not required for SC maintenance. Details should be given about the affinity purification of the antibody: Was that done with a S269-nonphospho-peptide? How was success of the affinity-purification determined?</p><p>2) Please document the effect of <italic>syp-4</italic> point mutants on chromosome segregation or offspring viability (apart from the mild increase in apoptosis).</p><p>3) Quantify and document better the per-chromosome correlation of COSA-1 and pSYP-4. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it doesn't seem that stretches of pSYP 4 signal are first observed only on chromosomes that have a GFP::COSA-1 foci. Some quantification as well as better images should be provided. For example, one could determine the contour of the stretch of pSYP-4 staining and calculate the association of stretches with the COSA-1 foci.</p><p>4) Define single pSYP-4 chromosome in more detail. What is the cause for the single chromosome staining: Is there a second wave of PLK-1 phosphorylation? Is it known which chromosome track stains with pSYP-4 in the DSB break processing mutants? Is it always the same chromosome track? Can some FISH be done to address this? This is off-topic of the main point of the paragraph but it suggests that some chromosome stretches get pro-crossover factors which pSYP-4 can respond to. However, is that a reasonable assumption? This is somewhat important in the interpretation of the pairing data that is presented subsequently. Is there no difference in the pairing data because one chromosome behaves aberrantly from the rest and that happens to be the chromosome you which you tested for pairing?

Although the impact of cellular movement was minimized for intensity measurements, what about chromosomal movements within the cell? Meiotic prophase generally has been shown to display significant changes in motion of its chromosomes. It would be important to have data and a statement that this was not a concern in generating the change of fluorescent intensity. This is particularly important because z-projections were used for the analysis. Chromosome motion instead of incorporation of central element may or may not be distinguished well in projections.</p><p>Major points that can be addressed by text fixes or changes to figures with available data:</p><p>6) Incorporate SC dynamics (and how they change) into the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> model.

Given the SYP-4 involvement in DSB shut-off, this might be a good opportunity to reevaluate the earlier findings. More generally, this would also be a good opportunity to reevaluate the implications of using rad-54 or other recombination-defective mutations as a tool to estimate total DSB levels in wild type.</p><p>9) Provide better introduction and discussion of current results relative to other organisms. Please introduce and discuss similarities and differences of DSB limitation via Plk in <italic>C. elegans</italic> compared to the role of ATM/Tel1 in other organisms. In addition, the discussion of similarities to the homolog engagement pathway for DSB regulation that has been previously documented in yeast and mouse needs to be improved. In the Introduction it is stated: &quot;However, once a DSB is designated to become a CO a feedback mechanism turns off further programmed DSBs from forming (Lam and Keeney 2015). The molecular basis for transmission of this feedback regulation remains an open question.&quot; The first statement is not a fair summary of what is known. And the implication from second sentence seems to be that the current results will address the lack of information, but the connection of the current findings to these other organisms is not convincing. CO designation is one possibility for why &quot;homolog engagement&quot; turns off DSB formation in yeast and mouse, but it is not the only possibility. Keeney's and Toth's labs propose that it is SC formation that triggers DSB inhibition, in part because even non-homologous SC formation in the absence of SPO11 is accompanied by TRIP13-dependent HORMAD depletion from chromosomes in mouse (see Wojtasz 2009, Thacker 2014, and Keeney 2014). In any case, the text shouldn't state it so categorically that DSB inhibition is a consequence of CO designation, because there is certainly no evidence to strongly support that conclusion. Concerning the molecular basis of the feedback: indeed this is not known. But it clearly does not require polo kinase in yeast (Cdc5) because Keeney's lab showed that the homolog engagement (ZMM-dependent) pathway operates even in an ndt80 mutant (Thacker 2014). Cdc5 is not expressed in the absence of Ndt80. Minor point: the Lam and Keeney 2015 paper does not seem to be a particularly apt reference for this general point. Perhaps Keeney et al. 2014 would be better.</p><p>10) Subsection “PLK-2 localization on chromosomes during pachytene is dependent on the SYP proteins”. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the localization in PLK-2 to the nuclear periphery of syp-4 is qualitatively different than in WT. In fact, PLK-2 location is different between <italic>syp-1</italic> and <italic>syp-4</italic> mutants. This is in contrast to the statement in the figure legend that PLK-2 localization is not different. So, either the figure for the <italic>syp-4</italic> mutant is not representative or there is a difference that exists. There is also a distinct difference in the HTP-3 staining for <italic>syp-4</italic>. Some comment should be made.</p><p>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the image contrast/ detection thresholds for WT and <italic>syp</italic> mutants appear to be set differently. If anything, the background should be set lighter in <italic>syp</italic> mutants. The same concern applies for PLK-1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement.1B, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> the <italic>syp-4</italic> and <italic>plk-2</italic> panels. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the colored boxes are hard to see and the fact that different antibodies and stages are identically color-coded is confusing (e.g. green stands for COSA-1 and also midpachytene).</p><p>12) Primary data should be provided for RAD-51 foci in the S269A mutant (i.e. a representative IF image).</p><p>13) The possible cause/effect relationship between SC dynamics and extra RAD-51 should be discussed clearly. While the inference is that continued SC dynamics result in extra DSBs, currently there is no evidence to exclude the reverse relationship. If additional experimental data are available, great; if not, adding discussion would suffice. For example, have the authors explored whether the SC in <italic>syp-4</italic> (A269S) still exhibits high dynamics in the absence of DSBs/SPO-11? If <italic>syp-4</italic> (S269A)-induced SC dynamics persist despite absence of DSBs, this would allow excluding a role of extra DSBs in inducing SC dynamic. Or: does the S269D phosphomimetic mutation eliminate SC dynamics in absence of DSBs? Notably, even in absence of DSBs, some SYP-4 phosphorylation is still happening. Is it possible to compare the SC dynamics phenotypes of S269A and other recombination mutant(s) that assemble apparently normal SC?</p><p>14) Does SYP-4 phos work via chromosome association of DSB-1 and -2? It would be interesting to discuss this possibility.</p><p>15) It seems that the authors' model SYP-4 phos should be more important when total DSBs are low (e.g., in a <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutant or <italic>spo-11</italic> + low IR dose). Did the authors test this? If not, it could be a Discussion point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23437.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers and reviewing editor raised a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. Some of the required revisions will likely require further experimentation within the framework of the presented studies and techniques.</italic> </p><p><italic>Additional experimental data needed:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) More evidence/validation for phospho-specific antibody is needed, since this is such a critical tool. For example, structural changes may be happening that might affect e.g. epitope accessibility. Does the anti-pSYP-4 work for western? If so, show a western of anti-pSYP-4 and sensitivity of the band to phosphatase treatment.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, the anti-pSYP-4 antibody does not work on western blots.</p><p><italic>At a bare minimum, the authors need to show that SYP-4 is still recruited along chromosomes under conditions where the presumed phospho-specific SYP-4 antibody does not detect a signal, especially in the plk mutant condition. The principal evidence for SYP-4-phopho-specificity of the antibody is that the signal is delayed or disappears in the plk-2 and/or plk-1 mutant. But in the same mutant, SYP-1 assembly is also compromised, at a similar stage (e.g. Harper et al., 2011, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D; 6A</xref>). The interdependence between the SYPs was shown in null mutants, but syp-4(S269A) could be functional for SC assembly but unstable/reduced later assuming it is not required for SC maintenance.</italic> </p><p>We now provide several lines of evidence that the pSYP-4 antibody is specific. First, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, we show that SYP-4 is recruited along the homologous chromosomes in the <italic>syp-4(S269A)</italic> phosphodead mutant but we do not detect phosphorylated SYP-4 signal in this mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which argues that the pSYP-4 signal is specific and not a consequence of SYP-4 not being loaded or maintained on the chromosomes. Second, as the reviewers suggested, we now show SYP-4 in addition to SYP-1 localization in the <italic>plk-2;plk- 1(RNAi)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This new data is now mentioned as follows: “We found that pSYP-4 signal, but not SYP-4, was completely lost upon depletion of <italic>plk-1</italic> by RNAi in the <italic>plk-2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>)”. In the <italic>plk-2;plk-1(RNAi)</italic> mutant, we observe an uneven localization for both SYP-1 and SYP-4 along the homologous chromosomes. Specifically, SYP-1 and SYP-4 form tracks of uneven intensity along DAPI-stained chromosomes, and we now clearly indicate that in our revised figure legends for both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. However, even where we observe strong signal for SYP-1 or SYP-4 we still do not observe pSYP-4 signal. We would like to clarify that we did not argue that SYP protein localization is normal in this mutant background. Rather, even though the SYP proteins are able to localize, albeit unevenly, on the chromosomes we did not detect any SYP-4 phosphorylation on those chromosomes. Third, in the recombination defective mutants, even though SYP-1 can still load on the chromosomes, we do not see pSYP-4 localization, except for a single chromosome track in 19.7% of nuclei in mutants for factors involved in early steps of recombination (the pSYP-4 signal is completely absent in pro-crossover mutants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, we do not observe any obvious defects in SC maintenance in the <italic>syp-4(S269A)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these data strongly support the specificity of the phospho SYP-4 antibody.</p><p><italic>Details should be given about the affinity purification of the antibody: Was that done with a S269-nonphospho-peptide? How was success of the affinity-purification determined?</italic> </p><p>As per the reviewer’s request, we now provide additional information about the affinity purification method used for the SYP-4 phospho-specific antibody in the Materials and methods subsection “Antibodies”. A rabbit phospho-specific polyclonal antibody was generated by Abmart using the phospho-peptide C-QFDR(pS)FILAS encompassing the S269 site in SYP-4. Two peptides were synthesized: An antigen peptide with phosphoserine C-QFDR(pS)FILAS and a control peptide without phosphorylation (C-QFDRSFILAS). Serum harvested from the rabbits immunized with the antigen peptides went through two rounds of affinity purification. First, serum was passed through a column to which the antigenic peptide was coupled in order to isolate phospho- specific SYP-4 antibodies. The eluate from the first column was then passed through a second column to which the control peptide was coupled and flow through was collected. This second step was done to remove any non-phosphorylated SYP-4 antibodies. An ELISA titer of ≥ 1:50,000 against the modified peptide and a modified/unmodified titer ratio of ≥ 8 were used as validation criteria. In addition, phospho- specificity of the antibody was tested by immunofluorescence in <italic>syp- 4(S269A)</italic> phosphodead mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Please document the effect of syp-4 point mutants on chromosome segregation or offspring viability (apart from the mild increase in apoptosis).</italic> </p><p>We have now added <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> reporting the brood size, percentage of embryonic lethality, and percentage of males observed in the <italic>syp- 4</italic> point mutants compared to wild type. This new data is now mentioned as follows: “We observed a significant reduction in brood size in both <italic>syp- 4(S269A)</italic> phosphodead and <italic>syp-4(S269D)</italic> phosphomimetic mutants compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, we only saw 6-8% embryonic lethality accompanied by 0.3-1% males among the progeny from these mutants, suggesting only a mild increase of autosomal and X chromosome nondisjunction during meiosis in these mutants, which could stem in part from the &lt;4% of oocytes observed having a reduced number of COSA-1 foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) Quantify and document better the per-chromosome correlation of COSA-1 and pSYP-4. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it doesn't seem that stretches of pSYP 4 signal are first observed only on chromosomes that have a GFP::COSA-1 foci. Some quantification as well as better images should be provided. For example, one could determine the contour of the stretch of pSYP-4 staining and calculate the association of stretches with the COSA-1 foci.</italic> </p><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we now show the quantification of the per- chromosome correlation of COSA-1::foci and pSYP-4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. We also included high-magnification images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> to show the colocalization of pSYP-4 with COSA-1::GFP in early, mid and late pachytene nuclei. The new data is now mentioned as follows: “Strikingly, at that same stage, phosphorylated SYP-4 was first observed on 76% of chromosomes (n=78) with GFP::COSA-1 foci, whereas a low percentage of chromosomes showed either only pSYP-4 signal (5.8%; n=6) or COSA-1 foci (18.4%; n=19) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>)”.</p><p><italic>4) Define single pSYP-4 chromosome in more detail. What is the cause for the single chromosome staining: Is there a second wave of PLK-1 phosphorylation? Is it known which chromosome track stains with pSYP-4 in the DSB break processing mutants? Is it always the same chromosome track? Can some FISH be done to address this? This is off-topic of the main point of the paragraph but it suggests that some chromosome stretches get pro-crossover factors which pSYP-4 can respond to. However, is that a reasonable assumption? This is somewhat important in the interpretation of the pairing data that is presented subsequently. Is there no difference in the pairing data because one chromosome behaves aberrantly from the rest and that happens to be the chromosome you which you tested for pairing? It also would be nice to have some speculation statement about the chromosome track.</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer’s questions we now show that the COSA-1::GFP foci are observed on the chromosomes with the pSYP-4 signal in <italic>spo-11</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) suggesting that SYP-4 phosphorylation occurs in response to CO precursor formation, which is consistent with our model. We also examined which chromosome exhibited the pSYP-4 track in <italic>spo-11</italic> mutants. Specifically, we performed HIM-8 staining to mark the X chromosome and FISH to identify chromosomes III and V in the <italic>spo-11</italic> mutant. We found that 46% of pSYP-4 tracks corresponded to the X chromosome, 11.6% to chromosome V and 9.5% to chromosome III. The higher frequency of pSYP-4 signal along the X chromosome could be due to its distinct chromatin structure and/or a result of it undergoing delayed replication compared to autosomes (Bender et al., 2004; Kelly et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2015; Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007), which might result in DSBs being carried into meiosis. We now include all this new data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3A-C</xref>, and in the main text as follows: “Moreover, a COSA-1::GFP focus was observed on each of these chromosomes exhibiting pSYP-4 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). […] The higher frequency of pSYP-4 tracks along the X chromosome could be due to its distinct chromatin structure and/or a result of it undergoing delayed replication compared to autosomes (Bender et al., 2004; Kelly et al., 2002; Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007), which might lead to a higher number of DNA lesions that could be processed for CO precursor formation during meiosis.”</p><p>Regarding whether there may be a second wave of PLK-1 phosphorylation that could result in this single chromosome with pSYP-4 staining, we were not able to detect PLK-1 signal on chromosomes during pachytene in either wild type or <italic>plk-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), although we cannot rule out the possibility that there is some PLK-1 that is below threshold levels of detection by immunofluorescence as mentioned in the subsection “PLK-localization on chromosomes during pachytene is dependent on the SYP proteins”. Since PLK-2 is still present in the <italic>spo-11</italic> mutant and we see COSA-1::GFP foci on the pSYP-4 tracks, we reason that the single pSYP-4 tracks seen in <italic>spo-11</italic> mutants are due to CO precursor formation and PLK-2-dependent phosphorylation of SYP-4.</p><p><italic>5) Address concerns about chromosome movements within cells for FRAP experiments (subsection “FRAP Analysis”) in regards to FRAP analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Although the impact of cellular movement was minimized for intensity measurements, what about chromosomal movements within the cell? Meiotic prophase generally has been shown to display significant changes in motion of its chromosomes. It would be important to have data and a statement that this was not a concern in generating the change of fluorescent intensity. This is particularly important because z-projections were used for the analysis. Chromosome motion instead of incorporation of central element may or may not be distinguished well in projections.</italic> </p><p>We now include a revised and expanded description in the Materials and methods section that also addresses the issue of chromosome movements. There we now explain that a small region of the nuclei was photobleached throughout the Z stack for the entire length of the nuclei and measured for extent of fluorescence recovery. We used the StackReg plugin in Fiji to correct for gross lateral animal movement and drift. Then we used rigid body registration in StackReg to minimize the impact of chromosomal movement on intensity measurements. In this case, because only the chromosomes are fluorescent (and not the nuclei as a whole) it is precisely the chromosomes themselves that are being registered over time. When this registration failed – for instance the chromosomal structure demonstrated obvious rotation around the lateral plane, and not just lateral translation, or rotation around the detection axis – then nuclei were excluded from further analysis due to our inability to reliably measure intensity of the same chromosomal region over time. Nuclei with the photobleached region (region of interest, ROI) in focus for the entire period of fluorescence recovery were selected for further analyses. To further correct for chromosomal movement, the photobleached regions were traced manually to measure average fluorescence intensity over the duration of the time-lapse.</p><p>We also include now two videos, one depicting an example of a wild type nucleus we scored and another showing a wild type nucleus we did not score due to poor chromosome registration over the duration of the time-lapse –<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Major points that can be addressed by text fixes or changes to figures with available data:</italic> </p><p><italic>6) Incorporate SC dynamics (and how they change) into the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> model. It is also suggested the authors should show the proposed feed-back loop, i.e. showing that DSBs trigger an event that in turn triggers their own switch off.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we have made changes to the model on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> to incorporate SC dynamics and how they change. However, we respectfully choose to keep the current diagram where the negative inhibition on further DSB formation is shown on the chromosome at pachytene after phosphorylation of SYP-4 since our data supports a model in which PLK-1/2-dependent phosphorylation of SYP- 4 in response to CO designation results in changes in SC dynamics and that in turn switches off additional DSB formation along those chromosomes in pachytene.</p><p><italic>7) The authors are careful to point out in the Results section that their data are consistent with phosphorylation of SYP-3 being PLK dependent. However, they start their Discussion with: &quot;We have discovered that phosphorylation of a central region component of the SC, SYP-4, by Polo-like kinases…&quot; and &quot;Our data indicate that Polo-like kinases phosphorylate SYP-4 starting at early pachytene…&quot; The authors haven't provided any data demonstrating that PLK-1 or PLK-2 directly phosphorylates SYP-4. They can only say the phosphorylation is dependent on PLK-1/2 and that their data suggests that polo-like kinases phosphorylate SYP-4 in early pachytene, consistent with PLK-2's localization.</italic> </p><p>We have now carefully gone over the text and made sure that we consistently only indicate that phosphorylation of SYP-4 is PLK-dependent. Examples of these changes are in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>8) In Smolikov et al., PLOS Genetics (2009), elevated levels of persistent RAD-51 foci were interpreted as a defect in recombination progression, rather than as a failure to shut-off DSBs. Given the SYP-4 involvement in DSB shut-off, this might be a good opportunity to reevaluate the earlier findings. More generally, this would also be a good opportunity to reevaluate the implications of using rad-54 or other recombination-defective mutations as a tool to estimate total DSB levels in wild type.</italic> </p><p>In Smolikov et al. (2009) we examined the levels of RAD-51 foci throughout the germline of <italic>syp-4</italic> null mutants. In that case, as in the Colaiacovo et al. (2003) and Smolikov et al. (2007) papers, the different <italic>syp</italic> null mutants (<italic>syp-1, syp-2, syp-3</italic> and <italic>syp-4</italic>) impaired the ability to stabilize homologous chromosome pairing interactions, but not initial DSB formation. As a result, DSBs formed but repair between homologs was not possible due to complete absence of an SC, resulting in persistent DSBs and a lack of crossovers. That is different from this current study in which in the context of the phosphodead and phosphomimetic mutants the SC proteins, such as SYP-4, are still associating with the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and DSB repair can still take place between homologs resulting in detectable CO precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The use of a <italic>rad-54</italic> mutant to essentially “trap” RAD-51 at sites of DSB repair, is currently the only strategy available to assess DSB levels in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. However, available data does argue that elevated RAD-51 can be due to more breaks, delayed repair, and/or increased time where breaks are occurring and therefore caution should be exercised when interpreting alteration of RAD-51 levels.</p><p><italic>9) Provide better introduction and discussion of current results relative to other organisms. Please introduce and discuss similarities and differences of DSB limitation via Plk in C. elegans compared to the role of ATM/Tel1 in other organisms. In addition, the discussion of similarities to the homolog engagement pathway for DSB regulation that has been previously documented in yeast and mouse needs to be improved. In the Introduction it is stated: &quot;However, once a DSB is designated to become a CO a feedback mechanism turns off further programmed DSBs from forming (Lam and Keeney 2015). The molecular basis for transmission of this feedback regulation remains an open question.&quot; The first statement is not a fair summary of what is known. And the implication from second sentence seems to be that the current results will address the lack of information, but the connection of the current findings to these other organisms is not convincing. CO designation is one possibility for why &quot;homolog engagement&quot; turns off DSB formation in yeast and mouse, but it is not the only possibility. Keeney's and Toth's labs propose that it is SC formation that triggers DSB inhibition, in part because even non-homologous SC formation in the absence of SPO11 is accompanied by TRIP13-dependent HORMAD depletion from chromosomes in mouse (see Wojtasz 2009, Thacker 2014, and Keeney 2014). In any case, the text shouldn't state it so categorically that DSB inhibition is a consequence of CO designation, because there is certainly no evidence to strongly support that conclusion. Concerning the molecular basis of the feedback: indeed this is not known. But it clearly does not require polo kinase in yeast (Cdc5) because Keeney's lab showed that the homolog engagement (ZMM-dependent) pathway operates even in an ndt80 mutant (Thacker 2014). Cdc5 is not expressed in the absence of Ndt80. Minor point: the Lam and Keeney 2015 paper does not seem to be a particularly apt reference for this general point. Perhaps Keeney et al. 2014 would be better.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we modified our statement which now reads as follows: “However, the engagement of homologous chromosomes during recombination and/or SC assembly has been proposed to turn off further programmed DSB formation (reviewed in Keeney et al. 2014). One possibility is that once a DSB is designated to become a CO a feedback mechanism turns off further programmed DSBs from forming. An alternative, albeit non-mutually exclusive possibility, is that SC formation may result in structural changes along the chromosomes which suppress further DSB formation.” While we kept the second statement, that the molecular basis of the feedback is not known, we did modify the beginning of the following paragraph to clearly indicate that the findings regarding a polo kinase requirement apply to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We also do this now in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>We also expanded our Discussion to address the similarities and differences of DSB limitation via PLK in <italic>C. elegans</italic> compared to the role of ATM/Tel1 in other organisms and expand on the point that it is SC formation that triggers DSB inhibition in yeast and mouse. Finally, we also replaced the Lam and Keeney (2015) for the Keeney et al. (2014) reference as recommended.</p><p><italic>10) Subsection “PLK-2 localization on chromosomes during pachytene is dependent on the SYP proteins”. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the localization in PLK-2 to the nuclear periphery of syp-4 is qualitatively different than in WT. In fact, PLK-2 location is different between syp-1 and syp-4 mutants. This is in contrast to the statement in the figure legend that PLK-2 localization is not different. So, either the figure for the syp-4 mutant is not representative or there is a difference that exists. There is also a distinct difference in the HTP-3 staining for syp-4. Some comment should be made.</italic> </p><p>In this figure we are showing that PLK-2 still forms aggregates, likely at the pairing centers, during the leptotene/zygotene stage in <italic>syp-1</italic> and <italic>syp-4</italic> mutants, but that we no longer see any PLK-2 signal on pachytene stage nuclei. However, in the <italic>syp-1</italic> and <italic>syp-4</italic> mutants, as previously reported in MacQueen et al. (2002) and Smolikov et al. (2009), while chromosomes initially attempt to pair at leptotene/zygotene, the levels of pairing at that stage are somewhat lower than in wild type. Therefore, the pairing centers of chromosomes are not held in close juxtaposition at the same levels as in wild type. This is why the PLK-2 signal forms fewer and larger aggregates in wild type (where homologs find each other more effectively and start to stabilize those pairing interactions) compared to the <italic>syp</italic> null mutants at that stage (where homologs pair less frequently and do not successfully stabilize those interactions). We now explain this in the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Moreover, we replaced the <italic>syp-1</italic> and <italic>syp-4</italic> mutant images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for more representative images that show the higher number of smaller PLK-2 aggregates observed at leptotene/zygotene in both mutants compared to wild type. The nuclei shown for wild type, <italic>syp-1</italic>, and <italic>syp-4</italic> mutants are all from the same stage.</p><p>HTP-3 staining is different in wild type compared to both <italic>syp-1</italic> and <italic>syp-4</italic> null mutants because chromosomes are synapsed in wild type and therefore their axes are held in close juxtaposition, which is observed as thicker HTP-3 signal, while in the <italic>syp</italic> null mutants homologous chromosomes are not held together and a lot more thinner tracks of HTP-3 are observed. We also explain this now in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the image contrast/ detection thresholds for WT and syp mutants appear to be set differently. If anything, the background should be set lighter in syp mutants. The same concern applies for PLK-1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> the syp-4 and plk-2 panels. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the colored boxes are hard to see and the fact that different antibodies and stages are identically color-coded is confusing (e.g. green stands for COSA-1 and also midpachytene).</italic> </p><p>We have now corrected this and have set the same image intensity for the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we removed the colored boxes and included high-resolution images of single nuclei from early, mid and late pachytene stages to more clearly show the colocalization of COSA-1::GFP foci with pSYP-4.</p><p><italic>12) Primary data should be provided for RAD-51 foci in the S269A mutant (i.e. a representative IF image).</italic> </p><p>We now show a representative IF image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>13) The possible cause/effect relationship between SC dynamics and extra RAD-51 should be discussed clearly. While the inference is that continued SC dynamics result in extra DSBs, currently there is no evidence to exclude the reverse relationship. If additional experimental data are available, great; if not, adding discussion would suffice. For example, have the authors explored whether the SC in syp-4 (A269S) still exhibits high dynamics in the absence of DSBs/SPO-11? If syp-4 (S269A)-induced SC dynamics persist despite absence of DSBs, this would allow excluding a role of extra DSBs in inducing SC dynamic. Or: does the S269D phosphomimetic mutation eliminate SC dynamics in absence of DSBs? Notably, even in absence of DSBs, some SYP-4 phosphorylation is still happening. Is it possible to compare the SC dynamics phenotypes of S269A and other recombination mutant(s) that assemble apparently normal SC?</italic> </p><p>We propose that the SC is stabilized by PLK-dependent phosphorylation, which inhibits further DSB formation. In the absence of PLK-dependent SYP-4 phosphorylation in <italic>syp-4(S269A)</italic> phosphodead mutants, the SC persists in a more dynamic state in mid-pachytene and chromosomes exhibit significantly elevated numbers of DSBs. Consistent with our model, in <italic>spo-11</italic> mutants, which we showed only have &lt;20% of nuclei with pSYP-4 signal along a single chromosome, the SC persisted in a more dynamic state throughout pachytene as measured by FRAP analysis in Machovina et al., 2016 and Pattabiraman and Villeneuve (personal communication). This rules out the argument that it is the extra DSBs that cause the SC to remain in a more dynamic state. We now better address this in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>14) Does SYP-4 phos work via chromosome association of DSB-1 and -2? It would be interesting to discuss this possibility.</italic> </p><p>To address this comment we examined pSYP-4 localization in <italic>dsb-1 and dsb-2</italic> mutants. Similar to what we observed for other mutants defective in early steps of recombination we did not detect pSYP-4 signal in most of the germline nuclei in <italic>dsb-1 and dsb-2</italic> mutants and only a few nuclei showed a pSYP-4 track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This new result is described in the subsection “Phosphorylation of SYP-4 is dependent on crossover precursor formation” and discussed in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>15) It seems that the authors' model SYP-4 phos should be more important when total DSBs are low (e.g., in a dsb-2 mutant or spo-11 + low IR dose). Did the authors test this? If not, it could be a Discussion point.</italic> </p><p>Our model is that SYP-4 is phosphorylated on the chromosomes that undergo interhomolog CO precursor formation. In the absence of CO formation, for example in pro-crossover mutants, although they undergo DSB formation we do not detect SYP-4 phosphorylation. In addition, in <italic>spo-11(ok79)</italic> mutant animals expressing COSA-1::GFP, the pSYP-4 tracks colocalize with COSA-1::GFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This argues that even if a chromosome might undergo only one DSB, as long as this break gets processed into a CO you will get phosphorylated SYP-4 along that chromosome.</p><p>As described for point #14, we examined pSYP-4 localization in <italic>dsb-1</italic> and <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutants, and similar to other recombination defective mutants, we did not detect pSYP-4 signal in most nuclei and only a few nuclei carried a pSYP-4 track (we added this new data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Extrapolating from our <italic>spo-11</italic> mutant analysis, we hypothesize that those chromosomes with the pSYP-4 signal in <italic>dsb- 1</italic> and <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutants also correspond to chromosome that underwent a DSB and CO precursor formation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
