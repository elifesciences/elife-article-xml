In children, a broad array of cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets (defined by cytokine and transcription factor expression) were reactive to both malaria antigens, <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A and <italic>Pf</italic>GARP, while adults had a narrow profile centering on cT<sub>FH</sub>17- and cT<sub>FH</sub>1/17-like subsets following stimulation with <italic>Pf</italic>GARP only. Because T<sub>FH</sub>17 cells are involved in the maintenance of memory antibody responses within the context of parasitic infections, our results suggest that <italic>Pf</italic>GARP might generate longer-lived antibody responses compared to <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A.

Unfortunately, progress has been impeded by a plateau in malaria control since 2015. Antimalarial drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taylor and Juliano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aydemir et al., 2018</xref>) and unprecedented logistical challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic that dramatically impacted the distribution of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets led to an increase in malaria cases in children under 5 years of age from 17.6 million in 2015 to 19.2 million in 2021 in East and Southern African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geneva: World Health Organization, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref>), thus, contributing to reinvigorated prioritization of malaria vaccine initiatives.</p><p>After 30 years of development, the first malaria vaccineâRTS,S/AS01Eâwas approved by the World Health Organization in 2021 for use in children residing in malaria-endemic regions. However, the limited efficacy of RTS,S, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership, 2015</xref>) particularly against severe malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership, 2015</xref>), has motivated the search for additional vaccine candidate antigens, including blood-stage <italic>Pf</italic>-schizont egress antigen-1 (<italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raj et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Pf</italic>-glutamic acid-rich protein (<italic>Pf</italic>GARP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raj et al., 2020</xref>). Antibodies against <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A correlate with significantly lower parasite densities in Kenyan adults and adolescents and substantially reduce schizont replication in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raj et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nixon et al., 2017</xref>), whereas <italic>Pf</italic>GARP-specific antibodies kill trophozoite-infected erythrocytes in culture and confer partial protection against <italic>Pf</italic> challenge in vaccinated nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raj et al., 2020</xref>). The presence of antibodies against <italic>Pf</italic>GARP was associated with a 2-fold-lower parasite density in Kenyan adults and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raj et al., 2020</xref>). Due to the complexity of the parasitesâ life cycle, there is general agreement that a multivalent vaccine would be more efficacious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holder, 1999</xref>). However, determining which antigens hold the most promise for inclusion in next-generation malaria vaccines remains a challenge.</p><p>Many pathogens and vaccines engender protective antibody responses after a single or few exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amanna et al., 2007</xref>), characterized by the production of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tarlinton and Good-Jacobson, 2013</xref>). Affinity maturation takes place in the germinal center (GC), where antigen-specific CD4<sup>pos</sup> T-follicular helper (T<sub>FH</sub>) cells are required not only to provide cellular (CD40L) and molecular (IL-21, IL-4, and IL-13) signals to trigger B-cell proliferation but also to promote GC maintenance and plasmablast differentiation. The GC is also where higher affinity B cells outcompete B cells with lower affinity for T<sub>FH</sub> help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crotty, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crotty, 2019</xref>). T<sub>FH</sub> cells are defined by the expression of a combination of markers, starting with chemokine receptor CXCR5, which directs CD4<sup>pos</sup> T cells from the T-cell zone to engage with follicular B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breitfeld et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crotty, 2011</xref>). Once antigen-experienced T<sub>FH</sub> cells leave the GC, they become circulating T<sub>FH</sub> (cT<sub>FH</sub>) cells and correlate with the generation of long-lasting antibody responses. Interestingly, cT<sub>FH</sub> cells can also come from peripheral cT<sub>FH</sub> precursor CCR7<sup>low</sup>PD1<sup>high</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cells; thus, they also have a GC-independent origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2013</xref>). Expression profiles of CCR6 and CXCR3 further categorize cT<sub>FH</sub> into subsets as follows: cT<sub>FH</sub>1 (CCR6<sup>neg</sup>CXCR3<sup>pos</sup>), cT<sub>FH</sub>2 (CCR6<sup>neg</sup>CXCR3<sup>neg</sup>), and cT<sub>FH</sub>17 (CCR6<sup>pos</sup>CXCR3<sup>neg</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the expression of PD-1, ICOS, CD127, and CCR7 define their functional status: quiescent/central memory cT<sub>FH</sub> (CCR7<sup>high</sup>PD-1<sup>neg</sup>ICOS<sup>neg</sup>CD127<sup>pos</sup>) or activated/effector memory cT<sub>FH</sub> (CCR7<sup>low</sup>PD-1<sup>pos</sup>ICOS<sup>pos</sup>CD127<sup>low/neg</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunham et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, transcription factors (i.e. Bcl6 and cMAF) and cytokines (i.e. interferon-gamma [IFNÎ³], IL-4, and IL-21) are crucial to further defining the role of each cT<sub>FH</sub> subset within the context of their interactions with B cells to promote antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BÃ©langer and Crotty, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seth and Craft, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olatunde et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andris et al., 2017</xref>). Bcl6 facilitates the production of IL-21 by T cells, which aids B-cell affinity maturation and antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nurieva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nurieva and Chung, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). T<sub>FH</sub> cells also secrete cytokines that align with their subset classifications (but are not limited to them), such as IFNÎ³ (T<sub>FH</sub>1), IL-4/IL-13 (T<sub>FH</sub>2), IL-4/IL-5/IL-13 (T<sub>FH</sub>13), and IL-17 (T<sub>FH</sub>17), that direct antibody isotype class-switching and mediate effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crotty, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BÃ©langer and Crotty, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seth and Craft, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olatunde et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gowthaman et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have characterized cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets within the context of both adult and childhood <italic>Pf</italic>-malaria infections, as well as in healthy malaria-naÃ¯ve volunteers after controlled malaria infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2020</xref>). In Mali, where malaria is seasonal, Obeng-Adjei and colleagues showed that T<sub>H</sub>1-polarized cT<sub>FH</sub> PD1<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CXCR3<sup>pos</sup> cells were preferentially activated in children and less efficient than CXCR3<sup>neg</sup> cT<sub>FH</sub> cells in helping autologous B cells to produce antibodies; yet they used US healthy adult cT<sub>FH</sub> cells for their in vitro assays. Therefore, the authors suggested that promoting T<sub>H</sub>2-like CXCR3<sup>neg</sup> cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets could improve antimalarial vaccine efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obeng-Adjei et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, a study in Papua, Indonesia, where malaria is perennial, found that all cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets from adults showed higher activation and proliferation status compared to cT<sub>FH</sub> cells from children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oyong et al., 2022</xref>). After in vitro stimulation with infected red blood cells (iRBCs), they found that all cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets were activated in adults accompanied by IL-4 production, whereas only the T<sub>H</sub>1-polarized cT<sub>FH</sub> subset responded in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oyong et al., 2022</xref>). One study in Uganda, where malaria is holoendemic with seasonal peaks, showed that a shift from T<sub>H</sub>2- to T<sub>H</sub>1-polarized cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets occurred during the first 6 years of life and was associated with the development of functional antibodies against <italic>Pf</italic>-malaria, yet appeared to be independent of malaria exposure and this age-associated shift was also observed in a malaria-naÃ¯ve population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, this study also found that a higher proportion of T<sub>H</sub>17-cT<sub>FH</sub> cells was associated with a decreased risk of <italic>Pf</italic> infection the following year; however, the authors postulated that this phenomenon could have been driven by the previous exposure to the parasite. The observed higher abundance of T<sub>H</sub>2-like cT<sub>FH</sub> cells in children younger than 6 years of age and the age-associated increase in T<sub>H</sub>1-cT<sub>FH</sub> cells achieving the same proportion of T<sub>H</sub>1-cT<sub>FH</sub> cells by 6 years of age and into adulthood appeared to be independent of malaria exposure. Of note, these studies were limited by the use of a two-dimensional gating strategy to classify cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets and whole parasite activation conditions, either during infections or in vitro stimulation assays, leaving the malaria-antigen specificity of the different cT<sub>FH</sub> subset responses undefined. However, these studies highlight progress in the field of evaluating the role of human T<sub>FH</sub> cells in antimalarial immunity.</p><p>Antibody levels appear to be unreliable predictors of malaria vaccine efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stanisic and McCall, 2021</xref>). Thus, establishing a combined immune profile to incorporate other surrogates of protection is warranted. Here, we examined the profile of cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets using multiparameter spectral flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentebibel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2015</xref>) against two malaria vaccine candidate antigens (<italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raj et al., 2014</xref>] and <italic>Pf</italic>GARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raj et al., 2020</xref>]) in a cross-section of children and adults residing in a malaria-holoendemic region of Western Kenya. Our findings revealed significant differences in cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets between children and adults, where children had more abundant cT<sub>FH</sub>1-like cells and showed antigen-specific responses from all cT<sub>FH</sub> types, whereas these responses were limited to cT<sub>FH</sub>17- and 1/17-like cells in adults. Moreover, this study showed that <italic>Pf</italic>GARP triggered Bcl6 expression across cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets, whereas <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A induced more cMAF expression, demonstrating the feasibility of implementing T-cell immune correlates to down-select new malaria candidates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Children had lower anti-PfSEA-1A antibodies compared to adults but similar levels of anti-PfGARP antibodies</title><p>This cross-sectional study selected a convenience sample of 7-year-old children and adults with a mean age of 22.67 years (ranging from 19 to 30 years of age).

Both males and females were enrolled, with 43% (6/14) and 53% (8/15) being female children or adults, respectively. Seroprofiles against a panel of commonly used malaria antigens were generated to confirm the history of previous <italic>Pf</italic>-infections for the selected children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). All participants had high IgG levels against merozoite antigens, apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1), and merozoite surface protein (MSP1), confirming at least one <italic>Pf</italic>-infection within their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">OâFlaherty et al., 2021</xref>). IgG antibodies against circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and CelTOS (liver-stage antigens) were characteristically lower than against blood-stage antigens, yet were present in all study children. We observed a clear bimodal distribution in antibody levels against histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) with half of the children having âhigh-HRP2â vs âlow-HRP2â IgG levels, possibly a reflection of recent malaria history since it has been suggested that HRP2-specific antibodies are short-lived and could serve as a surrogate for a recent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turnbull et al., 2022</xref>).

To simultaneously account for the expression of 17 markers required to define cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets, we instead used FlowSOM unbiased clustering analysis to determine the frequency of cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets from a pool of 1000 CD3<sup>pos</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> cells from each sample (total of 13,000 CD3<sup>pos</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> cells in both children and adults). Based on CXCR3 and CCR6 expressions as well as the expression of effector/memory/activation markers (CCR7, CD127, PD1, and ICOS), cytokines (IFNÎ³, IL-4, and IL-21), and transcription factors (Bcl6 and cMAF), we initially identified 15 meta-clusters within the CD4<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). First, we found different CXCR5 expression levels between meta-clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>); CXCR5 is essential for cT<sub>FH</sub> cells to migrate to the lymph nodes and interact with B cells. Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are from children; however, we found similar observations for adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Because CD45RA<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cells are likely naÃ¯ve cells with transient low expression of CXCR5, yet high expression of CD45RA, we excluded three meta-clusters using these criteria (i.e. MC12, MC14, and MC15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Then, using the overall expression of CXCR3 and CCR6 across the cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and e</xref>), we identified the remaining 12 clusters as follows: MC01 and MC02 were cT<sub>FH</sub>2-like; MC06 and MC07 were cT<sub>FH</sub>1-like; MC09 and MC11 were cT<sub>FH</sub>1/17-like; MC10 and MC13 were cT<sub>FH</sub>17-like.

Thus, revealing a potential difference in engaging cT<sub>FH</sub> help between the two malaria vaccine candidates evaluated in this study.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Summary.</title><p>Illustration of combined findings showing remarkable differences in cT<sub>FH</sub> subset abundance and <italic>Pf</italic>-malaria antigen-specific cytokine and transcription factor responses between children and adults residing in a malaria-holoendemic region of Kenya. Figure created with BioRender.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98462-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Several key points can be made from our results. First, it may be too soon in the field of cT<sub>FH</sub> biology to select only one or two types of cT<sub>FH</sub> subset(s) to measure when evaluating malaria vaccine candidates, especially if we miss essential, albeit transient, correlates of protection for children which may differ in adults. Longitudinal studies with clinical outcomes are needed to determine the impact of the changing dynamics of cT<sub>FH</sub> subset adaptations after repeated malaria infections that lead to premunition and parasite clearance. A Ugandan study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2022</xref>, demonstrated an age-associated change in cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets independent of malaria and, thus, supports the importance of accounting for age when evaluating antigen-specific cT<sub>FH</sub> profiles. Second, our study reveals that adults have a robust cT<sub>FH</sub>17- and cT<sub>FH</sub>1/17-like subset response to <italic>Pf</italic>GARP but not to <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A. In addition to demonstrating differences between malaria antigens, this finding supports the premise that cT<sub>FH</sub>17 cells are important for maintaining immunological memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2023</xref>), which has important implications for evaluating malaria vaccine efficacy. Third, we found a correlation between cT<sub>FH</sub>1or2-like (MC04) and high <italic>Pf</italic>GARP antibodies for both children and adults, indicating that a cT<sub>FH</sub> subset accompanied by high antibody levels could serve as a potential biomarker of protection. More studies are needed to explore this association; however, we postulate that a coalition of cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets might be engaged to develop long-lived antibody responses, and therefore, categorizing subsets as efficient or inefficient might be context-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obeng-Adjei et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As the field of computational immunology and unbiased clustering analyses evolves, it presents an ongoing challenge to meaningfully define cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets. Here, we intentionally chose to use cT<sub>FH</sub>1or2-like nomenclature for meta-clusters MC03, MC04, MC05, and MC08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) because of their low (but not null) CXCR3 and robust IL-4 expression along with Bcl6 and cMAF. CXCR3 expression leans toward a cT<sub>FH</sub>1-like polarization, whereas IL-4 expression indicates a cT<sub>FH</sub>2-like profile when we follow the most commonly used cT<sub>FH</sub> classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seth and Craft, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olatunde et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentebibel et al., 2015</xref>). This difference is crucial as cT<sub>FH</sub>2 cells are described as good promoters for functional GC antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oyong et al., 2022</xref>), whereas cT<sub>FH</sub>1 cells are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obeng-Adjei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oyong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, their definitive classification will require a more in-depth investigation. Although we used malaria antigen-specific stimulation, and not a <italic>Pf</italic>-lysate or iRBCs as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obeng-Adjei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oyong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2022</xref>), adults had significantly more of the quiescent cT<sub>FH</sub>2-like subset (MC02) compared to children who instead had significantly more of the activated cT<sub>FH</sub>1-like subset (MC06), the latter being consistent with the previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obeng-Adjei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oyong et al., 2022</xref>), and more PD1<sup>high</sup> activated and ICOS<sup>high</sup> quiescent cT<sub>FH</sub>1or2-like subsets (MC03 and MC08, respectively). However, even when classifying the cT<sub>FH</sub> meta-clusters as cT<sub>FH</sub>1, cT<sub>FH</sub>2, cT<sub>FH</sub>17, or cT<sub>FH</sub>1/17, the most abundant cT<sub>FH</sub> subset was cT<sub>FH</sub>2 cells for adults (more than 50%), contradicting a previous study showing only ~20% of cT<sub>FH</sub>2 cells for the same age range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2022</xref>). As suggested by Gowthamanâs T<sub>FH</sub> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gowthaman et al., 2019</xref>), T<sub>FH</sub>1 cells are involved in the development of neutralization antibody responses to viruses and bacteria, whereas parasites, such as helminths, lead to a T<sub>FH</sub>2 response. These observations reinforce the need to assess T<sub>FH</sub> subset profiles stratified by exposure to potentially immune-modulating co-infections.</p><p>Transcription factors cMAF and Bcl6 play essential roles in T<sub>FH</sub> development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nurieva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imbratta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). cMAF induces the expression of various molecules, such as ICOS, PD1, CXCR5, IL-4, and IL-21, which are all essential for T<sub>FH</sub> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imbratta et al., 2020</xref>). It was, therefore, not surprising to find that cMAF significantly increased after antigen stimulation for most of the cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets in children. However, again, this expression profile was only observed in the activated cT<sub>FH</sub>1/17-like subset (MC11) after <italic>Pf</italic>GARP stimulation in cells from adults, supporting a role for T<sub>FH</sub>17 cells in the maintenance of immunological memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, cMAF cooperates with Bcl6 in T<sub>FH</sub> development and function and is essential to establish an efficient GC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nurieva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). Bcl6 is also described as being expressed by mature T<sub>FH</sub> cells, inducing the expression of CXCR5 and PD1, but it can also regulate IFNÎ³ and IL-17 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crotty, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nurieva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>). In our study, <italic>Pf</italic>GARP induced a highly significant increase of Bcl6 in cT<sub>FH</sub>2-like and cT<sub>FH</sub>17-like subsets in children, suggesting that <italic>Pf</italic>GARP may be a better candidate to trigger an efficient humoral response in children compared to <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A. Of note, Blimp1, a Bcl6 antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>), was absent from our flow panel and would be of interest to assess in future studies.</p><p>There are several limitations of human immune profiling studies. Similar to other such studies, we used peripheral blood and, thus, were only able to provide a snapshot of the cT<sub>FH</sub> cells. Study participants did not have blood-stage malaria infections at the time of blood collection, and children were 7 years of age; thus, our profiles were by design meant to reflect cT<sub>FH</sub> memory recall responses and demonstrate differences between children and adults. As this was not a birth cohort study design, the number of cumulative malaria infections could have confounded the association between malaria and cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets, causing a certain cT<sub>FH</sub> meta-cluster to arise. Most human immunology studies are unable to assess tissue-resident T<sub>FH</sub> or T<sub>FH</sub> in the lymph nodes. Therefore, we can only speculate on the composition of T<sub>FH</sub> cells observed in children that were perhaps short-lived helper cells and not maintained as T cell memory cells or may have trafficked from the blood into tissues over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Potter et al., 2021</xref>). Using an in vivo nonhuman primate model, Potter et al. showed an entry rate of lymphocyte subsets into peripheral lymph nodes per hour of 1.54% and 2.17% for CD4<sup>pos</sup> central memory (CD45<sup>neg</sup>CCR7<sup>pos</sup>) and effector memory (CD45<sup>neg</sup>CCR7<sup>neg</sup>) T cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Potter et al., 2021</xref>), both of which may include central and effector memory cT<sub>FH</sub> cells. With this in mind, cT<sub>FH</sub> cells seem to be at a crossroads with multiple possible fates. The first one being the recirculation of cT<sub>FH</sub> cells from lymph node to lymph node, whereby a peripheral blood sampling captures migratory cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets, which could explain the cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets we observed still expressing cMAF and Bcl6. A decade ago, it was hypothesized that once a T<sub>FH</sub> cell leaves the lymph node, it can become a PD1<sup>low</sup> memory cT<sub>FH</sub> cell with the possibility of returning to a GC T<sub>FH</sub> stage after a secondary recall response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crotty, 2014</xref>). Other possible fates include becoming a PD1<sup>neg</sup> memory cT<sub>FH</sub> with the same path after recall or progressing to a non-T<sub>FH</sub> cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crotty, 2014</xref>). More recently, a few studies showed circulating CXCR5<sup>neg</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup> cells with T<sub>FH</sub> functions, such as production of IL-21 and the capability to help B cells in systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bocharnikov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Alcazar et al., 2019</xref>), and importantly researchers mapped these circulating CXCR5<sup>neg</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup> cells to an original lymph node CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> T<sub>FH</sub> subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Alcazar et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting another possible outcome for T<sub>FH</sub> cells outside secondary lymphoid organs. To date, no clear destiny has been established for cT<sub>FH</sub> cells in humans, thus highlighting the importance of including a complete panel of cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets to continue to improve our understanding of their respective roles against different pathogens and eliciting long-lived vaccine-induced antibody responses.</p><p>Other limitations of this study include not measuring other cytokines (i.e. IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17) and transcription factors (i.e. T-bet, BATF, GATA3, and RORÎ³t) that have been used in other studies to fully characterize cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crotty, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gowthaman et al., 2019</xref>). Although the heterogeneity in the response of CD40L and IFNÎ³ suggests that our tested malaria antigens did not induce significant differences in the expression of these markers in all our participants, our panel did not include other activated induced markers, such as OX40, 4-1BB, and CD69. However, even with our small sample size, we demonstrated significant age-associated differences in malaria antigen-specific responses from different cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets. To minimize false-positive results that can arise when using algorithms for computational analyses, we ran the statistical tests in triplicate and the clustering algorithm in duplicate to validate our findings.</p><p>In summary, our study provides additional justification for the resources needed to conduct cellular immunological studies of cT<sub>FH</sub> cell signatures and provides insight into which types of cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets during a personâs lifespan assist B cells in the GC to produce long-lived plasmocytes and functional antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moormann et al., 2019</xref>) against malaria. This is particularly important when selecting immune correlates of protection that could be used to predict the efficacy of the next generation of <italic>Pf</italic>-malaria vaccine candidates within various study populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Intracellular staining was performed at 4Â°C for 45 more minutes followed by two washes using the kitâs perm-wash buffer. Data was acquired on a Cytek Aurora with 4 lasers (UMass Chan Flow Core Facility) using SpectroFlo software (Cytek) and compensation for unmixing and fluorescence-minus-one controls.

In addition, previous <italic>Pf</italic> exposure was determined using recombinant proteins to blood-stage malaria antigens: AMA1, MSP1, HRP2, CelTos, and CSP (gifts from Sheetji Dutta, Evelina Angov, and Elke Bergmann from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research). Briefly, 100 Î¼g of each antigen or BSA (Sigma), as a background control, was coupled to ~12 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> nonmagnetic microspheres (Bio-Rad carboxylated beads) and then incubated with study participant plasma (spun down 10,000Ã<italic>g</italic> for 10 min and diluted at 1:100 in the assay dilution buffer) for 2 hr, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-human IgG (BD #555785) diluted 1:1000 for 1 hr and streptavidin (BD #554061) diluted 1:1000 for 1 hr following the manufacturerâs instructions. The MFI of each conjugated bead (minimum of 50 beads per antigen) was quantified on a FlexMap3D Luminex multianalyte analyzer (Xponent software). Results are reported as antigen-specific MFI after subtracting the BSA value for each individual since background levels can vary between individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>OMIQ analysis</title><p>The fcs files were uploaded into the OMIQ platform after passing quality control under SpectroFlo (Cytek) where compensation was re-checked. In OMIQ, we arcsinh-transformed the scale to allow downstream analysis and then gated on singlet live lymphocytes and subsampled the data to yield 87,712 live lymphocytes per sample. Using only lineage markers CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19, CXCR5, and CD25, FlowSOM consensus meta-clustering was run on 100 clusters based on the 87,712 live lymphocytes per sample with a comma-separated k-value of 75 and Euclidean distance metric. Using these 75 meta-clusters, we defined subsets of cells based on lineage markers, such as CD3<sup>pos</sup>CD8<sup>pos</sup>, CD3<sup>neg</sup>CD14<sup>pos</sup>CD19<sup>pos</sup>, and CD3<sup>pos</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup>, and then distinguished CD4<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> (cT<sub>FH</sub>) and CD4<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>neg</sup>CD25<sup>pos</sup> (T regulatory [T<sub>reg</sub>] or T-follicular regulatory [T<sub>FR</sub>]) subsets. CD25 was used to exclude T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>FR</sub> cells which share numerous markers with cT<sub>FH</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wing et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sage et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). EmbedSOM dimensional reduction was used to visualize the different groups of cells, and EdgeR analysis was run to assess the significance of their differences. A clustering heatmap was used to visualize cytokine expression and transcription factor profiles for each subset.</p><p>Focusing on the CD4<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> T<sub>FH</sub> cells, we ran another FlowSOM analysis based on the 1000 CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cells per sample (two samples from the adult group and one sample from the children group were excluded from the analysis as they had less than 1000 CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cells), using extracellular markers CXCR5, CXCR3, CCR6, ICOS, CCR7, CD45RA, CD127, CD40L, and PD1 enabled the identification of 15 meta-clusters. If the fcs file had more than 1000 CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cells, the down-sampling was done randomly by the OMIQ platform algorithm to select only 1000 CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cells within this specific fcs file. From there, we performed UMAP dimensional reduction, heatmaps, and EdgeR analyses; the latter allowed statistical analysis of the cT<sub>FH</sub> abundances. To demonstrate the reproducibility of these results, statistical analysis algorithms were run at least three times downstream of the same clustering algorithm and downstream of repeated clustering algorithms. To assess statistical differences in cytokines and transcription factor expression, we exported the statistics dataset from OMIQ containing MFI values from each marker (IFNÎ³, IL-4, IL-21, Bcl6, and cMAF) per cluster and for each sample and stimulation condition. To assess cytokines and transcription factors without bias, we chose to use the total MFI expression per meta-cluster with the assumption that cells with increased production of the desired analyte trigger an increase in the overall meta-cluster MFI compared to unstimulated cells, and if there is no production of the desired analyte, the overall MFI will not differ. However, the percentage of positive IFNÎ³, IL-4, IL-21, Bcl6, or cMAF using manual gating can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplements 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">6</xref> along with the overlay of the gated positive cells on the CD4<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> UMAP and the cytoplots of the gated positive cells for each meta-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplements 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For this cross-sectional immunology study, we selected both male and female study participants (sex defined at birth). There were fourteen 7-year-old children and fifteen adults. Using GraphPad Prism software (version 7.0), age, sex, ALC, and serological data were compared between adults and children. Because the number of participants within each group was too low to verify the normality of the underlying distributions (adults n=15 and children n=14), we chose to use non-parametric tests, including the Mann-Whitney U test (for unpaired analysis) and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (for paired analysis). When data passed the normality test (DâAgostino and Pearson test), we used Welchâs parametric test. All tests were two-tailed with a p-value&lt;0.05 for significance. Because of the exploratory nature of the analysis, we did not use any adjustment of the p-value for multiple comparisons. The tests used are indicated in the legend of each figure.

PBMC samples from children and adults were unstimulated or stimulated with PfSEA-1A or PfGARP in vitro for 6h and analysed by a cTfh-focused panel. Unsupervised clustering and analysis on cTfh was performed. The main conclusions are: (A) the children cohort has a more diverse (cTfh1/2/17) recall responses compared to adults (mainly cTfh17) and, (B) Pf-GARP stimulates better cTfh17 responses in adults, thus a promising vaccine candidate.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study is, in general, well-designed and with excellent data analysis. The use of unsupervised clustering is a nice attempt to understand the heterogeneity of cTfh cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors have provided additional data in Supplementary Figures 14-16. However, I remain concerned about whether cTfh cells are truly responding to antigen stimulation. In Supplementary Figure 15A-F, the IFNg responses appear as expected, SEB elicits the strongest response, as it stimulates bulk T cells, and the staining is promising, showing a clear distinction between IFNg+ and IFNg- populations. However, in Supplementary Figure 15I-N, the IL-21 secretion assay is concerning. The FACS plots make it difficult to distinguish IL-21+ from IL-21- cells, raising concerns about the validity of this analysis. Additionally, in panel J, the responses to PfSEA-1A or PfGARP appear even greater than those to SEB stimulation. In PBMCs, only a small percentage of T cells should be specific to a particular antigen. How can the positive control (SEB) produce a weaker response than stimulation with a specific antigen? This suggests that the IL-21 secretion assay may not have worked, making the authors' interpretation unreliable.</p><p>I also have similar concerns about the IL-4 secretion in Sup Figure 16. First, the FACS plot shows that appear double-positive for IL-21 and IL-4, so it suggests the staining may be due to autofluorescence rather than true cytokine signals. Also in B-C the responses of SEB stimulation is generally weaker than stimulated by one antigen, further questioning the reliability of the IL-4 assay. In summary, I am not convinced that the in vitro antigen stimulation assay worked as intended. Consequently, the manuscript's claims regarding PfSEA-1A- and PfGARP-specific cTfh responses are not sufficiently supported by the presented data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98462.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The goal of this study was to carry out an in-depth granular and unbiased phenotyping of peripheral blood circulating Tfh specific to two malaria vaccine candidates, PfSEA-1A and PfGARP, and correlate these with age (children vs adults) and protection from malaria (antibody titers against Plasmodium antigens.)

As it stands, the study is not really on antigen-specific T cells, but rather on the overall CD4 T cell compartment plus or minus antigenic stimulation. Although authors used an in vitro restimulation strategy with malaria antigens, they do not focus on cells de-novo expressing activation markers as a result of restimulation, neither they use tetramers to detect antigen-specific T cells. Moreover, their data shows that the number of CXCR5+ CD4 T cells de-novo expressing activation markers and/or cytokines as a result of their in vitro restimulation is negligible, even when using a prototypic superantigen (SEB).</p><p>Thus, no antigen-specific CXCR5+ CD4 T cells could be analysed with the data that the authors provide in this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98462.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #4 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript is a descriptive study of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) responses to PfSEA -1A or PfGARP (targets of new antimalaria vaccine candidates) in PBMCs from a convenience sample of children (7 yrs of age) and adults living in a malaria holo endemic Kenya using multiparameter flow cytometry and clustering analysis.

In vitro, stimulation on cTfh cells has been frequently used (e.g. Dan et al, PMID: 27342848), usually by antigen stimulation for 9h and analysed CD69/CD40L expression, or 18h and CD25/OX40.

However, in this paper, the authors report the significant secretion of IL-4 and IFNg on some cTfh clusters after 6h stimulation. If the stimulation is antigen-specific through TCR, why cTfh1 cells upregulate IL-4 but not IFNg in Figure 6? I believe including the representative FACS plots of IL-4, IFNg, IL21 staining, and using %positive rather than MFI can make the conclusion more convincing. Similarly, the author should validate whether TCR stimulation under their system for 6h can induce robust BCL6/cMAF expression in cTfh cells. Moreover, there is no CD40L expression. Does this mean TCR stimulation mediated BCl6/cMAF upregulation and cytokine secretion precede CD40L expression?</p><p>In summary, I am particularly concerned about the method used to analyse <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A and <italic>Pf</italic>GARP-specific cTfh responses because it lacks proper validation.

An unexpected delay, frankly, was the COVID-19 pandemic when non-essential research lab activities were put on hold. We designed our panel in 2019 and referred to the âT Follicular Helper Cellsâ Methods and Protocols book from Springer 2015. Obviously the field of human immunology took a huge leap forward during the pandemic as we sought to characterize components of protective immunity, and as a result there are several new markers we will choose for future studies of Tfh subsets. We agree with the reviewer that cytokine expression kinetics differ depending on the in vitro stimulation conditions. Due to small blood volumes obtained from healthy children, we were limited in the number of timepoints we could test. However, since we were most interested in IL21 expression, we found 6 hrs to be the best in combination with the other markers of interest during our optimization experiments. We did find IFNg expression from non-Tfh cells, therefore we believe our stimulation conditions worked.</p><p>Dan et al used stimulated tonsils cells to assess the CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>PD1<sup>pos</sup>CD45RA<sup>neg</sup> Tfh and CXCR5<sup>neg</sup> CD45RA<sup>neg</sup> non-Tfh whereas in our study, we evaluated CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>PD1<sup>pos</sup>CD45RA<sup>neg</sup> Tfh from PBMCs. Dan et al PBMCsâ work used EBV/CMV or other pathogen product stimuli and only gated on CD25<sup>pos</sup>OX40<sup>pos</sup> cells which are not the cells we are assessing in our study. This might explain in part the differences in cytokine kinetics, as we evaluated CD25<sup>neg</sup> PBMCs only. However, we agree that more recent studies focused on CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>PD1<sup>pos</sup> cells included more Activation-induced marker (AIM) markers, which are missing in our study, inducing a lack of depth in our analysis.</p><p>Percentage of positive cells and MFI are complementary data. Indeed, the percentage of positive cells only indicates which cells express the marker of interest without giving a quantitative value of this expression. MFI indicates how much the marker of interest is expressed by cells which is important as it can indicate degree of activation or exhaustion per cell. Meta-cluster analysis is not ideal to assess the percentage of positivity whereas it does provide essential information regarding the intensity of expression. We added supplemental figures 14 (Bcl6 and cMAF), 15 (INFg and IL21) and 16 (IL4 and IL21) where percentage of positive cells were manually gated directly from the total CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup>CD45RA<sup>neg</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> TfH based on the FMO or negative control, and we overlaid the positive cells on the UMAP of all the CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup>CD45RA<sup>neg</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> meta-clusters. Results from the manual gating are consistent with the results we show using clustering. However, it helps to better visualize that antigen-specific IL21 expression was statistically significant in children whereas the high background observed for adults did not reveal higher expression after stimulation, perhaps suggesting an upper threshold of cytokine expression (supplemental figure 15). The following sentence has been added in the methods at the end of the âOMIQ analysisâ section: â However, the percentage of positive IFNð¾, IL-4, IL-21, Bcl6, or cMAF using manual gating can be found in Supplemental Figures 14, 15, and 16 along with the overlay of the gated positive cells on the CD4<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> UMAP and the cytoplots of the gated positive cells for each meta-cluster (Supplemental Figures 14, 15, and 16).â</p><p>Indeed cMAF can be induced by TCR signaling, ICOS and IL6 (Imbratta et. al, 2020). However, in our study populations, ICOS was expressed (see Author response image 1, panel A) in absence of any stimulation suggesting that CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup>CD45RA<sup>neg</sup> cells were already capable of expressing cMAF. Indeed, after gating Bcl6 and cMAF positive cells based on their FMOs (Author response image 1, panel B and C, respectively), we overlaid positive cells on the CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup>CD45RA<sup>neg</sup> cells UMAP and we can see that most of our cells already express cMAF alone (Author response image 1, panel D), co-express cMAF and Bcl6 (Author response image 1, panel E), confirming that they are TfH cells, whereas very few cells only expressed Bcl6 alone (Author response image 1, panel F). Because we knew that cT<sub>FH</sub> already expresses Bcl6 and cMAF, we focused our analysis on the intensity of their expression to assess if our vaccine candidates were inducing more expression of these transcription factors.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98462-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The section between lines 246-269 is confusing. Line 249, comparing the abundance after antigen stimulation is improper because 6h stimulation (under Golgi stop) should not induce cell division. I think the major conclusions are contained in Figure 5e, that (A) antigen stimulation will not alter cell number in each cluster and (B) children have more MC03, 06 and fewer MC02, etc. The authors should consider removing statements between lines 255-259 because the trends are the same regardless of stimulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, there is no cell division after 6h and that different meta clusters did not proliferate after this short of in vitro stimulation. The use of the word âabundanceâ in the context of cluster analysis is in reference to comparing the contribution of events by each group to the concatenated data. After the meta clusters are defined and then deconvoluted by study group, certain meta clusters could be more abundant in one group compared to another - meaning they contributed more events to a particular metacluster.</p><p>Dimensionality reduction is more nuanced than manual gating and reveals a continuum of marker expression between the cell subsets, as there is no hard âstraight lineâ threshold, as observed when using in 2D gating. Because of this, differences are revealed in marker expression levels after stimulation making them shift from one cluster to another - thereby changing their abundance.</p><p>To clarify how this type of analysis is interpreted, we have modified lines 255-259 as follows:</p><p>âIn contrast, the quiescent <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A- and <italic>Pf</italic>GARP-specific cT<sub>FH</sub>2-like cluster (MC02) was significantly more abundant in adults compared to children (Figure 5c and 5d, <italic>pf</italic>&lt;0.05). Interestingly, following <italic>Pf</italic>GARP stimulation, the activated cT<sub>FH</sub>1/17-like subset (MC09) became more abundant in children compared to adults (Figure 5d, <italic>pf</italic>&lt;0.05 with a False Discovery Rate=0.08), but no additional subsets shifted phenotype after <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A stimulation (Figure 5c).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Forconi et al explore the heterogeneity of circulating Tfh cell responses in children and adults from malaria-endemic Kenya, and further compare such differences following stimulation with two malaria antigens. In particular, the authors also raised an important consideration for the study of Tfh cells in general, which is the hidden diversity that may exist within the current 'standard' gating strategies for these cells. The utility of multiparametric flow cytometry as well as unbiased clustering analysis provides a potentially potent methodology for exploring this hidden depth. However, the current state of analysis presented does not aid the understanding of this heterogeneity. This main goal of the study could hopefully be achieved by putting all the parameters used in one context, before dissecting such differences into their specific clinical contexts.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Understanding the full heterogeneity of Tfh cells in the context of infection is an important topic of interest to the community. The study included clinical groupings such as age group differences and differences in response to different malaria antigens to further highlight context-dependent heterogeneity, which offers new knowledge to the field. However, improvements in data analyses and presentation strategies should be made in order to fully utilize the potential of this study.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In general, most studies using multiparameter analysis coupled with an unbiased grouping/clustering approach aim to describe differences between all the parameters used for defining groupings, prior to exploring differences between these groupings in specific contexts. However, the authors have opted to separate these into sections using &quot;subset chemokine markers&quot;, &quot;surface activation markers&quot; and then &quot;cytokine responses&quot;, yet nuances within all three of these major groups were taken into account when defining the various Tfh identities. Thus, it would make sense to show how all of these parameters are associated with one another within one specific context to first logically establish to the readers how can we better define Tfh heterogeneity. When presented this way, some of the identities such as those that are less clear such as &quot;MC03/MC04/ MC05/ MC08&quot; may even be better revealed. once established, all of these clusters can then be subsequently explored in further detail to understand cluster-specific differences in children vs adults, and in the various stimulation conditions. Since the authors also showed that many of the activation markers were not significantly altered post-stimulation thus there is no real obstacle for merging the entire dataset for the first part of this study which is to define Tfh heterogeneity in an unbiased manner regardless of age groups or stimulation conditions. Other studies using similar approaches such as Mathew et al 2020 (doi: 10.1126/science.abc8) or Orecchioni et al 2017 (doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-01015-3) can be referred to for more effective data presentation strategies.</p><p>Accordingly, the expression of cytokines and transcription factors can only be reliably detected following stimulation. However, the underlying background responses need to be taken into account for understanding &quot;true&quot; positive signals. The only raw data for this was shown in the form of a heatmap where no proper ordering was given to ensure that readers can easily interpret the expression of these markers following stimulation relative to no stimulation. Thus, it is difficult to reliably interpret any real differences reported without this. Finally, the authors report differences in either cluster abundance or cluster-specific cytokine/ transcription factor expression in Tfh cell subsets when comparing children vs adults, and between the two malaria antigens. The comparisons of cytokine/transcription factor between groups will be more clearly highlighted by appropriately combining groupings rather than keeping them separate as in Figures 6 and 7.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for sharing these references. Similar to SPADE clustering and ViSNE dimensionality algorithms used in Orecchioni et al, we used all the extracellular markers from our panel in our FlowSOM algorithm with consensus meta-clustering which includes both the chemokine receptors and activation markers even though they are presented separately in our manuscript across the figure 3 and 4. This was explained in the methods section (lines 573 - 587). We then chose the UMAP algorithm as visual dimensionality reduction of the meta-clusters generated by FlowSOM-consensus meta-clustering as explained under the âOMIQ analysisâ subpart of our methods (lines 588- 604). Therefore, we believe we have conducted the analysis as this reviewer suggests even if we chose to show the figures that were informative to our story. The heatmap of the results brings the possibility to see which combination of markers respond or not to the different conditions and between groups, all the raw data are present from the supplemental figures 10 to 13 showing, using bar plots, the differences expressed in the heatmaps. We believe it strengthens our interpretation of the results.</p><p>Regarding the transcription factor and cytokine background, we added supplemental figures 14, 15 and 16 where we used manual gating to select Bcl6, cMAF, IFNg, IL21 or IL4 positive cells directly from total CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup>CD45RA<sup>neg</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> TfH cells based on the FMO or negative control, and we overlaid the positive cells on the UMAP of all the CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup>CD45RA<sup>neg</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> meta-clusters. Moreover, all the dot plots (with their statistics) used for the heatmap figure 6 and 7 can be found in the supplemental figures 10, 11, 12 and 13. These supplemental figures address the concerns above by showing the difference of signals between unstimulated and stimulated conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The goal of this study was to carry out an in-depth granular and unbiased phenotyping of peripheral blood circulating Tfh specific to two malaria vaccine candidates, <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A and <italic>Pf</italic>GARP, and correlate these with age (children vs adults) and protection from malaria (antibody titers against Plasmodium antigens.). The authors further attempted to identify any specific differences in the Tfh responses to these two distinct malaria antigens.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors had access to peripheral blood samples from children and adults living in a malaria-endemic region of Kenya. The authors studied these samples using in vitro restimulation in the presence of specific malaria antigens. The authors generated a very rich data set from these valuable samples using cutting-edge spectral flow cytometry and a 21-plex panel that included a variety of surface markers, cytokines, and transcription factors.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- Quantifying antigen-specific T cells by flow cytometry requires the use of either 1- tetramers or 2- in vitro restimulation with specific antigens followed by identification of TCR-activated cells based on de-novo expression of activation markers (e.g. intracellular cytokine staining and/or surface marker staining). Although authors use an in vitro restimulation strategy, they do not focus their study on cells de-novo expressing activation markers as a result of restimulation; therefore, their study is not really on antigen-specific cTfh. Moreover, the authors report no changes in the expression of activation markers commonly used to identify antigen-specific T cells upon in vitro restimulation (including IFNg and CD40L); therefore, it is not clear if their in vitro restimulation with malaria antigens actually worked.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewerâs point of view and apologies for any confusion. IFNg was expressed but not statistically different between groups. Indeed, looking at the CD8 T cells and using manual gating, we were able to show that IFNg was increased but not statistically significant upon stimulation from CD4<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cells (supplemental figure 15, panel C), confirming our primary observation using clustering analysis. These results showed that our malaria antigen induced IFNg response in some participants, but not all of them, revealing heterogeneity in this response among individuals within the same group.</p><p>Regarding CD40L, in the supplemental figure 7, we can see that some of our meta-clusters expressed more CD40L upon stimulation, but again without leading to statistical differences between groups. Combined with the increased expression of other cytokines and transcription factors, we showed that our stimulation did indeed work. However, because of the high variation within groups, there were no statistical differences across our groups. Because CD40L is not the only marker showing specific T cell activation, and not all T cells respond using this marker alone, a more comprehensive multimarker AIM panel might have highlighted differences between groups. We recognized the limitations of our study and believe that future study will benefit from more activation markers commonly used to identify antigone-specific T cells such as CD69, OX40, 4-1BB (AIM panel), among other markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- CXCR5+CD4+ memory T cells have been shown to present multi-potency and plasticity, capable of differentiating to non-Tfh subsets upon re-challenge. Although authors included in their flow panel a good number of markers commonly used in combination to identify Tfh (CXCR5, PD-1, ICOS, Bcl-6, IL-21), they only used one single marker (CXCR5) as their basis to define Tfh, thus providing a weak definition for Tfh cells and follow up downstream analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion, even though the subsampled on the CD4<sup>pos</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> CD25<sup>neg</sup> cells to run our FlowSOM, we showed the different levels of expression across meta-clusters (figure 4 panels A and B) of PD1 (Tfh being PD1 positive cells) and ICOS (indicating the activation stage of the Tfh, âT Follicular Helper Cellsâ Methods and Protocols book from Springer 2015). We also included an overlay of the manually gated double positive Bcl6-cMAF cells on the CXCR5<sup>pos</sup>CD45RA<sup>neg</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup> CD4 T cell UMAP plot to show that most of them express Bcl6 (supplemental figure 14). Interestingly, the manually gated IL21 positive cells were less abundant, particularly for children (supplemental figure 15). Because we were not able to include all the markers that are now used to define Tfh cells, we referred to our cell subsets as âTFH-likeâ. This is an acknowledged limitation of our study. Due to the limited blood volume obtained from children and cost of running multiplex flow cytometry assays, our results showing antigen-specific heterogeneity of Tfh subset will have to be validated in future studies that include these additional defining markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Previous works have used FACS-sorting and in vitro assays for cytokine production and B cell help to study the functional capacity of different cTfh subsets in blood from Plasmodium-infected individuals. In this study, authors do not carry out any such assays to isolate and evaluate the functional capacity of the different Tfh subsets identified. Thus, all the suggestions for the role that these different cTfh subsets may have in vivo in the context of malaria remain highly hypothetical.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, low blood volumes obtained from children prevented us from running in vitro functional assays and the study design did not allow us to correlate them with protection. However, since the function of identified Tfh subsets from malaria-exposed individuals has been evaluated using Pf lysates in other studies, we referenced them when interpreting the differences we reported in Tfh subset recognition between malaria antigens. If either of these antigens move forward into vaccine trials, then evaluating their function would be important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors have not included malaria unexposed control groups in their study, and experimental groups are relatively small (n=13).</p></disp-quote><p>This study design did not include the recruitment of malaria naive negative controls as its goal was to assess malaria antigen-specific responses comparing the quality and abundance between malaria-exposed children to adults to these potential new vaccine targets <italic>Pf</italic>SEA-1A and <italic>Pf</italic>GARP. We did however test 3 malaria-naive adults and found no non-specific activation after stimulation with these two malaria antigens. Since this was done as part of our assay optimization, we did not feel the need to show these negative findings.</p><p>And even with our small sample size, we demonstrated significant age-associated differences in malaria antigen-specific responses from cT<sub>FH</sub>-like subsets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor points are:</p><p>(1) Line 88, cTfh cells are not only from GC-Tfh, they have GC-independent origin (He et al, PMID: 24138884).</p></disp-quote><p>The following sentence was added line 88 âInterestingly, cT<sub>FH</sub> cells can also come from peripheral cT<sub>FH</sub> precursor CCR7<sup>low</sup>PD1<sup>high</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cells; thus, they also have a GC-independent origin (He, Cell, 2013 PMID: 24138884).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I believe all participants were free of blood-stage infection upon enrolment.

The correct approach would be to gate on those cells that respond by de-novo expression of activation markers upon antigen restimulation (also termed activation-induced markers. e.g. CD69, CD40L, CXCL13 and IL-21, Niessl 2020; CD69, CD40L, CD137 and OX40, Lemieux 2023; CD137 and OX40, Grifoni 2020). As it stands, the study is not really on antigen-specific T cells, but rather on the overall CD4 T cell compartment plus or minus antigenic stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognized the limitation in our flow panel design which prevents us from performing this gating. We originally based our panel design on the âT follicular helper cells methods and protocolsâ book (Springer 2015) which used CD45RA, CD25, CXCR5, CCR6, CXCR3, CCR7, ICOS and PD1 to define cT<sub>FH</sub>. We had already optimized our 21-color panel, purchased reagents and started to run our experiments by the time these publications modified how to define TFH cells Niessl, Lemieux and Grifoniâs publication. Indeed we optimized and performed our assay from November 2019 to March 2020, finishing to run the samples during the first quarantine. Because of the urgent needs of research on SARS-CoV-2 that we were involved with from this time and moving forward, the analysis of our TFH work got highly postponed. Moreover, 2020 is also the year where many TFH papers came out with better ways to define cT<sub>FH</sub> and responses to antigen stimulations. In our future studies, our panel will include AIM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is not clear if the antigenic stimulation actually worked. Does the proportion of IFNg+ or IL-4+ or IL-21+ or CD40L+ or CD25+ CD4 or CD8 T cells increase following in vitro antigen restimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, using manual gating, we are able to show an increase of IL4 (supplemental figure 16 panel B and C), and IL21 (supplemental figure 15 panel J and K) production in both children and adults. However, we did not observe significant production of IFNg (supplemental figure 15, panel C) and changes in CD40L expression (supplemental figure 7) after malaria antigen stimulation, however, our positive control SEB worked. So, yes our stimulation assay worked but these 2 malaria antigens did not significantly induce these cytokines. This could be that they are too low to detect in every participant since they are single antigens and not whole parasite lysates, as other studies have used. It could also be that these antigens donât stimulate CD40L or IFNg in all our participants. We brought up this limitation as follow in the discussion, line 473: âAlthough the heterogeneity in the response of CD40L and IFNÎ³ suggests that our tested malaria antigens did not induce significant differences in the expression of these markers in all our participants, our panel did not include other activated induced markers, such as OX40, 4-1BB, and CD69â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is not clear what is the proportion of cTfh over the total CD4 T cell compartment among the different groups. Does this vary among different groups? It would be valuable to display this as an old-fashioned combination of contour plots with outliers for illustrating flow cytometry and bar graphs for the cumulative data.</p></disp-quote><p>The proportion of CD3<sup>pos</sup>CD4<sup>pos</sup>CD25<sup>neg</sup>CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cTfh cells did not differ within the total number of CD4 T cells between groups (figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The gating strategy could be refined and become more robust if adding additional markers in combination with CXCR5 for identifying cTfh (e.g. CXCR5+Bcl6+).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

If the fcs file had more than 1,000 CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cells, the down-sampling was done randomly by the OMIQ platform algorithm to select only 1,000 CXCR5<sup>pos</sup> cells within this specific fcs file. The latest sentence was added to the methods line 593.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Lanes 201, 202, As it stands, the take of the authors on the role of different cTfh subsets during infection remains highly speculative. Are these differences in cTfh phenotypes actually reflected in their in vitro capacity to provide B cell help (e.g. as in the Obeng-Adjei 2015 paper) or to produce IL-21, express co-stimulatory molecules, or any other characteristic that would allow them to better infer their functional roles during infection? Any additional in vitro analysis of the functional capacity of isolated cTfh subsets identified in this research would greatly increase its value.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this sentence is speculative, and we rephrase it as follow: âFirst, we found different CXCR5 expression levels between meta-clusters (Figure 3b); CXCR5 is essential for cT<sub>FH</sub> cells to migrate to the lymph nodes and interact with B-cellsâ. We would have liked to perform in vitro functional assays. However, as explained above, we did not have sufficient cells collected from children to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) It is not clear why authors omitted IL-17 and did not use IFNg and IL-4 to refine their definition of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cTfh.</p></disp-quote><p>We would have liked to include IL-17, however we were constrained by only having access to a 4 lasers cytometer at the time we ran our assay. In light of needing to prioritize markers, when we were designing our flow panel, cTfh1 were shown to be preferentially activated during episodes of acute febrile malaria children (Obeng-Adjei). Therefore, we chose to focus on IFNg and IL4 to differentiate Tfh1 from Tfh2, in addition to other markers as surrogate of functional potential. We did not use IFNg and IL4 to refine our definition of Tfh1, Tfh2 and Tfh17 as recent publications have shown that IL4 is not only expressed in Tfh2 but also in the other Tfh subsets, at lower intensity (Gowthaman among others). Therefore IFNg and IL4 by themselves were not sufficient to properly define the different Tfh subsets. In future studies, we plan to include transcription factor profiles (T-bet, BATF, GATA3) to further refine definitions of Tfh subsets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Lines, 226, 228, based on the combination of markers that the MC03 subset expresses, it is tempting to think that this is the only &quot;truly&quot; committed Tfh subset from the entire analysis. Please, discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>If the reviewer is referring to changes in marker expression levels that indicate they have not reached a level of differentiation that would make them reliable (ie âtrue) Tfh cells, we agree that this is an important question now that we have technology that can measure and analyse so many phenotypic markers at once. This brings forward the need for the scientific method - to replicate study findings to determine whether they are consistent given the same study design and experimental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Lines 243 244, Again, is this reflected in functional capacity?</p></disp-quote><p>The study described in this manuscript did not include functional assays. However, this did not change the key finding that different malaria antigens behaved differently, demonstrating heterogeneity in Tfh recognition of malaria antigens. Regarding CD40L expression, we did not observe differences between groups, however some individuals had an increase of their CD40L (supplemental figure 7). It is possible that some individuals had responded through other activated induced markers (CD69, ICOS, OX40, 4-1BB among others) and that our stimulation condition was not long enough to assess CD40L expression upon malaria antigen stimulation. This limitation has been addressed by editing the line 243-244 as follows: âwe were unable to find statistical differences in the CD40L expression between groups as only few individuals responded through it (supplemental figure 7).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Lines 243, 244, Are these cTfh subsets exclusively detected in malaria-exposed individuals? This is confounded by the lack of a malaria unexposed control group in this study, which would have been highly valuable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that having non-naive children would have been valuable as a negative control group. However, this study was conducted in Kenya where all children are suspected to have had at least one malaria infection. We also did not have ethical approval or the means to enroll children in the USA who would not have been exposed to malaria as a negative control group. Since we were also evaluating differences by age group, comparing US adults would not have helped to address this point. Therefore, this remains an open question that might be addressed by another study recruiting children in non-malaria endemic areas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Line 267, as the authors have not gated on T cells de-novo expressing activation markers in response to antigen restimulation, how do they know these are indeed antigen-specific cTfh?</p></disp-quote><p>Omiq analysis accounts for marker expression levels in the resting cells (unstimulated well) for each individual compared to each experimental/stimulated well. The algorithm computationally determines whether that expression level changed without an arbitrary positive threshold, keeping the expression levels as a continuous variable, not dichotomous - which is the power of unbiased cluster analyses. Therefore, we know that these cells are antigen-specific based on the statistical difference in intensity expression between the resting cells and the stimulated ones. Nevertheless, manual gating to show âde-novoâ responding cells, produced the same results as assessing the MFI of each meta-cluster (supplemental figures 14, 15 and 16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Lines, 292-295, it is very surprising that Tfh cells would not produce IL-21 upon restimulation.
