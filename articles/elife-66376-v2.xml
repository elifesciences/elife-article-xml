With the aim to design MprF inhibitors that could sensitize MRSA to antimicrobial agents and support the clearance of staphylococcal infections with minimal selection pressure, we developed MprF-targeting monoclonal antibodies, which bound and blocked the MprF flippase subunit. Antibody M-C7.1 targeted a specific loop in the flippase domain that proved to be exposed at both sides of the bacterial membrane, thereby enhancing the mechanistic understanding of bacterial lipid translocation. M-C7.1 rendered MRSA susceptible to host antimicrobial peptides and antibiotics such as daptomycin, and it impaired MRSA survival in human phagocytes. Thus, MprF inhibitors are recommended for new antivirulence approaches against MRSA and other bacterial pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus

rates undermines the significance and efficacy of available antibiotics against bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Årdal et al., 2020</xref>). Several opportunistic antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens including methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and extended-spectrum beta-lactam or carbapenem-resistant proteobacteria impose a continuously growing pressure on modern healthcare systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tacconelli et al., 2018</xref>). MRSA is responsible for a large percentage of superficial and severe bacterial infections and the available last-resort antibiotics are much less effective than beta-lactams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, no new class of antibiotics has entered the clinical phase since the introduction of the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Årdal et al., 2020</xref>). Novel anti-infective strategies that would circumvent on the one hand the difficulties in identifying new microbiota-preserving small-molecule antimicrobials and, on the other hand, the enormous selection pressures exerted by broad-spectrum antibiotics, are discussed as potential solutions against a looming postantibiotic era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dickey et al., 2017</xref>). Such strategies could be based for instance on therapeutic antibodies or bacteriophages, which usually have only a narrow activity spectrum. A possible direction could be the inhibition of bacterial targets that are of viable importance only during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lakemeyer et al., 2018</xref>). Blocking such targets by so-called antivirulence or antifitness drugs would preserve microbiome integrity and create selection pressure for resistance-conferring mutations only on invading pathogens. Interfering with bacterial virulence factors should ameliorate the course of infection and enable more effective bacterial clearance by the immune system or by antibiotics.</p><p>Monoclonal antibodies (mABs) directed against antivirulence targets could be interesting alternatives provided the target can be reached by comparatively large antibody molecules. Therapeutic mABs are used in several malignant, inflammatory, and viral diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O’Brien et al., 2021</xref>) and have proven efficacy in toxin-mediated bacterial infections such as anthrax or clostridial toxin-mediated diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dickey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Migone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lowy et al., 2010</xref>). Apart from toxin neutralization, however, mABs have hardly been applied in antimicrobial development programs. Moreover, in-depth molecular studies are necessary to devise most promising targets for mABs and elucidate if and how mAB binding could disable pathogens to colonize and infect humans.</p><p>The multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF), a large integral membrane protein, is crucial for the capacity of bacterial pathogens such as <italic>S. aureus</italic> to resist cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) of the innate immune system and CAMP-like antibiotics such as daptomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peschel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ernst and Peschel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Slavetinsky et al., 2017</xref>). MprF is highly conserved and can be found in various Gram-positive or Gram-negative pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Slavetinsky et al., 2017</xref>). MprF proteins proved to be crucial for in vivo virulence of various pathogens in infection models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peschel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thedieck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maloney et al., 2009</xref>) and when exposed to human phagocytes as a result of increased resistance to phagocyte-derived antimicrobial agents such as CAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Slavetinsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kristian et al., 2003</xref>). Some parts of the protein are located at the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and could in principle be reached by mABs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2015</xref>). MprF forms oligomers and it is a bifunctional enzyme, which can be separated into two distinct domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2015</xref>). The C-terminal domain synthesizes positively charged lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (LysPG) from a negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol (PG) acceptor and a Lys-tRNA donor substrate, while the N-terminal domain translocates newly synthesized LysPG from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane and thus functions as a phospholipid flippase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roy and Ibba, 2009</xref>). The exposure of LysPG at the outer surface of the membrane reduces the affinity for CAMPs and other antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, <italic>mprF</italic> is a major hot spot for gain-of-function point mutations that lead to daptomycin resistance, acquired during therapy of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ernst et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In order to assess the suitability of MprF as a target for antivirulence agents we developed mABs targeting several epitopes of potential extracellular loops of its transmembrane part and analyzed their capacity to bind specifically to <italic>S. aureus</italic> MprF. We identified a collection of mABs, which did not only bind to but also inhibited the LysPG flippase domain of MprF. Our results suggest that a specific loop between two of the transmembrane segments (TMSs) of MprF is exposed at both sides of the membrane suggesting an unusual, potentially flexible topology of this protein part, which may be involved in LysPG translocation. Accordingly, targeting this loop with a specific mAB inhibited the MprF flippase function, rendered <italic>S. aureus</italic> susceptible to killing by antimicrobial host peptides and daptomycin, and reduced <italic>S. aureus</italic> survival when challenged by human CAMP-producing polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of mABs binding to putative extracellular loops of MprF</title><p>The hydrophobic part of <italic>S. aureus</italic> MprF appears to include 14 TMS connected by loops with predicted lengths between 2 and 56 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2015</xref>). Several of the loops are located at the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, accessible to mABs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Peptides representing 4 loops with a minimum length of 13 amino acids were synthesized with N- and C-terminal cysteine residues to allow cyclization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). The peptides corresponded to three loops predicted to be at the outer membrane surface (loops 1, 9, and 13) and loop 7, the location of which has remained ambiguous due to conflicting computational and experimental findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2015</xref>). The N-terminal amino groups of cyclized peptides were linked to biotin to facilitate their recovery and detection. The antigen peptides were incubated with MorphoSys’s Human Combinatorial Antibody Library (HuCAL), a phage display library expressing human Fab fragments with highly diverse variable regions at the phage surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prassler et al., 2011</xref>). Antigen-binding phages were enriched in three iterative rounds of panning in solution and antigen-phage complexes were captured with streptavidin-coated beads. The bound phages were extensively washed to remove unspecifically binding phages, eluted, and propagated in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for a subsequent panning round. Washing steps were prolonged and antigen concentrations reduced from round one to round three to increase stringency and discard antibodies with low specificity and affinity. DNA of the eluted, antigen-specific phages was isolated and subcloned in specific <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vectors to yield His-tagged fragment antigen-binding (Fab) molecules. 368 individual colonies per antigen were picked and Fab fragments were expressed and purified. A representative selection of 24 unique Fabs against all 4 peptides were converted to human IgG by cloning in an IgG1 expression vector system and expression in human HKB11 cells and IgGs were purified via protein A chromatography, as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prassler et al., 2011</xref>) (see graphical workflow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) topology and binding of monoclonal antibodies (mABs) to MprF-expressing <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MprF membrane topology is given according to our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2015</xref>) showing synthase and flippase domains in gray and black, respectively.

Cells were then disrupted, membranes were solubilized by treatment with the mild nonionic detergent <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-<sc>D</sc>-maltoside (DDM), and proteins were separated in nondenaturing PAGE gels (BN-PAGE). If M-C7.1 bound before cell disruption and remained tightly attached to MprF, it should shift the MprF bands in Western blots of the blue native gels and the MprF–M-C7.1 complex should be detectable after Western blotting with a human IgG-specific secondary antibody. In order to detect MprF independently of M-C7.1, an MprF variant translationally fused to green-fluorescent protein (MprF-GFP, expressed from plasmid pRB-MprF-GFP), which is detectable by a GFP-specific primary antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2015</xref>), was also used and treated in the same way. To detect potentially nonshifted MprF proteins in the native MprF variant (pRB-MprF), M-C7.1 was used as additional primary antibody. <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA113<italic>ΔspaΔmprF</italic> bearing the empty vector (pRB) was used as a negative control. In addition to M-C7.1, all three <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains were also incubated with the control antibody L-1. <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells expressing either unmodified MprF or MprF-GFP yielded a protein band migrating at a molecular weight of around 900 kDa when preincubated with M-C7.1 but not with L-1 or in cells with the empty-vector control (pRB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the empty-vector control (pRB) strain showed an unspecific band at 300 kDa when preincubated with M-C7.1 or at 150 kDa when preincubated with L-1 but no MprF-specific band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The 900 kDa band of MprF-GFP was detected by both, M-C7.1 and, with a weaker signal, anti-GFP, confirming the identity of MprF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We could recently show that MprF forms oligomers in the staphylococcal membrane, which were migrating at ca. 300 and 600 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2015</xref>). Bands migrating at similar heights (ca. 250 and 500 kDa) were detected specifically in the MprF-GFP lanes after preincubation with either M-C7.1 or L-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggesting that they represent the oligomerized but not the mAB-complexed MprF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the 900 kDa bands probably represent a complex formed by MprF and M-C7.1, which confirms that M-C7.1 specifically binds MprF loop seven in live <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells. The fact, that M-C7.1 used as primary antibody was not able to detect 250 and 500 kDa bands of noncomplexed MprF proteins while the MprF–M-C7.1 complex can directly be detected via antihuman secondary antibody, suggests that M-C7.1 binding only occurs in the living staphylococcal cell.

Native <italic>S. aureus</italic> MprF contains six cysteines none of which is conserved in MprF proteins from other bacteria suggesting that they do not have critical functions.

However, the mutated proteins conferred lower resistance levels than the wild-type protein, presumably because of less efficient protein folding or stability. Cysteines were then inserted into MprF loop seven (T263) and, as a control, into the first intracellular loop (loop 2, A99) and the last extracellular loop (loop 13, T480), the localization of which had been consistently confirmed by previous computational and experimental analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>).

Notably, MprF loop 7 was found in both locations, at the inner and outer surface of the membrane.

In contrast, mABs inhibiting crucial cellular mechanisms of bacterial pathogens have hardly been assessed so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). We developed specific mABs, which can block the activity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> MprF, the first described bacterial phospholipid flippase. Our mABs did not mediate increased internalization of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells, most probably because the bacterial cell wall is too thick to allow binding of the mAB FC part to phagocyte FC receptors. However, the inhibition of MprF by M-C7.1 sensitized <italic>S. aureus</italic> to CAMPs and daptomycin and promoted killing by human PMNs, which use CAMPs as an important component of their antimicrobial arsenal. Specific inhibition of MprF could therefore promote the capacity of human host defense to clear or prevent a <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection and would, at the same time, increase the susceptibility of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to CAMP-like antibiotics such as daptomycin. Thus, targeting bacterial defense mechanisms provides a promising concept for antivirulence therapy. The capacity of antibodies to traverse the cell wall and reach the cytoplasmic membrane of <italic>S. aureus</italic> has remained controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reichmann et al., 2014</xref>).

Loop 7 is located between predicted TMS 7 and 8, and its presence at the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane had remained elusive since computational and experimental analyses had yielded conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, we found loop 7 to be accessible from both, the outside and inside of the cytoplasmic membrane. This suggests that the protein part formed by loop 7 and adjacent TMS 7 and 8 may change its position in the protein complex, moving between the two membrane surfaces to accomplish LysPG translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), or it could be in a unique position of the large MprF protein complex that allows access from both sides. This protein part might represent the center of the MprF flippase establishing the previously reported MprF-dependent distribution of charged LysPG in the inner and outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). While this manuscript was in revision, the three-dimensional structure of the MprF protein of <italic>Rhizobium tropici</italic> was reported. It demonstrates that the region corresponding to the <italic>S. aureus</italic> MprF loop 7 is part of a gate between two large protein cavities, which are accessible from the outer and inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and allow for the passage of LysPG molecules between the two membrane leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Song et al., 2021</xref>). Song et al. suggest a mechanistic model where LysPG binding in the inner protein cavity of the MprF flippase results in a transient channel formation/gate opening allowing LysPG to diffuse into the outer protein cavity which would put the M-C7.1-binding site in the center of the flipping process. This model would explain why M-C7.1 binding to MprF seems to require the live <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell to achieve structural accessibility to MprF. Moreover, Song et al. confirmed that MprF forms homodimers and larger oligomers. These structural data support our functional data and provide molecular explanations.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) inhibition by M-C7.1.</title><p>Flipping of positively charged lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (LysPG) probably by transmembrane segment (TMS) 7 and 8 of MprF results in a more positively charged staphylococcal membrane, which is better able to repulse cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) or daptomycin (DAP).

Notably, one of the conserved and essential amino acids in TMS 7, D254, is negatively charged. It is tempting to speculate that D254 may interact with the positively charged head group of LysPG during the translocation process in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> MprF. Mutations on loop 7 and adjacent TMS have recently been found to cause specific resistance to the structurally related lipopeptide antibiotics daptomycin and friulimicin B but not to other antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ernst et al., 2018</xref>). Indirect evidence has suggested that these mutations allow the flippase to translocate these lipopeptide antibiotics instead of or together with LysPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ernst et al., 2018</xref>), which is in agreement with a direct role of loop 7 in the translocation process. A mAB-binding loop 13 also sensitized <italic>S. aureus</italic> to nisin in a similar but less pronounced way as M-C7.1 suggesting that this loop may also have a critical role for MprF activity.</p><p>With the severe shortage of new antibiotic target and drug candidates, crucial cellular machineries conferring fitness benefits during infection rather than accomplishing essential cellular functions should be considered as targets for the development of new therapeutics. The phospholipid synthase and flippase MprF may become a role model for further targeting of bacterial defense mechanisms for such antifitness or antivirulence drugs. Compared to other potential targets, MprF has the advantage that essential parts of it are exposed at the external surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Moreover, MprF is found in many other bacterial pathogens for which similar therapeutic mABs could be developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, only a few amino acids in loop 7 are conserved in other bacteria, which would limit the impact of loop-7-directed mABs on other microbiome members thereby minimizing the resistance selection pressure and the risk of dysbiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, maintenance, and mutagenesis of mprF</title><p>We used commonly used strains, the methicillin-susceptible laboratory strain <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA113 (ATCC 35556), methicillin-resistant clinical clone <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300, and the SA113 <italic>mprF</italic> knockout derivative SA113<italic>ΔmprF</italic>, which has been described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peschel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).</p><p>For the construction of a protein A mutant (Δ<italic>spa</italic>) the <italic>E. coli/S. aureus</italic> shuttle vector pKOR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae and Schneewind, 2006</xref>) was used, which allows allelic replacement with inducible counterselection in staphylococci.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dorte Frees (Reviewer #2); Gabriella Marincola (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study would be of interest to readers who specialise in infectious diseases research and treatment. The authors developed a monoclonal antibody that sensitises Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> to host peptides and antibiotics. Treatment with the antibody decreased bacterial survival in phagocytes. Overall, the antibody could be used as potential new therapeutic, diminishing the severity of <italic>S. aureus</italic>-associated disease. At this stage, the in vivo efficacy remains unknown.</p><p>1. A more thorough assessment of CAMP sensitization to show a dose response is needed to fully support the conclusions (i.e., checkerboard analysis with increasing concentrations of antibody and CAMPs).</p><p>2. The authors should address the potential for resistance to develop. Since mprF mutations confer resistance to CAMPs, did the authors consider assessing the propensity of the target to mutate in the presence of their monoclonal antibody?</p><p>3. The anti-virulence scope, as indicated by the title and the introduction, is not aligned with the actual content of the Results section and needs to be improved. The in vivo potential of anti-virulence strategies is evident throughout the introduction, but is only preliminarily address in the results. In contrast, a large part of Results section (lines 146-214) investigates the position of one specific loop of the MprF protein.</p><p>4. Figure 1A and throughout the manuscript. Although the antigens are predicted to be exposed to the extracellular site of the membrane they would not be accessible to antibodies because of the cell wall, as was shown for LTA. This polymer despite being exposed to the exterior of the membrane is not accessible to antibodies unless the cell wall is degraded. This crucial point needs to be discussed. (Reichmann NT et al., Differential localization of LTA synthesis proteins and their interaction with the cell division machinery in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Mol Microbiol. 2014 Apr;92(2):273-86. Doi: 10.1111/mmi.12551. PMID: 24533796; PMCID: PMC4065355.)</p><p>5. Figure 1B, would the IgG binding Sbi impact the result? Could the observed differences between wt and mutant be indirect (the changed membrane composition in the mprF cells may impact broadly on secretion of proteins, hence, unspecifically changing the surface antigenicity of the cells). I acknowledge that a humanized isotype mAB was used as a control, but to rule out the indirect effect, I think it would be better to use an antibody targeting a <italic>S. aureus</italic> surface molecule as a control.</p><p>6. Line 171-173, “the 900-kDa band of MprF-GFP was detected by both M-C7.1 and anti-GFP confirming the identity of MprF”. This conclusion is not well supported: the anti-GFP detects a smear of proteins in this area in both Figure 2A and Figure S4, and seems to have some specificity for a protein complex around 480 kDa that was, however, not recognized by the C7.1 antibody. How can this be explained and how does this affect the conclusions?</p><p>7. How does the unspecific binding observed for the C7.1 antibody (to the 300 kDa band) affect the results shown in Figure 1B and Figure 3? In Figure 3, how does an mprF mutant survive the same treatment? It could also be relevant to test the effect in a strain background with gain of function mutations in mprF.</p><p>8. Untreated wt and mprF strains should be included in Figure 4BC to fully evaluate this result.</p><p>9. A mprF negative mutant and preferentially also a mprF gain of function mutant should be included as controls in Figure 5.</p><p>10. Line 235-240. The impact of the work would increase if the authors determine and show the Daptomyicin MIC of the DAP-R strain with or without M-C7.1 (as control they could use the strains from Suppl. Figure S3: ∆mprF complemented with empty plasmid (low MIC) or with intact MprF (high MIC)).</p><p>11. Line 129-135 and Supplemental Figure 2. In the Figure one can see that the peptide corresponding to loop 1 binds not just to its own mAb (M-C1) but also to the ones directed against loop 7 and 9 (M-C7.2 and M-C9.2). This is the reason why the authors did not work further with these two mAbs. They write in line 134 “Antibodies M-C1, M-C7.1, M-C7.3, M-C9.1, M-C13.1, and M-C13.2 bound significantly stronger to MprF….” (Figure 1 B). However, all of them do (including the two which show less selectivity in the supplemental figure). I find this to be a bit confusing for the reader.</p><p>12. Line 154-186. Although the M-C7.1 antibody does seem to bind MprF (and I am aware of the challenge involved in blotting a blue native gel and obtaining sharp visible bands), it is very difficult to see and follow bands in figure 2A. Arrows which point to the putative bands the authors are referring to in the text (i.e. the 250, 500 and 900 kDa bands), would be extremely helpful for the reader. Also, the gel image in supplemental figure 4 is much more intuitive. Maybe the authors want to consider using these instead of 2A?</p><p>13. Line 196-200. The authors write that cysteines in MprF do not have critical functions and indeed the mutant complemented with the cysteine-deficient MprF or with the other version of MprF showed an increased MIC towards Dapto (Supplemental Figure 3). However, it is also clear that they do NOT do it to the same extent as a wild type MprF (Supplemental Figure 3 black column). It would be important to discuss this result. (In this figure, it would be easier for the reader to add a ∆mprF label below the graph, to immediately understand that it is the mutant complemented with various plasmids).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66376.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study would be of interest to readers who specialise in infectious diseases research and treatment.

Figure 1A and throughout the manuscript. Although the antigens are predicted to be exposed to the extracellular site of the membrane they would not be accessible to antibodies because of the cell wall, as was shown for LTA. This polymer despite being exposed to the exterior of the membrane is not accessible to antibodies unless the cell wall is degraded. This crucial point needs to be discussed.

Figure 1B, would the IgG binding Sbi impact the result? Could the observed differences between wt and mutant be indirect (the changed membrane composition in the mprF cells may impact broadly on secretion of proteins, hence, unspecifically changing the surface antigenicity of the cells). I acknowledge that a humanized isotype mAB was used as a control, but to rule out the indirect effect, I think it would be better to use an antibody targeting a <italic>S. aureus</italic> surface molecule as a control.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this suggestion, and we use now monoclonal antibody E-1 binding the surface-exposed elastin-binding protein of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (EbpS) now as an additional control (changed Figure 1B).

They are mentioned in the Results section (lines 137-139):</p><p>“An additional mAB directed against the <italic>S. aureus</italic> surface protein EbpS served as positive control, showing equal affinity towards SA113<italic>Δspa</italic> and SA113<italic>ΔspaΔmprF</italic> (Figure 1B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. line 171-173, &quot;the 900-kDa band of MprF-GFP was detected by both M-C7.1 and anti-GFP confirming the identity of MprF&quot;. This conclusion is not well supported: the anti-GFP detects a smear of proteins in this area in both Figure 2A and Figure S4, and seems to have some specificity for a protein complex around 480 kDa that was, however, not recognized by the C7.1 antibody. How can this be explained and how does this affect the conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this part needs better explanation. The experiment shown in Figure 2A is meant to show the non-covalent interaction of MprF or MprF-GFP oligomers with M-C7.1. Since SDS-PAGE would disrupt these interactions, we had to use blue-native PAGE, which yields less defined protein bands. Nevertheless, blue-native PAGE is a valuable and widely accepted technique and the identity of the band at around 900 kDa is clear as it is detects the MprF(-GFP)-M-C7.1 complex by anti-human secondary antibody and is absent in the <italic>mprF</italic> mutant. This band could also be detected with the anti-GFP antibody, albeit with lower efficiency compared to detection with M-C7.1. It is possible that the MprF-GFP-M-C7.1 complex shields the GFP tag from binding by the GFP antibody to some degree. On the other hand, M-C7.1 (used as primary antibody as well) seems to bind the non-complexed MprF-GFP oligomer less efficiently than the M-C7.1-complexed MprF-GFP oligomer, which may explain that the MprF-GFP band at ca. 480 kDa (described as 500 kDa in the manuscript) is hardly visible when detected with M-C7.1. We assume that M-C7.1 binds MprF in live <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells preferentially during the process of LysPG flipping which is supported by the recently solved structure of <italic>Rhizobium tropici</italic> MprF, published while this manuscript was in revision (Song, D., H. Jiao, and Z. Liu, Phospholipid translocation captured in a bifunctional membrane protein MprF. Nat Commun, 2021. 12(1): p. 2927). It shows that the M-C7.1 target sequence is in the putative active center of the flippase. This center forms a barrier / gate for LysPG and the authors speculate that it opens to a channel during the flipping process. Such a conformational accessibility would explain why only the MprF-M-C7.1 complex is detected (directly by the anti-human secondary antibody) and non-M-C7.1 bound MprF oligomers are hard to detect with M-C7.1 (as primary antibody).</p><p>However, the specificity of protein bands that appeared upon complexation of MprF-GFP oligomers with M-C7.1 is clearly demonstrated by the absence of these bands in the <italic>mprF</italic> mutant and in samples complexed with control antibody L1. We moved the previous Figure S4 to the main manuscript as new Figure 2A and deleted and modified the corresponding text to explain the findings better. The modified text in the Results section reads (lines 182-185):</p><p>“The fact, that M-C7.1 used as primary antibody was not able to detect 250 and 500-kDa bands of non-complexed MprF proteins while the MprF-M-C7.1 complex can directly be detected via secondary antibody, suggests that M-C7.1 binding only occurs in the living staphylococcal cell.”</p><p>The modified text in the Discussion section reads (lines 322-324):</p><p>“This model would explain why M-C7.1 binding to MprF seems to require the live <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell to achieve structural accessibility to MprF.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. How does the unspecific binding observed for the C7.1 antibody (to the 300 kDa band) affect the results shown in Figure 1B and Figure 3?</p></disp-quote><p>We find unspecific binding of M-C7.1 only to isolated proteins in blue-native PAGE (Figure 2A) but not with intact <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells (Figure 1B). M-C7.1 may therefore unspecifically bind an antigen that is not accessible in intact cells, e.g. a cytoplasmic protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, how does an mprF mutant survive the same treatment?

It confirms that the <italic>mprF</italic> mutant is much more susceptible to daptomycin and that M-C7.1 does not further lower its susceptibility. Strikingly, it also demonstrates that both WT and strain 703 with an amino acid exchange in a protein region of the MprF loop targeted by M-C7.1 is also sensitized to daptomycin by M-C7.1. These data are mentioned in the Results section (lines 241-242):</p><p>“Of note, M-C7.1 could reduce daptomycin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of both, <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA113 WT and the DAP-R strain 703 (Figure 3F),…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Untreated wt and mprF strains should be included in Figure 4BC to fully evaluate this result.</p></disp-quote><p>The requested controls were added to new Figure 4B and 4C, which confirm our findings. These experiments show that the WT and <italic>mprF</italic> mutant strains bind similar amounts of cytochrome c or annexin V when incubated without or with control mAB L-1 while M-C7.1 treatment alters the binding capacities of the WT. These data are mentioned in the Results section (lines 260-263):</p><p>“Treatment of SA113 WT with M-C7.1 at concentrations that increased the susceptibility to nisin led to a significant increase in the capacity to bind cytochrome C or annexin V compared to SA113 WT without treatment or treated with isotype control mAB L-1…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. A mprF negative mutant and preferentially also a mprF gain of function mutant should be included as controls in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We have demonstrated that <italic>S. aureus mprF</italic> mutants are equally well phagocytosed but more efficiently inactivated by human neutrophils in two previous publications (Peschel et al., J Exp Med 2001 193:1067-76; Kristian et al., Infect Immun 2003 71:546-9). That M-C7.1 does not further affect the susceptibility of an <italic>S. aureus mprF</italic> mutant to cationic antimicrobial peptides is shown in new Figure 3F. We hope therefore, it will not be necessary to include more controls in Figure 5, which would require high amounts of M-C7.1, most of which has been used up now for the other experiments.

Line 129-135 and Supplemental Figure 2. In the Figure one can see that the peptide corresponding to loop 1 binds not just to its own mAb (M-C1) but also to the ones directed against loop 7 and 9 (M-C7.2 and M-C9.2). This is the reason why the authors did not work further with these two mAbs. They write in line 134 &quot;Antibodies M-C1, M-C7.1, M-C7.3, M-C9.1, M-C13.1, and M-C13.2 bound significantly stronger to MprF….&quot; (Figure 1 B).

Line 154-186. Although the M-C7.1 antibody does seem to bind MprF (and I am aware of the challenge involved in blotting a blue native gel and obtaining sharp visible bands), it is very difficult to see and follow bands in figure 2A. Arrows which point to the putative bands the authors are referring to in the text (i.e. the 250, 500 and 900 kDa bands), would be extremely helpful for the reader. Also, the gel image in supplemental figure 4 is much more intuitive.

The authors write that cysteines in MprF do not have critical functions and indeed the mutant complemented with the cysteine-deficient MprF or with the other version of MprF showed an increased MIC towards Dapto (Supplemental Figure 3). However, it is also clear that they do NOT do it to the same extent as a wild type MprF (Supplemental Figure 3 black column). It would be important to discuss this result. (In this figure, it would be easier for the reader to add a ∆mprF label below the graph, to immediately understand that it is the mutant complemented with various plasmids).</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we are grateful for this helpful suggestion.
