shape-based representations. In two psychophysics and neuroimaging experiments, we characterized the response properties, topographical organization and perceptual relevance of these representations. In both pathways, shape sensitivity increased from early visual cortex to extrastriate cortex but then decreased in anterior regions. Moreover, the lateral aspect of the ventral pathway and posterior regions of the dorsal pathway were sensitive to the availability of fundamental shape properties, even for unrecognizable images. This apparent representational similarity between the posterior-dorsal and lateral-ventral regions was corroborated by a multivariate analysis. Finally, as with ventral pathway, the activation profile of posterior dorsal regions was correlated with recognition performance, suggesting a possible contribution to perception. These findings challenge a strict functional dichotomy between the pathways and suggest a more distributed model of shape processing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27576.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We rely on our sense of vision to perceive the world around us and the objects within it. We also use vision to guide our interactions with objects. One of the most influential theories in cognitive neuroscience is the idea that separate pathways within the brain support these two processes. The ventral pathway is in charge of vision-for-perception. It analyses the features that help us recognize objects, such as their color, size or shape, enabling us to identify the hammer in a toolbox, for example. The dorsal pathway is responsible for vision-for-action. It processes features that help us interact with objects, such as their movement and location, enabling us to use the hammer to strike a nail.</p><p>However, recent studies have suggested that the ventral and dorsal pathways may not be as independent as originally thought. Freud et al. now test this idea by examining if the dorsal vision-for-action pathway can also perceive and process objects.</p><p>Healthy volunteers viewed pictures of objects while lying inside a brain scanner. Some of the objects in the pictures were intact, whereas others had been distorted. If a brain region shows greater activation when viewing intact objects than distorted ones, it implies that that region is sensitive to the normal shapes of objects. Freud et al. found that both the ventral and dorsal pathways were sensitive to shape, with some areas in the two pathways showing highly similar responses. Furthermore, the shape sensitivity of certain regions within the dorsal pathway correlated with the volunteers’ ability to recognize the objects. This suggests that regions distributed across both pathways – and not just the ventral one – may contribute to object recognition.</p><p>The two-pathways hypothesis has governed our understanding of vision and of other sensory systems including hearing for several decades. By challenging the binary distinction between the two pathways, the results of Freud et al. suggest that models of sensory processing may require updating. This improved understanding may ultimately improve diagnosis and treatment of perceptual disorders such as agnosia, in which patients struggle to recognize objects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>central visual pathways</kwd><kwd>shape perception</kwd><kwd>dorsal pathway</kwd><kwd>ventral pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant No. 65/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freud</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Yad Hanadiv Postdoctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freud</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCS-1354350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plaut</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name><name><surname>Behrmann</surname><given-names>Marlene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004897</institution-id><institution>Pennsylvania Department of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plaut</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 130345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Culham</surname><given-names>Jody C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional neuroimaging reveals sensitivity to shape information and correlation between brain activation and perceptual behaviour in both dorsal and ventral visual pathways, thereby challenging the strict binary distinctions between the two pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Shape is the most fundamental perceived property of objects, and, accordingly, shape processing is crucial for successful visual object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palmer, 1999</xref>). Deriving information about the shapes of objects in the input has long been considered to be under the purview of the ventral visual pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodale and Milner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ungerleider and Mishkin, 1982</xref>) and many functional imaging studies have provided evidence to support this claim (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grill-Spector et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malach et al., 1995</xref>). Specifically, these investigations have uncovered a gradient of shape sensitivity in the ventral pathway, with posterior regions in the early to mid-visual cortex (i.e., V1-hV4) being less responsive to the shape of the object than more anterior regions, such as the Lateral Occipital Cortex (LOC) and the Fusiform Gyrus (FG). Additionally, shape sensitivity in these latter, anterior regions is correlated with perceptual abilities, and a lesion to these areas results in an impairment in object perception (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freud et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodale et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Konen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It appears, however, that shape perception is not solely a product of the computations mediated by the ventral pathway. Human neuroimaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong and Xu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Konen and Kastner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zachariou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zachariou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bracci and Op de Beeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bracci et al., 2017</xref>), primate electrophysiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Janssen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Dromme et al., 2016</xref>); for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Theys et al., 2015</xref>), comparative studies between human and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denys et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sawamura et al., 2005</xref>) and human neuropsychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freud et al., 2017a</xref>) have all uncovered object representations mediated by the dorsal pathway, even under conditions in which no visuomotor response is required. However, many questions remain concerning the topographical organization of the dorsal object representations, the nature of the visual properties encoded in these representations and their contribution to perceptual behavior.</p><p>In the current study, we addressed these questions in two studies, each combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and psychophysical measures. We hypothesized that the large-scale topographical organization of dorsal object representations obeys a spatial gradient in which posterior regions of the pathway derive shape representations and contribute to visual perception, whereas more anterior regions derive representations that are better tuned to subserve visuomotor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freud et al., 2016</xref>). Our motivation stems from two key issues concerning dorsal pathway function: the first is the need to reconcile recent findings of dorsal pathway activation under conditions of perception (as noted above) with the well-established findings that the dorsal pathway is engaged in object-directed actions such as grasping and manipulation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Culham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fabbri et al., 2016</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallivan and Culham, 2015</xref>). The second concerns the connectivity that anchors the parietal representational continuum at one end with more caudal regions connected to visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greenberg et al., 2012</xref>) and, at the other end, with more rostral regions anatomically and functionally connected to motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davare et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We adopt an approach that has been used previously to characterize the neural basis of shape processing in ventral cortex in response to stimuli in which shape information is parametrically eliminated by increasingly distorting images of objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2001</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for example). The decrease in BOLD activation with increased scrambling serves as an index of shape sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denys et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grill-Spector et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malach et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murray et al., 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27576.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental stimuli (<bold>A</bold>) and a quantitative analysis of ‘goodness of shape’ following the different scrambling procedures (<bold>B</bold>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Box scrambling experiment (upper row). Shape information was altered by dividing the display using an invisible grid and then randomly rearranging the squares. The diffeomorphic scrambling experiment (bottom row) distorted the outer contour and distinctive features of the object, while preserving the existence of a single shape but rendering it increasingly unrecognizable. This is achieved by repeatedly applying a flow field generated from a set of two-dimensional cosine components with random phase and amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stojanoski and Cusack, 2014</xref>). Both methods of scrambling preserve low-level factors of the image (e.g., average luminance, number of pixels). (<bold>B</bold>) Image analysis as a function of scrambling method and scrambling level. For each image, the minimal distance between the shape edges (blue dots) and the image’s convex hull (red frame) was computed and normalized relative to the full (intact) image. Although both manipulations resulted in reduced shape information, a greater decrease in the availability of shape information was found in the box scrambling experiment compared to the diffeomorphic scrambling experiment. Similar results were obtained when other image analysis algorithms were employed, suggesting that the amount of shape information (including texture, figure-ground segregation and defined edges) was greater for the diffeomorphic than scrambled stimuli (see methods for details).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27576-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Following these previous studies, in the first experiment, we adopted a parametric box scrambling procedure to map the large-scale organization of shape processing along the ventral and dorsal visual pathways and the contribution of these representations to shape perception. In addition, we employed more advanced multivariate analyses to further elucidate the nature of representations and the similarities or differences in these representations in the two pathways. However, the box-scrambling method has some inherent limitations. First, it increases the number of edges, and early visual cortex is especially sensitive to this type of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grill-Spector et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2001</xref>). Second, box scrambling disrupts crucial shape attributes such as good continuation and figure-ground segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koffka, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qiu and von der Heydt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Read et al., 1997</xref>), and, unsurprisingly, eliminates the identity information of the stimulus. Furthermore, in the box scrambling experiment, participants were shown each object at every level of scrambling and so there may have been priming or adaptation for the same object across levels of scrambling.</p><p>To circumvent these limitations and verify the results, in the second experiment we used a diffeomorphic scrambling manipulation that increasingly precludes the identification of the object but preserves some fundamental shape properties by repeatedly applying a flow field generated from a set of two-dimensional cosine components with random phase and amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stojanoski and Cusack, 2014</xref>). Consequently, some shape information (i.e., the presence of an object or figure that is clearly differentiated from the background and has well-defined boundaries, relatively uniform texture and center of mass; see methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for quantitative analyses of object distortion) is still largely available even in the most distorted version, but the object itself is parametrically distorted and unrecognizable. This manipulation enabled us to re-examine the large-scale organization of the two pathways, and to disentangle sensitivity to shape versus identity information. Last, each object was presented at only one level of distortion (counterbalanced across participants) to remove possible priming effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The large-scale organization of shape processing along the dorsal and ventral visual pathways was assessed in two imaging experiments, by computing the level of the BOLD signal as a function of the decrease in shape information across five levels. Three analytical approaches were employed: a novel voxel-wise approach that provides a continuous voxel-wise mapping of shape processing along the two pathways, a more traditional ROI analysis, and a multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA) to uncover additional information about the similarity of spatial patterns of activation as a function of scrambling.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Univariate analysis</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Box scrambling experiment</title><p>To map the topographical organization of shape processing along the two pathways in a continuous fashion, we generated a voxel-wise map of shape sensitivity for all visually selective voxels. In each voxel, beta weights were extracted for each of the five stimulus conditions from most scrambled to intact (S4, S3, S2, S1, Full), and the linear slope between these conditions was used as an index of shape sensitivity. Voxels that are shape sensitive were those in which activation, as a function of object coherence, had a positive slope. Conversely, voxels that showed greater sensitivity for scrambled than intact images had a negative slope. To map the profile of shape sensitivity across all voxels, we then applied a piecewise linear regression across all the voxels using two (rather than one) linear components (see Methods for details). In each pathway, the piecewise linear regression increased the R<sup>2</sup> when compared with a simple linear regression (ps &lt;0.05), thereby providing a better fit to the data than a one-component linear model (see Materials and methods).</p><p>In the ventral pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), a negative slope was found in the vicinity of the calcarine sulcus and in the posterior occipital lobe more generally, and likely reflects the sensitivity of early visual cortex to edges and high spatial frequency information in the input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2001</xref>); for an additional interpretation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murray et al., 2002</xref>). In more anterior regions of the ventral pathway, a positive slope was evident both on the lateral and the inferior surface of the occipitotemporal cortex (i.e., LO, Parahippocampal gyrus and Fusiform gyrus). However, in even more anterior regions (i.e., anterior and medial temporal cortex), a decrease in shape sensitivity was detected. The piecewise regression revealed that the data were well described by two linear components. The first component reflected the increase in shape sensitivity in the transition between early visual cortex and object-selective cortex and was characterized by a positive correlation between slope and location on the posterior-anterior axis [LH: t<sub>(10)</sub>=8.21, q &lt; 0.00001 CI {0.39, 0.69}; RH: t<sub>(10)</sub>=12.1 q &lt; 0.00001, CI {0.43, 0.62}]. The second component was characterized by a decrease in shape sensitivity, as evident from the negative correlation between location on the posterior-anterior axis and slope [LH: t<sub>(10)</sub>=9.5, q = 0.00001, CI{−0.32, −0.51}; RH: t<sub>(10)</sub>=6.94, q = 0.00001, CI {−0.20 −0.39}; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>]. The robust positive first component is consistent with previous investigations of the ventral pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murray et al., 2002</xref>), and replicates the hierarchical nature of shape processing in which more elaborate and complex representations are derived as one moves rostrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grill-Spector and Weiner, 2014</xref>). The reduction in shape sensitivity in the anterior parts of the temporal lobe might reflect a transition to more semantic and memory-based representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kravitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Visser et al., 2010</xref>), rather than shape sensitivity per se, but might also be a consequence of MRI distortion effects which are more common in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olman et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27576.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Voxel-wise analysis for the box scrambling experiment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Shape sensitivity is projected on an inflated brain from a superior view (upper panel) and from a posterior-inferior view (lower panel).

Consistent with the findings of the ventral pathway, shape selectivity gradually decreased from the posterior parietal lobe to more anterior regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Accordingly, the piecewise regression revealed a positive correlation for the first component, which reflects the increase in shape sensitivity [LH: t<sub>(10)</sub>=5.15, q = 0.0004 CI {0.32, 0.82}; RH: t<sub>(10)</sub>=10, q = 0.00001, CI {0.62, 0.97}], and a robust negative correlation for the second component, which reflects the decrease in shape sensitivity in the anterior parts of the dorsal pathway [LH: t<sub>(10)</sub>=8.54, q = 0.00001 CI {−0.32, −0.55}; RH: t<sub>(10)</sub>=8.94, q = 0.000001, CI {−0.34, −0.57}; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>].</p><p>The key finding here is that the two pathways have similar topographical organization. In addition, these findings provide novel evidence for the nature of shape processing in the dorsal pathway and indicate that object representations in this pathway are not monolithic but, rather, differ qualitatively along the posterior-anterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freud et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The mapping of topographical organization of shape sensitivity was done along the posterior-anterior axis. However, given the curvature of the two pathways in the brain, it might be the case that shape information is also modulated by the inferior-superior axis. To examine this possibility, we calculated the distance between each voxel to the most posterior voxel using both Y and Z coordinates and then evaluated the shape-sensitivity gradient. This analysis replicates the organization revealed using only the Y-axis and indicates the Y-axis serves as the key dimension (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, lower panel).</p><p>Despite the apparent qualitative similarity in the large-scale topographical organization of shape processing along the two pathways, further analyses also revealed some differences between the ventral and dorsal pathways. In particular, the maximal shape sensitivity (the apex or inflection point of the regression line) was more posterior in the dorsal relative to the ventral pathway [F<sub>(1,10)</sub> = 22.11, p=0.0008, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.68, CI {12 21}; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>]. This effect was reproduced when the main dependent variable was the distance from the most posterior voxel based on the Y and Z coordinates [F<sub>(1,10)</sub> = 91, p=0.000002, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.90, CI {16 27}].</p><p>Additionally, the average sensitivity of all shape-selective voxels (slope &gt; 0) was significantly greater in the ventral than dorsal pathway [F<sub>(1,10)</sub> = 45, p=0.00005, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.81, CI {0.01 0.02}; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>].

The greater difference between the pathways in shape sensitivity in the left hemisphere might reflect hemispheric specialization, such that the left dorsal pathway is more tuned to visuomotor aspects than the right dorsal pathway.</p><p>Finally, in addition to the continuous analysis described above, the data were analyzed using an ROI approach. ROIs were defined based on a probabilistic atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and the aIPS ROI was defined based on a meta-analysis (Neurosynth.org).

This result indicates that, despite the difference in the overall shape sensitivity between the two experiments, they provided consistent information on the overall large-scale organization of shape sensitivity.</p><p>As in box scrambling experiment, the maximal shape sensitivity emerged in more posterior regions of the dorsal pathway compared with the ventral pathway [F <sub>(1,10)</sub>=18.78, p=0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.65], and the effect held when distance based on the Y and Z axes served as the dependent variable [F <sub>(1,10)</sub>=45, p=0.00005, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.81]. The similarity between the two experiments was confirmed by an ANOVA that included Experiment as a between-subjects variable. In particular, a main effect of pathway was found [F <sub>(1,20)</sub>=56, p=0.000001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.73] and was not modulated by experiment [F <sub>(1,20)</sub> &lt; 1]. Interestingly, the inflection point of the regression was more anterior in the diffeomorphic scrambling experiment compared with box scrambling experiment [F <sub>(1,20)</sub>=8.45, p=0.008, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.29], and this might reflect the increased high-level shape or identity processing associated with the diffeomorphic scrambling stimuli.</p><p>In addition, we compared the overall neural sensitivity to shape information in all shape-selective voxels (slope &gt; 0). The average shape sensitivity was greater in the ventral than the dorsal pathway [F <sub>(1,10)</sub>=37, p=0.0001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.79]. The comparison between the two experiments revealed two main effects, with no interaction. As expected, there was a main effect of pathway: shape sensitivity was greater overall in the ventral than dorsal pathway across the two experiments [F <sub>(1,20)</sub>=83, p=0.000001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.8]. There was also an additional main effect of Experiment, with greater average positive slope in the box scrambling experiment than the diffeomorphic scrambling experiment, reflecting the different nature of the two manipulations [F <sub>(1,20)</sub>=32, p=0.00001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.62; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>]. Notably, an interaction between pathway and hemisphere [F <sub>(1,20)</sub>=10.85, p=0.003, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.35] was found and was not modulated by experiment [F <sub>(1,20)</sub>&lt;1]. This interaction was the result of a greater difference between the two pathways in the left than right hemisphere, and therefore further implicates hemispheric differences in shape processing.</p><p>Finally, the ROI analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) confirms that the large-scale organization of object processing was largely replicated in the diffeomorphic scrambling experiment. In particular, in the dorsal pathway, shape sensitivity was first evident in V3b, reached a peak at IPS0/V3b and then decreased, and was not evident in the more anterior IPS4 and aIPS, confirming the posterior-anterior representational gradient. Note that the ROIs-based analysis did not permit an exploration of the ventral pathway second component, since this component was found to be in more anterior parts of the ventral pathway in the diffeomorphic scrambling experiment and the probabilistic atlas does not include these more anterior regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Representational similarity analysis</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Box scrambling experiment</title><p>So far, we have presented results based on a univariate approach. Despite the robustness of this method and the convergence of the voxel-wise and ROI approaches, these analyses only consider the magnitude but not the pattern of the fMRI activation. Recent investigations employing multivariate approaches have successfully uncovered important features of the neural representations of objects in both the dorsal and the ventral pathways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bracci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bracci and Op de Beeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fabbri et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To extend our results, we utilized a multivariate approach of representational similarity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>; RSA). Notably, most previous investigations utilize the RSA approach to uncover the representational space of individual exemplars. The RSA employed here, however, is unlike the standard RSA procedure. Given that the present study used a block design to increase the statistical power in the service of the voxel-by-voxel univariate mapping described above, we could not evaluate the representation of individual exemplars. Instead, the RSA was applied at the level of a block (where a single block contains intact or scrambled objects to differing degrees). This procedure still allows us to explore how the availability of shape information modulated the representational content of different ROIs.</p><p>The RSA computed the similarity of spatial activation patterns across conditions for different ROIs and then tested whether these data could be accounted for by a model in which representations of images will be more similar to each other if they possess similar levels of shape information. For example, in shape selective regions, the response pattern to intact images is predicted to be more correlated with the response pattern to images scrambled to four pieces compared with the response pattern to images scrambled to 64 pieces. Correspondingly, response patterns for the 256 scrambled inputs should be more correlated with voxels that respond to the 64 scrambled inputs versus intact objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27576.022</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Box scrambling experiment - RSA analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The shape model is a dissimilarity matrix which asserts that representations of blocks of images will be more similar to each other (i.e. lower dissimilarity) if they possess similar levels of shape information. The analysis correlates the pattern of activation from the odd (columns) and even (rows) runs. For clarity, the left matrix magnifies a part of the model, and the values reflect the predicted dissimilarity values (range from 0 – maximal similarity to 1 maximal dissimilarity).

Black asterisks along the x-axis signify that a ROI is significantly correlated with the shape model (q &lt; 0.05). The black vertical line separates the lateral and inferior ROIs of the ventral pathway. The correlation with the shape model was evident in the early visual cortices, as well as in object selective cortices. The correlation with the shape model reached a peak in the LO (ventral) and V3b (dorsal) and then decreased gradually. For each ROI, the bright gray bars reflect the noise ceiling (the reliability of the correlational patterns in each ROI, which approximates the upper limit of the correlations between the fMRI and shape model given the inherent noise in the data (see methods)).

Three key findings were obtained. First, the two pathways followed a similar topographical organization with a posterior to anterior initial increase and then decrease in shape sensitivity. Second, the representational structures of regions in the dorsal and ventral pathways were highly correlated with each other. Third, the activation of posterior dorsal pathway regions, which were sensitive to shape, were correlated with recognition performance, suggesting that these regions might contribute to perceptual behaviors. Together, these findings challenge the binary distinction between the two pathways.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Topographical organization of shape processing</title><p>Consistent with early investigations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grill-Spector et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grill-Spector and Weiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murray et al., 2002</xref>), shape sensitivity, was not evident in the caudal parts of the ventral pathway (i.e., early visual cortex) and emerged in the rostral and lateral parts of the ventral pathway, reflecting the hierarchical nature of object processing. However, in the transition from high-level visual regions (i.e., parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus) to even more anterior temporal regions, shape sensitivity was still present, albeit reduced (i.e., a flatter slope). Interestingly, in recent years, accumulating evidence has shown that the anterior and medial regions of the temporal lobe (i.e., perirhinal and entorhinal cortices) may also play a role in object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrmann et al., 2016</xref>); for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murray et al., 2007</xref>). The results of the present investigation are compatible with the view that these more anterior representations may be confined to high-level object properties (such as conjunction of multiple features see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barense et al., 2007</xref>; or familiarity, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin et al., 2013</xref>) and to memory-based representations, and less to shape and geometric information per se.</p><p>The novel findings pertain more to the nature of shape processing along the dorsal pathway. In particular, shape sensitivity increased from early visual cortex to extrastriate cortex, reached its peak sensitivity in the posterior parietal cortex and then gradually decreased in more anterior regions, closer to the central sulcus. These findings extend previous studies in both humans and non-human primates that have demonstrated that, similar to the ventral pathway, the dorsal pathway derives object representations. (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denys et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Konen and Kastner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Theys et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Dromme et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The similarity between the two pathways suggest that the topographical organization is constrained by similar factors, namely cortical distance from the visual cortex and connectivity to other cortical systems (i.e., the motor system in the dorsal pathway and semantic system in the ventral pathway).</p><p>Finally, the similarity in the large-scale organization of the two pathways was further confirmed by an RSA approach that revealed that the representational structure of regions in the posterior dorsal pathway was highly correlated with the representational structure of lateral-ventral ROI. Notably, despite these similarities, differences were also observed between the two pathways: shape sensitivity was greater in the ventral than dorsal pathway, reflecting the centrality of this pathway in object perception, and shape sensitivity reached its maximum values in more anterior regions of the ventral than dorsal pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What aspects of object properties are encoded by the dorsal pathway?</title><p>Some fMRI investigations have provided evidence that pictures of tools activate regions in the dorsal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chao and Martin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valyear et al., 2007</xref>), even when no overt visuomotor task was required. Nevertheless, one might speculate that the observed activation might still reflect visuomotor plans that are associated with the tool being displayed. More recent studies, however, have documented dorsal activation for both 2D and 3D images, even when the stimuli do not have any visuomotor association and the task is not action-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Konen and Kastner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zachariou et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, when BOLD responses to tools were compared to non-tools (but graspable) objects, no difference was observed between the two categories in the posterior parts of the dorsal pathway, but greater activation was observed for tools than for objects in more anterior regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mruczek et al., 2013</xref>). In the current work, shape sensitivity within the dorsal pathway was found both for tools and non-tool objects. Together, these results suggest that the representations subserved by the posterior regions of the dorsal pathway are not limited to visuomotor associations evoked by the object. Instead, the neural representation may reflect the processing of different shape cues such as the 3D status of the object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berryhill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freud et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Konen and Kastner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Dromme et al., 2016</xref>) and/or object elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fabbri et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have used multivariate analytic approaches to elucidate the visual and cognitive features represented by the dorsal (and ventral) regions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bracci and Op de Beeck, 2016</xref> mapped the cortical sensitivity for a stimulus set in which shape and category (e.g., animals, musical instruments, tools) were dissociated. Similar to the present findings, posterior LOC was more correlated with a shape model than a category model. In the dorsal pathway, the TOS, which corresponds to posterior ROIs in the probabilistic atlas used here, was also highly correlated with the shape model, and not with the category model. Nevertheless, in this previous investigation, some anterior dorsal ROIs were more correlated with the category model, than the shape model. As discussed below, dorsal pathway representations were found to be highly sensitive to task properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bracci et al., 2017</xref>) and therefore, the discrepancies between the present investigation and Bracci and Op de Beeck’s findings might be related to the nature of the task: while Bracci and Op de Beeck asked participants to compare the real-size of preceding images (encouraging object-based processing), in the present investigation, we deliberately avoided explicit processing of the stimuli and had participants complete an orthogonal fixation-based task.</p><p>The comparison between the box scrambling experiment and the diffeomorphic scrambling provided additional information on the nature of shape representations derived by the dorsal pathway. The diffeomorphic transformation distorted the object’s identity, while preserving the presence of some shape information (to a greater degree than was true of the box scrambling manipulation). In contrast to the inferior surface of the ventral pathway, along the dorsal pathway a decrease in shape sensitivity was found for this manipulation, compared with the results obtained from the box scrambling experiment. Hence, our results suggest that dorsal pathway representations are tied to the presence of a single coherent shape, even if it is not identifiable as a familiar object and lacks important visual properties. The residual perceptual abilities of patients with visual agnosia are consistent with such interpretation. In particular, the dissociable dorsal representations can support sensitivity to particular attributes (such as the 3D structure of an object) but cannot support intact recognition abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freud et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>Note that this interpretation ought to be considered speculative as the shape attribute is confounded with other visual properties that constitute a shape in the diffeomorphic scrambling experiment: our image analysis procedures revealed that a host of factors, related to low-, mid- and high-level shape cues, such as defined perimeter, entropy and homogeneous texture, were also better preserved for the diffeomorphic than box-scrambled stimuli. Moreover, and in contrast to previous investigations, the RSA in the present study was based on a block design experiments, and therefore, could not uncover the representational content of a specific exemplar. Future studies should, therefore, explore the importance of different visual properties to dorsal pathway representations, and, by doing so, evaluate whether dorsal and ventral representations differ quantitatively (or also qualitatively).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional contribution of dorsal pathway representations to perception</title><p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodale and Milner (1992)</xref>, the visual pathways should be described in terms of their functions, rather than in terms of the visual information that is represented. The question then is, what behavioral functions are subserved by dorsal pathway representations? Here, we provide novel evidence for a correlation between recognition abilities and fMRI shape sensitivity in the posterior part of the dorsal pathway, even when the correlation of these variables with scrambling levels was partialled out. Despite the inability to infer causality from those correlations, they extend seminal findings that found correlations between perceptual performance and fMRI activation in different regions of the ventral pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grill-Spector et al., 2000</xref>) and point to a plausible functional contribution of the dorsal pathway to object perception.</p><p>Consistent with this suggestion, a patient with an occipitoparietal lesion was impaired in the perception of objects defined by monocular and binocular cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berryhill et al., 2009</xref>).

However, several other neuroimaging investigations in humans and electrophysiological studies non-human primates have revealed shape sensitivity in the anterior parts of the IPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freud et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Janssen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orban, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Theys et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Theys et al., 2015</xref>). This apparent contradiction raises the possibility that the nature of the task modulates shape sensitivity in the dorsal pathway, and, indeed, a recent study found that the aIPS coded object shape and elongation during grasping but not during passive viewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fabbri et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, task demands were found to modulate the nature of representations in other regions of the dorsal pathway, under perceptual (rather than visuomotor) tasks, further suggesting that dorsal pathway representations might be sensitive to tasks demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bracci et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, in contrast to these findings, a recent study revealed that the ventral pathway is less affected by task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bugatus et al., 2017</xref>), revealing potential differences in the way task modulates the representations in the two pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study uncovered novel evidence for the nature of shape representations along the dorsal pathway and its similarity to representations along the ventral pathway. In two fMRI experiments, using a variety of analytical approaches, we found that posterior extrastriate regions of the dorsal pathway are highly sensitive to shape information (but less to object identity), that the magnitude of their activation is correlated with perceptual behaviors and that in some regions, the representations derived are highly similar to those in some regions of ventral cortex. This sensitivity decreases in anterior regions of the dorsal pathway reflecting a gradual shift from representation-for-perception to representation-for action, leading to the conclusion that there is a representational continuum from more posterior areas tuned to visual properties of the objects in the input to more anterior areas tuned to motor aspects of the observed objects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-two right-handed participants (box scrambling experiment: Eleven participants, nine males; mean age: 31, range: 19–46 years, diffeomorphic scrambling experiment: Eleven participants, five males; mean age: 25, range: 19–46 years).

In contrast to the box scrambling experiment, only one version of each picture was presented to a particular participant (counterbalanced across participants) to ensure that sensitivity to object shape was not modulated by within-experiment priming or adaptation.

To assess low-level similarity, we used a pixel-similarity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Op de Beeck et al., 2008</xref>) to compare the pixels for each distorted image relative to the intact version of the image.

This analysis revealed greater similarity (higher values) between the intact images and distorted images in diffeomorphic scrambling experiment compared with box scrambling experiment (box scrambling: 0.7 ± 0.02; diffeomorphic scrambling: 0.87 ± 0.03).</p><p>To characterize mid-level attributes, we measured the image entropy (Matlab command: entropy) which provides an estimation of the overall disorder in the image with greater values reflect greater entropy. In addition, image homogeneity (Matlab command: graycoprops) was analyzed to examine the extent to which image texture was altered by the two scrambling methods. For this measure, lower values reflect reduced homogeneity and less uniform texture. These analyses showed greater entropy and lower homogeneity for the box scrambling stimuli (Image entropy: box scrambling: 1.07 ± 0.07; diffeomorphic scrambling: 1.02 ± 0.13; Image homogeneity: box scrambling: 0.98 ± 0.007; diffeomorphic scrambling: 0.99 ± 0.005)</p><p>Finally, to examine the distortion of high-level shape information (i.e., closed boundaries, continuous counter) we defined the edges of each image by detecting all pixels adjacent to a background (i.e., white) pixel, and then calculated the convex hull, which is the smallest convex set that contains a particular image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrew, 1979</xref>). Next, for each edge pixel, the distance to the nearest convex hull pixel was computed. The sum of all distances for each image was normalized by dividing it by the sum of distances for the intact version of that image. Thus, greater values of the normalized distance reflect increased shape complexity relatively to the intact image. As with the other algorithms, this procedure confirmed that shape properties were distorted even by the diffeomorphic images, but were still better preserved for these images compared with the box-scrambled images across all levels of scrambling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Procedure </title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>fMRI</title><p>Stimuli were presented in a pseudorandomized order using the E-Prime 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and projected via a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen located at the back of the scanner bore, behind the subject’s head. Stimuli were presented within a square frame (visual angle of 4.5° X 4.5°) on a white background. Participants viewed the stimuli through a tilted double-mirror setup mounted above their eyes on the head coil.

A structural scan was acquired using a T1-weighted protocol that included 176 sagittal slices (1 mm thickness, in-plane resolution = 1 mm, matrix = 256×256, repetition time = 2300 ms, echo time = 1.97 ms, inversion time = 900 ms, flip angle = 9 ̊). Functional images based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal were acquired with a gradient-echo, echoplanar imaging sequence (TR = 1.5 s, TE = 30 ms, flip angle 73 ̊). To achieve full coverage of both visual pathways, 43 axial slices (slice thickness = 3 mm, gap = 0 mm, in-plane resolution = 3 mm) were acquired in eight runs of 227 volumes each (such that each run lasted 5 min, 40.5 s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Object scrambling experiment</title><p>No participant completed more than one experiment.

The blocks were separated by 7.5 s fixation periods. Participants were instructed to fixate on the cross in the center of the display. To maintain attention throughout the scan, participants were required to indicate, via a button press, when the color of the fixation cross changed from black to red.

Preprocessing included 3D-motion correction and filtering of low temporal frequencies (cutoff frequency of 2 cycles per run). No spatial smoothing was applied to allow the voxel-wise analysis. All scans were transformed to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fonov et al., 2011</xref>). Three main analytical approaches were employed: a novel voxel-wise approach that allows a continuous mapping of shape processing along the two pathways, a more traditional ROI analysis and a multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA).</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Voxel-wise approach</title><sec id="s4-4-1-1"><title>Definition of a group-level mask</title><p>To map the topographical origination of shape processing along the two pathways in a continuous fashion, we generated a voxel-wise map of shape sensitivity of every visually selective voxel. A group-level mask of all visually selective voxels was generated by performing a random-effects general linear model (GLM) analysis across all 22 participants. This mask allowed us to compare the results of the two experiments directly, with the same voxels sampled in the two experiments. For each participant, the eight runs were concatenated and analyzed using a GLM, and beta value estimates of activation levels were calculated for each of the five conditions (scrambling level –S4, S3, S2, S1, Full). If a voxel was reliably responsive to any of these conditions (q &lt; 0.05, false-discovery rate (FDR)-corrected, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) relative to fixation, it was included in the mask, which was then applied in the individual subject analysis. All voxels superior to the calcarine sulcus were considered part of the dorsal pathway, and all the voxels inferior to the calcarine sulcus were considered part of the ventral pathway. This approach yielded the following distribution: right dorsal pathway (941 functional voxels), left dorsal pathway (1155 functional voxels), right ventral pathway (1793 functional voxels) and left ventral pathway (1736 functional voxels).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-1-2"><title>Voxel-based piecewise regression analysis</title><p>For each participant, a voxel-wise GLM was conducted and a beta value for each of the five conditions was calculated. Next, to assess shape sensitivity, the slope of activation (beta values) as a function of scrambling level was calculated for each voxel. A positive slope reflects an increase in activation as the level of scrambling decreases (from S4 to intact), and therefore reflects greater shape sensitivity. A negative slope represents a decrease in activation as the level of scrambling decreases, and, as such, may reflect greater sensitivity to local elements and edges, which are more frequent in increasingly distorted images (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>The location of a voxel on the posterior-anterior axis (i.e., the y-coordinate of each voxel) served as the independent variable, and shape sensitivity (i.e., slope) served as the dependent variable. Since an initial inspection showed that the topographical organization might not be linear, we conducted a piecewise regression analysis separately for each participant, pathway and hemisphere, using the shape language modelling (SLM) toolbox available in Matlab. Piecewise regression analysis allows the partitioning of the independent variable into multiple linear components, and then, for each component, a regression line is calculated. To avoid overfitting of the data, we limited the number of segments to two, and the segmentation point was automatically derived to maximize the R<sup>2</sup>. Notably, in each pathway, the piecewise linear regression robustly increased the R<sup>2</sup> was compared with a R<sup>2</sup> obtained from a simple linear regression (ps &lt; 0.005, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the former provides a better fit to the data than a one-component linear model.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27576.032</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison between simple regression and piecewise (two components) regression.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th colspan="4" valign="top">Simple correlation</th><th colspan="4" valign="top">Two linear components</th></tr><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Ventral r</th><th valign="top">Ventral l</th><th valign="top">Dorsal r</th><th valign="top">Dorsal l</th><th valign="top">Ventral r</th><th valign="top">Ventral l</th><th valign="top">Dorsal r</th><th valign="top">Dorsal l</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Box scrambling experiment</td><td valign="top">0.04 ± 0.01</td><td valign="top">0.03 ± 0.01</td><td valign="top">0.05 ± 0.02</td><td valign="top">0.1±0.02</td><td valign="top">0.23 ± 0.03</td><td valign="top">0.26 ± 0.04</td><td valign="top">0.27 ± 0.03</td><td valign="top">0.22 ± 0.02</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Diffeomorphic scrambling experiment</td><td valign="top">0.13 ± 0.02</td><td valign="top">0.11 ± 0.01</td><td valign="top">0.03 ± 0.01</td><td valign="top">0.03 ± 0.01</td><td valign="top">0.26 ± 0.03</td><td valign="top">0.33 ± 0.02</td><td valign="top">0.18 ± 0.03</td><td valign="top">0.17 ± 0.02</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The mean R<sup>2</sup> (and standard error) based on a simple correlation or the two linear components regression that was utilized for the voxel-wise analysis.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Note that because the y-axis (posterior-anterior) does not take into account the curvature of the brain, in a separate analysis, we computed the distance between each voxel and the most posterior voxel (using both Y and Z coordinates).

We defined ROIs based on a probabilistic atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) that includes regions along the ventral and the dorsal visual pathways. We used the maximum probability map that identifies the most probable region for any given point. Note that IPS5, SPL, and TO2 included only a few voxels and, therefore, were not included in our analysis. The FEF is located in the frontal lobe, and, thus, was not included here. Since we were also interested in more anterior parts of the dorsal pathway, we defined the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) bilaterally by selecting voxels located in the vicinity of the junction of the intraparietal sulcus and the post-central sulcus based on coordinates extracted from Neurosynth (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neurosynth.org/">http://neurosynth.org/</ext-link>) using the search term ‘Grasping’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hutchison and Gallivan, 2016</xref>). Finally, since our stimuli were always presented at the center of the visual field, for early visual ROIs (V1v, V2v, V3v, V1d, V2d, V3d), we defined a more restricted ROI (5 mm sphere) at the posterior part of the original ROIs as defined in the probabilistic atlas, in order to capture foveal representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For each ROI, beta weights for each of the five conditions were calculated, and then, as with the voxel-wise analysis, the linear slope between the beta weights was extracted and served as a measure of shape sensitivity of that ROI. Note that the ventral mask used for the voxel-wise analysis extends to more anterior parts of the temporal lobe, compared with the ROIs available from the atlas, and therefore some differences between these two analytical approaches are expected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Representational similarity analysis (RSA)</title><p>The analyses thus far only consider beta weights and do not permit a more fine-grained analysis of the pattern of activation per ROI. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the representational space in the different ROIs, we also conducted a multivariate investigation. To do so, beta weights from the different ROIs were extracted separately for each run and condition (8 runs x 5 conditions = 40) and the runs were separated into two sets with similar visual information contained in each set. The correlations between all the odd and even runs were extracted resulting in an asymmetric correlation matrix (20 × 20). To examine whether shape information was similarly encoded by different ROIs, we computed the Spearman correlation between the correlation matrix of each ROI and a shape model correlation matrix (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) that proposes that representations of images will be more similar to each other if they possess similar levels of shape information. These correlation values were Fisher transformed to permit further statistical comparisons. One-sample t-test (p&lt;0.05, FDR corrected) was used to determine whether a specific ROI conveys shape information (r &gt; 0). A series of t-test independent samples tests (p&lt;0.05, FDR corrected) were used to compare between the correlation obtained in the box scrambling experiment and the diffeomorphic scrambling experiment.</p><p>To estimate the upper limit of the correlation given the noise in the data, we calculated reliability for each ROI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bracci and Op de Beeck, 2016</xref>). The correlation matrix of each subject in each ROI was correlated with the average matrix obtained from all other subjects. These values were averaged across participants and served as the reliability index. The reliability index is provided for reference (bright gray bars) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>.</p><p>Finally, the pattern of activation in each ROI was correlated with the activation pattern of all other ROIs. To visualize the similarity of the response patterns of the different ROIs, we averaged the correlation matrices of all the participants and utilized the Multi-Dimensional Scaling approach (MDS, ‘mdscale’ Matlab command). To statistically quantify the representational similarity between ROIs, for each participant, we averaged the correlation values between the lateral-ventral ROIs (LO1, LO2 and TO1) and inferior-ventral ROIs (VO1-PH2) (within ventral pathway), between posterior dorsal (V3a-IPS1) ROIs and anterior dorsal ROIs (IPS1-aIPS) (within dorsal pathway) and the correlations between the posterior-dorsal and lateral-ventral ROIs (between pathways). These values were then subject to a repeated-measures ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Correlation with object recognition</title><p>The univariate analyses described above included just five levels (scrambling), limiting the ability to calculate a reliable correlation between participants’ BOLD response and object recognition abilities. We therefore divided the fMRI data into two datasets, in which different objects were presented, and we separated the data from the tools and objects categories. This procedure yielded 20 beta weights for each ROI. For the purpose of correlating the neural and behavioral data, we split the behavioral data into 20 subsets as was done with the neural data. Partial correlations between behavioral performance and fMRI signal were computed, controlling for the correlation of these two variables with the level of scrambling.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Bobby Stojanoski and Rhodri Cusack for providing the code for generating diffeomorphic transformations of the stimuli, and Rafael Malach and the VisCog group at CMU for fruitful discussion.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: As detailed in the manuscript, all subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were financially compensated for their participation.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Nick Turk-Browne as the Reviewing Editor and David Van Essen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission agreed to reveal their identity: Hans Op de Beeck.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Note that some of the essential revisions will require additional experimentation and/or significant new analyses. You may thus decide to forego resubmission should these requirements prove onerous. Moreover, as new results will be generated that could impact the conclusions, it remains possible that your manuscript will be rejected upon revision, should you choose to resubmit.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes two fMRI experiments assessing shape processing in the ventral and dorsal pathways. Using two forms of scrambling, the authors assess BOLD responses in voxels and ROIs as a function of image coherence, with positive slopes reflecting greater responses to more shape information (i.e., lower levels of scrambling). They then examine how these slopes change as a function of position along the anterior-posterior axis, and find a dissociation between ventral (increasing then plateauing slopes) vs. dorsal (increasing then decreasing slopes) streams. Moreover, shape information in both ventral and dorsal streams correlated with object recognition behavior. The authors conclude that both ventral and dorsal streams contribute to perception, despite differences in how they code for shape information.</p><p>There was consensus that this study was rigorous, with two experiments, two manipulations, thorough analyses, good data reporting, and clear writing. Moreover, the findings were robust and interesting, speaking to an issue of fundamental importance about which there has been relatively little work.</p><p>At the same time, the reviewers raised several important and consistent concerns that would need to be addressed before a decision about publication can be reached. Below these concerns are described via constructive suggestions about how the manuscript would need to be improved to fare well in the next round.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Many of the claims relate to what has been learned about the nature of object representations in the dorsal stream. However, the reviewers question whether the approach taken here is adequate to assess representational content. In particular, the use of univariate methods and image scrambling to assess shape information was considered indirect and outdated, compared to the multivariate (or even adaptation) methods used in prior studies. Admittedly, the difference between scrambling techniques across streams (i.e., reduced shape sensitivity in dorsal stream in Experiment 2) speaks to what is being coded, but this was not viewed as sufficient. In particular, this can speak to selectivity for shape and/or identity, but does not address what features are being represented. Although adaptation would not be possible to consider with the current design, I see no reason that a representational similarity analysis couldn't be performed. There were 2 and 4 (Experiments 1 and 2) repetitions of each stimulus, which would allow a cross-correlation of the raw pattern of BOLD activity over searchlights or ROIs for each stimulus with its own repetition(s) and with the other stimuli. Average diagonal vs. off-diagonal correlations would provide an index of shape coding, and this could be examined at different levels of scrambling. Moreover, how this index changes over the longitudinal axis could provide confirmation of the piecewise regression results, and also about differences between scrambling techniques across streams. Finally, second-order correlations of the correlation matrices would speak directly to the question of the similarity between ventral and dorsal stream representations. Other multivariate approaches could achieve the same goals, and the authors are experts in this class of techniques, but something along these lines is necessary.</p><p>2) Related to questions about representation, it was unclear which exact properties of the objects were affected by scrambling. For example, reduced sensitivity to diffeomorphic scrambling in the dorsal stream is interpreted as evidence of coding for the presence of a single shape rather than identity. However, this kind of scrambling affects many other features (e.g., curvature, texture, etc.), all of which could be potential explanations. The convex hull analysis is a good start, but the authors should provide a more comprehensive, perhaps computational analysis of the features present in the stimuli from both experiments at different levels of scrambling.</p><p>3) This paper builds on a long history of related studies. The reviewers felt that this history and its implications were not adequately presented. This includes the classic work by Grill-Spector and others – and whether the current results would (or would not) have been predicted from it – as well as the more recent work using multivariate methods (e.g., by Bracci and colleagues). Many of these papers are cited, but a more in-depth weighing of the prior literature, discussion of the new findings and why they are novel in this historical context, and consideration of theoretical implications (including for previous conclusions) is needed.</p><p>4) The conclusion about differences in the representational gradient of ventral and dorsal streams depends on how the streams are defined. For example, the authors seem to go as anterior as possible in the dorsal stream and obtain a decrease in shape sensitivity. Would a decrease not be observed in the ventral stream if its end was likewise extended further, say into the hippocampus or anterior temporal lobe? Alternatively, if the dorsal stream was defined more conservatively, wouldn't the gradient match the ventral stream? The root concern is that it is unclear whether the gradients are fundamental, organizing properties of these streams, or at least partially artifacts of how the analysis was conducted. The authors need to better justify their definition of the streams, and address this limitation.</p><p>5) Relatedly, the anterior-posterior axis is defined simply as Y coordinates. Given the brain's curvature, especially in the dorsal stream, these coordinates do not reflect neural distance. The authors should calculate alternative distance metrics, for example tracing along the surface of inflated cortex from calcarine to central sulci, re-performing their piecewise regressions, and either replacing the existing analyses or reporting one in the supplement.</p><p>6) Object recognition performance is almost perfectly correlated with scrambling. As a result, the neural correlations with object recognition almost perfectly mirror the baseline relationships to scrambling. Thus, it is unclear what these results add to the story. More problematically, it is unclear whether neural activity is driven by scrambling or recognition. These can be dissociated, as Grill-Spector did with training, but that hasn't been done in the present manuscript. At a minimum, this issue should be highlighted in the Discussion; better would be an analytical solution to dissociating these factors.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The large-scale organization of shape processing in the ventral and dorsal pathways&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Note that, because we used a block design to increase the statistical robustness of our experiment, we cannot employ a multivariate analysis of the responses to the different exemplars. Nevertheless, following this comment, we have conducted a multivariate analysis (see below) and utilized RSA to uncover the sensitivity of the different ROIs to object scrambling and to compare the representational structure of the different ROIs.</p><p>The first-level RSA correlated the representational structure of the different ROIs with that of a shape-sensitivity model. Consistent with the results of the univariate analysis, we were able to demonstrate that the two- components organization along the longitudinal axis is not a unique property of the fMRI amplitude, but also emerges from the similarity of response patterns in the different ROIs.</p><p>Even more importantly, the second-level RSA allowed us to compare directly between the representational structures of the different ROIs. We used multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) to visualize the similarity and dissimilarity between the different ROIs and we statistically quantified the similarity of the representations within- and between-pathways. Interestingly, this analysis revealed that regions in the lateral ventral pathway derived similar representations to those derived by the posterior dorsal pathway, and that this, between-pathways similarity was even greater than the similarity observed between some regions in the same pathway. Hence, this analysis and the robust results further suggests that the neural representations of shape information are present in the two visual pathways and that these representations are broadly distributed in cortex.</p><p>The new analysis has been included in the revised manuscript (subsection “ii. Representational Similarity Analysis”) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to questions about representation, it was unclear which exact properties of the objects were affected by scrambling.

These analyses enabled us to examine how the different distortion manipulations modulated low, mid and high-level shape attributes. Low-level attributes were examined using a pixel-similarity analysis. Mid-level attributes were mapped using image entropy (the amount of the disorder in an image) and image homogeneity (texture). High-level attributes were assessed using the Convex Hull algorithms. The results of these analyses revealed that object distortion was greater in box scrambling experiment compared with diffeomorphic experiment across all levels of shape information.</p><p>The continuity of object and image texture are essential to the existence of a “shape” and therefore it is hard to conclude whether the relative reduction of dorsal sensitivity to the diffeomorphic manipulation reflects sensitivity to “shape” per-se, or to shape elements such as continuous texture and a clear figure-ground segregation. We address this limitation in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (subsection “What aspects of object properties are encoded by the dorsal pathway?”, fourth paragraph and see subsection “Comparison between stimuli as function of distortion method” for the analysis of shape attributes)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This paper builds on a long history of related studies.

Thanks for drawing our attention to this inadvertent neglect of related work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusion about differences in the representational gradient of ventral and dorsal streams depends on how the streams are defined. For example, the authors seem to go as anterior as possible in the dorsal stream and obtain a decrease in shape sensitivity.

The authors need to better justify their definition of the streams, and address this limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this comment, we redefined the ventral pathway mask to include the anterior parts of the temporal lobe. This new definition extended the previous results observed for the ventral pathway. In particular, we have found that the ventral pathway, similar to the dorsal pathway, has a first positive component and a negative second component. Hence, the results obtained from the new, extended mask, may suggest that the topographical organization of the two pathways is shaped by similar factors, namely cortical distance from the visual cortex and connectivity to other cortical systems (i.e., the motor system in the dorsal pathway and semantic system in the ventral pathway).</p><p>Notably, even though the gradients are qualitatively similar (i.e. have 2 components, one positive and one negative), there is also evidence for differences in shape processing in the two pathways. First, in both experiments, the maximal shape sensitivity (the inflection point of the regression line) emerged in more posterior regions of the dorsal pathway compared with ventral pathway (and this effect holds even when we have used a different distance measurement that was computed based on both the Y and Z axes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>)). In addition, the average shape sensitivity is greater in the ventral pathway reflecting the centrality of this pathway in shape processing.</p><p>The results of the new analyses have been included in the revised manuscript (subsection “i. Univariate analysis”) and on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Relatedly, the anterior-posterior axis is defined simply as Y coordinates.

The authors should calculate alternative distance metrics, for example tracing along the surface of inflated cortex from calcarine to central sulci, re-performing their piecewise regressions, and either replacing the existing analyses or reporting one in the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that we focus our analysis on the Y (posterior-anterior) axis. This focus was theoretically driven and followed a previous related investigation (e.g., Mruczek et al., 2013; Freud et al., 2016). However, in light of the reviewers’ concerns, we have reanalyzed the data, taking into account both the Z (superior-inferior) and Y axes. To this end, we have calculated the distance between each voxels to the most posterior voxel (using both Y and Z coordinate). This approach replicates the main organization revealed using only the Y-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref> of the revised manuscript). We still report the Y axis analysis for the sake of simplicity, but the distance analysis has been added and figures are included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>These results were reproduced when we used Principal Component Analysis to extract the common space of the two axes. The first PCA component (which explains ~89% of the variance) was correlated with the slope values and revealed similar organization to this described above.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Group-averaged piecewise regression analysis for Experiment 1 and 2.</title><p>Each dot signifies a voxel, at a particular relative location based on the z and y coordinates, averaged across participants, and the black line shows the result of the piecewise regression (based on two components) obtained for the group average.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27576-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Object recognition performance is almost perfectly correlated with scrambling.

To address this concern, we have calculated the partial correlations between behavioral performance and fMRI activation controlling for the correlation with the level of scrambling. Importantly, the partial correlation treats the level of scrambling as a covariate, and therefore allows us to reveal the unique correlation between fMRI activation and behavioral performance. The partial correlations were weaker (compared with the original, simple correlation) but were nevertheless, still evident and significant in the posterior parietal ROIs and in regions along the ventral pathway, pointing to a plausible contribution of dorsal regions to perception.

In particular, since we have utilized a block design, we cannot reach any conclusions about the representational structure of any particular exemplar. Therefore, the RSA focuses on the extent to which the <italic>availability of shape information</italic> modulates the representational content in different ROIs (see comment above, subsection “ii. Representational Similarity Analysis”, first two paragraphs). You will recall that the experiment is blocked by level of scrambling: intact through 256 scrambled pieces. The RSA allows us to explore the extent to which each ROI represents information as a function of the coherence of the shape, and it is this parameter that enables us to reach a conclusion regarding the sensitivity to shape.</p><p>Another concern raised by the reviewers is that the similarities or dissimilarities between the representational structures of different ROIs might be accounted for by changes of low-level visual attributes, which are being distorted by the scrambling manipulation. It is for this very reason that we conducted the second experiment with the diffeomorphic manipulation and we conducted the RSA on these data as described above for the box scrambling manipulation i.e. we have applied the same analyses on fundamentally different scrambling manipulations (box scrambling and diffeomorphic scrambling) that distort object shape, but preserve different attributes of the original stimuli. Importantly, similar patterns of results for the first-order and second-order RSA were observed across the two experiments, reinforcing the notion that our results reflect the sensitivity of the visual system to shape information, rather than to low level attributes. This conclusion is also supported by the differences observed between the two experiments. In particular, the diffeomorphic scrambling preserves more shape information than the box scrambling manipulation and accordingly, the RSA for this experiment uncovered overall lower correlations with the shape model.</p><p>We have incorporated this discussion in the subsection “ii. Representational Similarity Analysis” and in the last paragraph of the subsection “What aspects of object properties are encoded by the dorsal pathway?”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be more informative to use Box Scrambling and Diffeomorphic Scrambling as subtitles rather than Experiment 1 and Experiment 2.</p></disp-quote><p>The paper has been revised accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
