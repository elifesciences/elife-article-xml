currently exhibit multicellularity with different generation mechanisms in a variety of contexts of ecology on Earth. In the present study, we report a new type of multicellular bacterium, HS-3, isolated from an underground stream. HS-3 self-organizes its filamentous cells into a layer-structured colony with the properties of a nematic liquid crystal. After maturation, the colony starts to form a semi-closed sphere accommodating clusters of coccobacillus daughter cells and selectively releases them upon contact with water. This is the first report that shows that a liquid-crystal status of cells can support the prokaryotic multicellular behavior. Importantly, the observed behavior of HS-3 suggests that the recurrent intermittent exposure of colonies to water flow in the cave might have been the ecological context that cultivated the evolutionary transition from unicellular to multicellular life. This is the new extant model that underpins theories regarding a role of ecological context in the emergence of multicellularity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>origin of multicellularity</kwd><kwd>two-dimensional nematic liquid crystal</kwd><kwd>ecological scaffolding</kwd><kwd>limestone cave</kwd><kwd>competition-dispersal trade-off</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new bacterium isolated from an underground stream shows a novel multicellularity by self-organizing its filamentous cells like a liquid crystal and accommodating daughter cells in a sequential manner, which would be a new extant model of prokaryotic multicellularity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The emergence of multicellularity is one of the mysteries of life on Earth, and has been attracting scientists in a broad range of fields including bioengineering on artificial construction of cellular behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2005</xref>) and medical research on cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trigos et al., 2017</xref>). The oldest reliable fossil record of multicellular life is an ~3.42-billion-year-old putative filamentous microfossil that inhabited a paleo-subseafloor hydrothermal vein system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavalazzi et al., 2021</xref>). Since then, the fossil records show the emergence of dominating multicellular cyanobacteria on this planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amard and Bertrand-Sarfati, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golubic and Seong-Joo, 2004</xref>), which were identified as early as 2.32 billion years ago and are assumed to be responsible for the rapid accumulation of oxygen levels, known as the ‘Great Oxygenation Event’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schirrmeister et al., 2011</xref>). It seems that multicellularity emerged several times independently at different species lineages irrespective of a eukaryotic or prokaryotic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>). Multicellularity in prokaryotes would not directly link to the origin of animals, but investigating it gives us fundamental models to consider the mechanistic or evolutionary steps behind the leap to multicellularity. Currently, we see a diversity of prokaryotes that exhibit multicellularity with distinct formation mechanisms in different contexts of ecology on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Claessen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lyons and Kolter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nadell and Bassler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vlamakis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Prokaryotic multicellularity.</title><p>‘Clonal multicellularity’, ‘aggregative multicellularity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>), and ‘multicellular-like behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malik and Rosenberg, 2009</xref>) describe modes of multicellularity that arose through distinguished hypothetical conditions.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-71920-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Actinomyces and cyanobacteria are well-studied prokaryotes that exhibit multicellular forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Claessen et al., 2014</xref>). Their reproducible multicellular structures achieve a high fitness for the whole population even though they are not beneficial for partial individuals. Further elaborate organization can be seen in large-sized genome bacteria, such as <italic>Myxobacteria</italic> (9–16 Mbp genome) and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (7–12 Mbp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Claessen et al., 2014</xref>). Some fitness advantages acquired by multicellularity include avoiding predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernardes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boraas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herron et al., 2019</xref>), cooperative defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shapiro, 1998</xref>), dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2014</xref>), labor division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shapiro, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>), resource competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herron et al., 2019</xref>), and creation of a stable internal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The terms ‘aggregative multicellularity’ or ‘clonal multicellularity’ are used to describe the different bottom-up processes resulting in multicellular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). An example of aggregative multicellularity can be seen in myxobacteria, where solitary cells come together upon stress conditions to organize a fruiting body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonner, 1998</xref>). On the other hand, clonal multicellularity occurs through incomplete cell division, such as in actinomyces and cyanobacteria, and may be the process by which the first eukaryotic ancestor of all animals evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>). The co-option of preexisting cellular traits is an important concept in these bottom-up processes; for example, cell aggregation in response to stress, or a sticky cellular trait might have been used to architect a multicellular status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malik and Rosenberg, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Once a multicellular organism has emerged, the multicellular trait needs to be internalized as genetic information and fixed in the population for which Darwinian natural selection, which occurs over a longer timescale encompassing multiple cell lifetimes, must take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2020</xref>). This is a key problem of the bottom-up perspective of multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Libby and Ratcliff, 2014</xref>). However, the constraints that allow for the selection of a multicellular status are as yet unknown. One suggested explanation of the fixation of multicellularity is the involvement of certain environmental factors that can give an extrinsic selective pressure to the evolving population. This concept is termed ‘Ecological Scaffolding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2020</xref>) and has been experimentally substantiated in a model experiment using <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammerschmidt et al., 2014</xref>). The study regarded a biofilm formed at the air–liquid interface of a glass bottle as a population at a certain generation, and counted repeated dynamism of synthesis and collapse of the biofilm as generations of the population. This concept suggests that Darwinian natural selection is possible even for unicellular organisms through support by external environmental constraints before multicellular traits are fixed in a population.</p><p>The cave microbiome was previously considered to simply be a subset of the surface microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laiz et al., 1999</xref>), but it has recently been shown that the overlap of operational taxonomic units with microbes from the surface is only 11–16% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavoie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the microbiomes of different cave environments differ, as has been revealed in caves composed of limestone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barton and Northup, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rangseekaew and Pathom-Aree, 2019</xref>), lava (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavoie et al., 2017</xref>), ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itcus et al., 2018</xref>), quartz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sauro et al., 2018</xref>), or sulfur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macalady et al., 2008</xref>). Namely, each cave has a distinctive microbiome that has adapted to that environment.</p><p>Here, we report a new cave bacterium that can develop a multicellular-like architecture, possibly through the influence of an external environmental constraint, from a simple, but ordered, cell cluster. The bacterium was isolated from the surface of a cave wall above an underground river in a limestone cave system that is intermittently submerged. The most remarkable aspect of this bacterium’s life-cycle is the existence of well-regulated development (dimorphism) between the first growth stage (filamentous cells that show liquid-crystal-like self-organization on a solid surface) and the second stage (coccobacillus cells that can disperse in flowing water). There is no report that the properties of a nematic liquid crystal were co-opted toward prokaryotic multicellularity. The second stage suggests the involvement of recurrent water flows in the establishment of the multicellularity in this species. We discuss what the discovery of HS-3 implicates in the context of our present understanding and hypothesis about the emergence of multicellularity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Jeongeupia sacculi</italic> sp. nov.

In 2008, strain HS-3 was isolated from water dripping on a limestone cave wall in the Hirao karst plateau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukuyama et al., 2004</xref>) in northern Kyushu Island, Japan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The sampling site, which was located slightly above the water surface of an underground river, was intermittently submerged due to an increase in runoff after rainfall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). After plating on agar, colonies appeared transparent and iridescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). HS-3 is a Gram-negative obligate aerobe with a single polar flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, inset). Genetically, it belongs to a group in the family <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> that is mainly comprised of environmental bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). It has a 3.4 Mbp genome and a plasmid (2.0 kbp).

On a solid medium, the length of the cells was correlated with the colony density, and lower densities were associated with a wider range of cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Generally, the microcolonies initially spread as a single layer. As the colony expands, bulges are produced especially, but not specifically, around the rapidly growing colony edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

The bulges are also generated around the colony center (data not shown).

Since this site is also intermittently submerged by water due to increased runoff caused by rainfall, we examined the response of colonies on an agar plate to being submerged by water. Remarkably, the coccobacilli were released into the water column, leaving the architecture produced by the filamentous cells behind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Even after the complete release of the coccobacillus from the center of the colony, the bottom cell layer of the aligned filamentous cells adhered tightly to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, right side). These observations suggest that the filamentous cells act to support the embedded coccobacilli clusters. We also examined whether the released ‘daughter’ cells were able to reproduce the original colony morphology. The results showed that the spawned coccobacillus cells could indeed reproduce the original filamentous colony morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, when filamentous cells obtained from a mature colony were inoculated on agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) the majority of cells failed to regrow, potentially due to cell damage during recovery. However, a fraction elongated and then divided to generate short rods that each formed a microcolony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the filamentous cells were not irreversibly destined to be the equivalent of ‘somatic’ cells.

While it appears to have occurred both repeatedly and independently in different lineages, the generative process is enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shapiro, 1998</xref>); moreover, we cannot directly observe the transmission process of extant organisms, including HS-3. Nonetheless, in this study, we found unique characteristics of HS-3 that have some implications regarding the emergence of multicellularity.</p><p>The remarkable aspect of HS-3’s life-cycle is the regulated dimorphism between the first growth stage (filamentous cells showing liquid-crystal-like self-organization) and the second stage (coccobacillus cells). The first stage suggests that liquid-crystal-like self-organization is involved in the emergence of multicellularity, which has not been reported before. The liquid-crystal behavior of microscopic cell populations is recognized as the spontaneous formation of intrinsic two-dimensional patterns when motile, rod-shaped cells proliferate in thin layers at a certain density. Typical two-dimensional nematic patterns are characterized by asymmetric vortex structures and anisotropic domains adjacent to specific types of topological defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duclos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Majumdar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>); this was also observed for HS-3 colony on solid surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The rise of the fluid dynamics subdiscipline in physics led to a number of theoretical and experimental approaches for cell behaviors in the last two decades, where researchers observed liquid-crystal orderings in cell suspension of neuronal cells, fibroblasts, melanocytes, osteoblasts, lipocytes, and several laboratory model bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doostmohammadi et al., 2018</xref>). In ordinary bacteria as observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> growing on agar, the nematic features are only sustained for short periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dell’Arciprete et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yaman et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, HS-3 is unique in its ability to maintain the two-dimensional sheet structure for a prolonged period, which we consider to be one of the prerequisites for HS-3 to establish its multicellular behavior.</p><p>This prolonged nematic status enables HS-3 to make its colony growth a two-phase life-cycle. Two distinct life-cycles are seen in extant single-celled bacteria such as spore formation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and asymmetric cell division of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casadesús and Low, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubnau and Losick, 2006</xref>). More generally, bacteria produce differentiated subpopulations using a variety of genetic (e.g., phase variation) or nongenetic (e.g., bistability) mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casadesús and Low, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubnau and Losick, 2006</xref>), by which they can achieve division of labor or hedge their bets in the event of unpredictable future conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malik and Rosenberg, 2009</xref>). Although these dichotomic behaviors at population level underlie in multicellular life, bacteria still require some more process to acquire and establish distinctive multicellular structures. In the case of HS-3, we observed that internal growth of coccobacilli was attenuated until the colony of fibrous cells matured, and this regulation is likely a factor that enabled the establishment of multicellular-like structure.</p><p>Another important condition to support HS-3’s multicellular-like behavior appears to be the dynamic water environment in the cave, which we believe is the key to explain a potential evolutionary path toward HS-3’s multicellularity. The recurrent dynamism of water flow could have allowed each colony on the wall (i.e., a collective of genetically homogenous population) to undergo Darwinian natural selection. This assumption gives an attractive explanation as to how a genetically homogeneous single-cellular organism might have experienced natural selection through a benefit during the early stage of the population characteristics, and supports the ‘Ecological Scaffolding’ theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the present study underpins the aforementioned theories and concepts about the transition from unicellular to multicellular life. HS-3 is an example of an extant prokaryote with a unique multicellular behavior that is based on liquid-crystal characteristics and timely regulated development, and potentially involved recurrent dynamism in its cave environment in the emergence of multicellularity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and culture media</title><p>Strain HS-3 was isolated in 2008 from percolating water on the surface of a limestone cave wall in ‘Seryukutsu’ (Blue Dragon) cave in the Hirao karst plateau (33°46′00.5″ N 130°55′02.7″ E) in northern Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Your revised article has been evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor. We apologize for the long delay in furnishing this decision.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Summary of reviewers' comments:</p><p>The reviewers appreciate the changes you have made in response to the first round of review but are of the opinion that the way in which your discovery is framed is not particularly well justified and may even detract from the main message of your paper.</p><p>Our main concern is that the paper is framed about gaps in our knowledge about how multicellularity evolves, but the paper does not actually do a good job addressing these gaps. We don't actually have any information about what its unicellular ancestors looked like or behaved, how selection acted on early multicellular stages, what transitional steps in its evolution were like, etc. The authors cannot address these questions, because they just have a single contemporary species. And these questions have been addressed in a large literature that the authors do not cite- classically involving the volvocine green algae, and experimental evolution work in yeast, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>.</p><p>What we do have in this paper is a very nice example of bacterial multicellularity that is different from other examples of bacterial multicellularity. And, importantly, it appears that multicellularity, in this case, is adaptive because of the periodic flooding behavior of the cave, which allows for groups to form, generate, and then periodically disperse. We thought that the environment in which these microbes presumably evolved in might provide some neat insight into their evolution, but even this claim must be made lightly since we do not know how these organisms actually evolved. Specifically, we suggested that periodic flooding might act as an ecological scaffold, creating an early life cycle in which groups form and disperse based purely on the abiotic environment. This connects nicely to recent theoretical work on scaffolding, but it seems from the paper that the authors' do not understand what scaffolding is or how their system can be interpreted in this context.</p><p>We think that the introduction needs to be reworked, as in its present form it appears as a meandering list of some of what is known about the early evolution of multicellularity, but it does not review the topic well, build to a critical point or identify gaps in the knowledge that the paper does a good job of addressing. This revised version is, in our opinion, not as good as the first one, as more information has been added but it just makes the arguments about the evolution of multicellularity less coherent.</p><p>In the same vein, we are concerned about Figure 1: first, ecological scaffolding is not widely accepted as a necessary step in the transition to multicellularity. In fact, we do not even have a single good example of it happening. That's actually why we suggested it for this paper in the last review, and we think that this paper might be the best example yet of an idea that so far has just been shown to work in models. Though, of course, we don't know if scaffolding played a role in the evolution of HS3, it seems plausible given the environment. Recurrent dynamism (which is their term for what ecological scaffolding is- these are the same exact argument!), dichotomic cell response, and trade-offs are not all hypothetical conditions for the origin of multicellularity. Scaffolding is, but dichotomic cell response and trade-offs are not conceptual foundations for how multicellularity evolves. A dichotomic cell response will usually be a trait that can be adaptive in a multicellular life cycle, usually because it provides a benefit through division of labor/differentiation. This is really just saying 'cellular differentiation' in using the authors' own unique terminology. And trade-offs are a part of life that constrains how evolution works- a universal law of nature that applies to all of evolutionary biology. Critically, these are three different kinds of ideas, one a conceptual scheme for how multicellularity evolves, one a description of how cells behave, and one a basic feature of all biological evolution.</p><p>We do not understand why they are in the figure as 'hypothetical conditions for the emergence of multicellularity'.</p><p>We believe that this paper stands on its own two feet purely as an example of fascinating organismal biology, a new kind of multicellular bacteria found in caves! That is important in its own right.</p><p>We thus urge the authors to go with their strengths. Talk about the discovery of a fascinating new multicellular organism. Perhaps include a bit about what this teaches us about evolution in the discussion. But to use this as a foundation for the paper appears to us as a mistake, as they fail to clearly identify the gaps in the knowledge of how their work addresses them.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71920.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers are enthusiastic about the discovery but think the description of its significance is lacking.</p><p>They suggest reframing it, not as an example of a missing 'group phase' (which isn't in fact missing, and this paper is not a very compelling argument in any case since it is not on a lineage that has ultimately evolved complex multicellularity), but rather as a new form of bacterial multicellularity.</p><p>'Ecological scaffolding' is a hot topic in the field- the idea that ecology gives rise to the first multicellular life cycles, which then are co-opted by developmental processes (see Black, Bourrat and Rainey, 2020).
