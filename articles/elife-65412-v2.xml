Langerhans cells (LC) in the epidermis to various distinct classical dendritic cell subsets in the dermis. Through genetic fate mapping analysis and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we have identified a novel separate population of LC-independent CD207<sup>+</sup>CD326<sup>+</sup> LC<sup>like</sup> cells in the dermis that homed at a slow rate to the lymph nodes (LNs). These LC<sup>like</sup> cells are long-lived and radio-resistant but, unlike LCs, they are gradually replenished by bone marrow-derived precursors under steady state. LC<sup>like</sup> cells together with cDC1s are the main migratory CD207<sup>+</sup>CD326<sup>+</sup> cell fractions present in the LN and not, as currently assumed, LCs, which are barely detectable, if at all. Cutaneous tolerance to haptens depends on LC<sup>like</sup> cells, whereas LCs suppress effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell functions and inflammation locally in the skin during contact hypersensitivity. These findings bring new insights into the dynamism of cutaneous dendritic cells and their function opening novel avenues in the development of treatments to cure inflammatory skin disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our immune cells are constantly on guard to defend and protect us against invading pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses. Specialized immune cells, known as antigen-presenting cells, or APCs, have a key role in this process. They engulf invaders, chew them up, and travel to the closest local lymph node to stimulate other immune cells with small fragments of these pathogens. This ramps up the immune response to control infection and disease.</p><p>APCs are a large and diverse family of immune cells, which includes dendritic cells and macrophages. Some APCs work as mobile surveillance units, travelling around the body to find new threats. Others embed themselves in particular organs and tissues, such as the skin, to provide local, on-the-spot surveillance. Langerhans cells are one of the main types of APC in the skin and are found in the thin outer layer of the epidermis. While it is commonly believed that Langerhans cells can move from the epidermis to the skin-draining lymph nodes, some seemingly contradictory evidence exists to suggest that this may not be the case.</p><p>Now, Sheng et al. have investigated this issue by tracking APCs, including Langerhans cells, in the skin of mice. A powerful genetic cell labelling technique allowed them to track the movement of immune cells inside a living mouse. Sheng et al. found that majority of 'real' Langerhans cells did not leave the skin. Yet, a second lookalike cell that shared many of the same features of a Langerhans cell was found in the dermal layer of skin, and this cell could travel to local lymph nodes. Both the original and lookalike cells had distinct and separate roles in the skin.</p><p>This research, which has uncovered a new type of Langerhans-like immune cell in the skin, may be extremely useful for developing new targeted therapies to boost immune responses during infection; or to suppress inappropriate immune activation that can lead to autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>dermis</kwd><kwd>lymph node</kwd><kwd>dendritic cell</kwd><kwd>Langerhans cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruedl</surname><given-names>Christiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001505</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Independent Research Organisation grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ronchese</surname><given-names>Franca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0803000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheng</surname><given-names>Jianpeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fate mapping analysis shows that not bona fide Langerhans cells but their ‘look-alikes’ dermal Langerhans cell-like cells migrate to the lymph nodes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 1868, Paul Langerhans described a novel dendritic-shaped, non-pigmentary cell population in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langerhans, 1868</xref>). These so-called Langerhans cells (LCs) were first classified as cellular members of the nervous system, due to their morphological similarity with neurons. It was not until the 1980s when it became clear that this peculiar epidermal cell fraction with its potent antigen presentation activity belonged to the dendritic cell (DC) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Romani and Schuler, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schuler and Steinman, 1985</xref>). Despite the fact that LCs share many features with DCs, they are generally considered as epidermal tissue-resident macrophages, mainly due to their dependence on CSF1, their embryonic origin and local self-maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wynn et al., 2013</xref>), although a conventional ‘macrophage signature’ (e.g. CD16/32, CD64, and MerTK expression) is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>LCs can sense invading pathogens and initiate an intrinsic maturation process that drives their migration out of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romani et al., 2001</xref>). As such, LCs have been regarded as a prototype antigen-presenting cell (APC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagao et al., 2009</xref>) that can, after antigen capture, migrate to the draining lymph nodes (LNs) to initiate an immune response by priming naïve LN-resident T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romani et al., 2003</xref>). Antigen presentation can, however, occur in skin-draining LNs independently of LCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henri et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, the skin hosts several other distinct dermal DC subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kissenpfennig et al., 2005</xref>), the presence of which complicates the analysis of the cellular contribution to skin immune responses, such as contact hypersensitivity (CHS). Consequently, the paradigm of ‘who is doing what’ (i.e. epidermal LCs versus dermal DC counterparts) is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bobr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bursch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clausen and Stoitzner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noordegraaf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West and Bennett, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that under steady-state conditions, LCs most likely do not exit the skin, or if so, in very low numbers. Through a combined use of genetic fate mapping and novel inducible LC-ablating mouse models, we show that the originally described LN LC fraction is actually an independent LC<sup>like</sup> cell population that originates from the dermis, not from the epidermis. These LC<sup>like</sup> cells are ontogenitically different from LCs and are replaced over time by bone marrow (BM)-derived cells with slow kinetics before trafficking to the LN.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LC<sup>like</sup> cells are found in dermis and LNs</title><p>The skin and the skin-draining LNs contain several distinct DC subpopulations. To delineate migratory LCs and dermal DCs, we profiled DC subsets in the epidermis, dermis, and skin-draining LNs. In the epidermis, we confirmed that CD326<sup>+</sup>CD207<sup>+</sup> LCs are predominantly found within the CD11b<sup>hi</sup>F4/80<sup>hi</sup> fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valladeau et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the dermis, we found a fraction of CD11b<sup>hi</sup>F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells that co-expressed CD326 and CD207 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, upper panel). These cells could be immigrated LCs, although we cannot exclude a contamination from the epidermis during the isolation procedure. As expected, the remaining dermal CD11b<sup>hi</sup>F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells were CD326<sup>-</sup>CD207<sup>-</sup> tissue-resident macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tamoutounour et al., 2013</xref>). Dermal DCs were localized in the F4/80<sup>int</sup> and CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup> DC fraction, which we could separate into three subpopulations based on CD103 and CD11b expression: CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup> (defined as cDC1), CD103<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>low</sup>, and CD103<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>hi</sup> (defined as CD11b<sup>hi</sup>). CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup> DCs but not CD103<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>hi</sup> DCs co-expressed CD326 and CD207. We could also divide the CD103<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>low</sup> subpopulation into CD326<sup>-</sup>CD207<sup>-</sup> (defined as triple negative [TN]) and CD326<sup>+</sup>CD207<sup>+</sup> (defined as LC<sup>like</sup>) fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). The signal regulatory protein α (Sirpa), a myeloid cell-specific receptor, was expressed on dermal LCs, LC<sup>like</sup>, TN, and CD11b<sup>hi</sup> DCs, while, as expected, dermal CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs lacked this receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), result validated also by the single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis shown later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In terms of costimulatory receptors, dermal LCs and LC<sup>like</sup> cells express similar levels of CD80 and CD86, whereas the remaining DC subpopulations display lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of cutaneous Langerhans cell (LC) and dendritic cell (DC) subpopulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative flow cytometry dot plots for LC characterization in the epidermis.

Similar to our findings in the dermis, CD11b and CD103 labelling separated the migratory DCs into CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup> (cDC1), CD103<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>hi</sup> (CD11b<sup>hi</sup>), and CD103<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>low</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The CD103<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>low</sup> cells could be further separated into two fractions: CD326<sup>-</sup>CD207<sup>-</sup> (TN) and CD326<sup>+</sup>CD207<sup>+</sup> (LC<sup>like</sup>) subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, we did not detect the bona fide epidermal and dermal LCs showing the original F4/80<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>hi</sup> phenotype in the LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right, lower panel).</p><p>In agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henri et al., 2010</xref>), the CD11b<sup>hi</sup> DC fraction represented the largest DC subpopulation in the dermis, whereas in the LN all four DC subpopulations (CD11b<sup>hi</sup>, cDC1, TN, and LC<sup>like</sup>) were almost equally represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To confirm our observation, we took advantage of the Lang-EGFP mouse to trace directly EGFP-expressing CD207<sup>+</sup> cells in all three tissues (epidermis, dermis, and skin-draining LN). Clearly epidermal EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were co-expressing high levels of CD326 and F4/80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, upper panel). In the dermis, two main EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells’ populations were detectable: one with lower levels of CD326 expressing xCR1, typical marker for cDC1 and a second population co-expressing EGFP and CD326 was further separated into F4/80<sup>hi</sup> and F4/80<sup>low</sup> fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, middle panel). Differently to the skin, EGFP expression in the LN was weaker and was restricted to CD326<sup>low</sup> and CD326<sup>hi</sup> cells: CD326<sup>low</sup> cells represent resident (CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>int</sup>) DCs and CD326<sup>hi</sup> cells the migratory (CD11c<sup>int</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup>) fraction. With respect to resident DCs, EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were only detectable in xCR1<sup>+</sup> cells but not in the CD11b<sup>+</sup> fraction. On the contrary, the migratory DCs were further subdivided into CD326<sup>hi</sup>EGFP<sup>+/low</sup> xCR1<sup>+</sup> cDC1 and F4/80<sup>low</sup> LC<sup>like</sup> cells. No CD326<sup>hi</sup>EGFP<sup>+/low</sup> F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells were detectable in the LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, lower panel).</p><p>Because we detected no phenotypic F4/80<sup>hi</sup> LCs in the LNs, we hypothesized that the cutaneous DCs en route to the LN were not derived from epidermal LCs, but rather from distinct dermal CD11b<sup>hi</sup>, cDC1, TN, and F4/80<sup>low</sup> LC<sup>like</sup> DC populations.

Here, we induced immune tolerance against the strong contact sensitizer DNFB by epicutaneous application of an innocuous DNTB. We applied DNTB to the shaved abdomen of DT-injected WT, CD207-DTR, Clec9A-DTR, and DC-SIGN DTR mice 7 days prior to subsequent DNFB sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). As a positive control, we established a group of WT mice that was not treated and tolerized with DNTB. When the mice were ear-challenged with DNFB, we found that the non-tolerized WT mice developed robust CHS, as evidence by ear swelling that increased over time upon DNFB challenge. CD207-DTR mice were clearly not tolerized against DNFB, since they showed robust ear inflammation over time. Such ear swelling was not observed in DNTB-tolerized WT, Clec9A-DTR, and DC-SIGN-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). CHS is conferred by cytotoxic T-cell-mediated skin inflammation induced by exposure to strong contact sensitizers, such as DNFB. We thus analysed activated IFN-γ-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T-cells in the skin-draining LNs by flow cytometry on day 5 post DNFB sensitization. In line with the observed ear swelling profile, we found that a low IFN-γ-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T-cell response was restricted to DNTB-tolerized WT, Clec9A-DTR, and DC-SIGN-DTR mice. This response was comparatively enhanced in CD207-DTR and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The diminished level of ear inflammation in DNTB-tolerized WT, Clec9A-DTR, and DC-SIGN-DTR mice correlated with an increased presence of activated ICOS<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> in the LN, which exhibit suppressive activity in CHS to DNFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vocanson et al., 2010</xref>).

Because of this clear difference between CD207-DTR mice (that lack CD207<sup>+</sup> LCs/LC-like cells and CD207<sup>+</sup> DC1s) and DC-SIGN DTR mice (that lack only CD207<sup>+</sup> LCs) and Clec9A-DTR mice (that lack only CD207<sup>+</sup> cDC1), we conclude that only LC<sup>like</sup> cells critically contribute to tolerance induction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Epidermal LCs are the only APCs localized in the epidermis. These cells were recently re-defined as ‘macrophages in DC clothing’ due to their unique ontogeny, and self-renewing and radio-resistant characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doebel et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, there are multiple DC and macrophage subpopulations that reside in the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tamoutounour et al., 2013</xref>). Although these dermal DCs share some common markers with LCs (such as langerin [CD207] and EpCAM [CD326]), they constitute a distinct cell lineage on the basis of their developmental origins and cytokine requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bursch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ginhoux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poulin et al., 2007</xref>). Three CD207<sup>+</sup> DC subpopulations have been described in the skin-draining LN: two subpopulations are skin-derived and one subpopulation originates from the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bursch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douillard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romani et al., 2010</xref>). Due to this diverse skin-resident DC network, it became evident that not only LCs but other skin-derived DCs might be involved either in tolerance or immune response induction in draining LNs.</p><p>Although it is commonly believed that the journey of an LC starts from the epidermis and ends in the skin-draining LN after a transit through the dermis in steady state, we found that it is in fact their look-alike counterparts, LC<sup>like</sup> cells, that migrate to the draining LNs. Our new insight was gained by re-analysing established mouse strains (<italic>Kit</italic><sup>MerCreMer</sup>/R26 mice) and exploiting newly generated transgenic mouse strains (DC-SIGN-DTR mice and DC-SIGN-DTR- Kit<sup>MerCreMer</sup>/R26 fate mapping mice), which allowed us to visualize, with increasing resolution, the in vivo dynamics of skin-resident DCs under steady state. We first characterized and re-defined different DC/LC subsets in the dermis by flow cytometry and scRNA-seq analysis, which delineated classical F4/80<sup>hi</sup> LC and four different DC subsets, namely cDC1, TN DCs, CD11b<sup>hi</sup> DCs, and an unappreciated CD11b<sup>low</sup>F4/80<sup>low</sup> LC<sup>like</sup> cell fraction. With the exception of classical F4/80<sup>hi</sup> LCs, we found all of these cells in the migratory CD11c<sup>int</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup> DC fraction of the skin-draining LN. This finding suggests that the majority of migratory CD326<sup>+</sup>CD207<sup>+</sup> DCs are CD103<sup>+</sup> cDC1 and CD103<sup>-</sup> LC<sup>like</sup> cells and not classical CD11b<sup>hi</sup>F4/80<sup>hi</sup> LCs which are hardly seen in the LN if not at all. Corroborating evidence for differential migratory behaviours among different skin DCs was provided by real-time intravital two-photon microscopy. Under steady-state conditions, due to the structural integrity of the basement membrane, epidermal LCs are sessile with static and almost immobile dendrites. In contrast, dermal DC subpopulations are actively crawling through the dermal interstitial space at high velocity even in absence of inflammation suggesting that continuous migration to LN is a steady-state property of dermal DCs and not epidermal LCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shklovskaya et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of dermal DCs is in full agreement with recent published data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henri et al., 2010</xref>. The DC family in the dermis was likewise disentangled in five subpopulations: two subsets lacking the expression of CD207 (CD207<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup> [TN] and CD207<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> [CD11bhi]) and three expressing CD207 (CD11b<sup>int</sup>CD207<sup>++</sup> mLCs, CD11b<sup>low/-</sup>CD207<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> [cDC1], and CD11b<sup>low</sup>CD207<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>-</sup> [LC<sup>like</sup>]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henri et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, cutaneous LNs were distinguished in five analogous subpopulations including mLCs, which were defined for their characteristics in radioresistance and not for the expression of classical LC markers (CD11b<sup>hi</sup> and F4/80<sup>hi</sup>). Henri et al. speculated that LN LCs downregulated CD11b and F4/80 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henri et al., 2010</xref>) and therefore these markers lost their discriminatory power to segregate distinct CD207<sup>+</sup> cells in the LN.</p><p>To circumvent the ‘complication’ of the potential shift in phenotype, we adopted an alternative approach based on genetic fate mapping analyses which allowed to trace cell lineages between distinct LC and DC subpopulations avoiding lethal irradiation and generation of chimeric mice. First, our E7.5 embryo ‘labelling strategy’ demonstrated that only LCs are partially yolk sac-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>), but not the other migratory DCs’ subpopulations, inclusive of LC<sup>like</sup> cells. Second, our detailed analyses of the fate mapping kinetics revealed that the radio-resistant and radiosensitive CD11b<sup>low</sup>CD207<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>-</sup> subpopulations described by Henri et al. represented instead a truly homogeneous radio-resistant LC<sup>like</sup> subpopulation, which is gradually replaced over time by BM-derived progenitors. Furthermore, we corroborated their ‘LC independency’, since long-term absence of LCs did not affect the numbers of LC<sup>like</sup> cells in our DC-SIGN DTR mouse model. We also ruled out a possible downregulation of DC-SIGN during LC maturation which excludes the transition of a dermal DC-SIGN<sup>pos</sup> LC to a DC-SIGN<sup>neg</sup> LC<sup>like</sup> cell. Accordingly, our analysis delineated only four, and not five, LN migratory DC subpopulations, excluding LCs. The phenotypes, transcription profiles, and cytokine requirements of dermal cDC1, TN, and CD11b<sup>hi</sup> DCs have been extensively described (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clausen and Stoitzner, 2015</xref>); however, there has been comparatively less attention given to the LC<sup>like</sup> subpopulation.</p><p>Unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq trascriptome data of dermal cells indicated that LC and LC<sup>like</sup> cells, although sharing some common myeloid cell markers and TFs, are two independent cell fractions and clearly distinct from macrophages and the other skin DC subpopulations. However, unlike LCs, which are BM-independent, radio-resistant, and self-renewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghigo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoeffel et al., 2012</xref>), LC<sup>like</sup> cells represent a radio-resistant population that is progressively replaced postnatally by BM-derived precursors. Similar to resident macrophages in tissues, such as skin, gut, kidney, and heart, LC<sup>like</sup> cells have a dual origin involving both embryonic (but not yolk sack-like LCs) and adult haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Molawi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soncin et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike other skin DC subpopulations, which are short-lived and exhibit a high turnover rate, we show that fetal-derived LC<sup>like</sup> cells are long-lived, show higher proliferation rates than conventional DCs, and are replaced very slowly by BM-derived cells. These fetal-derived and BM-derived LC<sup>like</sup> cells co-exist together in adult tissue, and although derived from different origins, they show high similarity. This finding suggests that it is the local tissue microenvironment and not the cellular origin that shapes their final identity. The existence of an LC-independent radio-resistant dermal DC fraction was previously observed in other study that described the presence of an in situ proliferating, radio-resistant dermal DC subpopulation not only in the murine but also in human dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogunovic et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, a langerin-expressing dermal myeloid CD1<sup>+</sup> DC fraction unrelated to XCR1<sup>+</sup> DCs and LCs has been reported in human dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigley et al., 2015</xref>). It is likely that these cells are the LC<sup>like</sup> cells described here and further studies will be needed to analyse the potential relationship between murine CD207<sup>+</sup> LC<sup>like</sup> cells and human myeloid CD207<sup>+</sup> DC counterparts.</p><p>Although all dermal DCs migrate into LNs in a CCR7-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Förster et al., 1999</xref>), LC<sup>like</sup> cells seem to migrate at slower rate than other DCs under steady-state conditions. Similar slow trafficking dynamics was originally attributed to LCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bursch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ruedl et al., 2000</xref>) but we now strongly believe that these previously reported slow migratory cells are in fact LC<sup>like</sup> cells.</p><p>To further rule out the possibility that epidermal F4/80<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>hi</sup> LC downregulate CD11b and F4/80 and turn into F4/80<sup>low</sup>CD11b<sup>low</sup> LC<sup>like</sup> cells in the dermis, we exploited a novel DC-SIGN DTR transgenic mouse strain where LCs, but not LC<sup>like</sup> cells, could be ablated. Even long-term depletion (6 weeks) of epidermal and dermal LCs had no effect on the numbers of LC<sup>like</sup> cells in the dermis and LNs while maintaining their LC<sup>like</sup> YFP-labelling profile in the absence of epidermal LCs in DC-SIGN DTR-<italic>Kit</italic><sup>MerCreMer</sup>/R26 mice.</p><p>The contribution of LCs to hapten sensitization is still controversial and matter of debate since the phenotype observed in different LC depleting mouse models is ranging from reduced to exaggerated CHS reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noordegraaf et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bobr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clausen and Stoitzner, 2015</xref>). The depletion of LCs, in the herein presented novel DC-SIGN DTR transgenic mouse line, resulted in enhanced CHS, a similar phenotype also reported in hu-DTA and huDTR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bobr et al., 2010</xref>). The T<sub>regs</sub>-independent LC-mediated suppressive effect is restricted locally to the skin since several proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) as well as effector IFN-γ CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells are enhanced at the challenged cutaneous side in absence of LCs. Interestingly VEGF-α, recently reported as a novel biomarker for pathological cutaneous alterations such as psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canavese et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2015</xref>), is highly upregulated in LC-deficient mice which indicates an involvement of LCs in controlling keratinocytes in their VEGF production. In summary, our data corroborate the view that LCs data corroborate the view that LCs are one of the main immune regulators within the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West and Bennett, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The role of different skin-resident DCs in triggering tolerance is also widely debated. Several studies have demonstrated that LCs are crucial for inducing tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Igyarto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kautz-Neu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">King et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Price et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shklovskaya et al., 2011</xref>) by stimulating T<sub>regs</sub> and anergizing CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. This effect has been shown, for example, in an experimental CHS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez de Agüero et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, others have demonstrated the specific contribution of dermal DCs into maintaining skin tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azukizawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tordesillas et al., 2018</xref>). Given that we only detected LC<sup>like</sup> cells and not bona fide LCs in the draining LNs, we readdressed this issue in a cutaneous tolerance model towards the weak contact allergen, DNTB. We used our novel inducible DC-SIGN DTR mice, in which LCs but not dermal or LN LC<sup>like</sup> cells can be ablated, together with other CD207<sup>+</sup>CD326<sup>+</sup> LC/DCs depleting DTR strains (inducible CD207-DTR and Clec9A-DTR mice). Deletion of LCs or cDC1 had no effect on tolerance induction, while deletion of both LCs and LC<sup>like</sup> cells prevented tolerance induction. This finding demonstrates that migratory LC<sup>like</sup> cells, which are capable of reaching the draining LNs, are responsible for the expansion of ICOS<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> and the suppression of a cytotoxic T-cell response.</p><p>In summary, our genetic fate mapping approach, used to delineate the complex skin DC network, does not support the established paradigm of LCs as being the main ‘prototype’ migrating APCs to draining LNs under homeostatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson and Villadangos, 2004</xref>). We propose, rather, that LCs at steady state, similar to other tissue-resident macrophages, are sessile and act locally in the skin, whereas dermal LC<sup>like</sup> cells assume many of the functions previously attributed to LCs. The identification of this novel migratory dermal LC<sup>like</sup> subpopulation opens new avenues and approaches in the development of treatments to cure diseases such as contact allergic dermatitis and other inflammatory skin disorders like psoriasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rat anti-mouse CD45 (30-F11)</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 103108;

Pregnant mice (E7.5) were injected once with 16 mg TAM for embryo labelling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>DT injection</title><p>DC-SIGN-DTR<sup>pos</sup> and DC-SIGN-DTR<sup>neg</sup> mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 20 ng/g DT (Sigma-Aldrich) to deplete DC-SIGN-expressing cells. Two different DT injection protocols were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). For the short-term depletion protocol, mice were injected i.p. at day −2 and −1 before collection of tissues. For the long-term protocol, DT was injected once a week over 5 weeks prior tissue collection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Generation of BM chimeras</title><p>Chimeric mice were generated by irradiating recipient C57BL/6 or DC-SIGN-DTR mice (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) with two doses of 550 cGy, 4 hr apart. Then, 10<sup>6</sup> B6.Ly5.1 (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) BM cells were injected intravenously (i.v.), 24 hr after treatment. The mice were allowed to recover from 1 to 4 months before analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Isolation of epidermal, dermal, and LN cells</title><p>Mouse ears were cut and separated into dorsal and ventral halves using fine forceps. Both the dorsal and ventral halves (with the epidermis side facing upwards) were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in 1 ml IMDM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) medium containing 1 U/ml Dispase II (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The epidermis and dermis were separated using fine forceps, cut into small pieces and digested for another 1 hr at 37°C in 1 mg/ml Collagenase D (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). To obtain single-cell suspensions, the digested tissue was passed through a 40 mm cell strainer. To process skin-draining auricular LNs, the dissected LNs were minced and incubated in 1 mg/ml collagenase D for 60 min at 37°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used: anti-mouse CD45 (30-F11), anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70), anti-mouse F4/80 (BM8), anti-mouse Ly6c (HK1.4), anti-mouse CD11c (N418), anti-mouse I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2), anti-mouse CD103 (2E7), anti-mouse CD326 (G8.8), anti-mouse CD207 (4C7), anti-mouse CD45.1 (A20), anti-mouse CD45.2 (104). They were purchased all from Biolegend (San Diego, CA, USA). Anti-mouse CD45 microbeads from Milteny (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). All antibodies were used for extracellular stainings with the exception of the anti-CD207 Ab which was used for intracellular labelling after have fixed and permeabilized the cells with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% saponin, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Flow cytometry analysis of skin-related DC subpopulations</title><p>Single-cell epidermal, dermal, or LN tissue suspensions were pre-incubated with 10 mg/ml anti-Fc receptor antibody (2.4G2) on ice for 20 min. Then, the suspensions were further incubated with fluorochrome-labelled antibodies at 4°C for 20 min, before being washed and re-suspended in PBS/2% FCS for analysis on a five-laser flow cytometer (LSR Fortessa; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA). The data were analysed with FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA) and UMAP analysis was performed using the FlowJo UMAP plugin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>scRNA-seq analysis</title><p>Immune cells were enriched using anti-mouse CD45 microbeads from dermal single-cell suspension. Briefly, enriched CD45<sup>+</sup> dermal cells were loaded into chromium microfluidic chips with v3 chemistry and barcoded with a 10× Chromium Controller (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA). RNA from the barcoded cells was subsequently reverse-transcribed and sequencing libraries constructed with reagents from a Chromium Single Cell v3 reagent kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library sequencing was performed at Novogene Co., Ltd (Tianjin Novogene Technology Co., Tianjin, China) with Illumina HiSeq 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Single-cell data analysis</title><p>FastQC was used to perform basic statistics on the quality of the raw reads. Raw reads were demultiplexed and mapped to the reference genome by 10X Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline using default parameters. All downstream single-cell analyses were performed using Cell Ranger and Seurat unless mentioned specifically. In brief, for each gene and each cell barcode (filtered by Cell Ranger), unique molecule identifiers were counted to construct digital expression matrices. Secondary filtration for Seurat analysis: a gene with expression in more than three cells was considered as expressed and each cell was required to have at least 200 expressed genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>All mouse RNAs were analysed using an Agilent Bioanalyser (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The RNA Integrity Number ranged from 3.4 to 9.3, with a median of 8.2. cDNA libraries were prepared from a range of 18, 24.2, 68, and 100 ng total RNA starting material using the Ovation Universal RNA-seq system. The length distribution of the cDNA libraries was monitored using a DNA High Sensitivity Reagent Kit on an Agilent Bioanalyser. All 11 samples were subjected to an indexed paired-end sequencing run of 2 × 100 bp on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).</p><p>The paired-end reads were trimmed with trim_galore1 (option: -q 20 –stringency 5 –paired). The trimmed paired-end reads were mapped to the Mouse GRCm38/mm10 reference genome using the STAR2 (version 2.6.0a) alignment tool with multi-sample two-pass mapping. Mapped reads were summarized to the gene level using featureCounts3 in the subread4 software package (version 1.4.6-p5) and with gene annotation from GENCODE release M19. DESeq25 was used to analyse differentially expressed genes, and significant genes were identified with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values&lt;0.05. DESeq2 analysis was carried out in R version 3.5.2.</p><p>For functional analysis, hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean distance and complete linkage, was performed using the R ‘pheatmap’ package. PCA was performed using the R ‘prcomp’ package. The first two principal components were analysed on a multidimensional scatterplot that was created using the R ‘scatterplot 3D’ function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Preparation and staining of epidermal sheets</title><p>DC-SIGN-DTR<sup>neg</sup> and DC-SIGN-DTR<sup>+</sup> mice were treated for 2 days with DT. Ears were collected and split into dorsal and ventral halves and subsequently incubated with 3.8% ammonium thiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 20 min at 37°C. Epidermal and dermal sheets were separated and fixed in ice-cold acetone for 15 min. Then, the epidermal sheets were pre-incubated with 10 mg/ml anti-Fc receptor antibody (2.4G2) on ice for 20 min and subsequently stained with FITC-labelled anti-MHC class II antibody for a further 30 min on ice for LC visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Ears were harvested and immediately homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

DT injection was repeated for 7 days every 3–4 days to maintain the LC pool ablated. The ears of both WT and DC-SIGN DTR mice were challenged with 0.5% DNFB. Ear swelling was measured daily for 12 consecutive days post challenge. Another mouse group was sacrifized at day 3 post challenge for qPCR analysis and for dermal T-cell response analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Induction of tolerance to CHS</title><p>WT, CD207-DTR, Clec9A-DTR, and DC-SIGN DTR mice were injected with DT every 3–4 days over a period of 20 days to maintain the depletion of the target cells (CD207-DTR: LC, cDC1, and LC<sup>like</sup> cells; Clec9A-DTR: cDC1 and DC-SIGN-DTR: LC and CD11b<sup>hi</sup> cells). All mouse strains were tolerized with a 100 μl volume of 1% DNTB (Sigma-Aldrich) in an acetone and olive oil mixture (AOO) (4:1, v/v), administered epicutaneously to the shaved abdomen. One group of WT mice was painted only with AOO as a control. After 7 days, all mouse strains were sensitized by skin painting the dorsal side of the ears with 0.5% DNFB (Sigma-Aldrich) (25 μl in AOO). Another group of mice was further ear-challenged 5 days later with 0.1% DNFB (4 μl in AOO), and ear swelling was measured using a digital caliper (Mitutoyo, Kanagawa, Japan) over the course of 6 days. In a second group of mice, the draining LNs were harvested at day 5 post tolerization/sensitization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Analysis of T-cell responses</title><p>To determine the capacity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells to secrete IFN-γ, isolated cells were stimulated in a round-bottom 96-well culture plate (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mg/ml Ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in complete IMDM for 3 hr followed by an additional 2 hr incubation with 10 μg/ml Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C. The cells were then harvested and stained for CD3 and CD8, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.05% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) before staining with anti-IFN-γ antibodies. To quantify activated T<sub>regs</sub>, isolated cells were co-stained for CD4 and ICOS, fixed, and permeabilized using a Fix/Perm Buffer Set (eBioscience) before staining with an anti-Foxp3 antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistics</title><p>The data represent the means ± SEM or SD, as indicated in the figure legends. GraphPad Prism software was used to display the data and for statistical analysis. Statistical tests were selected based on the appropriate assumptions with respect to data distribution and variance characteristics. All statistical tests are fully described in detail in the figure legends. Samples were analysed by two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test to determine statistical differences between two groups. A two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test was used to determine the differences between more than two groups. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

The corresponding results explain the expression of langerin on two fractions of dermal DC (CD103+ and CD103-) observed several years ago. The demonstration that epidermal LC do not contribute to LN populations in the steady state is completely unexpected and raises important question on the in vivo function of the LC-like subset unveiled in the present study.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fate mapping analysis reveals a novel dermal migratory Langerhans-like cell population&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nikolaus Romani (Reviewer #1); Matthew Collin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. (a) Stain the new LC-like population for SIRP-alpha (as this was an important marker in Sandrine Henri's 2010 analyses) and (b) assess DC-SIGN protein expression in immature and mature epidermal Langerhans cells by FACS. There are no clear data in the literature regarding DC-SIGN expression on mouse Langerhans cells. The expression of DC-SIGN on mouse Langerhans cells will thus constitute a divergence with human Langerhans cells. Fixing these two points require simple FACS analyses.</p><p>2. Perform more in-depth analysis of the single cell data to better probe the relationship of the LC-like subset with LC.</p><p>3. Provide information on the proliferation of the LC-like subset. To give rise to such a substantial LN population, the LC-like subset is expected to have a fast turnover. Analysis of the single cell data or a FACS experiment documenting cell cycle markers can contribute to solve this important issue.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors (required)):</italic></p><p>I have some questions for clarifications. Most of the answers will be in the authors' existing files. I suggest two limited set of additional simple (FACS) experiments (see my points #3 and 4) to strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>1. Some questions and remarks to Figure 1 – flow cytometry analyses. Answers can easily be provided.</p><p>1a. For how many experiments are the FACS plots in Figure 1 representative?</p><p>1b. Where are – in Figure 1B dermis – the LC-like cells when backgating onto the F4/80 vs.CD11b plot? Just beneath the LC gate? In other words, how high is the level of F4/80 on the LC-like cells?</p><p>1c. Figure 1C. Lymph node. F4/80 vs. CD11b. Is this necessary at all? The gate does not really exclude many cells from further analysis. What is the rationale?</p><p>2. Figure 2: Single-cell analyses are interesting and the separate population is convincing. In Figure 2C, however, one cannot really see differences between LCs and LC-like cells. Would the difference in F4/80 expression be mirrored in these plots? Could they be shown? Likewise, maturation marker expression would be informative. Looks like these maturation markers are less expressed in the LC-like cells in panel D – correct? Please provide more information on this point.</p><p>3. The authors refer to Henri et al., 2010 in the JEM. Indeed, their populations conform to each other nicely. One marker, though, may be of additional importance, epecially since the authors are referring to that work several times. SIRP-α. Henri in Table I has it on &quot;LC in transit&quot; in the dermis. It discriminates these transiting LCs from the other langerin+ dermal populations. It would therefore be highly valuable to know about the status of this surface antigen on the populations in the dermis and the lymph node.</p><p>4. DC-SIGN-DTR mice – Figures 6 and S2. This new mouse model is as yet unpublished. Little if nothing is known about DC-SIGN/CD209 expression on mouse Langerhans cells. Here, the authors show &quot;only&quot; mRNA expression. Could it be possible that LC might down-regulate DC-SIGN surface protein expression upon maturation and in vivo migration? If so, this could explain why LC-like cells are spared from the toxic effect of DT. However, if this is not the case, it would reinforce the authors' conclusions. To determine this would be experimentally very easy: DC-SIGN antibody staining of freshly isolated epidermal LC versus LC cultured for 2 or 3 days – no need to enrich, bulk culture together with keratinocytes suffices – counterstain with langerin or MHC-II. I think this is also important to establish since human LC are clearly DC-SIGN-negative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors (required)):</italic></p><p>The study uses a range of incisive and complementary technologies to delineate LC-like cells as distinct from epidermal LC, migratory LC and langerin+ cDC1. It is very well written, easy to follow and presents an interesting discussion showing how the current work fits with previous descriptions of murine dermal DC.</p><p>1. The dual origin of the LC-like cell (page 7 and figure 4) was inferred from BM chimera experiments in which there was incomplete turnover to donor origin within 4 months. However, this is completely consistent with simple slow kinetics as then demonstrated in the next section (page 8 and figure 5). I do not think that 50% turnover at 4 months following transplantation supports a 'dual origin' if one is considering HSC origin. The language 'dual origin' is confusing because this terminology is in use to describe primitive yolk sac and definitive HSC contributions to LC and macrophage populations. The authors do explain this in the discussion that their use of dual means 'fetal and adult' but this is again a kinetic rate of replacement issue from HSC rather than a critical distinction between primitive yolk sac and definitive HSC. I make this point also because the preceding section (page 6 and Figure 3) shows that the % yolk sac contribution to LC-like cells matches that of HSC-derived DC and is distinct from LC with their small yolk sac contribution. In this sense, the LC-like cell has the same single origin from HSC as other DC. It is just replaced at a slower rate.</p><p>2. Proliferation is a major variable that is missing from the data. Could the authors derive this from the single cell RNAseq? In situ proliferation possibly accounts for slow replacement kinetics of LC-like cells yet their substantial contribution to the LN populations. If they are not continually supplied by in situ proliferation in the tissues then presumably LC-like cells must also have an extended life in the LN, compared with other DC?</p><p>3. The authors could also do more with their single cell data to define the differences between LC-like and LC. A host of upregulated genes is depicted in Figure 2 in addition to DC-SIGN and TGFB2 but do these define certain pathways or transcription factor signatures?</p><p>4. Relate to this is it possible to probe similarities or differences between LC-like cells and other DC? Specifically, the data in 2A could be re-clustered taking only LC and DC which might potentially resolve cDC1 and cDC2 within DC/mono. This is relevant because the discussion about the equivalent human DC misses several studies on langerin expression in cDC2 detectable as mRNA in the blood, in cDC2 inhabiting the dermis and inducible to the same level as LC with TSLP/GM-CSF and TGFb. E.g PMID 25114264, 25352125, 25516751. LC-like cells may be directly comparable with human langerin+ DC (a cDC2) that are neither LC nor cDC1 (25516751). If there is insufficient resolution in the SC RNAseq data then another 6 mice/one lane of 10X might suffice. Without wanting to speculate too much, this relationship between cDC2 and LC may indicate a latent precursor function of cDC2 in humans and in mice (the non-monocyte LC precursor observed in several murine studies).</p><p>5. Given that there are about 3-4 times as many migratory LC as LC-like cells in the dermis (Figure 2A) and LC do not appear in the LN then where do they go?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65412.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.
