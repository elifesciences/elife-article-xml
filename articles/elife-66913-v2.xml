crops have been widely planted and the effects of Bt-crops on populations of the target and non-target insect pests have been well studied. However, the effects of Bt-crops exposure on microorganisms that interact with crop pests have not previously been quantified. Here, we use laboratory and field data to show that infection of <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> with a densovirus (HaDV2) is associated with its enhanced growth and tolerance to Bt-cotton. Moreover, field monitoring showed a much higher incidence of cotton bollworm infection with HaDV2 in regions cultivated with Bt-cotton than in regions without it, with the rate of densovirus infection increasing with increasing use of Bt-cotton. RNA-seq suggested tolerance to both baculovirus and Cry1Ac were enhanced via the immune-related pathways. These findings suggest that exposure to Bt-crops has selected for beneficial interactions between the target pest and a mutualistic microorganism that enhances its performance on Bt-crops under field conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Bacillus thuringiensis</kwd><kwd>Helicoverpa armigera</kwd><kwd>densovirus</kwd><kwd>beneficial interactions</kwd><kwd>symbiosis</kwd><kwd>insect resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Key Project for Breeding Genetic Modified Organisms</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019ZX08012004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Kongming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Key Project for Breeding Genetic Modified Organisms</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016ZX08012004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Kongming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L026821/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Kenneth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000690</institution-id><institution>Research Councils UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P023444/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Kenneth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exposure to <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (Bt) selects for beneficial interactions between the target insect pest (<italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>) and its symbiotic densovirus that enhances its performance on Bt-crops under field conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transgenic crops expressing insecticidal Cry proteins from <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> bacteria, known as Bt-crops, have become important tools for the management of insect crop pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrière et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cattaneo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hutchison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shelton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabashnik et al., 2010</xref>).

We have previously shown that the commercialization of transgenic Bt-cotton in China brought significant changes in the ecology of insects utilizing the crop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swiatkiewicz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). However, the effect of Bt-crops on other organisms, such as microbes, which could be playing important roles in the life cycle of insect populations, remains largely unknown.</p><p>Recently, we showed in laboratory trials that infection with a densovirus, <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> densovirus-1 (HaDV2, named as HaDNV-1 previously, GenBank accession number: NC_015718), was associated with significantly enhanced tolerance of cotton bollworm, <italic>H. armigera</italic>, to a baculovirus (<italic>H. armigera</italic> nucleopolyhedrovirus, HaNPV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), and there was some suggestion that the densovirus also increased tolerance to Cry1Ac toxin in a Bt-susceptible strain of <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2017b</xref>). HaDV2 was found to be widespread in wild populations of <italic>H. armigera</italic> adults (&gt;67% prevalence between 2008 and 2012) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). The densovirus was mainly distributed in the fat body of the insect and could be both horizontally and vertically transmitted. Moreover, HaDV2-positive individuals showed faster development and higher fecundity than non-infected individuals. There was no evidence for a negative effect of HaDV2 infection on <italic>H. armigera</italic> in relation to other fitness-related traits, suggesting a possible mutualistic interaction between the cotton bollworm and HaDV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we further explore the interaction between <italic>H. armigera</italic>, HaDV2, and Bt-cotton, to establish its relevance to field populations and to test the hypothesis that the widespread adoption of Bt-cotton in China has selected for cotton bollworm carrying the densovirus. Laboratory experiments show that HaDV2 infection in both Cry1Ac-resistant and Cry1Ac-susceptible strains of cotton bollworm enhances larval tolerance to Bt and overall fitness. Field experiments indicate that <italic>H. armigera</italic> populations infected with HaDV2 also have a higher tolerance to Bt-cotton relative to those not infected with HaDV2. Moreover, field monitoring over a 10-year period indicates that the frequency of HaDV2-infected cotton bollworm is significantly higher in regions planted with Bt-cotton than in those areas where Bt-cotton is not grown, and that in Bt-cotton-growing areas, the prevalence of HaDV2 infection increases with time since Bt-cotton adoption and with the proportion of cotton that is grown which is transgenic. Further, we found that increased Bt tolerance is associated with activated immune pathways to HaDV2 infection. These results indicate that increased HaDV2 infection in cotton bollworm is correlated with the wide-scale adoption of Bt-cotton in China. Our data are consistent with the notion that exposure to Bt-crops selects for beneficial interactions between the target pest and a microorganism that enhances their fitness in response to Bt exposure under field conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HaDV2 infection increases Cry1Ac tolerance in <italic>H. armigera</italic></title><p>Previous laboratory bioassays suggested that when a Cry1Ac-susceptible strain of <italic>H. armigera</italic> was infected with HaDV2, it increased its tolerance to the Cry1Ac toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). To explore the generality of this finding, we first analyzed the effect of HaDV2 infection in different <italic>H. armigera</italic> populations that differ in their susceptibility to Cry1Ac due to different mechanisms of resistance. Two susceptible <italic>H. armigera</italic> strains infected with HaDV2 (96S and LF) both showed 1.5 times greater tolerance to Cry1Ac toxin, relative to their corresponding non-infected controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a and b</xref>). In the case of the Cry1Ac-resistant strains (BtR, 96CAD, LFC2, LF5, LF60, LF120, and LF240), infection with HaDV2 again showed a significant increase in their tolerance relative to the corresponding strains without HaDV2 infection, ranging between 30% and 130% enhanced tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The slope of the regression line is significantly greater than one (t-test: t=2.853, df=6, p=0.029), suggesting that the benefits of carrying HaDV2 may increase with increasing levels of Bt tolerance. Logistic regression confirmed that for a given strain of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, larvae harboring HaDV2 were significantly more tolerant to Cry1Ac (GLM: Strain: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>8</sub>=36.57, p&lt;0.0001, log10 (Cry1Ac toxin concentration): χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>=848.16, p&lt;0.0001; Strain*log10(Cry1Ac toxin concentration): χ<sup>2</sup><sub>8</sub>=97.30, p&lt;0.0001; HaDV2-status: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>=9.53, p=0.0020). However, there was no evidence that the benefits of hosting HaDV2 are affected by the tolerance level of the <italic>H. armigera</italic> strain, as reflected in the LC<sub>50</sub> of the non-infected insects (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>=0.06, p=0.80). At 8 days post-hatching, <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae were significantly lighter (t=10.164, df=32, p&lt;0.0001, n=17) and had lower HaDV2 viral loads in individuals feeding on diet containing Bt than the ones without Bt (t=4.527, df=32, p&lt;0.0001, n=17), suggesting that Bt decreased the replication rate of HaDV2 by suppressing the growth of <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Relationship of different <italic>Helicoverpaarmigera</italic> strains’ LC<sub>50</sub> with or without HaDV2 infection.</title><p>The x-axis is the LC<sub>50</sub> of different strains (LF, 96S, LF5, LF60, LF120, LF240, LFC2, 96CAD, and BtR) without HaDV2 infection (HaDV2-negative); the y-axis is the LC<sub>50</sub> of different strains (LF, 96S, LF5, LF60, LF120, LF240, LFC2, 96CAD, and BtR) with HaDV2 infection (HaDV2-positive).

Thus, our data suggest that the Cry1Ac-toxin selected for HaDV2-infected <italic>H. armigera</italic> following exposure to Bt-cotton and our RNA-Seq analysis suggests that the increased tolerance of HaDV2-infected insects is caused, in part at least, by the activation of a series of immune pathways and pathways that enhance development.</p><p>The emergence and rapid spread of a symbiont through a host population have been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Himler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turelli and Hoffmann, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weeks et al., 2007</xref>). For example, the bacterial symbiont, <italic>Rickettsia</italic> sp. nr. <italic>bellii</italic>, swept through a population of invasive sweet potato whitefly, <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>, in just 6 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Himler et al., 2011</xref>). Although we do not know when HaDV2 first infected <italic>H. armigera</italic> in China, in two areas where Bt-cotton is grown extensively, and where nearly 100% of all insects are currently infected with HaDV2, the prevalence of the densovirus was as low as 40% in 2007, when the earliest samples were collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, extrapolation of the observed temporal trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) would suggest that emergence of HaDV2 may have coincided with the introduction of Bt-cotton in China two decades ago. This apparently rapid spread is perhaps not surprising given the strong fitness benefits of carrying the densovirus (amounting to a ~40% increase in <italic>H. armigera R</italic><sub>0</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with this, based on these estimated increases in <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>, a simple population growth model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Himler et al., 2011</xref>) suggests that HaDV2 would go to near fixation in 20–30 generations in Bt-cotton-growing areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Rather than being a recent introduction to <italic>H. armigera</italic> in China, it is possible that the association between the HaDV2 and its host is more ancient, but that the increase in HaDV2 prevalence in recent years is because it has only recently evolved from a parasitic or commensal relationship into one that is more mutualistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weeks et al., 2007</xref>), perhaps under direct or indirect selection from Bt-cotton. Indeed, most of the densoviruses that have been studied thus far have tended to be at the parasitic end of the symbiotic spectrum and some of these have even been promoted as potential biological pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">El-Far et al., 2012</xref>). However, the observation that densoviruses tend to be parasitic in nature is likely biased by the fact that viruses with notable pathological effects on their hosts are more likely to be reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roossinck, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roossinck, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Webster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). With the advent of modern molecular methods, such as suppression subtractive hybridization and RNA-seq, it has become apparent that there are many ‘good viruses’ that have failed to be discovered due to their relatively benign, or even beneficial, effects on their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roossinck, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roossinck, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Webster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), including HaDV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Although there is an increasing number of studies suggesting that symbiotic microbes can impact an insect host’s ability to combat pathogens and parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hedges et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oliver et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), as far as we are aware, this is the first field study to provide support for the notion that a symbiotic virus could protect a crop pest from Bt toxin.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not larvae are exposed to Cry1Ac, HaDV2 appears to enhance the fitness of both Bt-resistant and Bt-susceptible <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Theoretically, the infection rate should naturally increase in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> population both in Bt-cotton and non-Bt-cotton regions because of efficient transmission with horizontal and vertical modes and the mutualistic relationship between HaDV2 and its host, especially increasing its reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). We monitored HaDV2 infection rates at 38 locations across 16 provinces during the period 2014–2016. Indeed, our data showed that HaDV2 infection levels increased both in Bt-cotton and non-Bt-cotton areas. However, with the exception of samples from Changde (Hunan Province), the other 37 locations showed consistent trends that HaDV2 infection rates were significantly higher in Bt-cotton areas than in non-Bt-cotton areas. Previously, we also quantified the infection rate of HaDV2 in samples collected from Changde in 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). The final infection rate in samples from Changde in the 4 years was 45%, which is higher than the infection rate of samples from non-Bt-cotton planting regions (26%). Changde is located at the southernmost point of Bt-cotton-growing range, where the planted cotton included both non-Bt- and Bt-cotton and the fluctuation of HaDV2 infection rate in Changde might be due to both the lower pressure of Bt-cotton and the migration of <italic>H. armigera</italic> between Bt- and non-Bt-cotton-growing areas. Previously, we showed that there was evidence for a significant decline in HaDV2 prevalence from 2008 to 2012, especially in the migrating moths collected in Yantai (Beihuang Island), which is located in Bohai Sea between Bt- and non-Bt-cotton areas and where there were no resident populations of <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). If we exclude the data from Yantai, however, there was no obvious temporal trend in HaDV2 prevalence between 2008 and 2012 (85%, 77%, 83%, 73%, and 75%, respectively). Other factors might also result in variation in HaDV2 infection rates. For example, there are four generations of <italic>H. armigera</italic> per year in northern China and the fourth generation overwinters as diapausing pupae, and if <italic>H. armigera</italic> grows too fast due to HaDV2 infection, it will overwinter at an inappropriate state which may lead to higher mortality of HaDV2-positive individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang and Li, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The climate and crop structures of the locations where our samples were collected have been relatively constant over the last few decades and data analyses supported the notion that HaDV2 prevalence was not correlated with environmental variables or the areas of any other crops being grown. Using the PCR method, it is not possible to discount the possibility that HaDV2 was widespread in field populations of <italic>H. armigera</italic> as very low-titer covert infections, and that the higher incidence of virus in areas of Bt-cotton was due to the stress associated with larvae feeding on plants expressing Bt toxin. To test the hypothesis, using larvae with low dose of HaDV2 from single pair, we quantified the copy numbers of HaDV2 within the cotton bollworms feeding on artificial diets with or without Bt toxin. Interestingly, the results showed that feeding on the Bt toxin resulted in lower titers of HaDV2, which might be due to the Bt suppressing the growth of <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae. These results suggest that the higher infection rate of HaDV2 might be due to lower mortality by higher Bt tolerance and the increased reproduction of the cotton bollworms with HaDV2 than those without. These findings support the notion that Bt-cotton has played an important role in increasing HaDV2 infection rates in field populations of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, and suggest the possibility that HaDV2 may threaten the future control of <italic>H. armigera</italic> by Bt.</p><p>We found some evidence to support this hypothesis from LC<sub>50</sub>-bioassays using synthetic diets containing Cry1Ac protoxin, with the benefits of hosting HaDV2 being greatest for the most Bt-resistant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting synergistic effects of Bt-resistance and HaDV2 infection. However, laboratory trials using non-Bt- and Bt-cotton plants suggested that the relative fitness benefits of harboring HaDV2 were independent of exposure to Bt-cotton and of Bt-resistance levels (at least in terms of larval growth rates) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). This is at odds with the observation that HaDV2 infection levels in the field are higher when populations are exposed to Bt-cotton for prolonged periods, and may indicate that LC50-bioassays are a more reliable measure of relative fitness than larval growth on Bt-cotton plants in the laboratory. Alternatively, it is possible that there are added benefits to HaDV2 infection for <italic>H. armigera</italic> exposed to Bt-cotton in the field that our laboratory bioassays cannot fully capture, such as the enhanced capacity to resist predators and parasitoids, or reduced exposure to chemical pesticides. In this latter regard, there may be parallels here with the increase in outbreaks of mirid bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae) following the wide-scale adoption of Bt-cotton in China and the subsequent reduction in pesticide application rate on crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The evolution of tolerance to Bt-toxins could endanger the utility of this GM technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gahan et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gahan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gahan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heckel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tabashnik, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tabashnik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tabashnik et al., 2013</xref>). However, as observed here, resistance to Cry toxins is often associated with significant fitness costs that are likely to delay the establishment of Bt-resistant populations under field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horikoshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raymond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santos-Amaya et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we show here that Bt-resistant strains with different resistance mechanisms, such as mutations affecting ABCC2 (strain LF60) or cadherin (strain 96CAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>), incurred significantly reduced fitness costs when they were infected with HaDV2. The reduction of fitness costs by HaDV2 infection, especially increasing the reproduction of their hosts, could speed up the establishment of resistant populations. The Bt resistance induced by ABCC2 and cadherin is due to genomic heritable variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>), while the Bt tolerance induced by HaDV2 appears to be due to the regulation of immune and other pathways. ABCC2 and cadherin can directly mediate high levels of resistance to Bt toxin in <italic>H. armigera</italic>, but with significant fitness costs (e.g., lower reproduction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2014</xref>); however, HaDV2 infection could enhance host reproduction and tolerance to Cry1Ac in both susceptible and resistant strains of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, increasing larval survival rate. Susceptible strains infected with HaDV2 showed only 1.5 times greater tolerance to Cry1Ac toxin. In the case of the Cry1Ac-resistant strains, infection with HaDV2 again showed a significant increase in their resistance relative to the corresponding strains without HaDV2 infection, ranging between 30% and 130% enhanced resistance. Thus, a potential implication of these results is that the increased prevalence of HaDV2 infections under field conditions could impact the evolution of <italic>H. armigera</italic> populations resistant to Bt-cotton, which might decrease the control efficacy by Bt-cotton expressing Cry1Ac toxin and promote the development of novel strategies for <italic>H. armigera</italic> control.</p><p>The temporal increase in HaDV2 infection levels observed in Xiajin and Anci, two cotton-growing counties &gt;300 km apart in north-east China, was associated with parallel temporal increases in relative growth rates (RADR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). In a previous study of these two populations, the temporal increase in RADR between 2002 and 2014 was ascribed to evolved genetic resistance to Cry1Ac in <italic>H. armigera</italic>, despite the failure to identify the key genetic locus conferring resistance in these populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2015</xref>). The relatively strong correlation between the annual prevalence of HaDV2 in <italic>H. armigera</italic> and their mean annual RADR in each of these populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>) suggests that the putative increase in genetic resistance over this period may, at least in part, be due to the phenotypic expression of HaDV2 infection. The fact that the densovirus is mostly located in the insect’s fat body suggests that it may play a role in <italic>H. armigera</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Lepidopteran larvae tend to become more tolerant to pathogens and toxins as they age and grow, a phenomenon known as developmental resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engelhard and Volkman, 1995</xref>). HaDV2-infected <italic>H. armigera</italic> not only accumulate more fat body than non-infected individuals, but they also grow faster and larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, developmental resistance could provide a potential mechanism to explain the enhanced tolerance of densovirus-infected insects. HaDV2-infected larvae have more fat body than non-infected insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), and the fat body plays an important role in insect immunity as it is a major site for the production and secretion of antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>), so immunological resistance is another potential mechanism by which HaDV2 may enhance resistance to both baculovirus and Cry1Ac.</p><p>To explore further the molecular interaction between the HaDV2 and its host, we performed an RNA-seq experiment using <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae. Due to the observed effects of HaDV2 on its host, we focused on molecular pathways related to immunity and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jindra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kingsolver and Hardy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kingsolver et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin and Smagghe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shields, 2017</xref>). In <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae at 24 and 48 hr, the Jak-STAT pathway was significantly enriched by upregulation in HaDV2-positive individuals. In fruit flies and mosquitoes, this pathway controls the expression of genes in response to infection with a range of viruses and bacteria, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> C virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barillas-Mury et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marques and Imler, 2016</xref>). The Jak-STAT pathway was not significantly enriched in larvae at 72 hr, however, pathways related to other antimicrobials were, for example, the lysosome and MAPK signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watts, 2012</xref>). Previously, we found that HaDV2-positive individuals developed faster than non-infected insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the transcriptome data suggest that several pathways related to development are also significantly enriched, including the insect hormone synthesis, insulin, mTOR, and AMPK signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jindra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin and Smagghe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). We did not observe the differential expression of genes playing pivotal roles in Bt resistance of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, for example, cadherin, APN, and ALP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gahan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that HaDV2 may not enhance resistance to Bt using traditional molecular resistance pathways, though we did observe that the ABC transporter pathways, which has been reported to be associated with Bt-resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bretschneider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dermauw and Van Leeuwen, 2014</xref>), were significantly upregulated at 48 hr post challenge.</p><p>Generally, the mode of action of Bt toxins agrees that Bt protoxins are first converted to activated toxins by midgut proteases, then the toxins bind to the midgut receptors, for example, CAD, APN, and ALP, finally leading to insect death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xiao and Wu, 2019</xref>). A change in any of these steps will lead to Bt resistance, such as mutations in genes for toxin activation, toxin-binding, and changes in insect immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). To understand the responses of <italic>H. armigera</italic> to Bt toxins with or without HaDV2, we conducted RNA-seq after larvae had been exposed to Cry1Ac. In insects lacking HaDV2, Cry1Ac increased the activation of Bt protoxins by increasing the expression level of proteases, such as trypsin. In a defensive response to Cry1Ac, receptor genes of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, such as APN and ALP, were significantly downregulated to reduce the toxin-binding capacity. Carboxylesterase genes and most of ABC transporters genes were significantly upregulated to improve insect immunity, while other pathways related to antimicrobials, for example, MAPK signaling pathways, were significantly downregulated, reducing resistance to Bt toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, when <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae were infected with HaDV2, these genes and pathways were generally not significantly enriched after Cry1Ac exposure: one trypsin gene was downregulated and some genes involved in drug metabolism were upregulated to increase the metabolism of xenobiotics, improving Bt tolerance. Through RNA-seq analysis, we did not find significant upregulation or downregulation of genes known to be related to typical Bt tolerance. Thus, it is difficult to perform further experiments, e.g. CRISPR. In spite of this, our data still support the notion that HaDV2 increased the Bt tolerance level of <italic>H. armigera</italic> via related immune mechanisms.</p><p>Whilst data from the field are inevitably correlational, when combined with the laboratory experiments, we feel that the most parsimonious explanation for the observations reported here is that HaDV2 directly or indirectly enhances tolerance of <italic>H. armigera</italic> to Bt in the field, probably via increasing larval growth rates and via priming of immune defenses. However, demonstrating causation conclusively in the field will prove difficult. One possibility would be to plant some Bt-cotton in areas that are currently Bt-free and to compare larval growth patterns and HaDV2 infection levels in neighboring Bt and non-Bt areas, mirroring the ‘natural’ field experiments we report here. As was found with the rapid spread of mutualistic <italic>Rickettsia</italic> in whiteflies (1–97% prevalence in just 6 years or around 80 field generations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Himler et al., 2011</xref>), we envisage that HaDV2 infection levels will eventually go to fixation (or close to it) in both Bt and non-Bt areas, due to the growth benefits associated harboring this mutualist, but that the time to get to this point will take longer in non-Bt areas, due to the lower fitness benefits. Likewise, we envisage that the spread of HaDV2 infection would slow down in Bt areas if Bt-cotton were to be replaced by conventional cotton or a GM variety that did not rely on Bt toxins. Another possibility would be to conduct laboratory evolution experiments using populations of <italic>H. armigera</italic> infected or not with HaDV2 growing on either Bt- or non-Bt-cotton over several generations. We envisage that HaDV2 infection levels would increase over time on both Bt- and non-Bt-cotton due to the fitness benefits of HaDV2 infection, but that the rate of spread would be faster on Bt-cotton. We also envisage that the fitness of <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> and cumulative population size after several generations) would be determined by the interaction between HaDV2 infected-status and cotton plant Bt-status. A similar experiment to this was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Himler et al., 2011</xref> for laboratory cages of whitefly populations infected with <italic>Rickettsia</italic>, who found that over five generations, the prevalence of <italic>Rickettsia</italic> increased from 14% in the parental generation to 40–70% on three different host plant species. Repeating such experiments with <italic>H. armigera</italic> is feasible but logistically much more difficult due to their much larger size. In summary, here, we report the rapid increase in the prevalence of a mutualistic virus in a major crop pest and show that its spread is greatest for field populations exposed to Bt-cotton for prolonged periods. Our findings support a novel mechanism by which insects may cope with changes in engineered host plant defenses, namely via infection with a mutualistic virus that enhances their tolerance to the toxins expressed by Bt-cotton crops. Our study has significant implications for understanding the co-evolution of host-pathogen-symbiont interactions. Although we show that HaDV2 increases the tolerance of its host to Bt, it is not feasible to manipulate HaDV2 infection status in the field in order to enhance the capacity of Bt to manage <italic>H. armigera</italic> because of the lack of suitable antivirals (against HaDV2) and because of the efficient vertical and horizontal transmission of this virius in the field.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

In brief, the susceptibility was evaluated by feeding <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae with an artificial diet containing different concentrations of Cry1Ac toxin. Newly hatched larvae were first orally inoculated with either filtered-liquid containing HaDV2 or filtered-liquid from uninfected individuals. After that, they were placed in each treatment Petri dish for 2 days to ensure that larvae ingested the treated diet. They were then transferred individually on Cry1Ac-contaminated artificial diet in plastic wells (depth: 1.5 cm, vol. 3 mL) in 24-well plates. The plates were covered with a plastic lid to prevent escape and 72 larvae were tested per Cry1Ac concentration. After 7 days, the mortality was recorded and body mass of individuals that were still alive was measured. Both dead larvae and those with a body mass of less than 5 mg were recorded as dead. For each strain, the median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) value was determined using a Probit analysis (POLO Plus LeOra Software, Berkeley) and the resistance level to Cry1Ac indicated by the resistance ratio was calculated with LC<sub>50</sub> of the tested strains divided by the LC<sub>50</sub> of the susceptible strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Assessment of fitness cost</title><p>To test the impact of HaDV2 infection on the fitness cost of its host, life-table parameters of the different strains were analyzed on artificial diet.

Thirteen fitness components (life history parameters) were obtained with life-table techniques (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c and 1d</xref>). The components considered were: (i) survival rate from the 1st to 5th larval instar (0–1), (ii) survival rate from the 5th instar to the pupal stage (0–1), (iii) duration of larval development (days), (iv) pupal weight (mg), (v) female pupal development period (days), (vi) male pupal development period (days), (vii) adult emergence rate (0–1), (viii) proportion of females (or sex ratio) (0–1), (ix) copulation rate (0–1), (x) female adult longevity (days), (xi) male adult longevity (days), (xii) fecundity (number of eggs laid), and (xiii) hatching rate (0–1).

Newly hatched larvae were first orally inoculated with either filtered-liquid containing HaDV2 or filtered-liquid from non-infected individuals. After that, they were placed in each treatment Petri dish for 2 days to ensure that larvae ingested the treated diet. They were then transferred individually onto Bt-cotton (Zhongmian 29) or non-Bt-cotton (Zhongmian 24) leaf in plastic wells in 24-well plates. After 9 days, the weight of individuals was measured.

Adult females collected from the field were placed individually into 250 mL clear plastic cups and covered with gauze to provide a substrate for egg laying. Eggs were collected on a daily basis. At larval hatch, 24 neonates from each female line were placed on non-Bt diet, and 24 neonates were placed on Cry1Ac-containing diet (1 μg of Cry1Ac/g diet). The concentration of Bt Cry1Ac protoxin was 1.0 μg/g diet. The composition of the diet was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).

Then the R package DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used to get the significantly differential expressed unigenes at different comparisons. The threshold to determine the significantly differential expressed unigenes was ‘fold change≥1.5 and the p&lt;0.05’. The hierarchical clustering method was applied to analyze the expression pattern of significantly differentially expressed unigenes in different samples.

interactions and how they may affect adaptation to pesticides, nicely indicates that infection with a mutualistic virus can enhances fitness of a moth, and that selection pressure represented by transgenic crops may be driving the spread of mutualistic infections in moth populations.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rapid spread of a symbiotic virus in a major crop pest following wide-scale adoption of Bt-cotton in China&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Change the title to more precisely reflect the most certain conclusions of the study.</p><p>2) Clearly distinguish between resistance (the evolution of increased tolerance due to genetic changes in the pest population) and other mechanisms of increased tolerance (e.g. virus infection).</p><p>3) Provide the minimum detection limit for the densovirus, to ensure that latent infection is not missed.</p><p>4) In the Discussion, consider and evaluate an alternative hypothesis; that increased virus infection and increased tolerance of Bt cotton are parallel but independent responses to the stress of feeding on Bt cotton.</p><p>5) Redraw Figure 1 with the more appropriate units of LC50 rather than resistance ratio.</p><p>6) Clarify questions about the identity and uniqueness of the virus.</p><p>7) In the Discussion, use existing data to estimate the potential impact on reduction of pest control efficacy by Bt cotton due to densovirus infection in relevant cotton-growing areas of China; and compare this impact to estimated reduction in efficacy due to cadherin mutations and due to mutations in the ABC transporter.</p><p>8) In the Discussion, describe the ideal approach/dataset that would conclusively show that infection by the densovirus causes (not merely is associated with) the increased tolerance of Bt cotton, and evaluate this approach with respect to feasibility. Likewise evaluate the approaches presented in the manuscript relative to this ideal approach.</p><p>9) In the Discussion, discuss the feasibility or infeasibility of manipulating the virus infection status to increase the pest control efficacy by Bt cotton.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Previous reports have provided evidence identifying infection of cotton bollworm with a densovirus as resulting in increased fitness. In the current manuscript, the relevance of this infection towards field resistance to transgenic Bt corn is evaluated by comparing its incidence between regions in China growing non-Bt versus Bt cotton. A clear correlation emerges with infection rates being higher in Bt versus non-Bt cotton growing areas, although its effect on resistance to Cry1Ac and Bt cotton is not as clear.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript presents evidence for the spread of densovirus infection in field bollworm populations, and that this spread seems to occur at a faster rate in areas of China where Bt cotton is grown versus non-Bt cotton areas.</p><p>Life table comparisons clearly show increased fitness in bollworms infected with the virus.</p><p>The study capitalizes on availability of an impressive collection of samples with distinct geographic and historic origin to address relevant evolutionary questions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The suggested role for densovirus infection in resistance to Cry1Ac and Bt cotton is supported by association and the data presented does not necessarily support causation. In fact, the confidence intervals in all the comparisons from bioassays overlap substantially and the resulting resistance ratio is not a good estimate of any significant differences the infection may have on ability to survive Cry1Ac. Infection by a virus is expected to activate the immune system, so the larvae used in bioassays should be considered as &quot;primed&quot; and the slight reduction in susceptibility should not be considered as an effect of the virus itself.</p><p>The life table data clearly shows that fertility and fecundity are probably the most relevant aspects affecting fitness of infected insects. These differences in reproduction (even more than differences in larval growth) could explain why infection is rapidly spreading in the wild. However, most of the research and analyses are focused on the possibility that the viral infection may make the insects more able to survive Cry1Ac or Bt cotton. There are no conclusive data supporting this hypothesis in the current version, other than increased infection rates in Bt-cotton growing areas. This could be explained by effects on reproduction rather than enhanced survival.</p><p>Related to this aspect, there should be a more clear distinction between the densovirus increasing fitness versus increasing resistance, the data supports the former but is not so clear in the later.</p><p>It would be useful to provide a map detailing regions were moths were collected.</p><p>The putative effect of infection on susceptibility could be strengthened by comparing effects of treating the larvae with a non-pathogenic microbe other than the densovirus. One would expect a similar priming of the immune response, making the larva less susceptible to subsequent exposure to Cry1Ac.</p><p>The text may be misleading as written as in several statements suggests densovirus infection is related to resistance to Cry1Ac.Resistance is not due to the densovirus infection, but to other mechanisms.</p><p>More focus needs to be put on the effect of viral infection increasing reproductive output rather than larval growth. It is plausible that the former will have a more relevant role on the spread of infection. The observed higher frequency of infection in Bt cotton areas could be due to participation of infection in survival (as hypothesized) or may be a result of initial selection of individuals that were infected and subsequent spread due to higher reproductive output.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The various pathogenic, parasitic, symbiotic, and mutualistic interactions between insects and the microbes they interact with represents a rich area of research. This study by Xiao et al. represents a very interesting example of such a relationship. Overall the study is well designed and executed. The approach they utilize to test their hypothesis is valid and they combined both laboratory and field collected insects to address the question. The RNAseq analysis also provides potential insights into possible mechanisms by which the virus HaDV2 enables enhanced resistance to Bt Cry1Ac. The RNAseq data also represent one of the minor issues. The authors focused on analyzing only development and immune systems, however, they do not report on any other significantly different changes in gene expression other than reporting that there were 1573 significant differences. The authors should at least provide some holistic analysis and report the data in the supplemental results. Focusing on development and immune systems is valid and rationally supported but a complete analysis should be presented. The relationship between <italic>H. armigera</italic> and HaDV2 is more a mutualistic relationship, thus, the authors should consider changing the titles of the manuscript and the supplementary data. This is an exciting study and is well written and will be of general interest to the field.</p><p>In this study Xiao et al., report on the association of an insect virus with the lepidopteran host <italic>Heliothis armigera</italic> and the development of increased resistance to the Bt toxin Cry1Ac in transgenic cotton. Previous studies from this group had shown that infection of <italic>H. armigera</italic> with the densovirus <italic>H. armigera</italic> densovirus<sup>-1</sup> (HaDV2) enhanced resistance to baculovirus infections and potentially increased resistance to Cry1Ac with no detrimental impacts to fitness. In this study they test the hypothesis that the large adoption of transgenic Bt-cotton has selected for <italic>H. armigera</italic> infected with HaDV2. To test this they examined different <italic>H. armigera</italic> strains with and without HaDV2 and observed a significant increase in resistance in all strains. Previous studies has shown Bt resistance has fitness costs, they showed that resistant strains had improved reproductive rate if the strain was infected with HaDV2 apparently compensating for the fitness costs of resistance. Analysis of field collected larvae from Bt-cotton and non-Bt-cotton regions over the last 10 years showed a direct correlation with HaDV2 infection. To address the question of molecular basis for the enhanced resistance to Bt cotton when infected with HaDV2, resistant and non-resistant strains with or without HaDV2 infection were analysed by RNAseq. Differences in gene expression was bioinformatically analyzed. Focusing on biochemical pathways related to development and immune systems a number of pathways were identified which could account for the observed enhanced fitness of Bt resistant larvae. They conclude the selection of the this mutualistic virus has been selected for by the widespread use of Bt-cotton.</p><p>Additional guidance for Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Title: The word &quot;symbiotic&quot; should be removed from the title.

(page 25, lines 538-542)</p><p>Results: At 8 days post-hatching, <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae were significantly lighter (t = 10.164, d.f. = 32, P &lt; 0.0001, n=17) and had lower HaDV2 viral loads in individuals feeding on diet containing Bt than the ones without Bt (t = 4.527, d.f. = 32, P &lt; 0.0001, n=17), suggesting that Bt decreased the replication rate of HaDV2 by suppressing the growth of <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). (page 5, lines 107-112).</p><p>Discussion: Using the PCR method, it is not possible to discount the possibility that HaDV2 was widespread in field populations of <italic>H. armigera</italic> as very low-titre covert infections, and that the higher incidence of virus in areas of Bt-cotton was due to the stress associated with larvae feeding on plants expressing Bt toxin. To test the hypothesis, using larvae with low dose of HaDV2 from single pair, we quantified the copy numbers of HaDV2 within the cotton bollworms feeding on artificial diets with or without Bt toxin. Interestingly, the results showed that feeding on the Bt toxin resulted in lower titres of HaDV2, which might be due to the Bt suppressing the growth of <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae. These results suggest that the higher infection rate of HaDV2 might be due to lower mortality by higher Bt tolerance and the increased reproduction of the cotton bollworms with HaDV2 than those without.

HaDNV-1 and HaDV2 are pseudonyms for the same virus we found in <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>. At the beginning, densovirus was abbreviated as “DNV” (Tijssen, et al., 1976). For distinguishing the densovirus with ambisense genome in <italic>H. armigera</italic> which was named as HaDNV (El-Far, et al., 2012), we named the densovirus we find as HaDNV-1 (Xu, et al., 2012; Xu, et al., 2014). However, the ICTV changed the abbreviation of densovirus as “DV” and named the HaDNV as HaDV1 in 2014 (Cotmore, et al., 2014).

We added to the discussion. The Bt resistance induced by ABCC2 and cadherin is due to genomic heritable variation (Liang et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2014), while the Bt tolerance induced by HaDV2 appears to be due to the regulation of immune and other pathways. ABCC2 and cadherin can directly mediate high levels of resistance to Bt toxin in <italic>H. armigera</italic> but with significant fitness costs (e.g. lower reproduction) (Cao et al., 2014), however, HaDV2 infection could enhance host reproduction and tolerance to Cry1Ac in both susceptible and resistant strains of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, increasing larval survival rate.

Demonstrating causation conclusively in the field will prove difficult however. One possibility would be to plant some Bt cotton in areas that are currently Bt-free and to compare larval growth patterns and HaDV2 infection levels in neighbouring Bt and non-Bt areas, mirroring the ‘natural’ field experiments we report here. Even this approach, though, would not demonstrate causality conclusively. We envisage that HaDV2 infection levels will eventually go to fixation (or close to it) in both Bt- and non-Bt areas, due to the growth benefits associated harbouring this mutualist but that the time to get to this point will take longer in non-Bt areas, due to the lower fitness benefits. Likewise, we envisage that the spread of HaDV2 infection would slow down in Bt-areas if Bt-cotton were to be replaced by conventional cotton or a GM variety that did not rely on Bt toxins.” (pages 20, lines 470-493).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the Discussion, discuss the feasibility or infeasibility of manipulating the virus infection status to increase the pest control efficacy by Bt cotton.</p></disp-quote><p>Accepted, we added the discussion as follows: “Although we show that HaDV2 increases the tolerance of its host to Bt, it is not feasible to manipulate HaDV2 infection status in the field in order to enhance the capacity of Bt to manage <italic>H. armigera</italic> because of the lack of suitable anti-virals (against HaDV2) and because of the efficient vertical and horizontal transmission of this virius in the field.” (pages 21, lines 512-516).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Previous reports have provided evidence identifying infection of cotton bollworm with a densovirus as resulting in increased fitness. In the current manuscript, the relevance of this infection towards field resistance to transgenic Bt corn is evaluated by comparing its incidence between regions in China growing non-Bt versus Bt cotton. A clear correlation emerges with infection rates being higher in Bt versus non-Bt cotton growing areas, although its effect on resistance to Cry1Ac and Bt cotton is not as clear.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript presents evidence for the spread of densovirus infection in field bollworm populations, and that this spread seems to occur at a faster rate in areas of China where Bt cotton is grown versus non-Bt cotton areas.</p><p>Life table comparisons clearly show increased fitness in bollworms infected with the virus.</p><p>The study capitalizes on availability of an impressive collection of samples with distinct geographic and historic origin to address relevant evolutionary questions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The suggested role for densovirus infection in resistance to Cry1Ac and Bt cotton is supported by association and the data presented does not necessarily support causation. In fact, the confidence intervals in all the comparisons from bioassays overlap substantially and the resulting resistance ratio is not a good estimate of any significant differences the infection may have on ability to survive Cry1Ac. Infection by a virus is expected to activate the immune system, so the larvae used in bioassays should be considered as &quot;primed&quot; and the slight reduction in susceptibility should not be considered as an effect of the virus itself.</p><p>The life table data clearly shows that fertility and fecundity are probably the most relevant aspects affecting fitness of infected insects. These differences in reproduction (even more than differences in larval growth) could explain why infection is rapidly spreading in the wild. However, most of the research and analyses are focused on the possibility that the viral infection may make the insects more able to survive Cry1Ac or Bt cotton. There are no conclusive data supporting this hypothesis in the current version, other than increased infection rates in Bt-cotton growing areas. This could be explained by effects on reproduction rather than enhanced survival.</p><p>Related to this aspect, there should be a more clear distinction between the densovirus increasing fitness versus increasing resistance, the data supports the former but is not so clear in the later.</p><p>It would be useful to provide a map detailing regions were moths were collected.</p><p>The putative effect of infection on susceptibility could be strengthened by comparing effects of treating the larvae with a non-pathogenic microbe other than the densovirus. One would expect a similar priming of the immune response, making the larva less suceptible to subsequent exposure to Cry1Ac.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for the suggestions.
