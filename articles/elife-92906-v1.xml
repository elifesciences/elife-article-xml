The disturbance of gut microbiota aggravates pathogenic bacteria invasion and gut barrier injury. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for microbiome-related disorders, where beneficial strain engraftment is a significant factor influencing FMT outcomes. The aim of this research was to explore the effect of FMT on antibiotic-induced microbiome-disordered (AIMD) models infected with enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC). We used piglet, mouse, and intestinal organoid models to explore the protective effects and mechanisms of FMT on ETEC infection. The results showed that FMT regulated gut microbiota and enhanced the protection of AIMD piglets against ETEC K88 challenge, as demonstrated by reduced intestinal pathogen colonization and alleviated gut barrier injury. <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> (<italic>A. muciniphila</italic>) and <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> (<italic>B. fragilis</italic>) were identified as two strains that may play key roles in FMT. We further investigated the alleviatory effects of these two strains on ETEC infection in the AIMD mice model, which revealed that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> relieved ETEC-induced intestinal inflammation by maintaining the proportion of Treg/Th17 cells and epithelial damage by moderately activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the effect of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> was better than <italic>B. fragilis</italic>. We, therefore, identified whether <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> protected against ETEC infection using basal-out and apical-out intestinal organoid models. <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> did protect the intestinal stem cells and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium, and the protective effects of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> were reversed by Wnt inhibitor. FMT alleviated ETEC-induced gut barrier injury and intestinal inflammation in the AIMD model. <italic>A. muciniph</italic>ila was identified as a key strain in FMT to promote the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells by mediating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pig</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>organoid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32172765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Xinyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>FMT alleviated the intestinal barrier damage caused by enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infection in antibiotic-induced microbiome-disordered model through increasing the relative abundance of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> in the intestine.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota and its metabolites play important roles in modulating host health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canfora et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghosh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). The most drastic exposure that leads to intestinal microbiota dysbiosis is antibiotic treatment, which kills commensal micro-organisms and inhibits these microbiota-mediated immune defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andremont et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buffie and Pamer, 2013</xref>). The disturbance of intestinal microbiota may lead to disruptions of the gut barrier and increase the susceptibility of the host to pathogenic microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flint et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witkowski et al., 2020</xref>). Several clinical studies have demonstrated that early-life exposure to antibiotics leads to gut microbiota dysbiosis that can impair host immune system maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the negative impact of antibiotics on gut microbiota in early life may even last for long periods throughout a lifetime, increasing the risk of gut diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francino, 2015</xref>). Enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC) K88 infection is a common cause of diarrhea in humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubreuil, 2021</xref>). When ETEC adheres to intestinal epithelial cells, virulence factors interact with specific receptors to induce intestinal barrier injury and intestinal inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a therapeutic intervention for reconstructing gut microbiota in gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borody et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colman and Rubin, 2014</xref>). Since FMT has been successful in treating <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection and maintaining the gut barrier, the emerging investigation has been focused on other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quraishi et al., 2017</xref>). However, whether FMT could remedy against ETEC K88 infection in antibiotic-induced gut microbiota-disordered (AIMD) piglets is still unknown. Simultaneously, the underlying mechanism of FMT and the gut microbes that confer its efficacy remain unclear.</p><p>Intestinal stem cell renewal is vital for the maintenance of the gut barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beumer and Clevers, 2021</xref>). Mammalian intestinal epithelial cells are renewed approximately every 3–5 d with the migration of undifferentiated intestinal cells from the crypt to the top of the villi, accompanied by the differentiation of different types of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). The proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium driven by intestinal stem cells, mainly crypt-base columnar cells expressing R-Spondin receptor Lgr5, is a necessary process for repairing intestinal barrier injury to prevent pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sato et al., 2009</xref> successfully cultured isolated intestinal stem cells into three-dimensional intestinal organoids with villous and crypt-like structural morphology for the first time. Intestinal organoids contain various terminally differentiated cell types, including intestinal stem cell, tuft cell, absorptive cell, enteroendocrine cell, goblet cell, and Paneth cell, which have more advantages over single cell lines for in vitro study of intestinal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sprangers et al., 2021</xref>). Intestinal organoid is an ideal model for studying the interaction between intestinal epithelium and microorganisms in vitro, which can eliminate the complexity of animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2019</xref>). In traditional basal-out intestinal organoid models, the intestinal epithelium was in the interior of an organoid spheroid, which restricted the interaction between intestinal epithelium and gut microbiota. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Co et al., 2019</xref> first established the intestinal organoid model with polarity reversal in humans and mouse, which optimizes the shortcomings of microinjection in terms of heterogeneous exposure concentrations and durations, as well as destruction of organoid walls, and evaluated the infection effects of the invasive pathogens with different polarity-specific patterns.</p><p>In the present study, we first investigated the effects of FMT on ETEC K88 infection in AIMD neonatal piglets, then by using bacterial 16 S rDNA sequencing analysis, we identified <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> (<italic>A. muciniphila</italic>) as a potential microbe to alleviate ETEC-induced intestinal barrier injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We further hypothesized that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> could relieve intestinal barrier injury and intestinal inflammation by modulating the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium, and verified this hypothesis using in vivo mice experiments as well as in vitro porcine intestinal organoid models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Collectively, our results may provide the theoretical basis that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> is a promising method to repair intestinal barrier damage and a new strategy for the precise application of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> in livestock production.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental designs of the present study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) administered to the antibiotic-induced microbiome-disordered (AIMD) piglets infected with Enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC) K88.

We set out to explore whether FMT is protected against the ETEC K88 challenge. The piglets were randomly assigned to three groups: the control piglets (Con group), the ETEC K88 infected piglets (EP group), and the ETEC K88 infected piglets with FMT treatment (EF group). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, decreased ADG and increased diarrhea scores were observed in AIMD piglets on day 3 and day 6 after ETEC K88 infection, and these symptoms were relieved by FMT treatment. We next detected the pathogen colonization in mucosal tissues and found that FMT significantly decreased the copies of ETEC K88 in the jejunal and colonic mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To address whether FMT could protect the intestinal barrier against ETEC K88 infection, intestinal barrier integrity, and inflammatory cytokine levels were detected. FMT decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (<italic>TNF-α</italic>, <italic>IL-1β,</italic> and <italic>IL-6</italic>) and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (<italic>IL-10</italic> and <italic>TGF-β1</italic>) in the jejunum (p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Jejunal scanning electron microscopy showed that the villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> top) in ETEC K88 infected piglets were short and coarse, and there existed obvious rod-shaped bacterial adhesion on the surface of microvilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> bottom), while FMT reversed villi and microvilli injury caused by ETEC K88. In addition, the reduced mRNA and protein levels of the tight junctions (ZO-1, claudin, and occludin) and adherence junctions (β-catenin and E-cadherin) caused by ETEC K88 challenge were also reversed by FMT treatment in the jejunum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). We then evaluated the expression of Mucin 2 (MUC2) in the jejunum using immunofluorescence staining. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, ETEC K88 infection reduced the expression of MUC2, which was significantly increased following FMT administration.

Intestinal dysbiosis increases intestinal colonization of antibiotic-resistant and pathogenic bacteria. Antibiotic treatment is the most drastic exposure leading to gut dysbiosis and pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andremont et al., 2021</xref>). Early-life exposure to antibiotic leads to gut microbiota dysbiosis and impair host immune system maturation, which may even last for long periods throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). Researchers have made a lot of attempts to prevent or inhibit antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Our previous study showed that FMT alleviates early-life antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and mucosa injuries in a neonatal piglet model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). Our present study aimed to investigate whether FMT increases early-life antibiotic-induced neonatal piglet against pathogen invasion. ETEC K88 is one of the most common pathogens in humans and animals and causes intestinal inflammation and diarrhea symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun and Kim, 2017</xref>).

In accordance with the above results, the present study showed that ETEC K88 infection increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced the expression of intercellular junction proteins in AIMD piglets. Since FMT has been successful in treating <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection and maintaining gut barrier, emerging investigation has been focused on other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cammarota et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2018</xref> demonstrated that FMT diminished the inflammatory response and the destruction of epithelial integrity in piglets challenged with lipopolysaccharide. In the present study, we found that FMT dampened ETEC K88-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulation and improved the intestinal morphology. In addition, the number of ETEC K88 in jejunal and colonic mucosa was significantly decreased following FMT, which was consistent with the observation of jejunal microvilli under SEM, showing the absence of rod-shaped bacterial adhesion in FMT treatment. ETEC infection was reported to reduce the MUC2 expression by destroying goblet cells or directly degrading MUC2, thereby damaging the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). Our results demonstrated that FMT enhanced the expression of MUC2 and increased the expression of ZO-1, claudin, occludin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin at mRNA and protein levels, indicating that FMT improved the intercellular junctions between intestinal epithelial cells and restored the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier to reduce the colonization and invasion of ETEC K88.</p><p>Intestinal microbiota plays a key role in maintaining gut mucosal barrier and resistance to pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chelakkot et al., 2018</xref>).

It has been reported that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> effectively inhibited intestinal inflammatory response and elevated epithelial barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Everard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> is one of the symbiotic anaerobes within the mammalian gut and is also an opportunistic pathogen which often isolated from clinical specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Although it was initially thought to be pathogenic, in the long-term evolution process, <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> colonized in the gut has established a friendly relationship with the host, which is an essential component for maintaining the health of the host, especially for obesity, diabetes, and immune deficiency diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Troy and Kasper, 2010</xref>). <italic>B. fragilis</italic> could decompose mucin by lipid-anchored enzymes and interact with intestinal epithelial cells, thereby altering intestinal permeability and repairing intestinal epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donaldson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2016</xref> reported that <italic>B. fragilis</italic> altered macrophage phenotype and increased the phagocytosis of macrophages to restrain pathogens colonization. Hence, we speculated that FMT increased the relative abundance of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> in the intestine and alleviate intestinal barrier injury and intestinal inflammation caused by ETEC K88 infection.</p><p>Since <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> were identified as two strains that may play key roles in FMT, we further investigate whether <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> exerted protective effect on ETEC K88 infection in AIMD mice model. We found that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> maintained normal gut morphology after ETEC K88 infection, repaired the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier as evidenced by the reduced FD4 concentration in serum, colonized in the intestine and inhibit the translocation of ETEC K88, and reduced the intestinal inflammation, which may have been attributed to the increased proportion of Treg cells and mature dendritic cells and the decreased proportion of Th17 cells. These results are consistent with the protective role of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> in dextran sulphate sodium salt induced enteritis model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhai et al., 2019</xref>). Intestinal stem cell renewal is vital to maintaining the gut barrier. Ki67 is widely expressed in proliferating cells and presents a reliable indicator of cell proliferation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). Ki67 reaches its peak during the division stage with short half-life period and easy degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> increased the number of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells and the mRNA expression of <italic>Lyz</italic>, suggesting that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> accelerated the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium. Paneth cells not only produce antimicrobial peptides and express key niche signals that regulate stem cells, but also secrete activators that dynamically modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hou et al., 2020</xref>). The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ring et al., 2014</xref>). When the Wnt receptors are activated, the multiprotein degradation complex is rapidly inhibited, which allows β-catenin to accumulate and subsequently migrate to the nucleus and binds to the transcription factors of T cell factor family and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor family to drive the expression of genes that regulate the stem cells, including Lgr5, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). The c-Myc and Cyclin D1 are cyclins that positively regulate cell cycle from the G1 phase to S phase, thus inducing cell cycle progression and promote cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2020</xref> reported that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> restored intestinal mucosal damage with the accelerated proliferation of intestinal epithelium through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thus relieving infection caused by <italic>Salmonella pullorum</italic> in chicks. In the present study, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> moderately activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and maintain the suitable expression of Wnt, Active-β-catenin, Lgr5, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1. Consistent with the in vivo results, ex vivo results of mouse intestinal organoids also demonstrated that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> repaired the damaged intestinal epithelium caused by the ETEC K88 infection by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Simultaneously, <italic>B. fragilis</italic> also avoid the overactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway caused by the ETEC K88 infection, while the impact of <italic>B. fragilis</italic> was not as obvious as <italic>A. muciniphila</italic>.</p><p>Intestinal organoid is an ideal model for studying the interaction between intestinal epithelium and microorganisms in vitro, which can eliminate the complexity of animal models and avoid the unicity of the traditional intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2019</xref>). In order to further verify whether <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> attenuated ETEC K88 infection through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, basal-out and apical-out porcine intestinal organoid models was used. Notably, we found that the ETEC K88 infection down-regulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in vitro, which was inconsistent with the results in vivo. A recent study showed that the addition of 400 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> STp, an enterotoxin of ETEC, could suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway of porcine intestinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). It is speculated that the reason for the difference in results might be related to the difference in the processing time of the in vivo and in vitro treatment. In spite of the slight stimulation of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> on the proliferation and differentiation of infected intestinal organoids, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> up-regulated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and had protective effects on intestinal stem cells. In basal-out intestinal organoid models, the intestinal epithelium was in the interior of organoid spheroid, which restricted the interaction between intestinal epithelium and <italic>A. muciniphila. </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Co et al., 2019</xref> first established the intestinal organoid model with polarity reversal in human and mouse and evaluated the infection effects of the invasive pathogens with different polarity-specific patterns, <italic>Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, on polarity reversal intestinal organoids. Subsequently, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2020</xref>) first applied the porcine intestinal organoids with polarity reversal to investigate the infectivity and antiviral immune responses of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. In addition, studies on host-pathogen interactions using polarity reversal intestinal organoids have also been reported in the sheep and chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nash et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2021</xref>). But up to now, there are few reports on the interaction between host and symbiotic microorganism using polarity reversal intestinal organoids. Here, we utilized porcine polarity reversal intestinal organoids to make <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> directly interacting with the intestinal epithelium. Our results showed that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> alleviated the injury of polarity reversal intestinal organoids induced by ETEC K88. In agreement with the in vivo results, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> restrain the intestinal inflammation caused by the ETEC K88 infection in polarity reversal intestinal organoids. Additionally, the alleviatory effect of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> on ETEC K88 infection via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was confirmed with the addition of Wnt inhibitor Wnt-C59. The promoted proliferation and differentiation in the basal-out and apical-out intestinal organoids after co-culturing with <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> were reversed with Wnt-C59.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that FMT relieved intestinal inflammation and improved intestinal barrier function in AIMD piglets infected with ETEC K88. <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> was identified as a key strain in FMT to promote the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells by mediating the Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway.

Other diagrams were implemented by using the R software (v2.15.3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification of short chain fatty acids</title><p>The colonic contents (50 mg) were homogenized with 0.5 ml dH<sub>2</sub>O in ball mill and then centrifuged. The supernatant 1 (0.3 ml) was homogenized with 0.5 ml dH<sub>2</sub>O and then centrifuged. The supernatant 2 (0.5 ml) combined with supernatant 1 were mixed with 0.8 ml of 2-Methylvaleric acid as internal standard solution and 0.1 ml 50% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. After centrifuging, the supernatant was transferred into fresh glass vial for Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, which was performed using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph system coupled with an Agilent 5977B mass spectrometer. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were identified and quantified by the retention time and standard curves of the standard solutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Flow cytometry (FC) analysis</title><p>Intestinal lamina propria cells were isolated by using the Mouse Lamina Propria Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) according to the instruction. For cell surface staining, the cells were incubated with FC block at 2–8℃ for 15 min, then were stained with Live/Dead Dye (FVS510, BD Pharmingen, USA) at room temperature for 15 min, followed by washing with Stain Buffer. Cells were incubated with specifical fluorescent antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>) at 2–8℃ for 30 min to label immune cells. For intracellular factor staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized using Transcription Factor Fix/Prem Buffer at 4℃ for 40 min, washed with 1×Perm/Wash Buffer, and stained with intracellular markers at 4℃ for 30 min. The stained cells were washed and resuspended in PBS, and assessed by the 12-color FACSCelesta flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, USA). The single cells were first gated on SSC-A vs FSC-A and FSC-A vs FSC-H, and then CD45<sup>+</sup>Live<sup>+</sup> cells were gated on single cells. The CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>–</sup> cells were gated on CD45<sup>+</sup>Live<sup>+</sup> cells. The CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells) were gated on CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>–</sup> cells, Tregs (CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells), and Th17 cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>RORt<sup>+</sup> cells) were gated on CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. The CD86<sup>+</sup>CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells were gated on DC<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>–</sup> cells. The data were analyzed using FlowJo software (v10.8.0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Isolation and culture of mouse intestinal crypts</title><p>The jejunum proximal to the stomach was harvested immediately after mice were sacrificed. After gently flushing with cold D-PBS (without calcium and magnesium) using injection syringe, the intestinal segment was opened longitudinally and gently washed with cold D-PBS three times. Then, the washed intestine was cut into 2 mm pieces with scissors, which fell into a 50 ml conical tube containing 15 ml cold D-PBS. The rinsing procedure using the 10 ml serological pipette to gently pipette the intestinal pieces up and down three times and then aspirate off the supernatant and add 15 ml fresh cold D-PBS was repeated 10-15 times until the supernatant was clear. The intestinal pieces were resuspended in 25 ml Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (GCDR, StemCell Technologies, Canada) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min on a rocking platform. After incubation, the intestinal pieces were resuspended in 10 ml cold D-PBS containing 0.1% BSA, supernatant was filtered through a 70 μm filter (Corning, USA), and filtrate was collected and labeled as fraction 1. Repeat the above step three times to obtain fractions 2-4. The fractions were centrifuged at 290×g for 5 min at 4℃ and resuspended in 10 ml cold DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES. The quality of the fractions was assessed by using an inverted microscope. The fraction which enriched for intestinal crypts was selected, centrifuged, and resuspended in equal volumes of complete IntestiCult Organoid Growth Medium (06005, StemCell Technologies, Canada) and Matrigel Matrix. The 50 μl of the 500-crypt suspension was plated in the center of each well of the pre-warmed 24-well plate. The plate was placed at 37℃ with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 10 min and then added 750 μl complete IntestiCult Organoid Growth Medium containing 100 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin to each well. The culture medium was fully exchanged three times per week. After 7 to 10 d of culture, the organoids were passaged using 1:6 split ratio. The images of organoids were captured using inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan). The surface areas of organoids were measured using ImageJ software (v1.8.0). The forming efficiency (%) = (number of mature organoids growing after 5 d/number of crypts seeded)×100%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were statistically analyzed by SPSS (v26.<sup>0</sup>) software, and all data are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD). p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.

The authors identify A. muciniphila and B. fragilis as two important strains and characterize how these organisms impact the epithelium by modulating host signaling pathways, namely the Wnt pathway in lgr5 intestinal stem cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strengths of this manuscript include the use of multiple model systems and follow up mechanistic investigations to understand how A. muciniphila and B. fragilis interacted with the host to impact epithelial physiology.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As in previous revisions, there remains concerning ambiguity in the methodology used for microbiota sequence analysis and it would be difficult to replicate the analysis in any meaningful way. In this revision, concerns about the rigor and reproducibility of this component of the manuscript have been increased. Readers should be cautious with interpretation of this data.</p><p>(1) In previous versions of the manuscript it would appear the correct bioproject accession was listed but, the actual link went to an unrelated project. The updated accession link appears to contain raw data; however, the authors state they used an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

They showed that FMT with fecal samples, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> or <italic>B. fragilis</italic> protected piglets and/or mice from ETEC infection, and this protection is manifested as reduced intestinal inflammation/bacterial colonization, increased tight junction/Muc2 proteins, as well as proper Treg/Th17 cells.

Important parameters required to replicate analysis have still not been provided. Inspection of the SRA data indicates a mix of Illumina MiSeq and Illumina HiSeq 2500. It is now unclear which sequencing technology was used as authors have variably reported 4 different sequencers for these samples. Appropriate metadata was not provided in the SRA, although some groups may be inferred from sample names. These changing descriptions of the methodologies and ambiguity in making the data available create concerns about rigor of study and results.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to confusing the sequencing method of this experiment with other experiment samples, we apologize for the multiple incorrect modifications of the method description.
