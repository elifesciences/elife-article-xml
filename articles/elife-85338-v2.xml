reproductive-aged women worldwide and approximately 6 million women in the United States (U.S.). PCOS can be a significant burden to those affected and is associated with an increased prevalence of mental health (MH) disorders such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and postpartum depression. We undertook this study to determine the excess economic burden associated with MH disorders in women with PCOS in order to allow for a more accurate prioritization of the disorder as a public health priority.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Following PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic review, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Medline, Scopus, and PsycINFO through July 16, 2021, for studies on MH disorders in PCOS. Excluded were studies not in humans, without controls, without original data, or not peer reviewed. As anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and postpartum depression were by far the most common MH disorders assessed by the studies, we performed our meta-analysis on these disorders. Meta-analyses were performed using the DerSimonianâLaird random effects model to compute pooled estimates of prevalence ratios (PRs) for the associations between PCOS and these MH disorders and then calculated the excess direct costs related to these disorders in U.S. dollars (USD) for women suffering from PCOS in the U.S. alone. The quality of selected studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>We screened 78 articles by title/abstract, assessed 43 articles in full text, and included 25 articles. Pooled PRs were 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.32â1.52) for anxiety, 1.65 (95% CI: 1.44â1.89) for depression, 1.48 (95% CI: PR: 1.06â2.05) for eating disorders, and 1.20 (95% CI: 0.96â1.50) for postpartum depression, for PCOS relative to controls. In the U.S., the additional direct healthcare costs associated with anxiety, depression, and eating disorders in PCOS were estimated to be $1.939 billion/yr, $1.678 billion/yr, and $0.644 billion/yr in 2021 USD, respectively. Postpartum depression was excluded from the cost analyses due to the non-significant meta-analysis result. Taken together, the additional direct healthcare costs associated with anxiety, depression, and eating disorders in PCOS were estimated to be $4.261 billion/yr in 2021 USD.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Overall, the direct healthcare annual costs for the most common MH disorders in PCOS, namely anxiety, depression, and eating disorders, exceeds $4 billion in 2021 USD for the U.S. population alone. Taken together with our prior work, these data suggest that the healthcare-related economic burden of PCOS exceeds $15 billion yearly, considering the costs of PCOS diagnosis, and costs related to PCOS-associated MH, reproductive, vascular, and metabolic disorders. As PCOS has much the same prevalence across the world, the excess economic burden attributable to PCOS globally is enormous, mandating that the scientific and policy community increase its focus on this important disorder.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>The study was supported, in part, by PCOS Challenge: The National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association and by the Foundation for Research and Education Excellence</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects one in seven reproductive-age women worldwide. PCOS impacts womenâs physical and mental health, and it may also have detrimental effects on their social lives, academic achievement and careers. Studies show women with PCOS have higher rates of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, infertility and postpartum depression compared with women without the condition.</p><p>The economic burden of PCOS is enormous. Previous studies show PCOS-related economic costs totals billions of dollars. But few studies have examined the costs associated with PCOS-associated mental health care. Learning more about these costs may help policymakers and clinicians allocate resources for mental health care for women with PCOS.</p><p>Yadav et al. analyzed the results of 25 studies to assess the mental health impact of PCOS and its costs. The analysis found that women with PCOS are 60% more likely to have depression or anxiety compared to women without the condition. They were also twice as likely to have eating disorders. Caring for these mental health issues in PCOS patients increases US healthcare costs by approximately $4.2 billion yearly. These costs raise the healthcare-related economic burden of treating PCOS and associated conditions to $15 billion in the United States each year.</p><p>The analysis suggests that earlier recognition and better treatment of PCOS could reduce associated healthcare costs and improve the quality of life for women with PCOS. The results may help policymakers and clinicians understand the condition's impact and prioritize resources for PCOS care. More research on the condition is necessary to reduce the enormous economic and personal burden caused by it.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PCOS</kwd><kwd>female reproduction</kwd><kwd>economic burden</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Foundation for Research and Education Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azziz</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>PCOS Challenge: The National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yadav</surname><given-names>Surabhi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent disorder of women, with significant reproductive, endocrine, and metabolic morbidities and a total healthcare-related economic burden exceeding $15 billion (2021 USD) for the U.S. alone, $4 billion due to mental health disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent disorder, highly inherited complex polygenic, multifactorial disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azziz et al., 2016</xref>). PCOS is the single most common endocrine-metabolic disorder in reproductive-aged women today, affecting 5â15% of unselected reproductive-aged women (1990 National Institutes of Health criteria), and potentially represents a significant financial burden to our healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azziz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riestenberg et al., 2022</xref>). Pathophysiological abnormalities in gonadotropin secretion or action, ovarian folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, insulin secretion or action, and adipose tissue function, among others, have been described in PCOS. Women with PCOS are at increased risk for glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hepatic steatosis and metabolic syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidemia, vascular thrombosis, cerebrovascular accidents, possibly cardiovascular events, subfertility, and obstetric complications, endometrial carcinoma, and mood and psychosexual disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azziz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although the physical symptoms of PCOS are increasingly recognized by practicing clinicians, little attention has focused on the psychological correlates of this frequent endocrine disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Himelein and Thatcher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brutocao et al., 2018</xref>). A significant amount of research has been conducted showing the direct causal relationship between PCOS diagnosis and mental health (MH) disorders. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and obsessiveâcompulsive disorder (OCD) and is associated with worse symptoms of depression, anxiety, OCD, and somatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Himelein and Thatcher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brutocao et al., 2018</xref>). Screening for these disorders to allow early intervention may be warranted.</p><p>In order to allow for a more accurate prioritization of the disorder as a public health priority, we have pursued a comprehensive estimation of the economic burden of PCOS. In previous studies conducted by our team, we estimated the mean annual cost of the initial evaluation of PCOS to be $93 million, that of hormonally treating menstrual dysfunction/abnormal uterine bleeding to be $1.35 billion, that of providing infertility care to be $533 million, and that of treating hirsutism to be $622 million in 2014 USD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azziz et al., 2005</xref>). In a more recent study, we estimated the mean annual costs of PCOS-associated T2DM and associated stroke to be $1.5 and $2.4 billion in 2020 USD, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riestenberg et al., 2022</xref>). The present study aims to assess the direct healthcare-related economic burden of PCOS-related MH disorders. To do so, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies with human subjects and controls that analyzed the relationship between MH disorders and previous diagnosis of PCOS, and then calculated the related direct economic burden.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Systematic review</title><p>A systematic review was performed, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Statement and Checklist (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.prisma-statement.org/">https://www.prisma-statement.org/</ext-link>), for reports examining the relationship of MH disorders and PCOS through July 16, 2021.

MH disorders included depressive disorders, such as major depression disorder, dysthymia, minor depression or subclinical/subthreshold depression, or affective disorders containing depressive disorders, emotional distress, eating disorders, or mood and anxiety disorders. In the case of repeatedly published and studied literature based on the same batch of data or sample population, the most recent studies with the complete dataset were included. Studies were excluded if they: (1) were based on non-human species; (2) did not have full text available; (3) did not include a control group; (4) reported solely on diseases other than PCOS; or (5) were reviews, letters, or commentaries.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Study selection and data extraction</title><p>Search strategy and study identification were performed by one investigator (S.Y.) using a standardized approach. Articles selected for inclusion were then screened by four authors (O.D., A.B., S.Y., and D.M.). Further, four investigators worked to independently extract data on study characteristics and outcomes (A.B., S.Y., O.D., and D.M.). Disagreements were discussed until consensus was reached.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Quality assessment</title><p>Four investigators worked in duplicate to independently assess the quality of eligible studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (S.Y., O.D., A.B., and R.A.)

The meta-analysis was performed using the DerSimonianâLaird random effects model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DerSimonian and Laird, 1986</xref>) and the results of the analyses were summarized using the pooled PR and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each of the above outcomes.</p><p>We should note that when estimating risk, in general we can assume that the OR approximates the risk ratio when the prevalence in both groups is low (~&lt;10%). However, when the prevalence of the outcome is higher the OR is likely to overestimate of risk ratio. Outcomes for this study were generally higher, so we used prevalence ratios (PRs) instead of ORs for the economic burden calculations. The limitation of using PRs is that these effects were not adjusted for the full set of covariates as for the OR analysis. However, most studies used groups that were matched by age and/or body mass index (BMI) by design.</p><p>Study-specific and overall effect estimates were visually presented using Forest plots. Between-study heterogeneity was evaluated using the <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> statistic. In case of significant heterogeneity (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt;70%) sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding any outliers from the analysis. We defined an outlier as any study whose CIs did not overlap the CI of the pooled estimate for the purpose of the sensitivity analysis. To assess the potential impact of self-reporting on the outcomes observed, we also performed sensitivity analyses excluding studies where PCOS was self-reported. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. To adjust for possible publication bias, we recalculated the results using the âtrim and fillâ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shi and Lin, 2019</xref>). In light of the asymmetry observed in the funnel plots, we further supplemented our assessment of potential publication bias by running Eggerâs test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egger et al., 1997</xref>). Analyses were performed using R version 4.1.3.</p><p>When selecting measures of risk ratios, we noted that, in general, we can assume that the OR approximates the risk ratio when the prevalence in both groups is low (approximately &lt;10%). However, when the prevalence of the outcome is higher than 10% the OR is likely to be an over-estimate of the risk ratio. As outcomes for this study were generally higher than 10%, we chose to use PRs instead of ORs for the economic burden calculations. These PRs were derived by comparing the prevalence in our study groups to the prevalence in the general population, which was determined based on control data in the included studies. The limitation of using PRs is that these effects were not adjusted for the full set of covariates as for the OR analysis. However, most studies used groups that were matched by age and/or BMI by design.</p><p>As previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azziz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riestenberg et al., 2022</xref>), we defined the prevalence of PCOS based on the NIH criteria (phenotypes A and B of the Rotterdam criteria) or what is considered the âclassicâ PCOS phenotypes, which we have conservatively estimated to be 6.6%. Annual cost data for medical treatment of depression for individuals 18â49 years of age was obtained from a 2021 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greenberg et al., 2021</xref>), for anxiety for ages 15â54 was obtained from a 1999 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenberg et al., 1999</xref>), and for eating disorders for individuals 20â49 years of age was obtained from a 2021 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Streatfeild et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The calculation of excess costs was based on cost estimates extracted from notable and frequently referenced studies. Though varying in publication year, these studies were selected based on their rigorous methodologies, comprehensive cost analyses, and alignment with our studyâs age-specific focus. For the medical treatment of depression in the age group 18â49, we relied on a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greenberg et al., 2021</xref>. This study thoroughly examines the economic burden associated with major depressive disorder in adults, presenting up-to-date and in-depth cost analyses. The investigatorâs approach to segmenting the costs, which considers direct, indirect, and intangible costs, makes it an excellent choice for our study. The anxiety cost estimate for ages 15â54 was obtained from a seminal work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenberg et al., 1999</xref>. Despite being over two decades old, this paper remains a critical resource due to its exhaustive breakdown of anxiety-related care costs. This study is well regarded for its thoroughness and provides granular data on healthcare and medication costs and costs related to morbidity and mortality. The economic costs associated with eating disorders for ages 20â49 were sourced from the comprehensive study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Streatfeild et al., 2021</xref>, which examined the social and economic costs of eating disorders in the United States (U.S.), making it ideal for our research. We adjusted for inflation using the medical care inflation calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.officialdata.org/Medical-care/price-inflation/">https://www.officialdata.org/Medical-care/price-inflation/</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2018 studies were identified during the initial literature review, of which 78 were screened by title and abstract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

However, we should note that the âtrim and fillâ method cannot be used as formal proof for the presence of publication bias due to âsmall studyâ effects, as it is possible that there are other explanations for the lack of symmetry on the funnel plots, including heterogeneity of study populations, covariates, or outcome definitions that may give rise to a lack of symmetry.

In contrast, results for eating disorders were somewhat less robust. In order to assess publication bias, we also conducted the Eggerâs test for funnel plot asymmetry.

The data sources used in GBD take many forms, including census data, vital registrations, disease registries, survey data, and published and unpublished scientific literature, among other sources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.healthdata.org/acting-data/what-data-sources-go-gbd">https://www.healthdata.org/acting-data/what-data-sources-go-gbd</ext-link>). These investigators concluded that PCOS accounted for 0.43 million associated DALYs. They also noted slight increases in the age-standardized incidence of PCOS and DALYs among women of reproductive age (15â49 years) from 2007 to 2017 at the global level, and in most regions and countries. Safiri et al. also used the GDB Study 2017 database to determine the global, regional, and national burden of PCOS, by age and SDI, over the period 1990â2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Safiri et al., 2022</xref>). These investigators reported that in 2019 the global age-standardized point prevalence and annual incidence rates for PCOS were 1677 (1.7%) and 59 (0.06%) per 100,000, respectively.</p><p>Neither one of these studies estimated the economic cost of the burden observed. Furthermore, we should note that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) reported only on global age-standardized PCOS incidence rates (i.e., the occurrence of <italic>new cases</italic> of PCOS over a specified period of time), not prevalence rates (i.e., the total proportion of persons in the population who have PCOS at a specified point in time or over a specified period of time), among women of reproductive age. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Safiri et al., 2022</xref> present an estimate of prevalence, we should note that the estimate is significantly lower than that reported when populations are assessed directly for the prevalence of PCOS (1.7% vs. 6.6% or greater), likely reflecting the chronic underdiagnosis of PCOS.</p><p>Ding et al. estimated the burden of disease attributable to type 2 DM in women with PCOS using individual patient data from a UK primary care database between 2004 and 2014 and aggregate data from the literature to obtain conversion rates through disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2018</xref>). A simulation approach was applied to model the population dynamics of PCOS over a follow-up period of 25 years in using Bayesian modeling. The investigators estimated that the associated annual healthcare burden of T2DM in PCOS was at least Â£237 million in 2014 pounds in the UK. Taking into account the relative populations of reproductive-aged women (15â49 years) of the UK and the U.S. (14.7 vs. 76.5 million) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2022</xref>), the healthcare inflation rate since 2014 (19.2%), and the conversion rate of pounds to dollars in mid-2021 (0.72 USD to 1 pound), the economic burden for PCOS-associated T2DM estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2018</xref> is equivalent to $2.04 billion 2021 USD, somewhat higher than the $1.527 2021 USD that we previously estimated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riestenberg et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The strength of this study lies in the exclusive inclusion of peer-reviewed and controlled studies. However, our analysis encountered limitations due to the restricted number of studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. This could be due to the fact that PCOS diagnosis creates an umbrella effect that encompasses physical as well as MH disease which creates a false belief in patients that they cannot be treated or diagnosed with a disease other than PCOS due to the misconception that their symptoms stem solely from the PCOS diagnosis. Other limitations of this study include the fact that while the cost estimates were conducted for the U.S., the meta-analysis used some studies from other countries.</p><p>Additional possible limitations stem from the inclusion of studies that relied on self-reported PCOS, which could introduce recall and reporting bias, potentially affecting the reported PRs of MH-related conditions. However, we should note that the point estimates changed little when excluding studies that used self-reported PCOS. In our calculations, we used inflation-adjusted estimates from previous studies to account for the changing value of currency over time. While this method provides a useful approximation, we acknowledge that it does not account for changes in treatment practices, healthcare policies, or the overall structure of healthcare costs that might have occurred since the original estimates were made. Finally, while other MH disorders have been shown to be associated with PCOS, such as bipolar disorder and OCD, we focused our study solely on the four most common disorders found in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Himelein and Thatcher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brutocao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our current study suggests that the additional direct healthcare costs due to PCOS-related anxiety, depression, and eating disorders exceeds $4 billion annually in 2021 USD in the U.S. So far, the total direct economic burden of PCOS exceeds $15 billion annually in 2021 USD, and MH disorders account for almost one-third of these costs. Notably, these estimates are solely for the U.S. and PCOS is a global disease. As PCOS is clinically most apparent during the reproductive age, we should note that the number of women between the ages of 15 and 49 worldwide is estimated to be about 1.9 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2022</xref>). Taking into account that most studies assessing the prevalence of PCOS report a minimum rate similar to what was used on the present study (i.e., 6.6% based on the NIH criteria) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bozdag et al., 2016</xref>), we can estimate that there are <italic>at least</italic> 125.4 million women affected with PCOS worldwide. Consequently, the worldwide economic burden for PCOS can be assumed to be enormous.</p><p>While we have examined the direct economic burden related to the medical or health-related costs of the disorder, we should note that a complete understanding of the economic burden of the disorder requires that we also assess the indirect (those attributable to loss of work productivity) and intangible (those related to the pain and sufferings of patients because of a disorder, usually measured by using the reduction in quality of life) costs of the disorder. Our data suggest that improved detection of PCOS and more significant clinical awareness and interventions for PCOS and its associated disorders is a cost-effective approach to ameliorating the economic, health, and quality of life impact of PCOS. Finally, our findings further highlight the need to increase investment in PCOS research, which is currently severely underfunded relative to the economic burden of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brakta et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is a Director of Public Affairs, Study Recruitment and Patient Registry Manager, and Intern Preceptor for PCOS Challenge: The National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association.

meta-analysis of mental health problems in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) that drive the excess economic burden associated with this common endocrine disorder. Interestingly, the cost of the diagnostic evaluation is only a relatively minor part of the total costs, but mental health disorders were identified as a significant component of the economic burden. These solid findings could not have been anticipated intuitively and are of considerable value for public health prioritization of PCOS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85338.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Eduardo L</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01pxwe438</institution-id><institution>McGill University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Pugeat</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Rebecca Elaine</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01jmxt844</institution-id><institution>University of Otago</institution></institution-wrap><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.01.05.23284220">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.05.23284220v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The results were significant for depression, anxiety, and eating disorders, implying potential publication bias arising from &quot;small study&quot; effects. Nonetheless, other factors, such as heterogeneity of study populations, covariates, or outcome definitions, could also account for the funnel plot asymmetry. The &quot;trim and fill&quot; method suggested that the results for anxiety and depression were robust to this type of publication bias. In contrast, results for eating disorders were somewhat less robust (Line 335; Supplemental Table 9). Please note that the power of this method to detect bias will be low with small numbers of studies. We have added this data to the Results and Discussion sections of our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
