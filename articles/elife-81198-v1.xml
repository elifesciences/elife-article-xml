vitro. Ocular hypertension (OHT) mouse models were induced with dexamethasone and further treated with metformin to determine the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect. Cultured human TM cells (HTMCs) were pre-stimulated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) to induce oxidative damage and then supplemented with metformin for another 24 hr. The expression of fibrotic markers and integrin/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signals, including α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), fibronectin, integrin beta 1, ROCK 1/2, AMP-activated protein kinase, myosin light chain 1, and F-actin were determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content was analysed using flow cytometry. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to observe microfilaments in HTMCs. It showed that metformin administration reduced the elevated IOP and alleviated the fibrotic activity of aqueous humour outflow in OHT models. Additionally, metformin rearranged the disordered cytoskeleton in the TM both in vivo and in vitro and significantly inhibited ROS production and activated integrin/ROCK signalling induced by tBHP in HTMCs. These results indicated that metformin reduced the elevated IOP in steroid-induced OHT mouse models and exerted its protective effects against oxidative injury by regulating cytoskeleton remodelling through the integrin/ROCK pathway. This study provides new insights into metformin use and preclinical evidence for the potential treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>open-angle glaucoma</kwd><kwd>trabecular meshwork</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton remodelling</kwd><kwd>metformin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82201177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Lijuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Health Commission of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023KY914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Lijuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key R&amp;D Program of Zhejiang</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022C03112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Yuanbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Leading Scientific and Technological Innovation Talents in Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R52012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Yuanbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020YFC2008200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Yuanbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Zhejiang Provincial National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LQ18H120010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Yuanbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Innovation and Guidance Program of the Eye Hospital, School of Ophthalmology &amp; Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>YNZD 2201903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Yuanbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wenzhou Municipal Technological Innovation Program of High-level Talents</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>604090352/577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Yuanbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metformin, which promotes the recovery of damaged trabecular meshwork, is a potential intraocular pressure-lowering drug.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation, predominantly resulting from increased resistance to aqueous humour outflow (AHO), is a major risk factor for primary open-angle glaucoma (OAG) deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). The only proven method is IOP lowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richter and Coleman, 2016</xref>). According to Bill and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bill and Hellsing, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bill and Svedbergh, 1972</xref>), up to 80% aqueous humour is drained via conventional trabecular meshwork (TM) pathway; however, available anti-glaucoma medications mostly act on sites other than TM and have limited efficiency. Therefore, polypharmacy has become increasingly prevalent, coupled with an increasing economic burden on society and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>IOP elevation is associated with TM stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarado et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heijl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnstone et al., 2021</xref>). Theoretically, drugs promoting the recovery of damaged TM are potentially effective in lowering IOP. Integrin and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) play pivotal roles in cytoskeletal formation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yemanyi et al., 2020</xref>), and ROCK inhibitors (ROCKi) can decrease actomyosin contraction and actin crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). ROCKi are the only drug that directly target conventional outflow function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ren et al., 2016</xref>). It alters the architecture of AHO and expands the juxtacanalicular connective tissue region. Currently, the clinically available ROCKi include Y-27632 and ripasudil.</p><p>Metformin (MET), an oral biguanide insulin-sensitising drug, is the most widely used treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foretz et al., 2014</xref>). It is a multifunctional drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rangarajan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maleškić et al., 2017</xref> found that MET reduced the risk of OAG in patients with DM, and this effect persisted even after controlling for glycated haemoglobin. However, this effect was not observed with other hypoglycaemic medications (insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and meglitinides), suggesting that the protective effect of MET on glaucoma goes beyond glycaemic improvement. However, the precise mechanisms involved remain unclear.</p><p>Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TM play an important role in the disruption of cytoskeletal integrity and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), leading to pathological alterations in AHO and subsequent IOP rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babizhayev and Bunin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saccà et al., 2016</xref>). Reduction of intracellular ROS levels by MET via activating AMPK signal has been reported in primary hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ota et al., 2009</xref>), vestibular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), and human immune cells (CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, and CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hartwig et al., 2021</xref>). Conversely, there is also evidence on cellular ROS level increase in some cancer cells after MET treatment, including AsPC-1 pancreatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Warkad et al., 2021</xref>), osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2020a</xref>), and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). These seemingly contradictory results suggested that MET plays different roles under different metabolic environments. To investigate the role of MET in damaged TM cells and ocular hypertension (OHT) mouse models, we used tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) to induce oxidative damage in TM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) and topical glucocorticoids to create OHT mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2021</xref>). The results showed that MET protected against cytoskeletal destruction in TM by activating the integrin/ROCK pathway and alleviated elevated IOP in steroid-induced OHT mouse models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Steroid-induced OHT in mice</title><p>The experiment included two steps: first, OHT modelling and the subsequent drug’s IOP-lowering effect test were performed, both of which lasted for 28 days.

The first was the IOP-lowering effect in steroid-induced OHT mouse eyes. The second was reversal of the skeletal destruction of TM cells, both in vivo and in vitro. Third, there was a significant decrease in the accumulation of fibrotic markers, namely α-SMA and FN, in TM tissues. These results suggest a protective effect of MET in TM, probably via promoting cytoskeleton recovery through the integrin/ROCK pathway.</p><p>Steroid-induced OHT in mice was generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) with the characteristics of TM stiffening and elevated IOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson et al., 1990</xref>), our model suggested that the stiffness of AHO closely matched that of OAG in humans, including the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the TM, disordered cytoskeleton, increased AHO resistance, and elevated IOP. Similar to the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zode et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ren et al., 2022</xref>, our topical DEX elevated the IOP by 2.00–7.30 mm Hg after 4 weeks of induction.</p><p>TM tissues play an important role in the regulation of AHO function and IOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). TM cells have the properties of extracellular debris phagocytosis and ECM degradation. If these functions are disturbed, the balance of TM in keeping AHO free of obstructive debris is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Last et al., 2011</xref>). It is noteworthy that MET appeared to restore biomechanical properties of TM in our steroid-induced OHT model after 5 days of treatment, and this restoration was accompanied by significant downregulation of ECM proteins in TM.</p><p>Moreover, as evidenced by immunofluorescence (IF) and WB analyses, L-MET rearranged the disordered cytoskeleton of HTMCs. This finding was supported by a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2020b</xref>, who showed that 50 μM MET protected oocytes against cytoskeletal destruction. Interestingly, the time course of structural changes in the TM was consistent with the observed pharmacodynamics of MET on IOP, significantly decreasing 4 weeks of OHT because of MET treatment, which was consistent with the known effects of other ROCK regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McMurtry et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that L-MET promotes the regeneration of abnormal HTMCs and enables the recovery of TM function; this should be confirmed in future studies.</p><p>As confirmed by WB analysis, complementation with L-MET treatment unregulated integrin, pAMPK, ROCK, and F-actin signals. These in vitro findings indicate that MET might elicit its protective effects through the regulation of the integrin/ROCK pathway in HTMCs. The in vivo observations in the OHT model again support the importance of the integrin/ROCK pathway in TM tissue protection. Generally, these signals mediate cellular biomechanical tension through actomyosin cytoskeletal tension, ECM synthesis, assembly, and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakajima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pattabiraman and Rao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rao et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Inconsistent with the previous studies indicating that the AMPK activator suppressed ROCK activity, our study revealed a novel mechanism of MET action within which activation of both AMPK and ROCK signals sequentially upregulated F-actin expression in TM. We hypothesised that ROCK regulators protect TM via different mechanisms, either by inhibiting ROCK signals when increased AHO resistance is attributed to TM stiffness or by activating the ROCK pathway to promote cytoskeletal formation when it is damaged. In the current study, we presumed that MET lowered IOP through short-term changes in TM cell morphology and adhesion by regulating integrin/ROCK signalling. In addition, the steroid-induced OHT recovered its normal IOP with MET treatment, preventing further TM cell loss, whereas MET promoted the maintenance of cytoskeletal morphology and repair after injury; therefore, IOP was maintained at a normal level for an extended period.</p><p>Generally, these data emphasise the protective properties of MET in the conventional outflow pathway, consistent with a large body of literature on other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rangarajan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to MET-mediated changes in ECM turnover, the observed changes in ECM composition and amount may also be due to the MET-mediated opening of flow pathways and the consequential removal of ECM. Additionally, the observed reduction in ROS content in HTMC treated with L-MET was in line with earlier studies displaying its protective effect in several types of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ghasemnejad-Berenji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Louden et al., 2014</xref>). In any case, therapy for steroid-induced OHT, which inhibits the cycle of damage and promotes cell remodelling by restoring function to a diseased tissue, offers a potential benefit for patients.</p><p>While experimental data were encouraging, there were limitations in our study. First, the concentration of MET in the anterior chamber was not measured. Additionally, we did not investigate its toxicity on ocular surfaces, such as tear film stability and components, which may change with the application of MET. Second, the sample size of the animals was relatively small, and a larger sample is needed to verify the protective effect of MET on TM. Third, the experimental period was too short to prove the long-term effects of MET and the presented figures were not in the same direction. Thus, additional studies are needed in the future.</p><p>In summary, promotion of TM cytoskeleton recovery by MET treatment may be an underlying mechanism for IOP reduction and AHO increase. A thorough investigation of the mechanisms by which cytoskeleton recovery is promoted will improve our understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of MET. If MET is confirmed to promote damaged cytoskeleton recovery and maintenance in the human body, it may have clear therapeutic effects on the main sites of glaucoma pathogenesis, which will broaden their application in the field of glaucoma. In conclusion, we revealed that integrin/ROCK activation reprograms metabolism in TM cells by enhancing the cytoskeleton and downregulating excessive ECM proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All the animals were treated in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement.

We have conducted a repeated experiment during the submission period and have extended both the OHT modelling process and drugs’ IOP-lowering effect tests from 21 to 28 days to strengthen the power of this study. Metformin oral group was deleted because of the unstable intake amount, which may reduce the reliability of the results. New data, including the control data, have been added to the manuscript. The main points are summarised as follows:</p><p>Materials and methods (p. 10, Line 8-22 in the manuscript)</p><p>“OHT animal model and drug treatments</p><p>The animal experiments were performed in two consecutive steps. In the first step, OHT C57BL/6J mouse model was induced by topical 0.1% DEX phosphate (dissolved in PBS twice daily, 8–9 AM and 5–6 PM) as described previously (<italic>Li, et al.</italic>,<italic>2021</italic>), and sterile PBS was used as a vehicle control. The second step was conducted 4 weeks after steroid induction. The successfully created OHT mouse models with elevated IOP were randomly divided into three groups: DEX withdrawal (group 2, DEX was stopped without any additional prescribed drug, n=10), DEX+PBS (group 3, n=8), and DEX+0.3% MET (group 4, n=18). Mice in groups 3 and 4 received an additional 4 weeks of supplemented drug (PBS or 0.3% MET) delivered bilaterally with the continued synchronous use of steroid, leading to an entire 8-week duration of DEX treatment. Meanwhile, PBS-only treatment was administered for 8 weeks in the control (group 1, n=8). Drugs were prescribed twice daily with at least 15-min interval when administering 2 types of eye drops to ensure effective penetration.”</p><p>Results (p. 5, Line 4-27 in the manuscript, Figure 2 and 3 in the figure legends)</p><p>“MET effectively reversed steroid-induced OHT in mice</p><p>In this step, successfully DEX-induced OHT mouse models were randomly assigned into three groups with the continued prescription of DEX: DEX withdrawal (group 2, n=10), DEX+PBS (group 3, n=8), and DEX+0.3% MET (group 4, n=18). Meanwhile, a group of mice were treated with solo PBS as control with a duration of 8 weeks (group 1, n=8).</p><p>The experimental procedure is illustrated in Figure 2A. The IOPs after 28 days of steroid induction in all three OHT groups were similar (17.27±1.08, 16.91±1.01, and 17.06±0.82 mmHg, respectively). Compared with group 3, DEX-withdrawal mice had significantly reduced IOP after 17–28 days (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). After 5 days of MET treatment, IOPs significantly reduced in group 4 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, Figure 2B). In fact, MET almost completely neutralised steroid-induced OHT, returning IOP to near DEX-withdrawal levels on day 21, suggesting a therapeutic role of MET in OAG. Specific IOP values are shown in Figure 2B.”</p><p><bold>“</bold>Figure 2. Effect of MET on OHT mouse models. A. Experimental process overview. B.

Quantitative comparison showed a significant difference in the number of α-SMA- and fibronectin (FN)-positive TM cells between MET-treated and control mice (Figure 3C, 3E). Additionally, MET treatment promoted the cytoskeleton recovery of steroid-induced TM cell damage, as confirmed by the pronounced upregulation of F-actin (Figure 3F). We concluded that the IOP-lowering effect of MET in this steroid OHT model can be largely explained by the attenuation of fibrotic alterations and rearrangement of the cell skeleton at sites of TM or trabecular outflow pathways.”</p><p>Figure 3.

Briefly, 10 μM DCFH-DA solution diluted in serum-free DMEM/F12 medium was added and incubated with the cells, then they were kept in the dark for 20 min. Excess DCFH-DA was removed by washing the cells three times with serum-free cell culture medium.

We have revised the Discussion and added the limitation as follows (see p.10, Line 11-18 in the manuscript).</p><p>“While experimental data were encouraging, there were limitations in our study. First, the concentration of MET in the anterior chamber was not measured. Additionally, we did not investigate its toxicity on ocular surfaces, such as tear film stability and components, which may change with the application of MET. Second, the sample size of the animals was relatively small, and a larger sample is needed to verify the protective effect of MET on TM. Third, the experimental period was too short to prove the long-term effects of MET and the presented figures were not in the same direction. Thus, additional studies are needed in the future.”</p><p>References:</p><p>Hartwig J, Loebel M, Steiner S, Bauer S, Karadeniz Z, Roeger C, Skurk C, Scheibenbogen C, Sotzny F. 2021.
