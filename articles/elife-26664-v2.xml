It was previously observed that functional CRISPR-Cas systems are absent from multidrug-resistant (MDR) <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, which only possess an orphan CRISPR locus, termed CRISPR2, lacking <italic>cas</italic> genes. Here, we investigate how the interplay between CRISPR-Cas genome defense and antibiotic selection for mobile genetic elements shapes in vitro <italic>E. faecalis</italic> populations. We demonstrate that CRISPR2 can be reactivated for genome defense in MDR strains. Interestingly, we observe that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> transiently maintains CRISPR targets despite active CRISPR-Cas systems. Subsequently, if selection for the CRISPR target is present, toxic CRISPR spacers are lost over time, while in the absence of selection, CRISPR targets are lost over time. We find that forced maintenance of CRISPR targets induces a fitness cost that can be exploited to alter heterogeneous <italic>E. faecalis</italic> populations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26664.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26664.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic></kwd><kwd>plasmid</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI116610</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Kelli L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005430</institution-id><institution>American Society for Microbiology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Undergraduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hullahalli</surname><given-names>Karthik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conflicts between CRISPR-Cas systems and antibiotic resistance plasmids can be exploited to selectively eliminate antibiotic resistance from <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> populations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> is a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that commensally inhabits the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lebreton et al., 2014</xref>). Enterococcal infections are considered serious public health threats, and rising antibiotic resistance makes these infections particularly difficult to treat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias and Murray, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kristich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sievert et al., 2013</xref>). Sequence analysis of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> reveals that they typically possess expanded genomes relative to more drug-sensitive isolates and have acquired large segments of mobile DNA in the form of prophage, genomic islands, transposons, and plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raven et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paulsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourgogne et al., 2008</xref>). These extraneous DNA elements often encode antibiotic resistance determinants and virulence factors that facilitate host infection and colonization, thus making the horizontal dissemination of DNA one of the prime causative factors for the emergence of MDR <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and their associated Cas proteins (CRISPR-Cas) are adaptive immune systems employed by bacteria to reduce the prevalence of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as bacteriophage and plasmids, in their populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rath et al., 2015</xref>). Some <italic>E. faecalis</italic> encode Type II CRISPR-Cas systems, defined by the presence of <italic>cas9,</italic> and which consist of two main components: a CRISPR array and <italic>cas</italic> genes. The mechanism of Type II CRISPR-Cas systems has been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marraffini, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sapranauskas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nishimasu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jinek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deltcheva et al., 2011</xref>). The CRISPR array consists of 36 bp repetitive DNA elements (repeats) interspersed by 30 bp sequences usually derived from foreign DNA (spacers). The cognate spacer sequence present in foreign DNA, termed the protospacer, is usually located proximally to a conserved DNA sequence referred to as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The final spacer in the CRISPR array (terminal spacer) is followed by a degenerated repeat (terminal repeat). During CRISPR interference, the Cas9 endonuclease is guided to DNA targets by CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), which are processed transcripts derived from the CRISPR array. An active Cas9-crRNA targeting complex is also associated with a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), which is partially complementary to the repeats of the CRISPR array. This targeting complex samples PAMs in DNA, and once it encounters a match to the affiliated crRNA spacer sequence, Cas9 creates a double-stranded break in the target DNA. Three Type II CRISPR occur with variable distributions in the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> species, including two that possess <italic>cas</italic> genes (CRISPR1 and CRISPR3, which are Type II-A systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fonfara et al., 2014</xref>]), and one orphan array (CRISPR2) that is ubiquitous but lacks associated <italic>cas</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourgogne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmer and Gilmore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hullahalli et al., 2015</xref>). The orphan locus possesses repeats identical to those in CRISPR1, but not CRISPR3. Further, the consensus PAM sequences for CRISPR1-Cas and CRISPR are identical (NGG), while the PAM for CRISPR3 is distinct (NNRTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Price et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>cas9</italic> associated with CRISPR3 is distinct in sequence and function from the CRISPR1 <italic>cas9</italic>. We have previously shown that CRISPR3-Cas9 cannot confer defense from conjugative plasmids using CRISPR2 spacers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Price et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>An inverse correlation between the occurrence of Type II CRISPR-Cas systems and antibiotic resistance has been reported for <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmer and Gilmore, 2010</xref>). All <italic>E. faecalis</italic> isolates possess a CRISPR2, but most MDR strains lack the functional CRISPR1-Cas or CRISPR3-Cas systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmer and Gilmore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hullahalli et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, using conjugation assays, we find that CRISPR2 is functional for sequence interference in otherwise <italic>cas-</italic>deficient MDR <italic>E. faecalis</italic> isolates upon the introduction of CRISPR1-<italic>cas9</italic>. We provide a mechanism for the ubiquitous presence of CRISPR2 in MDR enterococci despite the locus being natively inactive for genome defense in those strains. Intriguingly, we also find that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> can temporarily tolerate CRISPR-targeted plasmids, and that strains forced to maintain CRISPR targets exhibit a growth defect and can be outcompeted by other strains. We present a novel approach to alter the structure of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> populations by exploiting CRISPR-Cas, selection, and intraspecies competition. This approach could be applied in the future to reduce intestinal carriage of MDR <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in high-risk patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Nassir et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ubeda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rice, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design of a rapidly modifiable conjugation assay to study CRISPR function in <italic>E. faecalis</italic></title><p>V583 is a model MDR <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strain, and was the first fully sequenced vancomycin-resistant isolate in the U.S. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paulsen et al., 2003</xref>). It possesses an expanded genome relative to commensal isolates, and its sole CRISPR locus is the orphan CRISPR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourgogne et al., 2008</xref>). We have previously reported that CRISPR-Cas lowers the frequency of acquisition of large (50–70 kbp) conjugative pheromone responsive plasmids (PRPs) in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> T11, a strain closely related to V583 but lacking the HGT-driven genome expansion characteristic of V583 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Price et al., 2016</xref>). However, it remained to be determined whether the CRISPR2 locus of MDR strains possessing different spacer dispositions was also active. In order to test the functionality of CRISPR-Cas across a wide range of isolates, we developed a method to rapidly create protospacer-bearing conjugative plasmids. First, we inserted the <italic>oriT</italic> sequence from the pheromone-responsive plasmid pCF10 into the cloning vector pLZ12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perez-Casal et al., 1991</xref>), creating pKH12. pKH12 was linearized via PCR using primers with overhangs engineered to introduce different protospacers with the CRISPR1/CRISPR2 NGG PAM sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Price et al., 2016</xref>) to generate the pKHSX series, where X defines a spacer from our CRISPR dictionary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hullahalli et al., 2015</xref>). We then examined a series of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains to identify suitable plasmid donors. CK111SSp(pCF10-101) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kristich et al., 2007</xref>) was found to be an effective donor that was able to mobilize pKH-derivatives into a variety of strains. Since CK111SSp(pCF10-101) encodes a CRISPR1-Cas system, we also generated strain C173, with <italic>ermB</italic> disrupting the CK111SSp(pCF10-101) <italic>cas9</italic> locus. C173 was used as a donor to analyze the functions of spacers that are also present in the CK111SSp(pCF10-101) CRISPR1 or CRISPR2 arrays. The experimental scheme for conjugation assays is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>When possible, conjugation frequencies were determined as the ratio of transconjugants per donor, as is routine for the field. However, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> Merz96 and DS5 both showed bactericidal activity against CK111SSp(pCF10-101). Zones of inhibition were observed after spotting overnight cultures of Merz96 and DS5 onto CK111SSp(pCF10-101) lawns (data not shown). For these strains, conjugation frequencies were determined as the ratio of transconjugants per recipient.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CRISPR1-Cas and CRISPR2 are functionally linked across diverse <italic>E. faecalis</italic> lineages</title><p>CRISPR1-<italic>cas</italic> and CRISPR2 are the most prevalent CRISPR loci in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hullahalli et al., 2015</xref>). These CRISPR arrays contain identical repeats and differ only in their conserved locations in the chromosome and in the sequence of the terminal repeat (discussed later). We sought to confirm whether we could detect CRISPR1-Cas function using conjugation assays with pKHSX plasmids and if this assay could be used across genetically diverse <italic>E. faecalis</italic> isolates. We first assessed ATCC 4200RF, isolated from the bloodstream of a rheumatic fever patient in 1926, two years prior to the discovery of penicillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Birkhaug and Schilling, 1927</xref>). CRISPR function in ATCC 4200RF was assessed with pKHS244, which contains the protospacer target for S244 present in the CRISPR1 array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Conjugation frequencies of plasmids containing the protospacer were normalized to those of pKH12. We found that pKHS244 had a 56-fold lower acquisition rate than pKH12, and this phenotype was lost in ATCC 4200RFΔ<italic>cas9,</italic> confirming that the reduction in conjugation frequency was due to CRISPR interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Additionally, we confirmed CRISPR1 activity in strains OG1RF and DS5 using pKHS96 and pKHS119, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). OG1RF is an oral commensal isolate that has been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunny et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourgogne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold et al., 1975</xref>). DS5 is an erythromycin and tetracycline resistant isolate first described in 1974, and contains three extrachromosomal plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clewell et al., 1974</xref>) despite the fact that it possesses the entire CRISPR1-Cas system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmer and Gilmore, 2010</xref>). Our results demonstrate that a small conjugative vector can be used as an effective tool to evaluate the functions of individual spacers across a multitude of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26664.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRISPR defense in ATCC 4200RF.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ATCC 4200RF CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 arrays are shown.

To determine if CRISPR2 transcription is required for genome defense, ~50 bp of its promoter was deleted from V649, creating the strain V254. V254 shows conjugation frequencies for pKHS67 similar to that of pKH12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

CRISPR2 terminal repeats completely degenerate after 19 bp, and the majority of arrays (including in V583) contain two polymorphisms within those 19 bp. These two polymorphisms are not observed in the majority of CRISPR1 terminal repeats, which degenerate after 22 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We hypothesized that the degeneracy of the terminal repeats of both CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 causes a loss of function in the terminal spacer, since the association of the crRNA with the tracrRNA would be disrupted. V583 contains two spacers: S67, the target of our previous assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), and S12, which is associated with the terminal repeat. We first examined whether S12 was functional for genome defense. To avoid confusion, we named the engineered plasmid with the S12 protospacer target, pKHSL. As predicted, pKHSL conjugation frequency was equivalent to pKH12 in V649, revealing the lack of function of S12. This phenomenon was also apparent for terminal spacers in both the CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 arrays in ATCC 4200RF, as the deletion of <italic>cas9</italic> had no effect on the conjugation frequencies of plasmids bearing a terminal protospacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a–b</xref>). To confirm that this was due to the degenerated repeat, we replaced the terminal repeat in V649 with a direct repeat, creating the strain V485 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

This initially suggested that a large number of cells with CRISPR-inactivating mutations existed in the recipient population. If the CRISPR machinery was mutated before conjugation occurred, no change should occur in the maintenance of plasmids. To assess this, we conjugated pKHS67 into V583 and V649, and passaged two transconjugants each for 14 days. Cas9-dependent plasmid loss was observed in pKHS67 transconjugants in the absence of selection for the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

We monitored spacer deletion, as this is a rapidly screenable phenotype for variation in the CRISPR locus. Amplification of CRISPR2 from each passage revealed spacer loss events in 2 of 4 V649 pKHS67 transconjugants passaged with antibiotic selection for the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The other 2 V649 pKHS67 transconjugants maintained pKHS67 with selection over the course of 14 days with no detectable spacer deletion events. These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Importantly, we observe that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> cells can proliferate for days with their CRISPR-Cas system in conflict with a CRISPR target. Our results are in contrast with previous findings in other organisms, where the investigators describe the inability for CRISPR systems and their targets to co-exist in the same cell without mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lopez-Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gomaa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jiang et al., 2013b</xref>). In <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, forced maintenance of a CRISPR target results in a fitness cost to the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We propose that, during passaging with or without selection, cells that are best adapted to overcome the CRISPR-induced fitness cost proliferate over time. When selection for the plasmid is present, the most competitive mutants have compromised the integrity of the CRISPR-Cas machinery likely through multiple mechanisms, one of which is spacer deletion. In the absence of selection, the fitness cost is overcome by plasmid loss.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26664.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Effects of antibiotic selection on spacer content, and the role of terminal repeats.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental schematic for spacer deletion assay.

To quantify this conservation, we returned to our previous analysis of CRISPR2 arrays in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hullahalli et al., 2015</xref>). We generated a conservation index defined by the probability of a spacer in a particular position only existing in that position, taking into account 78 unique CRISPR2 arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Expectedly, the fractional conservation value of the terminal spacer is 0.999; that is, if a spacer is found in the terminal position, it is likely to only exist in the terminal position. Spacers upstream in the array show fractional conservation values of ~0.5, meaning that there is a 50% probability that a spacer found upstream in the array will be found in the same position in a different array. Therefore, terminal spacers are the least likely to be lost from the CRISPR array.</p><p>Since we observe that terminal spacers are naturally non-functional for genome defense due to the degenerate downstream repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), it was of interest to determine if any evolutionary advantage is provided by the terminal degenerate repeats. A previous study proposed that terminal repeats act as ‘anchor’ units to preserve CRISPR integrity by preventing homologous recombination with upstream CRISPR repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almendros et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it is widely understood that terminal spacers correspond to the ‘oldest’ memories of the CRISPR array, since adaptation occurs at the leader end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sternberg et al., 2016</xref>). In our spacer deletion assay, we observed only non-terminal spacer deletions when selection was applied to V649 pKHS67 transconjugants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We also passaged V485 pKHS67 transconjugants for 14 days, observing terminal and non-terminal spacer deletions in 2 of 3 cases. To increase the sample size, pKHS67 was conjugated into V649 and V485, and ten transconjugants each were passaged with selection for ten days. Three terminal spacer deletion events were observed in V485, while no terminal spacer deletion events were observed in V649 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This observation provides evidence that terminal degenerate repeats in CRISPR2 prevent terminal spacer deletion and facilitate the persistence of the ubiquitous CRISPR2 array in <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. Additionally, this phenomenon helps explain the high degree of conservation of terminal spacers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CRISPR-plasmid incompatibility alters population structure</title><p>We observed that transconjugants with plasmids in conflict with CRISPR spacers exhibited an extended lag phase when grown with selection (chloramphenicol), while control transconjugants exhibited no such defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We hypothesized that this growth defect, in the presence of selection, could be exploited for the selective removal of strains based on CRISPR incompatibility. To test this, conjugation reactions containing mixed donors, recipients, and transconjugants were used as inocula for overnight cultures supplemented with chloramphenicol. This allows for a measurement of the competitive fitness of each strain when forced to maintain a plasmid. CFU counts of donors and transconjugants were conducted from the mating reaction itself and from each day of chloramphenicol passaging. Changes between the relative abundance of each strain before and after chloramphenicol passaging would reveal any inhibitory effects of forced maintenance of CRISPR targets in competitive environments relative to controls.</p><p>First, we examined the effects of using the donor strain CK111SSp(pCF10-101) as the competitor against V583 and V649 using a 1/1000 dilution of the conjugation reaction in BHI supplemented with chloramphenicol. We used pKH12 and pKHS67 to confer either no defense or CRISPR interference against the plasmid, respectively, in V649. When pKH12 and pKHS67 are conjugated into V583, V583 remains abundant in the population chloramphenicol passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–b</xref>) and is ultimately able to outcompete CK111SSp(pCF10-101). Similarly, when pKH12 is conjugated to V649, CK111SSp(pCF10-101) is also ultimately outcompeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). However, when pKHS67 is conjugated to V649, the V649 CFU is dramatically reduced in the population when passaged in chloramphenicol, while CK111SSp(pCF10-101) remains abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Importantly, our data suggest that V583 and V649 naturally outcompete CK111SSp(pCF10-101) in BHI when no CRISPR conflict is present. However, when CRISPR conflict is applied, the opposite effect is seen. We also note that a 1/10,000 dilution of the mating reaction yields similar experimental results but requires fewer days of passaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), and this higher dilution was utilized for subsequent experiments.

During initial growth of the conjugation reaction, cells that are subject to genomic ‘self-targeting’ are less competitive, which allows surrounding cells (donors and plasmid-free recipients) to outcompete transconjugants during the course of the mating reaction. This results in significantly fewer transconjugants observed relative to controls. Nonetheless, our data show that targeting a native PRP in V649 was as detrimental to V649 as targeting a chromosomal region. This is presumably because pTEF1 loss activates toxin-mediated killing via its predicted toxin-antitoxin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weaver, 2012</xref>). Importantly, V649 transconjugants containing pCR2-<italic>ermB</italic> retained phenotypic resistance to erythromycin despite CRISPR targeting of <italic>ermB</italic> (data not shown).

We found that there was no reduction in conjugation frequency into these strains when transconjugants were selected with chloramphenicol (for pCR2 transconjugants) and rifampicin plus fusidic acid (for recipient cells).

V649 pCR2 and pCR2-Phage1 transconjugants were harvested directly from transconjugant selection plates and used for RNA isolation.

As a control, we induced the SOS response in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> cultures with the fluoroquinolone levofloxacin (LVX).

However, a large transconjugant pool still arises despite active CRISPR defense. Over time, these transconjugants lose plasmids when selection is absent and can lose spacers if selection is applied. Using this spacer loss assay, we show that CRISPR2 terminal repeats prevent terminal spacer loss, suggesting that CRISPR systems have an intrinsic mechanism for self-preservation. Even though plasmids can evade CRISPR interference at a high frequency, this limitation is overcome by intraspecies competition. <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains exhibit growth defects when forced to maintain conflicts between CRISPR-Cas and its targets. Exploiting this phenomenon, we show that CRISPR-Cas can be used to deplete specific strains or antibiotic resistance genes from a population in vitro. The ability for CRISPR-assisted <italic>E. faecalis</italic> population control remains to be assessed in vivo. Future studies will seek to optimize the current system in vivo.</p><p>Terminal degenerate repeats and highly conserved terminal spacers are a common characteristic of many CRISPR systems. It has been previously proposed that the terminal degenerate repeats ‘anchor’ the CRISPR array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almendros et al., 2014</xref>). We provide evidence that CRISPR2 terminal repeats can prevent terminal spacer deletion, but the evolutionary advantage remains unclear, especially since it has been shown that a single direct repeat alone is sufficient to promote spacer adaptation in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yosef et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with our findings, the smallest CRISPR2 array observed in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> consists of a direct repeat followed by a single spacer and a terminal repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hullahalli et al., 2015</xref>). Degeneracy in the terminal repeat may have been selected over time, preventing complete loss of the CRISPR array, and as a consequence, the terminal spacer lost CRISPR interference functionality. Moreover, that terminal spacers are functionally inactive for genome defense means that they are not subject to conflicts with protospacer-bearing elements, which may also explain their conservation.</p><p>A particularly striking feature of CRISPR systems in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> is the ability of the targeted DNA to temporarily coexist with the CRISPR-Cas system. It has been previously shown that CRISPR-Cas systems and their targets cannot coexist in the same cell. This phenomenon has been observed in <italic>E. coli, Sulfolobus,</italic> and various streptococci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gudbergsdottir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bikard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Selle and Barrangou, 2015</xref>). In a thorough investigation of CRISPR-Cas in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, Jiang, et al detected transconjugants at very low frequencies, and found that they all contained mutations that inactivated the CRISPR system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jiang et al., 2013b</xref>). Similarly, a dramatic inhibition of growth was observed when CRISPR self-targeting was induced in <italic>Pectobacterium atrosepticum,</italic> which led to growth inhibition and cellular elongation and filamentation, which are indicators of the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vercoe et al., 2013</xref>). CRISPR-induced toxicity was also found to induce the SOS response in <italic>E. coli</italic> at low <italic>cas9</italic> expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cui and Bikard, 2016</xref>). This is in direct contrast to our findings, where CRISPR conflict does not result in <italic>recA</italic> up-regulation. However, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> displays characteristics of CRISPR interference similar to that of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, where a targeted plasmid is acquired, but gradually lost from the population over time due to CRISPR interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Høyland-Kroghsbo et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to our observations in <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, strikingly large numbers of ‘escape mutants’ were observed for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. This delayed activity was attributed to the ability for plasmid replication to titrate out Cas9 targeting complexes. Our study is distinct in that we include chromosome-targeting constructs, which would not be limited by plasmid replication, and find that similarly large transconjugant pools appear. This suggests that plasmid copy number titrating Cas9 targeting complexes does not completely explain the transient tolerance of CRISPR targets.</p><p>Previous analysis of native <italic>E. faecalis</italic> CRISPR3-Cas also described a large number of purported ‘escape mutants’ that arose despite CRISPR defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Price et al., 2016</xref>); the mechanism of escape was not investigated in that study. Our data suggest that these transconjugants may better be classified as ‘unstable’. Based on the conditions subsequently applied, the cells stabilize themselves by adapting to the new environment, resulting in either CRISPR loss or plasmid loss. The basis for these transconjugants may be efficient DNA repair or stress response mechanisms that allow cells to survive chromosome cleavage by Cas9, or the induction of genes that transiently repress the CRISPR system, but this is speculative. It is also possible that this phenotype is due to low native expression of <italic>cas9</italic>. If this were the case, it would suggest that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> has evolved to temporarily tolerate CRISPR targets, perhaps as a mechanism to enhance population-level genetic diversity. This could prove beneficial, particularly in environments where acquisition of a mobile genetic element is advantageous for survival. Further studies, such as RNA sequencing, are required to elucidate the mechanism of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> tolerance to CRISPR-Cas toxicity. It will also be of interest to use deep sequencing to fully elucidate the evolutionary outcomes of CRISPR-protospacer conflicts in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> populations and provide greater resolution beyond the spacer deletion assays used here.</p><p>An application for CRISPR-mediated toxicity is in the selective depletion of hospital-adapted strains from heterogeneous populations. CRISPR targeting to distinguish very closely related strains was first demonstrated in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gomaa et al., 2014</xref>). Delivery of CRISPR-Cas systems is a major challenge to establishing CRISPR therapeutics, and has been studied using bacteriophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Citorik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bikard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yosef et al., 2015</xref>). However, a major limitation to phage delivery of CRISPR systems is narrow host range and incomplete delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beisel et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> has been shown to readily acquire resistance to phage via receptor mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duerkop et al., 2016</xref>). Conjugative delivery has been previously examined in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Citorik et al., 2014</xref>), but the investigators found very few viable transconjugants when introducing plasmids targeting the host chromosome via CRISPR. This is in contrast to what we observe in <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, where a large pool of transconjugants readily emerges despite CRISPR-Cas activity. We can exploit this by manipulating intra-species competition and CRISPR-Cas interference to deplete certain <italic>E. faecalis</italic> genes and strains from mixed populations. In this study, we used antibiotic selection to provide a competitive advantage to strains that readily accepted and maintained the plasmid. We showed that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> populations can be altered in vitro using this strategy. CRISPR-Cas may be a viable tool to alter in vivo E. faecalis populations as well. To deploy this system in vivo, however, it will be more feasible to utilize naturally occurring conjugative vectors such as the PRPs. PRPs have previously been shown to provide selective advantages in vivo through bacteriocin production, mimicking the antibiotic selection used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kommineni et al., 2015</xref>). Future studies will test the abilities of CRISPR constructs deployed on PRPs conferring beneficial competitive traits such as bacteriocins to manipulate <italic>E. faecalis</italic> populations in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>The use of CRISPR-Cas a tool to modify population structure is extremely attractive, due to its highly specific activity against particular strains, leaving the remainder of the microbiome intact. As demonstrated by our in vitro work, CRISPR-Cas employed on conjugative vectors that target antibiotic resistance genes can actively suppress proliferation of other conjugative vectors that harbor the targeted genes. Furthermore, drug-sensitive <italic>E. faecalis</italic> are already used as commercial probiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neuhaus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Domann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fritzenwanker et al., 2016</xref>).

To generate the insertion of <italic>ermB</italic> into the <italic>cas9</italic> locus of CK111SSp(pCF10-101), plasmid pGE17 was electroporated in large quantities (&gt;2.5 µg) into CK111SSp(pCF10-101) and plated on BHI supplemented with chloramphenicol. Since pGE17 cannot extra-chromosomally replicate in <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, transformants were integrants that were resistant to both chloramphenicol and erythromycin, and usually appeared within 3–5 days. These integrants were inoculated in media containing both antibiotics (to make stocks and confirm integration), and subsequently passaged in BHI supplemented with only erythromycin. The resulting culture was diluted and plated on MM9YEG containing <italic>p-</italic>Cl-phenylalanine to select recombinants that lost the plasmid backbone. Erythromycin-resistant colonies that were chloramphenicol-sensitive were sequence confirmed as having the <italic>ermB</italic> cassette interrupting <italic>cas9</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Conjugation and conjugation-competition assays</title><p>1 mL of overnight (~18 hr) cultures of donors and recipients were each washed in 1X PBS to remove excess antibiotic and media, and subsequently added to 5 mL of BHI containing no antibiotics. Cultures were incubated for 1.5 hr, after which 100 µL of the donor strain was mixed with 900 µL of the recipient strain, spread on BHI agar, and incubated overnight. Lawns were then scraped in PBS and dilutions were inoculated on plates containing appropriate antibiotics. Selection plates were subsequently incubated at 37°C or 30°C (for plasmids containing r<italic>epA</italic><sup>ts</sup>). For experiments assessing CRISPR function, independent tests were performed to verify that cross-resistance to the selection for donors or recipients did not occur.</p><p>To evaluate the effects of CRISPR systems in competitive environments, the conjugation reaction obtained after plate scraping was diluted 1000-fold or 10,000-fold in BHI with chloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C overnight. CFU for each strain containing the plasmid were measured by plating on BHI containing chloramphenicol and appropriate antibiotics to differentiate unique strains. For reactions with two recipients, a ‘Donor: Recipient 1: Recipient 2’ ratio of 1:4.5:4.5 was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Evolution assay</title><p>For each transconjugant colony assessed, half of the colony was inoculated into BHI, and half into BHI supplemented with chloramphenicol. Cultures were passaged daily for up to 2 weeks using 1:1000 dilutions from overnight cultures. Each day, the size of the CRISPR2 locus was monitored via PCR using primers CR2 Seq For and CR2 Rev (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Additionally, dilutions were plated on BHI and BHI supplemented with chloramphenicol to measure the retention of plasmids within the population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hullahalli et al., 2015</xref>), we examined CRISPR2 arrays across 228 previously sequenced <italic>E. faecalis</italic> isolates. Filtering out redundant CRISPR2 arrays and unique spacers that occurred only once in the dataset, we calculated the frequency at which a particular spacer appears in a given position in the array, as a fraction of the total number of occurrences within the dataset. Each frequency value was given proportional weight to the number of times a spacer appeared within a specific position. The fractional conservation value for a particular position in the array was defined as the average of the weighted frequencies for all spacers that occur at a particular position. Statistical significance for conjugation assays was assessed using one-tailed student’s T test assuming log-normal distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Primer extension</title><p>20 µg of DNA-free log-phase V583 RNA was used as a template for 6-FAM labeled primer extension as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lloyd et al., 2005</xref>). Reverse transcription was carried out using SuperScript II (Fisher) and cDNA was precipitated with ethanol and sent to the Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center DNA core facility for determination of the size of the transcript. The start site of transcription was determined using Peak Scanner (Thermo Fisher). The results of two independent experiments verified the CRISPR2 start site.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Growth curves</title><p>Individual transconjugant colonies were suspended in PBS and used to inoculate 96-well plates with or without chloramphenicol selection.

After two days incubation, colonies were pooled without passaging (to prevent accumulation of CRISPR-related mutations). Total RNA was harvested using RNA-Bee and chloroform precipitation essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhardwaj et al., 2016</xref>). RNA was treated with DNase I (Roche) and concentrated using the GeneJet RNA Cleanup and Concentration Kit (Fisher). cDNA was subsequently synthesized using qScript cDNA Supermix (Quanta Biosiences). As a control, RNA was similarly harvested from log phase V649 cultures (OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 0.3) and two hours after addition of 1 μg/ml levofloxacin. qPCR was performed using the AzuraQuant Green Fast qPCR Mix (Azura Genomics) with primers qrecA for/rev and qclpX for/rev using the MyGo Pro qPCR machine (Phenix). The <italic>clpX</italic> transcript was used to normalize samples. Fold changes are expressed as 2<sup>ΔΔCq</sup>, where ΔΔCq = (Cq<sub>pCR2-Phage1</sub><italic>clpX –</italic> Cq<sub>pCR2-Phage1</sub><italic>recA</italic>) – (Cq<sub>pCR2</sub> <italic>clpX –</italic> Cq<sub>pCR2</sub> <italic>recA</italic>) or (Cq<sub>LVX</sub> <italic>clpX –</italic> Cq<sub>LVX</sub> <italic>recA</italic>) – (Cq<sub>control</sub> <italic>clpX –</italic> Cq<sub>control</sub> <italic>recA</italic>).

After two days incubation, colonies were scraped and washed twice with 0.85% NaCl. Live/dead staining was performed using BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (Fisher) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader (Biotek Synergy). Samples from three biological experiments were assayed in technical triplicates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by R01 AI116610 to KLP and the American Society for Microbiology Undergraduate Research Fellowship to KH.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Exploiting CRISPR-Cas to manipulate <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> populations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael S Gilmore (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study by Hullahalli et al. explores the role of the type II CRISPR-Cas systems in the evolution of multidrug resistant strains of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. Although this CRISPR-Cas system harbors the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease, which has revolutionized the genetic engineering of human cells, very little is known about how it works in native environments. A number of works addressed the function of Cas9 in bacteria, but with few exceptions, the experiments are performed in heterologous hosts, such as <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The authors used native pheromone-responsive conjugation to introduce plasmids containing various CRISPR targets into a variety of natural and genetically altered <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains, and in doing so studied how conflicts arise between CRISPR spacers and their targets – and how those conflicts are resolved. In this regard, this paper begins to fill a gap in our knowledge of these important CRISPR-Cas systems, which may lead to advances in their use as biotechnological tools. The possibility of reactivating the CRISPR2 locus to selectively target drug resistant <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains is an attractive potential application of such technology.</p><p>The authors create the tools necessary to investigate CRISPR-Cas9 function in enterococci, which they subsequently use to show that (i) the last spacer sequence of the CRISPR array, always linked to a degenerate repeat, is not functional; (ii) that the lack of complete homology of these degenerate repeats (always the last repeat sequence of the CRISPR array) reduces homologous recombination, and thus loss of spacers within the CRISPR array; (iii) that target degradation is not immediate but gradual; and (iv), that this may be exploited to eliminate strains carrying antibiotic resistant conjugative plasmids from enterococcal populations.</p><p>The strength of the study is that it is quite thorough and systematic, and represents a significant advance in understanding of CRISPR biology in <italic>E. faecalis.</italic> The limitation, arguably more minor, is that it is unclear to what extent these findings may be applicable to CRISPR systems in other microbes, and is generalizable.</p><p>The following major comments should be considered:</p><p>1) The authors find that a significant portion of transconjugants appear to be escape mutants that maintain the spacer-containing plasmid targeted by the reactivated CRISPR locus. Some of these mutants have in fact lost the spacer from the CRIPPR locus. It would be of interest to know the nature of the remaining mutants (i.e., are there point mutations in the spacer target, are there second site mutations that affect CRISPR function or cas gene expression, etc.).</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript it is hard to keep track of the different strains, genetic backgrounds and constructs. Consider adding diagrams to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and 10 that show the genotypes of the recipient strains, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>3) Authors note that internal degeneracy is not observed in CRISPR1 terminal repeats. They went on to prove that degeneracy in the terminal repeat of CRISPR2 causes loss of function in the terminal spacer (as inferred from the observation that conjugation frequency is equivalent, revealing lack of function of terminal spacer). But they also observed this phenomenon for the terminal spacer in the CRISPR1 locus. This seems contradictory and should be clarified, along with relating this observation to some level of selective advantage for its lack of utility.</p><p>4) Regarding the point that target degradation is not immediate but gradual, the authors present their findings as unique to enterococci (subsection “Effect of CRISPR-plasmid incompatibility on maintenance of plasmids and spacers”, last paragraph; subsection “CRISPR-mediated removal of antibiotic resistance”, first paragraph; Discussion, third and fourth paragraphs). However, it cannot be ruled out that the phenotype is due to low expression of Cas9, which would lead to inefficient cleavage. This is well documented in many genome editing studies. Since the cas9 gene was artificially introduced to activate CRISPR2 and it is not native to this strain, the results cannot be interpreted as a unique property of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.</p><p>5) Regarding the proposal that &quot;CRISPR incompatibility can be used to remove certain MDR <italic>E. faecalis</italic> from a population in vitro,&quot; there are several obvious limitations. One is about the importance of such technology if it can only be performed in vitro. Is that an overinterpretation? Additional clarification of how it might be applied would be helpful. As it is, it is difficult to imagine transforming strains with plasmids harboring a &quot;conflictive&quot; spacer, then applying antibiotic selection for the plasmid containing the targeting spacer, which will also lead to the selection of antibiotic resistant organisms, contradicting the original intent. This problem also appears at the end of the Discussion: wouldn't spreading a conjugative plasmid also promote spreading of antibiotic resistance? These internal conflicts should be resolved, since the impact of the advance is argued to derive both from the new knowledge as well as its potential for application.</p><p>6) Why do the authors believe <italic>E. faecalis</italic> can harbor targeting CRISPR/Cas systems and targets without dying? This is reminiscent of previous work in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with imperfect crRNA-target sequences (see work from G. O'Toole lab). Are the crRNAs 100% complementary to the target, and secondly is the DNA damage response being triggered? The fitness cost could be a result of either slowing growth rates or increased cell death rates. Live dead staining and/or use of a DNA damage reporter would help resolve this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26664.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The following major comments should be considered:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors find that a significant portion of transconjugants appear to be escape mutants that maintain the spacer-containing plasmid targeted by the reactivated CRISPR locus.

It would be of interest to know the nature of the remaining mutants (i.e., are there point mutations in the spacer target, are there second site mutations that affect CRISPR function or cas gene expression, etc.).</italic></p><p>This is an excellent comment by the reviewers. We would like to point out that our spacer deletion assays show that multiple different CRISPR alleles (including wild-type, one spacer deletion, and two spacer deletion) co-exist in some of our serial passage experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We conclude that there are multiple different evolutionary outcomes of CRISPR conflicts with protospacers, which rationalizes a deep sequencing analysis of the overall populations.</p><p>We have undertaken this deep sequencing study, but in the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> T11 system, which has 21 spacers in its native CRISPR3-Cas locus. We conducted in-depth CRISPR amplicon and whole-genome sequencing analysis on T11 transconjugant populations that were forced to maintain CRISPR targets under antibiotic selection. We observe diversity in these populations at the CRISPR locus and in <italic>cas9</italic>. Specifically, multiple different mutant CRISPR alleles and <italic>cas9</italic> alleles co-occur in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> populations that are forced to maintain plasmids with protospacers in conflict with CRISPR-Cas. This work comprehensively addresses the question as to the multiple mechanisms by which escape can occur, using experimental evolution and population genomic approaches. This work will be submitted for publication this summer. We hope that the promise of this upcoming study, which addresses the reviewer comment in depth albeit in a different strain, will be sufficient.</p><p>We have added a sentence to the Discussion stating that a population-level genome sequencing study should be performed. We have also made several changes throughout the document to more accurately state the design and results of our spacer deletion assays.</p><p><italic>2) Throughout the manuscript it is hard to keep track of the different strains, genetic backgrounds and constructs.

But they also observed this phenomenon for the terminal spacer in the CRISPR1 locus. This seems contradictory and should be clarified, along with relating this observation to some level of selective advantage for its lack of utility.</italic></p><p>CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 terminal repeats are both degenerate, but the degeneracy occurs at different nucleotide positions. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. We apologize for the confusion on this point. We have edited the Discussion to remove the sentences that confused this point.</p><p><italic>4) Regarding the point that target degradation is not immediate but gradual, the authors present their findings as unique to enterococci (subsection “Effect of CRISPR-plasmid incompatibility on maintenance of plasmids and spacers”, last paragraph; subsection “CRISPR-mediated removal of antibiotic resistance”, first paragraph; Discussion, third and fourth paragraphs). However, it cannot be ruled out that the phenotype is due to low expression of Cas9, which would lead to inefficient cleavage. This is well documented in many genome editing studies. Since the cas9 gene was artificially introduced to activate CRISPR2 and it is not native to this strain, the results cannot be interpreted as a unique property of E. faecalis.</italic></p><p>It is true that we have artificially introduced <italic>cas9</italic> into V583 to generate strain V649. However, we would like to make two clarifying points.</p><p>The first is that numerous transconjugants arise during assessments of CRISPR1-Cas anti-conjugation defense in ATCC 4200RF and OG1RF, both of which natively possess the CRISPR1-Cas system. This suggests that the relative expression of <italic>cas9</italic> is similar in these strains and V649, since both display large CRISPR “escape” populations. Furthermore, a previous study (PMC4894674) from our group also made similar observations for the native CRISPR3-Cas system in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> T11. The fact that this phenomenon is observed for two different native Type II CRISPR-Cas systems in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> indicates that artificially low <italic>cas9</italic> expression in V649 does not explain the results we have obtained with this strain.</p><p>The second is that we took care to preserve the native expression of <italic>cas9</italic>, to the best of our abilities, when we generated strain V649. We have been unsuccessful in identifying the transcriptional start site of CRISPR1-<italic>cas9</italic> in strain ATCC 4200 using primer extension. However, in unpublished studies, we have generated multiple promoter reporter constructs using the anticipated promoter region of CRISPR1-<italic>cas9</italic>. For insertion of <italic>cas9</italic> into the V583 chromosome, we included the entire intergenic region upstream of <italic>cas9</italic>, including the predicted transcriptional terminator that occurs distally upstream of native <italic>cas9</italic> and is associated with the homolog of OG1RF_10403 (this is the gene upstream of <italic>cas9</italic>). This region contains an active promoter, per our unpublished reporter data. In short, we believe we have preserved the native promoter of <italic>cas9</italic> during the construction of V649.</p><p>However, the reviewer is absolutely correct that native <italic>cas9</italic> expression may be insufficient to confer robust genome defense in <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. If this were true, it would further expand our knowledge of the biological role of native CRISPR systems in <italic>E. faecalis.</italic> It would suggest that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> has evolved a low expression of <italic>cas9</italic> to tolerate CRISPR targets and thereby more readily accept foreign DNA. Numerous papers that we have referenced in the text have demonstrated the inability of CRISPR targets and CRISPR systems to coexist in the same cell. In this regard, even if <italic>cas9</italic> expression is low, our findings still provide insight into a unique facet of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> CRISPR biology. This explanation has been included in the discussion. We have also mentioned that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> displays a phenotype similar to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> when encountering CRISPR targets, and therefore this property may not be entirely unique to enterococci.</p><p><italic>5) Regarding the proposal that &quot;CRISPR incompatibility can be used to remove certain MDR E. faecalis from a population in vitro,&quot; there are several obvious limitations. One is about the importance of such technology if it can only be performed in vitro. Is that an overinterpretation? Additional clarification of how it might be applied would be helpful. As it is, it is difficult to imagine transforming strains with plasmids harboring a &quot;conflictive&quot; spacer, then applying antibiotic selection for the plasmid containing the targeting spacer, which will also lead to the selection of antibiotic resistant organisms, contradicting the original intent. This problem also appears at the end of the Discussion: wouldn't spreading a conjugative plasmid also promote spreading of antibiotic resistance? These internal conflicts should be resolved, since the impact of the advance is argued to derive both from the new knowledge as well as its potential for application.</italic></p><p>Pheromone-responsive plasmids (PRPs) have been well documented to be able propagate in vivoamong <italic>E. faecalis</italic> populations in nature and disseminate beneficial traits other than antibiotic resistance. Indeed, we are currently developing a system that deploys the entire CRISPR machinery on PRPs for in vivostudies, so that the system can be delivered to strains that may endogenously lack <italic>cas9</italic>. Furthermore, we plan on utilizing a PRP that encodes a bacteriocin to provide a competitive advantage, mimicking the antibiotic selection that we used in this study. This point is clarified in the Discussion. Also, we hypothesize that the spread of a naturally-occurring conjugative vector targeting antibiotic resistance genes would help prevent the spread of other conjugative vectors that harbor those antibiotic resistance genes.</p><p>Other issues to be tackled with in vivo deployment of these constructs are spatial heterogeneity and dilution rate in the intestine. We will address these points in future studies.</p><p><italic>6) Why do the authors believe E. faecalis can harbor targeting CRISPR/Cas systems and targets without dying? This is reminiscent of previous work in P. aeruginosa with imperfect crRNA-target sequences (see work from G. O'Toole lab). Are the crRNAs 100% complementary to the target, and secondly is the DNA damage response being triggered? The fitness cost could be a result of either slowing growth rates or increased cell death rates. Live dead staining and/or use of a DNA damage reporter would help resolve this.</italic></p><p>Yes, the crRNAs generated here are 100% complementary to the target. This is now stated in the Materials and methods.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful comment about DNA damage response. Interestingly, we do not observe induction of <italic>recA,</italic> a hallmark of the SOS response, in transconjugants with a conflictive CRISPR construct. As a control, we induced the DNA damage response with levofloxacin, and saw increase in <italic>recA</italic> transcript levels, as expected. We have also performed live/dead staining on these transconjugants as requested and saw a small but significant increase in cell death in transconjugants harboring chromosomal CRISPR targeting.
