self-sustaining extracellular matrix (D-ECM), is a puzzling feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDACs). Conflicting studies have identified tumor-restricting and tumor-promoting roles of PDAC-associated desmoplasia, suggesting that individual CAF/D-ECM protein constituents have distinguishable tumorigenic and tumor-repressive functions. Using 3D culture of normal pancreatic versus PDAC-associated human fibroblasts, we identified a CAF/D-ECM phenotype that correlates with improved patient outcomes, and that includes CAFs enriched in plasma membrane-localized, active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin. Mechanistically, we established that TGFβ is required for D-ECM production but dispensable for D-ECM-induced naïve fibroblast-to-CAF activation, which depends on α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin redistribution of pFAK-independent active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin to assorted endosomes. Importantly, the development of a simultaneous multi-channel immunofluorescence approach and new algorithms for computational batch-analysis and their application to a human PDAC panel, indicated that stromal localization and levels of active SMAD2/3 and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin distinguish patient-protective from patient-detrimental desmoplasia and foretell tumor recurrences, suggesting a useful new prognostic tool.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20600.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20600.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20600.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tumors are not entirely made out of cancerous cells. They contain many other components – referred to as tumor stroma – that may either encourage or hinder the tumor’s growth. Tumor stroma includes non-cancerous cells and a framework of fibrous sugary proteins, called the extracellular matrix, which surround and signal to cells while providing physical support.</p><p>In the most common and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer, the stroma often makes up the majority of the tumor’s mass. Sometimes the stroma of these pancreatic tumors can protect the cancer cells from anti-cancer drugs. Researchers have therefore been interested in finding out exactly which aspects of the tumor stroma shield and support cancer cells, and which impede their growth and progression. Answering these questions could make it possible to develop new drugs that will change a tumor-supporting stroma into one that hinders the tumor’s growth and spread.</p><p>The most abundant cells in the stroma of pancreatic tumors are called cancer-associated fibroblasts. Healthy specialized fibroblasts – known as pancreatic stellate cells – help to build and maintain the ‘normal’ extracellular matrix and so these cells normally restrict a tumor’s development. However, cancer cells can adapt healthy fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts, which produce an altered extracellular matrix that could allow the tumor to grow.</p><p>Franco-Barraza et al. have now compared healthy and cancer-associated fibroblasts from patients’ pancreatic tumors. One of the main differences between these two cell types was the location of the activated form of a molecule called α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin. Healthy fibroblasts, in a normal extracellular matrix, have active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin on the surface of the cell. However, a number of tumor-promoting signals, including some from the altered extracellular matrix, could force the active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrins to relocate inside the fibroblasts instead. In further experiments, where the activated integrin was retained at the cell surface, the fibroblasts were able to resist the influence of the cancer-associated extracellular matrix. Then again, if the active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrins were directed inside the cells, healthy cells turned into cancer-associated fibroblasts.</p><p>With this information in hand, Franco-Barraza et al. examined tumor samples from over a hundred pancreatic cancer patients using a new microscopy-based technique that distinguishes cancer cells from stroma cells. The analysis confirmed the pattern observed in the laboratory: those patients who appeared to produce more normal extracellular matrix and have active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin localized mostly to the surface of the cells survived longer without the cancer returning than those patients who lacked these stroma traits. Samples from patients with kidney cancer also showed similar results and, as before, an altered extracellular matrix was linked to a worse outcome of the disease.</p><p>Together these findings suggest that if future studies uncover ways to relocate or maintain active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin to the cell surface of fibroblasts they could lead to new treatments to restrict the growth of tumors in cancer patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20600.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20600.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

By contrast, the emergence of a desmoplastic (activated) stroma, encompassing fibrotic-like modifications of local and recruited fibroblasts based on tumor interactions with the local microenvironment, has been proposed to play a major role in the development and progression of solid tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bijlsma and van Laarhoven, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jonasch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erkan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>). Many studies suggest that a fibrotic reaction, such as that seen in pancreatitis, drives a pro-tumorigenic wound-healing response that often precedes tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Whitcomb and Pogue-Geile, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binkley et al., 2004</xref>). Tumor fibrosis, also known as desmoplasia, has been reported to promote tumorigenesis, providing chemoresistance and shielding tumors from therapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Olive et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ireland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Laklai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koay et al., 2014</xref>). A mechanism of ‘stromal reciprocation’, involving mutual signaling between tumor and neighboring cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that promotes tumor growth, has been demonstrated for PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tape et al., 2016</xref>). On the basis of these findings, several studies have attempted complete ablation of desmoplastic stroma as a therapeutic approach to limit tumor growth, but paradoxically, this resulted in the evolution of existing tumors to a more aggressive state, and accelerated rates of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Özdemir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rhim et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, the idea of chronically ‘normalizing’ activated stroma by reprogramming desmoplasia from a tumor-promoting to a tumor-restrictive state has been suggested to bear greater therapeutic promise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bijlsma and van Laarhoven, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sherman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm and Joyce, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stromnes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Froeling et al., 2011</xref>), and the identification of a clinically applicable means to revert desmoplastic stroma is of considerable interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stromnes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Froeling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander and Cukierman, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Activation of local fibroblastic pancreatic stellate cells and recruited naïve fibroblastic cells during desmoplasia involves their transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ)-dependent conversion to a myofibroblastic (activated) phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desmoulière et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Principe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). This phenotype is characterized by the induction of stress fibers and the elevated expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), palladin and other actin-binding proteins, and by the production of an aligned and organized (anisotropic) ECM, with parallel fibers that are rich in discrete fibronectin splice variants (e.g., ED-A) and in type I collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mishra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Serini et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hinz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rönty et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goetz et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the strong effect of TGFβ on fibroblast activation and ECM remodeling during epithelial cancer-associated desmoplasia, knowledge of the mechanisms and downstream consequences of this activation remain limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hesler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oshima et al., 2015</xref>). In previous studies, we demonstrated that culturing naïve fibroblasts within CAF-secreted D-ECM is sufficient to induce myofibroblastic conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amatangelo et al., 2005</xref>). Compatible with this dynamic ECM-dependent reprogramming, specific cell-matrix receptors, such as integrins α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub> and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>, have been identified as regulators of myofibroblastic αSMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lygoe et al., 2004</xref>) and as participants in the maturation of specific types of cell-matrix adhesions that support anisotropic fiber formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dugina et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we first asked whether D-ECM production and the ability of D-ECM to induce myofibroblastic activation can be decoupled and independently regulated. Using a patient-derived human pancreatic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2011</xref>) as main focus, with supporting data from human renal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>) and additional stromal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amatangelo et al., 2005</xref>) models, we found that although TGFβ is needed for production of D-ECM, it is dispensable for subsequent D-ECM-induction of myofibroblastic activation of naïve fibroblasts. We also found that D-ECM controls α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin signaling, which prompts the accumulation of activated, but FAK-independent, α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1-</sub>integrin pools in specific intracellular vesicles. This D-ECM control of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin signaling prevents the enrichment of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin at the plasma membrane (PM), where α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> activity opposes myofibroblastic activation. Using a novel integrative approach combining multi-colored immunofluorescence and a new quantitative algorithm, we first validated our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings and then applied this process to annotated clinical samples. This defined two readily distinguishable desmoplastic phenotypes that were correlated with markedly distinct clinical outcomes. These phenotypes are based on differences in the stromal localization and levels of either activated SMAD2/3 (indicative of TGFβ signaling) or active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin and FAK. These signatures help clarify the controversial role of desmoplasia in the progression of cancer.

We first established that both of these integrin heterodimers were highly abundant, compared to other β-integrins, on the PMs of human naïve pancreatic stellate cells and of PDAC-associated CAFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To determine whether either or both of these heterodimers is essential for D-ECM induction of myofibroblastic conversion, naïve fibroblastic stellate cells were plated overnight on N-ECM or D-ECM in the presence of integrin-inhibitory or negative control antibodies. ALULA, a highly specific α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin-blocking antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Su et al., 2007</xref>), eliminated the ability of D-ECM to induce αSMA stress fiber localization (and expression) beyond levels induced by N-ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). By contrast, mAb16, which specifically blocks human α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 1989</xref>), had limited effects on D-ECM induction of αSMA localization (or expression), with naïve cells undergoing robust myofibroblastic conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>).

(<bold>G</bold>) Model of D-ECM-induced activation of naïve fibroblasts, dependent on the activity of integrins α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub> and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>. Inhibition of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5-</sub> integrin results in release of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin, leading to blockade of D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation (1<sup>st</sup> arrow, red X). The activity of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5-</sub> integrin is no longer needed in the absence of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity, suggesting that α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity in not necessary for fibroblasts to undergo D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation (2<sup>nd</sup> arrow, green checkmark). Double inhibition of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin results in D-ECM myofibroblastic activation, which proposes that inhibition of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin can overcome or rescue the effects seen under α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibition (3<sup>rd</sup> arrow, green checkmark). Stabilization of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin in its active conformation overcomes the inhibitory/regulatory effects imparted by α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin, resulting in ineffective D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation (4<sup>th</sup> arrow, red X). Overall, the model suggests that D-ECM induces α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>- integrin activity, which in turn results in the regulation of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin, allowing D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation (large arrow to the right, green checkmark).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20600.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20600.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-20600-fig3-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig3s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20600.016</object-id><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Naïve β<sub>5</sub>-integrin KO fibroblasts display stunted D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The CRISPR/CAS9 system was used to generate naïve fibroblastic stellate cell β<sub>5</sub>-integrin knock-out (KO) (β<sub>5</sub>-KO) or control KO (cntrl-KO) lines, whose genoype was confirmed by western blotting.

We cultured naïve murine skin fibroblasts within mD-ECM overnight in the presence of ALULA alone, to inhibit α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin, or in combination with BMA5, to inhibit the activity of murine α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fehlner-Gardiner et al., 1996</xref>). The results of this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) paralleled those seen with pancreatic stellate cells, suggesting a general mechanism.</p><p>To explore the observation that α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin-induced myofibroblastic activation is dispensable upon loss of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity, we directly tested the possibility that α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin negatively regulates α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin to prevent active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> from blocking D-ECM-induced activation (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). For this, we asked whether stabilizing the activity of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin could phenocopy α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibition. We found that SNAKA51, an activating antibody that stabilizes the active conformation of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2005</xref>), reduced the ability of D-ECM to induce αSMA stress fiber localization (and expression) in naïve stellate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). As an independent approach to simulate ALULA-dependent inhibition of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin, we used Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-editing to generate a series of naïve stellate cells in which the β<sub>5</sub>, α<sub>5,</sub> α<sub>v</sub> or β<sub>3</sub> (a negative control) integrin subunits were ablated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Cells lacking the β<sub>5</sub> subunit had a greatly diminished response to D-ECM, with very limited induction of αSMA stress fiber localization (and expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, loss of α<sub>5</sub>-, α<sub>v</sub>- or β<sub>3</sub>-integrin profoundly reduced growth of naïve fibroblasts, yielding slow-growing cells that were also unable to respond to D-ECM. The slow growth and poor condition of the additional KO cells suggests pleiotropic roles for these integrin subunits in supporting cell viability, and thus makes it difficult to draw conclusions. Nonetheless, the results do not rule out a role for α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity, regulated by D-ECM control of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin, that opposes the stimulation of the naïve-to-myofibroblastic transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether manipulation of integrin activities in CAFs, as opposed to in naïve stellate cells, could influence their ability to produce functional D-ECM. In contrast to results with TGFβ blockade, neither α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibition (with ALULA) nor stabilization of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin (with SNAKA51) altered the anisotropic fiber formation in D-ECM deposited by CAFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), or the ability of these matrices to induce myofibroblastic activation in naïve fibroblastic stellate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also analyzed the ECM produced by CRISPR-edited CAFs lacking specific integrin subunits. In contrast to results with integrin inhibition, CAFs lacking β<sub>5</sub>-integrin or α<sub>5</sub>-integrin subunits had decreased αSMA expression and localization of αSMA to stress fibers. Loss of β<sub>5</sub> expression also affected levels of D-ECM anisotropy, while CAFs lacking α<sub>5</sub> failed to produce substantial matrices (matching earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pankov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McDonald et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fogerty et al., 1990</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, loss of α<sub>v</sub>-integrin caused significant reduction in the ability to produce D-ECM, while loss of the negative control, β<sub>3</sub>, had no effect on this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggested that the ability of CAFs to grow and produce functional D-ECMs was selectively affected by loss of α<sub>5</sub>, α<sub>v</sub> and β<sub>5</sub> integrin subunits but not by β<sub>3</sub> loss.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20600.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Transient α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibition or α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin stabilization failed to alter CAF production of anisotropic D-ECM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative indirect immunofluorescent images of 3D D-ECM producing CAFs in the presence of functional blocking anti-α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin (ALULA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Su et al., 2007</xref>]; D + α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-i), active conformation stabilizing anti-α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin (SNAKA51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2005</xref>]; D + α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-act.) or non-immunized isotypic antibodies (D + IgG).

Further, FAK<sup>-/-</sup> murine naïve fibroblastic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ilić et al., 1995</xref>) grown in mD-ECM had greatly reduced myofibroblastic activation, which was significantly increased if α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> but not α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub> integrin activation was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). As an additional control to exclude off-target or indirect effects of drug inhibition or FAK KO background compensation, we asked whether murine fibroblasts engineered to express a dominant negative FAK Kinase-Dead mutant (FAK-KD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lim et al., 2010</xref>) behaved similarly to those with deleted or inhibited FAK, and whether they also recovered responsiveness to D-ECM following inhibition of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity. Immortalized murine fibroblasts overexpressing FAK-KD displayed a lack of myofibroblastic response to mD-ECM compared to the response seen in isogenic hTert immortalized control cells, and again, an efficient rescue of this phenotype was imparted by α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>FAK often interacts with SRC family kinases to mediate integrin signaling. To further probe the mechanisms, we evaluated the mD-ECM responsiveness of fibroblasts cells that are genetically null for the SRC family kinases SRC, FYN and YES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klinghoffer et al., 1999</xref>). We found that the ablation of SRC family kinases also negated the ability of fibroblasts to respond to mD-ECM. Interestingly, in this context, inhibition of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin did not restore the mD-ECM-induced myofibroblastic phenotype, indicating non-equivalent functions of FAK and SRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Last, we explored the relationship between FAK and α<sub>5</sub>-integrin expression (as opposed to integrin activity). The ability of the FAK inhibitor to block D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic transition depended on an intact α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> heterodimer, as PF573,228 did not rescue the mD-ECM-induced process that was disrupted in α<sub>5</sub>-KO naïve stellate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results suggested that FAK is essential for D-ECM-induced myofibroblast activation, but dispensable for the α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin inhibition of this process. The data further indicate that genetic ablation of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin does not recapitulate the result of inhibition of integrin activity in D-ECM responsiveness, perhaps due to additional functional requirements for this integrin in supporting fundamental cell growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>D-ECM regulates length of 3D-adhesion structures concomitant with α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin-dependent redistribution of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin to endosomal vesicles</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, fibroblasts engage N-ECM through 3D matrix adhesion structures (3D-adhesions) that mediate matrix-dependent homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cukierman et al., 2001</xref>). 3D-adhesions are elongated adhesion plaques that depend on α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity for their formation and are characterized by encompassing active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin concomitant with constitutive, albeit low, levels of auto-phosphorylated, activated FAK (pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cukierman et al., 2001</xref>).

To test the idea that D-ECM might affect the recruitment or activation of FAK in 3D adhesions, potentially through control of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activation or localization, we also examined the localization of activated FAK (pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup>) to 3D adhesions. Results normalized to levels obtained in D-ECMs (a.u. = 1.0) indicated that D-ECM induced ~2 fold more pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> than N-ECM, and that this activated FAK was localized at 3D-adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Interestingly, while a modest pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> downregulation was observed in α<sub>5</sub>-KO, there were no appreciable changes in pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> in α<sub>v</sub>-KO cells, whereas a small increase in pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> was induced by D-ECM in β<sub>3</sub>-integrin KO fibroblastic stellate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Accordingly, treatment of naïve r-fibroblasts seeded within rD-ECM in the presence of small molecule FAK inhibitor PF573,228 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Slack-Davis et al., 2007</xref>), blocked acquisition of myofibroblastic traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3</xref>). In naïve r-fibroblasts, concomitant FAK and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin inhibition with combined PF573,228 and mAb16 significantly increased rD-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation compared to PF573,228 treatment alone. Again, effects similar to those observed in the PDAC system were seen: α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin co-inhibition with FAK failed to rescue rD-ECM naïve-to-myofibroblastic conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3</xref>). Also, pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> levels measured in 3D-adhesions of naïve r-fibroblasts induced by rD-ECM were effectively reduced in the presence of α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibitor (ALULA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Su et al., 2007</xref>]), rendering pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> levels similar to N-ECM levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s4">Figure 11—figure supplement 4</xref>). Culturing naïve r-fibroblasts in rD-ECM triggered lengthening of 3D-adhesion structures compared to those in rN-ECM, and this was effectively prevented by stabilization of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity using SNAKA51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s5">Figure 11—figure supplement 5</xref>). Last, plating naïve r-fibroblasts in rD-ECM increased levels of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin that was localized away from 3D-adhesion structures compared to those in rN-ECM. These levels were regulated by α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin, as treatment with ALULA restricted the enrichment of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity in areas lacking adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s6">Figure 11—figure supplement 6</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20600.048</object-id><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>αSMA stress fiber localization and expression levels in naïve renal fibroblasts cultured overnight within assorted renal ECMs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20600.048">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20600.048</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" valign="top"/><th><p><bold>rN-ECM</bold></p> </th><th><p><bold>rD-ECM</bold></p> </th><th><p><bold>rD+TGFβi</bold></p> </th><th><p><bold>rD+DMSO</bold></p> </th><th><p><bold>TGFβi</bold></p> </th><th><p><bold>DMSO</bold></p> </th><th><p><bold>αvβ5-i</bold></p> </th><th><p><bold>α5β1-i</bold></p> </th><th><p><bold>5+α5-i</bold></p> </th><th><p><bold>α5β1-act</bold></p> </th><th><p><bold>IgG</bold></p> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="3"><p><bold>αSMA stress fiber localization</bold></p> </td><td><p>25% percentile</p></td><td><p>0.05</p></td><td><p>0.88</p></td><td><p>0.28</p></td><td><p>0.689</p></td><td><p>0.87</p></td><td><p>0.91</p></td><td><p>0.46</p></td><td><p>0.54</p></td><td><p>0.63</p></td><td><p>0.74</p></td><td><p>0.96</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><bold>Median</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>0.29</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>1.00</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>0.72</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>0.89</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>1.03</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>1.05</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>0.67</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>0.89</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>1.00</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>0.93</bold></p> </td><td><p><bold>1.06</bold></p> </td></tr><tr><td><p>75% percentile</p></td><td><p>0.67</p></td><td><p>1.10</p></td><td><p>0.97</p></td><td><p>1.03</p></td><td><p>1.17</p></td><td><p>1.16</p></td><td><p>0.96</p></td><td><p>1.06</p></td><td><p>1.33</p></td><td><p>1.54</p></td><td><p>2.19</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn32"><p>Values obtained from naïve renal fibroblastic cells cultured overnight within intact rD-ECMs (made from rCAFs) were used for normalization and assigned an arbitrary unit of 1.00.

localization of the stromal biomarker signature developed here yielded clinically useful prognostic biomarkers for PDAC, testing the idea that stromal pSMAD2/3, indicative of TGFβ signaling, would be associated with poor outcomes and active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin at 3D adhesions would be associated with better survival. For this, we conducted high-throughput SMI image acquisition and SMIA-CUKIE analysis of TMA PDAC samples, using univariate CART methodology to integrate the reporting levels of numerical outputs and intersections of the seven biomarkers of interest with OS or RFS. We observed significantly shorter OS in tumor surgical samples that had high stromal pSMAD2/3 values, whether values were quantified as mean or median stromal pSMAD2/3 intensity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). Even though many patients did not show clinical improvement following surgery (so that our cohort presented a bias towards fast recurrence), high stromal pSMAD2/3 levels also correlated with shorter RFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, higher mean quantified levels of stromal α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity also correlated significantly with longer RFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s2">Figure 13—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, longer times to recurrence following surgery, quantified as the percentage area coverage relative to stromal occupied areas or as integrated intensities, were significantly associated with increased levels of integrin activity localized to stromal 3D-adhesion positive locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s2">Figure 13—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results suggest that stromal activation of TGFβ, represented by high stromal pSMAD2/3 levels and indicative of capacity for active production of D-ECM production, is a prognostic stromal trait for poor outcome, while increased stromal levels of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin at 3D adhesion positive areas may constitute a patient-protective PDAC-associated desmoplastic phenotype.<fig-group><fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20600.054</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Stromal pSMAD2/3 levels are predictive of poor overall survival in PDAC patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CART-generated survival curves depicting overall survival (OS) as a function of stromal pSMAD2/3 expression in PDAC patients.

The data in this study are useful by providing insight into stromal function in several ways. First, by addressing prior studies that suggest that changes in tumor-associated ECM are necessary for TGFβ-dependent myofibroblastic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desmoulière et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Serini et al., 1998</xref>), they dissect the interaction of TGFβ with N-ECM versus D-ECM. These results indicate that TGFβ contributes to N-ECM assembly, and that it is essential solely for the phenotypic remodeling required for conversion to anisotropic D-ECM, but not for secretion of ECM components per se in the context of D-ECM production. This fact is supported by the observation that CAFs require TGFβ signaling for the myofibroblastic production of anisotropic D-ECM and for expression of αSMA, while the myofibroblastic features that are acquired by normal/naïve fibroblasts in response to D-ECM do not entail this signaling pathway. Second, our work addressed two cell-ECM receptor integrin heterodimers that have previously been shown to influence myofibroblastic activation, α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub> and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lygoe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dugina et al., 2001</xref>). Our study shows that both of these integrin heterodimers are abundant on the surface of both naïve fibroblasts and CAFs, but have distinct roles in the ability of naïve fibroblasts to respond to and of CAFs to assemble anisotropic D-ECM. In particular, our work integrated multiple approaches to emphasize an important role for α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin in the response of naïve fibroblasts to D-ECM and for CAFs in producing anisotropic matrix. We also found that while α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> counteracted the response of naïve fibroblasts to D-ECM, it was, not surprisingly, essential for matrix fibrillogenesis. Interestingly, in the context of extracted D-ECM imparting naïve-to-myofibroblastic activation, cross-signaling between the two integrins was apparent, with α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub> regulating the internalization of part of the elevated pool of activated α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> to intracellular endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). Third, we also defined specific ECM responses as independent of, or dependent on, the canonical integrin effector FAK. Fourth, importantly, we demonstrated that the signaling relationships identified in this study were valid in multiple model systems, including human primary PDAC and RCC, as well as additional murine models. Fifth, we used high-content imaging and data analysis to demonstrate that interactions analyzed <italic>in vitro</italic> can be used to define an <italic>in vivo</italic> stromal signature that has prognostic value, addressing a significant clinical goal.<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20600.059</object-id><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Model depicting D-ECM-induced α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub> regulation of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin localization during naïve-to-myofibroblastic activation.</title><p>Essentially, naïve fibroblasts grown in N-ECMs do not trigger a surplus in active α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub> and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin conformations. Consequently, the non-pathological N-ECM spares regulation of α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin activity and assures physiological accumulation of low active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin levels at the PM, rendering fibroblasts inactive. D-ECMs induce an excess of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin and regulate α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin-mediated relocation of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin from the PM to intracellular (e.g., late endosomal) pools, resulting in myofibroblastic activation. Last, this D-ECM activity is dependent on the activity of α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin, as inhibition of α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin maintains active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin at the PM (similarly to N-ECM regulation of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin locations), which averts D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation.

The desmoplastic 3D models used in this study allowed us to functionally dissect both mechanisms of D-ECM production by CAFs, including the specific induction of anisotropic ECMs, and D-ECM-induced responses such as myofibroblastic activation of naïve fibroblasts, mechanistically informing the significance of such signatures.</p><p>A role for TGFβ in regulating the production of anisotropic ECM had been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Khan and Marshall, 2016</xref>). Remodeling that causes isotropic ECMs to become increasingly anisotropic, together with increases in matrix tension and stiffness, are all features of chronic fibrosis that physically enhance the accessibility and activation of TGFβ by myofibroblastic integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klingberg et al., 2014</xref>). Another interesting study demonstrated that substrate stiffness influences the ability of a cell induced <italic>in vitro</italic> to undergo myofibroblastic activation, and can positively or negatively influence the degree to which a cell is able to accurately acquire the characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achterberg et al., 2014</xref>) of a CAF<italic> in vivo</italic>. In accord with this line of thinking, one may argue that specific ECM topographies, and in particular the overall physical properties of cell substrates, play key pathophysiological roles in promoting positive feedback loops involving myofibroblastic cells and D-ECMs in fibrous tumor-associated microenvironments, such as PDAC-associated desmoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander and Cukierman, 2016</xref>). Our results indicated that while TGFβ is necessary for normal fibroblasts to assemble N-ECM, it is essential solely for the phenotypic remodeling of anisotropic D-ECM by CAFs, and not for its production. Negating CAF capability to produce anisotropic D-ECM restricts tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goreczny et al., 2016</xref>), while increased levels of anisotropic D-ECM correlate with poor patient survival and cancer relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goetz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conklin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bredfeldt et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of the TGFβ type I receptor, which reduces the activity of a downstream canonical effector of TGFβ, SMAD2/3, is known to hinder matrix fibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Callahan et al., 2002</xref>). In our work, elevated fibroblast-expressed pSMAD2/3 and nuclear translocation of this protein in CAFs producing D-ECM correlated with short time to recurrence and reduced survival in both PDAC and RCC patient cohorts. Results from our study also suggest that while TGFβ-targeted therapeutic interventions may revert D-ECMs to their naturally tumor-suppressive isotropic phenotype, the same approach could ablate homeostatic N-ECM. Consideration of this possibility is important because total ablation of TGFβ induces multifocal inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shull et al., 1992</xref>) and because clinical trials are currently assessing TGFβ-inhibitory drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Herbertz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While the understudied α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>1</sub> heterodimer was recently recognized as a regulator of latent TGFβ in fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reed et al., 2015</xref>), α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub> and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrins are involved in myofibroblastic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lygoe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dugina et al., 2001</xref>). Both α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub> and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin receptors were abundant in primary fibroblasts collected from patients. Our results demonstrated that in response to D-ECM, α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin activity supports the relocalization of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin to intracellular endosomal pools and that this vesicular accumulation is needed for the maintenance of naïve-to-myofibroblastic activation. In addition, genetic loss (but not transient inhibition) of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>, which resulted in slow-growing naïve cells, altogether prevented <italic>de novo</italic> D-ECM induction of naïve-to-myofibroblastic transition. Interestingly, in other studies, α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1-</sub>positive elongated ‘super mature’ adhesion structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dugina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hinz et al., 2003</xref>), which control tension-dependent recruitment and retention of αSMA at stress fibers, were found to play a functional role in myofibroblastic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goffin et al., 2006</xref>). Together with our findings, these data suggest that α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> participates in the regulation of αSMA expression, whereas the α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5-</sub>regulated relocation of activated α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin participates in αSMA localization to stress fibers. Other studies have shown that inhibition of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin activates β<sub>1</sub>-integrin, counteracting ECM-dependent myofibroblastic αSMA stress fiber localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). However, the nature of the specific β<sub>1</sub>-integrin heterodimer and the mechanistic details of this negative myofibroblastic regulation were previously unknown. We further defined the α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> activity that regulates αSMA localization as independent of FAK. Interestingly, a previously defined α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin activity needed to form 3D-adhesions in both normal cell-derived ECMs and <italic>in vivo</italic> is also FAK-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cukierman et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, our results indicate that D-ECM induces α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin-dependent redistribution of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin to intracellular pools, within structures that include CD81-positive multivesicular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Escola et al., 1998</xref>) and late Rab7/Rab11 endosomes. We found that using SNAKA51 to stabilize α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity resulted in reduced internalization, a finding that differs from results reported previously which indicated that treating cells with SNAKA51 internalized active integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mana et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that these differences reflect differences in analytic time points. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mana et al. (2016</xref>) looked at a time point of 20 min after treatment, whereas we analyzed data after overnight incubation with SNAKA51, which may have led to compensatory enrichment of activity at the PM in our study, and thus further investigation is required. However, it is interesting that engagement of the integrin-binding ligands RGD, osteopontin and cilengitide with α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> results in the association of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> with a Rab-coupling protein which regulates its localization concomitant with EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caswell et al., 2008</xref>). It is therefore possible that the use of ALULA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2005</xref>) in this study triggered activation of the Rab cellular trafficking machinery, in a manner restricted by α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub> activity during tumor-associated desmoplasia.</p><p>The importance of identifying reliable biomarkers for early PDAC diagnostics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Laeseke et al., 2015</xref>) and improved RCC prognostic predictions is clear. Recently, increased stromal density was deemed to be a better prognostic outcome in a retrospective study looking at pancreatic cancer patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by adjuvant treatment, while assessing overall levels of stromal αSMA was found to be inconclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bever et al., 2015</xref>). In the future, it will be interesting to test whether the increased stromal density, perhaps in the context of specific relocalization of αSMA, corresponds to this study’s ‘patient-protective’ phenotype. This example, together with additional studies that suggest both tumor-protective and -detrimental roles for highly heterogeneous desmoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Özdemir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rhim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sherman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bever et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sasson et al., 2003</xref>), underscore the need for better stromal categorization. The new software developed in this study to facilitate analysis of the discrete localizations of the various markers specifically in stroma (freely downloadable from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cukie/SMIA_CUKIE">https://github.com/cukie/SMIA_CUKIE</ext-link>) allows analysis of batch-sorted monochromatic images in bulk, and generation of qualitative and quantitative outputs to evaluate biomarkers located at any given mask and/or marker intersection. In this study, we used this software to identify predictive biomarker signatures for PDAC and RCC patients. Stromal increases in pSMAD2/3 and pFAK correlated with worse outcomes but, in spite of the bias introduced by the use of resectable surgical cases, we identified a patient-protective stroma phenotype in PDAC, in which increased active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin selectively localized at stromal 3D-adhesions is associated with improved outcomes. By contrast, intensities of active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity correlated with increasingly unfavorable OS as well as DSS in RCC patients. Hence, locations and intensities of stromal α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity concomitant with constitutive active pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> could represent novel desmoplasia-dependent outcome-predicting stromal patterns. As our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggested a complex function for α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity, and given the differences between the molecular characteristics of distinct tumor subtypes, we emphasize that individual tumor classes will require careful study before these biomarkers could be used as predictive clinical indicators.</p><p>In summary, our study provides new insights into the intracellular and extracellular signaling processes that support desmoplastic formation, with mechanistic studies facilitated by the use of <italic>in vitro</italic> fibroblast-derived 3D ECMs. Specifically, the results suggest that α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin prevents FAK-independent α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity from impairing D-ECM-induced naïve-to-myofibroblastic activation by relocating this activity to multivesicular and other late endosomes. β<sub>5</sub>-integrin's contribution to the ability of CAFs to produce functional anisotropic D-ECM, in which active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin levels are not altered, distinguishes between naïve-to-myofibroblastic activation and myofibroblastic CAFs. Importantly, this study supports the idea that stromal normalization, to produce a form that plays a tumor-suppressive role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mintz and Illmensee, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Soto and Sonnenschein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bissell and Hines, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander and Cukierman, 2016</xref>) may be a favorable approach, especially as some recent attempts aimed at completely abolishing stroma have proven harmful to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bijlsma and van Laarhoven, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Özdemir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rhim et al., 2014</xref>). This work also suggests specific protein targets that may be useful for stroma-normalizing therapies. For example, these data suggest that future therapeutic strategies might involve combinatorial treatments to inhibit TGFβ and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin. Finally, the study also suggests that monitoring the level and localization of stromal pSMAD2/3, as well as those of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity together with those of stromal pFAK, could assist in stratifying individuals that would benefit from α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin and other chronic fibrosis-directed therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Human tissues were collected under exemption-approval of the Center’s Institutional Review Board after patients signed a written informed consent agreeing to donate samples to research.

To overcome this problem, images were collected using Caliper’s multispectral imaging system (PerkinElmer), which utilizes a unique imaging module with Tunable Liquid Crystal. Two different systems namely Nuance-FX (for 40x objective) and Vectra (for 20x objective and high throughput) were used depending on the acquisition needs. A wavelength-based spectral library for each system and each tissue type (i.e., pancreas and kidney) was created by staining control sections with individual fluorophores or by mock treating samples to include the specific autofluorescence spectra. Once a spectral library was constructed for each organ type, it was saved and used for the subsequent image acquisition and analysis. All excitations were achieved via a high-intensity mercury lamp using the following filters (emission-excitation): for Nuance, DAPI (450-720), FITC (500-720), TRITC (580-720), CY5 (680-720); for Vectra, DAPI (440-680), FITC (500-680), TRITC (570-690), CY5 (680-720). For emissions collection, ‘DAPI’ filter (wavelength range 450–720) was used for all Q-dot labeled markers, while masks used the conventional FITC, TRITC, and CY5 filters. After collecting all image cubes (including all channels), images were unmixed to obtain 16-bit greyscale individual stains monochromatic files. Using Photoshop’s 'Levels' and 'Batch Conversion' functions, the images were processed in bulk to render identically scaled 8-bit monochromatic images for each channel. The resulting images were sampled to set identical threshold values for each channel, which were used to feed the values needed for analyses in SMIA-CUKIE to signify positive-labeled pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>SMIA-CUKIE usage and outputs</title><p>SMIA-CUKIE (SCR_014795) was written for the bulk analysis of high-throughput-acquired monochromatic images, corresponding to simultaneously labeled channels like the ones used in this study. As examples, masks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2</xref> were generated using SMIA-CUKIE and demonstrate how the software isolates stromal locations while omitting positive tumoral areas, based on mask value thresholds that are provided by the user.</p><p>Images were sorted into ‘Batch Folders’, each containing the five monochromatic images corresponding to the original (unmixed) sample. The newly written software, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cukie/SMIA_CUKIE">https://github.com/cukie/SMIA_CUKIE</ext-link>, was created to bulk process and analyze batches of monochromatic images providing localization (masks), intensities, and similar quantifying values (markers), including co-localizations of multichannel monochromatic immunofluorescent (or IHC, etc.) images. The software can identify intersection areas between an unlimited amount of masks, while queried marker values and locations can also be estimated for numerous interrogations. The software requires the identification of common nomenclatures to recognize each type of monochromatic image (i.e vim for vimentin etc.). It also needs information regarding the available number of masks and markers deposited in the batch folders containing the images. In this work, three masks were used corresponding to nuclei, epithelium/tumor and stroma, as well as two markers corresponding to adhesion structures and active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin. For each of the masks and markers, the software requires a numeric threshold (0-255), which indicates the value of pixel intensity that is to be considered positive for each channel (corresponding to each mask and marker). The software then allows choosing amongst all possible query combinations. Alternatively, it provides an option for the user to write the desired tests to be queried. For example, when active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin values were requested at <italic>bona fide</italic> stromal locations, the software was instructed to look for ‘SNAKA under vimentin, NOTepi/tumor’. In this example, ‘SNAKA’ was the nomenclature we used for the active integrin channel while vimentin and epi/tumor served as masks. After running this function, the software rendered an Excel file containing values of area coverage for the marker at the requested mask intersection (stroma), as well as total area coverage related to the image. Similarly, values included mean, median, standard deviation, total and integrated intensities. In addition, the software can be instructed to provide image outputs corresponding to requested mask locations, as well as markers shown solely at the corresponding mask intersections (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12 –figure supplement 2</xref>).

Next, membranes were incubated for 2 hr in anti-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibodies (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 5% milk in 0.1% TBST. Blots were then washed again five times/5 min each. Finally, Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) was added to the blots and protein bands were captured by film or Protein Simple Digital Imaging System (Protein Simple, San Jose, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Bioinformatics and statistics</title><p>Two-tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests were used to query experimental significances for all <italic>in vitro</italic> data, comparing control conditions to experimental ones independently. All <italic>in vitro</italic> results were presented as medians with interquartile range. Each PDAC-related <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment was performed at least three times, using one patient matched CAF and normal fibroblasts. For verification, these series of experiments were also conducted, using one additional pair of normal and activated fibroblasts from a non-related patient, two normal fibroblasts isolated from two additional non-related patients, and one tumor tissue which provided one additional non-related activated (desmoplastic) fibroblastic cell. All cells characterized as normal fibroblasts were verified for their phenotype and challenged with D-ECMs produced by CAFs isolated from three of the above describedpatients. These included a total of five different patient sources which included seven surgical samples. The RCC-related <italic>in vitro</italic> assessments were performed employing a combination of two patients-derived CAFs and normal fibroblasts from another two different sources. All the image analyses were conducted in at least ten images containing no less than three cells per region per experimental condition for each above-mentioned repetition.</p><p>Regarding statistics pertinent to the TMAs, to identify clinical and laboratory variables related to patient survival (OS, DSS, and RFS), univariate and multivariable analyses were performed by constructing decision trees using the CART methodology. Clinical and laboratory variables were considered as predictors of survival time and are listed in data uploaded to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.foxchase.org/sites/fccc/files/assets/cukierman_Franco-Barraza%20SMIA-CUKIE-Dec-2016.xlsx">https://www.foxchase.org/sites/fccc/files/assets/cukierman_Franco-Barraza%20SMIA-CUKIE-Dec-2016.xlsx</ext-link>. The unified CART framework that embeds recursive binary partitioning into the theory of permutation tests was used. Significance-testing procedures were applied to determine whether no significant association between any of the clinical variables and the response could be stated, or whether the recursion would need to stop. Also, log-rank tests and univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) were used to correlate clinical and laboratory variables with survival; hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated, as appropriate, for various comparisons. Goodness-of-fit of the PH model was evaluated based on Schoenfeld residuals. In order to account for potential batch effects, a ‘batch’ variable was included as an adjustment variable in all the analyses that were pertinent to the PDAC cohort. All tests were two-sided and used a significance level of 5% to test each hypothesis. Significant p-values in all figures were denoted by asterisks as follows: ****p&lt;0.0001 extremely significant, ***p=0.0001–0.01 very significant, **p=0.01–0.05 significant and *p=0.05–0.10 marginally significant. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software, version 6.05 for Windows (La Jolla, CA) and the R packages <italic>survival</italic> and <italic>parity</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Wafik S El-Deiry for providing critiques on the written manuscript and A Carson for proofreading.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Harry Dietz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Johanna Ivaska, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A timely and critical question in cancer biology concerns the dual role of the fibroblasts in restraining disease in some instances (i.e. normal fibroblasts) while promoting disease progression in other instances (i.e. activate carcinoma-associated fibroblasts). In particular, recent studies evaluating pancreatic cancer have highlighted this issue by further confirming that normal fibroblasts can restrain disease; findings that have been reasonably well described in other solid tumors. Further, strong consensus evidence in pancreatic cancer and numerous other solid tumors indicates a disease promoting role for activated myofibroblasts in the stroma. In the current work the authors undertake focused studies to evaluate this dual role of fibroblasts and elucidate fundamental mechanisms driving these distinct behaviors. Franco-Barraza and colleagues have investigated the underlying mechanisms of PDAC desmoplasia by generating 3D in vitro cell derived matrixes from normal fibroblasts (to generate N-ECM) and PDAC CAFs to generate D-ECM (desmoplastic ECM). They find that TGFb signalling is essential for D-ECM production but dispensable for the ability of the D-ECM to covert naïve fibroblasts to activated myofibroblasts. They find that in response to PDAC-associated D-ECM, αvβ5-integrin re-distributes active α5β1-integrin away from pFAK-Y397 positive 3D-adhesions and, thus, promotes myofibroblastic activation whereas inhibition of avb5 under these conditions was protective against myofibroblasts activation by increasing active a5b1 location to the cell surface. They also have data from human PDAC and RCC investigating whether levels of FAK and α5β1 integrin can distinguish tumor suppressive v tumor promoting stroma.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found your work to be particularly relevant to the field right now as there is some controversy about the role of fibroblasts in disease progression and response to therapy. They felt that the data presented in the submitted manuscript are very timely and may help clarify the dynamics of cancer stroma crosstalk in pancreatic carcinoma. However, all of the reviewers found the manuscript to be extremely dense and especially the Results section very hard to follow. Their enthusiasm was somewhat hampered by the lack of clarity in several instances (please see specific points below) that make portions of the manuscript difficult to read/interpret. Furthermore, they were critical about the clinical relevance and strength of the human data and the representability of the limited number of fibroblasts for PDAC as a whole. In addition, to the specific points raised below the authors are strongly encouraged to significantly edit and rewrite the manuscript to improve clarity of presentation, understanding what has been done and the logic behind the experiments.</p><p>1) PDAC is a highly heterogeneous disease, but the authors have studied fibroblasts from only 3 tumors, and they seem to have presented data from only 1 tumor (although they may have repeated with fibroblasts from the other 2 tumors these data aren't shown). The authors are encouraged to re-write the manuscript to show very clearly the data from the fibroblasts from the 3 different patients. This would make a more understandable story but also give clearer insights into the heterogeneity they might be seeing (i.e. are there differences from the 3 tumours when they have characterised the fibroblasts in depth?).</p><p>2) The human data, particularly from PDAC patients, need to be clarified. It is unclear why 10 PDAC patients (and 10/11 RCC patients) are excluded. However, the most obvious problem is that since there was no effect of stromal active α5β1 levels on OS, the authors have compared RFS – but apparently half of the cohort had a RFS of 0 (even though many have a OS of years!). Combined with the seemingly arbitrary cut-off for low vs. high (rather than above and below median which might be considered standard), this effectively leaves 3 patients with low stromal active α5β1 at 3D-adh. The authors then claim RFS benefits of about 11 months with high stromal active α5β1 at 3D-adh, but the median of those patients is about 11 months, compared with the survival of the 3 'low' patients at 10, 10 and 19 months.</p><p>In addition, despite assessing levels of α5β1 away from 3D-adh, and pFAK and pSmad, the relationship to OS or RFS is not shown or discussed, leading the reader to presume the data were negative. Far from supporting the conclusions of the in vitro work, this section raises questions as to the relevance to cancer.</p><p>It also appears highly likely that the patient samples used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> etc. represent a subset of pancreatic cancer patients (i.e. the ~20% that are candidates for surgical resection). Thus, they may not fully represent the patient population and some of the most aggressive forms of the disease. Some discussion of this seems appropriate.</p><p>3) The TGF-β experiments described starting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are interesting and insightful but also raise a number of important questions that are not adequately addressed or discussed in the manuscript in its current form. For instance, what is really changing when TGF-β signaling is blocked? Are the activated myofibroblasts in general reverting to a more phenotypically quiescent state, is ECM secretion changing resulting in fundamentally different ECM composition, are the CAFs simply less contractile or polarized etc.? While this reviewer fully understands that each of these factors cannot be examined in detail in the current work, a more encompassing discussion of these potential shifts would improve the manuscript. Likewise, if data exists from evaluating these cultures over time it would strengthen the manuscript. Further, the data suggests that the differential influence of the N v D ECM is largely due to the differences in ECM alignment. Can a case be made that this is the dominant factor or one of the critical factors?</p><p>4) How effective are the employed antibodies at reducing integrin activity in each instance? The consistently intermediate (trending yet non-significant) levels of SMA following inhibition of alpha5-beta1 are a bit perplexing and generate some concern the that inhibition is simply weak. As such the CRISPR data is appreciated, however it would appear to be much more insightful to also have an approach to knockdown alpha5-beta1 levels.</p><p>5) Currently, very little mechanistic insight is provided into the underlying mechanism of altered integrin traffic. While defining the exact mechanism of how a5v5 inhibition drives increased a5b1 localization to 3D adhesion is probably too much to ask a few obvious things could be done. i) Given the high level of expertise in imaging demonstrated in the manuscript the authors should be able to describe the intracellular localization of the active a5b1 with more accuracy (are these early endosomes, recycling endosomes…). ii) There is a wealth of literature in cancer cells showing that inhibition of avb3 integrin with osteopontin, cilengitide or cRGD drives a5b1 recycling from intracellular endosomes to the membrane. Could a similar mechanism be involved in the ALULA-driven increase of a5b1 in 3D adhesions? This should be at least discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20600.061</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers found your work to be particularly relevant to the field right now as there is some controversy about the role of fibroblasts in disease progression and response to therapy.

The inclusion of these additional specimens, presented in a new Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s2">2</xref>), now allows us to draw statistically robust conclusions that support our overall hypothesis.</p><p><italic>And the representability of the limited number of fibroblasts for PDAC as a whole.</italic> </p><p>Our data now includes quantitative assessments of cells harvested from 5 PDAC patients. These include 2 patients for whom we obtained matching normal fibroblastic cells and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF), as well as one additional patient-derived set of CAFs and two unpaired normal pancreatic stellate cells. This made up for 7 different populations of primary cells being assessed (in contrast to the previous focus placed mostly in only one pair in the original submission). We tested all normal cells for their response to desmoplastic-ECM (D-ECM) and tested all D-ECMs for their phenotype and function, and for each, evaluated the ability of a TGFbeta receptor inhibitor during matrix production to reverse their ability to produce functional D-ECM (see new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These added analyses buttressed the idea that the signaling we observe is generalizable for describing interactions between naïve pancreatic stellate cells and CAF-produced, PDAC-associated D-ECMs.</p><p><italic>In addition, to the specific points raised below the authors are strongly encouraged to significantly edit and rewrite the manuscript to improve clarity of presentation, understanding what has been done and the logic behind the experiments.</italic> </p><p>As noted above, the entire manuscript has been rewritten to increase clarity.</p><p><italic>1) PDAC is a highly heterogeneous disease, but the authors have studied fibroblasts from only 3 tumors, and they seem to have presented data from only 1 tumor (although they may have repeated with fibroblasts from the other 2 tumors these data aren't shown). The authors are encouraged to re-write the manuscript to show very clearly the data from the fibroblasts from the 3 different patients. This would make a more understandable story but also give clearer insights into the heterogeneity they might be seeing (i.e. are there differences from the 3 tumours when they have characterised the fibroblasts in depth?).</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We have now included quantitative data comparing phenotypes from 3 sets of CAFs and 4 sets of naïve fibroblasts for multiple reported parameters, clearly noting that all specimens are analyzed. Statistical analysis of phenotypes indicates limited issues with heterogeneity, although certainly, the differences observed in this study between signaling pathways required for CAF functions versus regulation of naïve fibroblast-to-myofibroblastic activation may explain some <italic>in vivo</italic> observed stroma heterogeneity. These tests included measurement of matrices produced in the presence or absence of inhibition of the TGFbeta pathway for their ability to induce myofibroblastic features (including levels and localization of α-smooth muscle actin) in naïve fibroblastic stellate cells. Results from the multiple cell-matrix combinations (new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>)are now bolstered by results from other model systems (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> together with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s6">6</xref> as well as revised <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>) and supported by statistically significant analysis of a larger number of clinical PDAC samples that show similar signaling relationships (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s2">2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The human data, particularly from PDAC patients, need to be clarified. It is unclear why 10 PDAC patients (and 10/11 RCC patients) are excluded.</italic> </p><p>A) A small number of patients were excluded from the cohorts analyzed in the initial submission because we did not have annotation for their OS, RFS or DSS. The numbers of patients used for each analysis are now clearly annotated in a new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>. In addition, please note that we were able to extend analysis to include additional PDAC patients, so that the total number of specimens analyzed in this revision now totals 128 tumors (versus 65 in the original submission), with new results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s2">2</xref>. We have available OS information for all PDAC patients, and for 116/126 RCC patients.</p><p>B) In regard to analysis of RFS or DSS, we do not have any annotation regarding evidence of disease following surgery for 26 PDAC patients, so that only 102/128 PDAC patients are analyzed for this property in this revision. Similar lack of annotation caused us to only analyze DSS in 115/126 RCC patients.</p><p>C) We have made a comprehensive summary of available data (regarding age, gender and other clinical and history particulars of the complete PDAC and RCC patient cohorts, as well as more than 50 biomarker readouts from the simultaneous multi-color immunofluorescent (SMI) approach, available online in a linked database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.foxchase.org/sites/fccc/files/assets/cukierman_Franco-Barraza%20SMIA-CUKIE-Dec-2016.xlsx">https://www.foxchase.org/sites/fccc/files/assets/cukierman_Franco-Barraza%20SMIA-CUKIE-Dec-2016.xlsx</ext-link>), to ensure complete transparency and to support future in silico searches.</p><p><italic>However, the most obvious problem is that since there was no effect of stromal active α5β1 levels on OS, the authors have compared RFS – but apparently half of the cohort had a RFS of 0 (even though many have a OS of years!).</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge the issue with RFS was problematic, and in the modified Results section discuss limitations of the dataset directly. We believe that part of the difficulty in achieving significance lies in size of the sample cohorts, and part in the fact that localization of the active integrin conformation to intracellular vesicles versus at the PM emerged in this study as a critical factor, which it is more difficult to robustly image in primary tumor specimens. In this revision, we have enlarged our analytic cohort of PDAC specimens (making the RFS data more reliable), and analyzed more markers that are less subject to localization control, and hence potentially more robust. We now clearly show that active TGFbeta signaling, represented by levels of pSMAD2/3 at stromal (but not tumor) locations, correspond with significantly lower OS times. Statistical analysis indicates that SMAD2/3 and active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin at 3D adhesion positive areas were each separately significant in prediction of RFS, even given the limitations of the data set. We believe that future studies using larger numbers of samples and examining additional markers will result in significant protective OS outcomes, since we did observe some trends which did not reach statistical significance.</p><p><italic>Combined with the seemingly arbitrary cut-off for low vs. high (rather than above and below median which might be considered standard), this effectively leaves 3 patients with low stromal active α5β1 at 3D-adh. The authors then claim RFS benefits of about 11 months with high stromal active α5β1 at 3D-adh, but the median of those patients is about 11 months, compared with the survival of the 3 'low' patients at 10, 10 and 19 months.</italic> </p><p>Addressing the statement about seemingly arbitrary partitioning of the data used to create Kaplan-Meier curves, in the “Bioinformatics and Statistics” section of Materials and methods, we now clearly state how we use a unified CART framework that embeds recursive binary partitioning into the theory of permutation tests. As defined by our biostatistician, significance-testing procedures were applied to determine whether no significant association between any of the clinical variables and the response could be stated, or whether the recursion would need to stop. This approach is commonly used for this type of analyses by clinical biostatisticians. Median partitioning of the data was also queried in the univariate and multivariate testing we conducted, but rendered no significant results with regards to the 7 markers.</p><p><italic>In addition, despite assessing levels of α5β1 away from 3D-adh, and pFAK and pSmad, the relationship to OS or RFS is not shown or discussed, leading the reader to presume the data were negative. Far from supporting the conclusions of the</italic> in vitro <italic>work, this section raises questions as to the relevance to cancer.</italic> </p><p>In the first submission of the manuscript, these data were not significant for PDAC and hence not discussed. However, due to the much-enhanced PDAC patient cohort analyzed for this revision, some of these values are indeed now significant for prediction of OS, including notably the stromal increases in pSMAD2/3. These results are now shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and are included in the new Discussion section. Moreover, three independent SMIA-CUKIE quantitative analyses each implicated α5β1 activity and in particular its stromal localization at 3D-adhesions (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s2">Figure 13—figure supplement 2</xref>), and nowprovide a stronger support for the relevance of <italic>in vitro</italic> data to pancreatic cancer in patients. Similarly, this revision now includes all significant Kaplan-Meier curves analyzing biomarkers in RCC patients, and better supports the pathophysiological validity of the <italic>in vitro</italic> 3D stroma system.</p><p><italic>It also appears highly likely that the patient samples used in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> etc. represent a subset of pancreatic cancer patients (i.e. the ~20% that are candidates for surgical resection). Thus, they may not fully represent the patient population and some of the most aggressive forms of the disease. Some discussion of this seems appropriate.</italic> </p><p>We agree that PDAC patients that are surgical candidates typically do not have the most advanced disease, as we now clearly state in the Results and Legends to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s4">4</xref>, and comment on in the Discussion. In this context, we view it as compelling that in spite of the bias of our analytic cohorts to earlier stage patients, differences in OS and/or RFS were evident correlating with some of the markers we analyzed.</p><p><italic>3) The TGF-β experiments described starting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are interesting and insightful but also raise a number of important questions that are not adequately addressed or discussed in the manuscript in its current form. For instance, what is really changing when TGF-β signaling is blocked? Are the activated myofibroblasts in general reverting to a more phenotypically quiescent state, is ECM secretion changing resulting in fundamentally different ECM composition, are the CAFs simply less contractile or polarized etc.? While this reviewer fully understands that each of these factors cannot be examined in detail in the current work, a more encompassing discussion of these potential shifts would improve the manuscript. Likewise, if data exists from evaluating these cultures over time it would strengthen the manuscript. Further, the data suggests that the differential influence of the N v D ECM is largely due to the differences in ECM alignment. Can a case be made that this is the dominant factor or one of the critical factors?</italic> </p><p>We agree that the mechanism of TGFbeta regulation is important. Given the constraints of fitting additional information into an already very long manuscript, we have now included a new paragraph in the Discussion providing context from recent studies addressing a proposed positive feedback loop between TGFbeta accessibility and regulation of myofibroblastic activation during chronic fibrosis (and desmoplasia). The Discussion includes examples in which this signaling has been directly associated to anisotropic ECM production as well as ECM alignment features being independently indicative of deteriorating patient outcomes (e.g., publications by Klingberg (JCB, 2014), Achterberg (J Invest Dermatol, 2014), Conklin (AJP, 2011) and Bredfeldt (J Pathol Inform., 2014). Our data does not allow us to make definitive statements about changes of protein composition of ECMs arising from TGFbeta inhibition, although we do state that induction of collagen I and the differential spliced form of fibronectin are known traits of desmoplasia.</p><p><italic>4) How effective are the employed antibodies at reducing integrin activity in each instance? The consistently intermediate (trending yet non-significant) levels of SMA following inhibition of alpha5-beta1 are a bit perplexing and generate some concern the that inhibition is simply weak. As such the CRISPR data is appreciated, however it would appear to be much more insightful to also have an approach to knockdown alpha5-beta1 levels.</italic> </p><p>A) We thank the reviewers for this comment, as it resulted in a significant change to the study (see below comments about newly generated mutant fibroblasts). Regarding the specificity of the functional antibodies: these antibodies are broadly used and very well accepted in the field. We now state this fact and cite references to the work that defined the functional properties of these valuable reagents.</p><p>B) In spite of the specificity of the reagents, we now also clearly acknowledge at multiple places in the text the fact that inhibition using antibodies is transient, while genetic ablation negates receptor expression, which may be impact alternative functions, making the two types of assay non-equivalent. For example, the revised text now includes a statement that gross expression of several of the integrins analyzed is needed for naïve-to-myofibroblastic activation in response to D-ECM, while α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity, regulated by α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin, opposes D-ECM stimulation of this transition.</p><p>C) We acknowledge the reviewer’s point regarding the intermediate levels of α-SMA, but we do not believe that the reason for α-SMA levels being less affected than its F-actin localization are due to antibodies presenting a weak inhibitory effect. Rather, we believe that signaling between alphavbeta5 and alpha5beta1 is important for maintaining α-SMA at stress fibers, but not for its expression, in naïve cells responding to D-ECM, while levels of α-SMA expression instead depend on TGFbeta signaling, and that the intermediate levels we see reflect the complexity of the signaling stimuli. This fact is generally supported by the findings that alphaSMA mRNA levels are unaffected by overnight D-ECM incubation of naïve fibroblasts while high levels of α-SMA expression are necessary in CAFs producing D-ECMs. The revised Discussion section now also cites work related to the complexity of control of α SMA: for instance, evidence that α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-positive elongated ‘super mature’ adhesion structures, known to control tension-dependent recruitment of αSMA to stress fibers while not affecting protein levels, play important functional roles in myofibroblasts.</p><p>D) We agree with the reviewers asking for knockout (CRISPR) inclusion of alpha5 fibroblasts (both in naïve fibroblastic stellate cells and in CAFs). Indeed, we now include not only these mutants, but also mutants for alphav as well as beta3 integrins, in both normal fibroblasts and CAFs. Extensive data comparing these new models are presented in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>. Some of the added text emphasizes the fact that results using mutants recapitulated results using inhibitors, while others highlight specific differences, providing improved mechanistic detail to the study.</p><p><italic>5) Currently, very little mechanistic insight is provided into the underlying mechanism of altered integrin traffic. While defining the exact mechanism of how a5v5 inhibition drives increased a5b1 localization to 3D adhesion is probably too much to ask a few obvious things could be done. i) Given the high level of expertise in imaging demonstrated in the manuscript the authors should be able to describe the intracellular localization of the active a5b1 with more accuracy (are these early endosomes, recycling endosomes…). ii) There is a wealth of literature in cancer cells showing that inhibition of avb3 integrin with osteopontin, cilengitide or cRGD drives a5b1 recycling from intracellular endosomes to the membrane. Could a similar mechanism be involved in the ALULA-driven increase of a5b1 in 3D adhesions? This should be at least discussed.</italic> </p><p>A) We have added a new section to the revised manuscript to analyze the intracellular location(s) of alpha5beta1 integrin. This analysis indicated accumulation of this activated integrin in late endosomes (Rab7- and Rab11-positive) and multivesicular (CD81-positive) endosomes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), but not early endosome positive for AAE1 and Rab5. In addition, in new electron microscopy images using the same experimental conditions, we utilized double immunogold to detect 3D-adhesion locations versus active alpha5beta1 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis indicates the intracellular integrin activity induced by D-ECM by naïve fibroblastic cells does not correspond to clatherin coated generated endosomes, and that multivesicular endosomes positive with this integrin are lost upon beta5integrin ablation.</p><p>B) We thank the reviewers for bringing to our attention previous work showing integrin regulation in receptor recycling. We have now cited relevant literature, and included a statement to the fact that integrin binding ligands such as soluble RGD, osteopontin and cilengitide have been shown to induce integrin crosstalk between α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> resulting in the association of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> with Rab-coupling protein, which regulates its localization concomitant with EGFR. Besides citing the work that provided this data, we mention the possibility that the use of antibodies to inhibit avb5 integrin activity in this study may have triggered activation of the Rab cellular trafficking machinery, which is otherwise restricted by α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub> activity during tumor-associated desmoplasia, which could explain the observed accumulation of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> to late endosomes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
