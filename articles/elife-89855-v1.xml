this phenomenon remain poorly studied. Using a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) system, we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, by revealing that they can do both in sequence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most plants are anchored to the soil by roots and need to be able to defend themselves from insects and other animal pests while remaining stationary. One way plants achieve this is to emit chemicals known as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) into the air when they are under attack to attract other animals that are natural enemies of the pest.</p><p>Certain HIPVs also prime other nearby plants (known as ‘receivers’) to be ready for an attack, or even pre-emptively activate defense responses in the plant before they encounter the pest. However, it remains unclear how the temporal patterns of HIPVs emitted from attacked plants affect how receiver plants respond to these chemicals, and how day-to-night light fluctuations impact this transfer of chemical information.</p><p>To investigate this question, Waterman et al. exposed maize plants to a common pest caterpillar called <italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic>. Individual infested maize plants (referred to as ‘senders’) were placed in transparent glass chambers that were linked by a narrow tube to a second glass chamber containing a receiver plant that had not encountered caterpillars. The team used a mass spectrometry approach to measure the HIPVs emitted by the sender plants and the responses of the receivers in real-time.</p><p>The experiments found that within the first few hours of exposure to HIPVs, receiver plants had a small burst of defense activity that was followed by a far stronger burst several hours later. The second burst coincided with the accumulation of plant hormones called jasmonates in the receiver plants, and was not controlled by fluctuations in light levels. This suggests that HIPVs first prime and then subsequently induce defense responses in other plants in a manner that is independent of the patterns of day and night.</p><p>In the future, these findings may be used to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of pest outbreaks in crop fields. They will also help us to better understand how plants communicate and the impact of this communication on their environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>defense priming</kwd><kwd>herbivory</kwd><kwd>plant defense</kwd><kwd>plant-plant interactions</kwd><kwd>volatile organic compounds</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Zea mays</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>210651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waterman</surname><given-names>Jamie Mitchel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007352</institution-id><institution>Staatssekretariat für Bildung, Forschung und Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project CANWAS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>886651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009068</institution-id><institution>University of Bern</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waterman</surname><given-names>Jamie Mitchel</given-names></name><name><surname>Cofer</surname><given-names>Tristan Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Real-time volatile emission kinetics reveal stress volatiles emitted from herbivore-damaged plants can sequentially prime and induce defense responses in undamaged plants following distinct temporal patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants rely on chemical cues to identify and mount appropriate responses to herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Waterman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escobar-Bravo et al., 2023</xref>). Among these cues are herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meents and Mithöfer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karban, 2021</xref>). When perceived by undamaged plants, HIPVs can enhance plant defenses, and thus increase plant resistance to future herbivory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalske et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelberth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vázquez-González et al., 2023</xref>).

HIPVs can also prime plant defenses. In this case, HIPV-exposed plants respond more strongly and/or more rapidly to a secondary stimulus such as herbivore attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelberth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mauch-Mani et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Plant responses to environmental cues depend on temporal patterns. For example, artificial herbivory that mimics spatiotemporal patterns of chewing herbivores induces more a similar response to actual herbivore attack than when spatiotemporal patterns are ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mithöfer et al., 2005</xref>). The emission of HIPVs also follows discrete temporal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 2017</xref>), which, again, is likely to influence defense responses in receiver plants. Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate (HAC), (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenal, and (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexen-1-ol, are catabolic products of the lipoxygenase/hydroperoxide lyase pathway and are emitted within minutes following damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Auria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matsui, 2006</xref>). Indole and terpenes are emitted within hours of herbivore attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escobar-Bravo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erb et al., 2015</xref>). Indole can mediate interactions between plants as well as between plants and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ye et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ye et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Veyrat et al., 2016</xref>). Terpenes are a very diverse group of volatiles (&gt;80,000 known structures) that are also important as both direct and indirect plant defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalske et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou and Pichersky, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Riedlmeier et al., 2017</xref>). Indole and terpenes take longer to produce in comparison to GLVs and are less transiently emitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escobar-Bravo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Auria et al., 2007</xref>). In maize, GLVs have been implicated in direct induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelberth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2023</xref>), and both GLVs and indole are known to prime defenses, and are thus considered as ‘bioactive’ in information transfer between plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although it is clear that plants can either be primed or directly induced following HIPV exposure, if and how these two phenomena integrate in the context of a natural HIPV exposure sequence is unclear. Studies have yet to monitor induction and priming dynamics in real time and during continuous exposure to HIPVs. It is possible that, through time, continuous HIPV exposure may result in a self-enforced positive feedback loop, whereby priming enhances induction and induction serves as a priming event for subsequent induction. Further, temporal trends might be complicated by dynamic environmental conditions, such as light fluctuations; over a 24 hr period, plants can experience both full sun and darkness. In darkness, the emission of many volatiles, especially those released via stomata, is severely hindered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seidl-Adams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bläsing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In order to understand the kinetics of information transfer between plants and the importance of dynamic temporal emission patterns, we monitored the emission kinetics of terpenes as a marker of defense activation in maize plants that were exposed to HIPVs. We leveraged a highly temporally resolved volatile multiplexing system that allowed us to track continuous volatile emissions in sender and receiver plants for the first time in real time. We further measured foliar terpene pools, stress hormones, and defense gene expression in receiver plants, and determined the impact of day:night light transitions in the observed defense induction kinetics. Finally, we measured defenses upon sequences of short-term HIPV and GLV exposure to unravel the relative importance of direct induction and priming. Together, our experiments reveal how the natural kinetics of herbivore attack result in a clocked defense response in neighboring plants via volatile information transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Delayed burst in induced volatile emissions in plants exposed to volatiles of a herbivore-attacked neighbor</title><p>When maize plants are exposed to volatiles from herbivore-attacked neighbors, they start to release terpenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ruther and Fürstenau, 2005</xref>). To understand the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon, we conducted a detailed time-course analysis of terpene release by receiver plants exposed to volatiles from sender plants under attack by <italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic> caterpillars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Herbivore feeding began around 12:00 and within 3 hr, we detected a small induction of sesquiterpenes [C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>25</sub><sup>+</sup>, m/z=205.20], monoterpenes [C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>17</sub><sup>+</sup>, m/z=137.13], 4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) [C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>19</sub><sup>+</sup>, m/z=151.15], and 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT) [C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>27</sub><sup>+</sup>, m/z=219.21] in undamaged receiver plants. Volatile emission was severely impaired during the night, regardless of treatment. Interestingly, as soon as the light was restored, we observed a strong burst of terpene release from receiver plants, which was two to five times higher than the release the day before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, exposure to volatiles from a herbivore-attacked plant triggers a delayed burst in terpene emission in neighboring plants.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Delayed burst in induced volatile emissions in plants exposed to volatiles of a herbivore-attacked neighbor.</title><p>Emission kinetics of herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV)-induced terpenes in undamaged receiver plants are shown.

During the night, plants close their stomata to limit water loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caird et al., 2007</xref>), which may also impair terpene release, thus leading to an accumulation of terpenes in the leaves and a burst once stomata open again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seidl-Adams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loughrin et al., 1994</xref>). To determine if terpenes accumulate above daytime levels in maize leaves of HIPV-exposed plants during the night, we measured internal foliar pools of the sesquiterpenes, β-caryophyllene, β-farnesene, and α-bergamotene, as well as the homoterpene, TMTT, over time. Internal pools of β-caryophyllene, β-farnesene, and TMTT were marginally induced after 3 hr, but only became significantly induced after 8 hr of exposure to HIPVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B, and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For all three, accumulation remained higher during the night (16.75 hr) as well as the following day. α-Bergamotene only began accumulating in leaves on the second day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, internal terpene pools remain comparable between night and day, suggesting that terpenes do not continue accumulating during the night and that, even when terpenes are emitted in large amounts on day 2, internal pools do not drop below nighttime levels. Nevertheless, the volatiles that are present during the night may be released suddenly the second day. Some control plants accumulated measurable amounts of β-caryophyllene at night, likely due to biological and experimental variation. This type of variation was not visible in total sesquiterpene emissions measured by proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), likely because β-caryophyllene is a minor sesquiterpene in B73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Block et al., 2018</xref>) and closed stomata block sesquiterpene emission at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seidl-Adams et al., 2015</xref>). To get insight into terpene biosynthesis we measured the expression of terpene synthases in receiver plants. In maize, farnesene pyrophosphate synthase 3 (FPPS3), terpene synthase 2 and 10 (TPS2 and TPS10, respectively), as well as dimethylnonatriene/trimethyltetradecatetraene synthase (CYP92C5) are rate limiting for terpene production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Richter et al., 2016</xref>). All genes were induced by HIPV exposure during daytime, but not during the night. FPPS3 was slightly induced after 3 hr and significantly induced after 8 hr of HIPV exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). TPS2 was slightly induced 3, 8, and 22 hr after the onset of HIPV exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). TPS10 was significantly induced after 3 and 22 hr of HIPV exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

We focused our analysis on GLVs and indole, which are known to induce and/or prime volatile release in neighboring maize plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelberth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ruther and Fürstenau, 2005</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we exposed receiver plants to volatiles from control plants or volatiles from herbivory-induced plants for 1.25 hr. We then disconnected the receiver plants and exposed them to clean air for 17 hr, until the beginning of the next day. Half of the plants were then exposed to HAC as a secondary trigger. HAC was selected as an inducer as it showed the strongest correlation with all measured terpenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Following the short exposure to HIPVs, we detected a generally small, but significant, induction of sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, DMNT, and TMTT emissions in receiver plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). During the night, no differences between treatments were detected any more. At the beginning of the next day, we found a slight induction in terpene emissions, most apparent for sesquiterpenes and TMTT, in plants that had been exposed to herbivory-induced volatiles 18 hr prior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). HAC exposure at the beginning of the next day also induced terpene emissions. Furthermore, HAC induced a stronger release of all terpenes in plants that had been exposed to HIPVs the previous day. In an independent experiment, we also tested whether HAC sensitivity per se may be higher at the start of the light period. We exposed maize seedlings to HAC dispensers either 30 min or 4 hr 30 min after lights came on. We found induction in terpene emission to be similar regardless of when induction began (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, exposure to HIPVs prompts maize plants to release more terpenes the next day and also primes maize plants to respond more strongly to a secondary HIPV trigger. Together, these two phenomena result in a pronounced terpene burst.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Aligned rank transformed nonparametric factorial repeated measures ANOVA results from data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</title><p>Bold values: p&lt;0.05 and underlined values: p&lt;0.1.

However, the kinetics and temporal dynamics of this information transfer remain poorly understood. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, upon continuous exposure to HIPVs, receiver plants show a pronounced activation of defenses at the onset of the second day. We find that this is the result of volatile-mediated priming on the first day that yields a clocked response to the volatiles that are perceived the next day. Here, we discuss the mechanisms and biological implications of this phenomenon.</p><p>Plants are well known to respond to herbivore-induced volatiles by increasing their own defenses. Defense activation can happen directly, with plants increasing their defense hormone production and volatile release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelberth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2023</xref>), and/or via priming effects, with plants increasing their defenses more strongly upon a secondary stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we show that these two phenomena operate together to trigger strong defense activation in receiver plants with predictable temporal kinetics. So far, studies in maize and other plants showing priming effects have often exposed receiver plants to HIPVs for several hours, overnight, or even for multiple days, and induced them, e.g., by simulated herbivory, on the following day in the absence of HIPVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelberth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paudel Timilsena et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, such a setup would reveal clear priming, with minor or no direct induction by the volatile treatment. Our findings demonstrate that more natural continuous exposure to volatiles results in the same pattern without the need for another stimulus. We thus conclude that HIPVs are sufficient to trigger robust, clocked defense activation in neighboring plants.</p><p>What is the mechanism that results in a strong activation of defenses on the onset of the second day of exposure to HIPVs? In maize, GLVs directly induce and prime jasmonate production and terpene release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelberth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Indole can prime, but not directly induce these two responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erb et al., 2015</xref>). GLVs and indole again can interact to increase defense priming upon a secondary stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Given these considerations, together with the observed volatile release, response kinetics, and our manipulative experiments, we can draw up the following scenario: On day 1, maize plants are exposed to GLVs, which trigger a small burst of terpene release in receiver plants. At the same time, receiver plants are primed to respond more strongly on the next day, once light is restored. At the onset of the second day, four things happen simultaneously. First, the emission of GLVs from the neighboring plants increases. Second, the defense priming mechanism responding to these cues kicks into gear. Third, terpene production is activated. Fourth, stomata open and enable volatile emission. Together, these elements result in a strong terpene burst. The orchestration of these elements is noteworthy and results in a predictable response pattern under variable HIPV exposure. Further experiments will reveal whether similar patterns are observed in other plants, and how they may operate on a mechanistic level. Additionally, considering we observed an induction in jasmonates coinciding with terpene bursts it is likely that non-volatile jasmonate-dependent defenses follow similar temporal patterns. Our experiments reveal the importance of tracking plant defense responses in real time as they perceive the dynamic natural volatile blend of herbivore-attacked neighbors.</p><p>What is the ecological relevance of the clocked temporal kinetics of defense activation in neighboring plants? We propose several hypotheses. First, responding most strongly to volatile cues on the second day may avoid unnecessary energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Waterman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mithöfer et al., 2005</xref>). GLVs are emitted upon both herbivore attack and mechanical damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gardiner et al., 2016</xref>). However, when damage is not sustained, GLVs will dissipate rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Auria et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, responding most strongly to repeated GLV exposure could avoid false negatives and allow plants to respond more robustly to the presence of actual herbivory. Second, sending out volatiles on the second day may maximize indirect defenses. Attracting natural enemies too early to herbivore-free plants could have fitness costs for both the plant and herbivore natural enemies. Responding on the second day could be advantageous, as by this time, the natural enemies would have located and interacted with the herbivores on sender plants, and would thus be ready to move over to the next plant in anticipation of herbivore arrival. As fitness outcomes are likely highly nuanced, especially considering HIPVs also attract herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zu et al., 2020</xref>), investigation into information transfer on the multi-plant scale, namely in the context of multi-trophic interactions, will be critical. Considerable work will be needed to understand whether the observed defense activation pattern has any adaptive benefit.</p><p>Airborne information transfer has the potential to play a major role in plant communities, as it functions as a signaling viaduct between plants not physically connected to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karban, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wenig et al., 2019</xref>). Although it has been established for decades that plants transmit airborne chemical information between individuals, we are only scratching the surface of the dynamic nature of this phenomenon. The kinetics of information transfer at the detailed temporal resolution of this study provide some insights regarding how HIPVs act across time and space. On this basis, a more comprehensive understanding of volatile-mediated information transfer between plants can be built.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant and insect growth</title><p>V2-stage <italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize, B73) was used throughout this study. At this stage, maize has four leaves: two are fully developed, one is expanding and one is emerging. Maize plants were grown in commercial potting soil (Selmaterra, BiglerSamen, Switzerland) in 180 ml pots. Plants were grown in a greenhouse supplemented with artificial lights (ca. 300 µmol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). Between light and dark phases, plants were supplemented with lower light (ca. 60 µmol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) for 15 min to more accurately simulate day:night transitions. The greenhouse was maintained at 22 ± 2°C, 40–60% relative humidity, with a 14 hr:10 hr, light:dark cycle. <italic>S. exigua</italic> (Frontier Agricultural Sciences, USA) were reared from eggs on artificial diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maag et al., 2014</xref>) and used for experiments when they reached the fourth instar stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Herbivore treatment and experimental setup</title><p>The herbivore treatment consisted of adding 3 fourth instar larvae onto plants (sender plants). For controls, sender plants were left undamaged. Two principal experimental setups were used to determine the kinetics of HIPV emissions in both sender plants (damaged by herbivores) and receiver plants (exposed to HIPVs from sender plants).</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Setup 1</title><p>Single plants (senders) in transparent glass chambers (Ø×H 12×45 cm) were connected with PTFE tubing to a second transparent glass chamber that was either left empty or filled with a second plant (receiver). Chambers were sealed other than an airflow inlet on the first chamber and an air outlet on the second chamber, allowing HIPVs from sender plants to pass through the second chamber. Cumulative HIPV emissions from senders and receivers were measured as described in the section ‘Volatile sampling’. In order to determine emissions from receiver plants alone, HIPV emissions from sender plants connected to an empty chamber were subtracted from sender plants connected to receiver plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup schemes for volatile profiling.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89855-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Setup 2</title><p>To isolate emissions solely from receiver plants, chambers containing sender and receiver plants were initially kept separate for basal HIPV emission profiling. Chambers were then connected as in setup 1 for 30 min before herbivore treatment. After herbivores were added to sender plants, chambers remained connected for 1.25 hr, after which time sender and receiver plants were once again disconnected and rearranged so that receiver plants had both clean air flowing through the inlet and an outlet for volatile collection and profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Preparation of HAC dispensers</title><p>HAC dispensers were prepared as previously described with modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). In brief, 1.5 ml glass vials (Ø×H 11.6×32 mm) containing ca. 100 mg glass wool were filled with 200 µl HAC (&gt;98%; Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) diluted 50-fold in EtOH and sealed with screw caps containing a rubber septum. The caps were pierced with a 1 µl glass capillary and sealed with PTFE tape. Vials were then covered with aluminum foil and equilibrated for at least 5 days before use. The (<italic>Z</italic>)-3 isomers of all GLVs measured in this study (hexenyl acetate, hexenal, and hexen-1-ol) are known to be bioactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelberth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matsui et al., 2012</xref>) and interconvertible, with hexenal and hexenyl acetate for instance being transformed into hexen-1-ol. As such, we designed the dispensers to emit a molar concentration of HAC comparable to the molar concentration of all (<italic>Z</italic>)-3 GLVs emitted by herbivore-infested plants. HAC dispensers emitted HAC at a rate of 4.68 (±0.40 SD) nmol hr<sup>–1</sup> and maize seedlings infested with 3 fourth instar <italic>S. exigua</italic> larvae emitted all GLVs at a rate of 1.94 nmol hr<sup>–1</sup> (±0.25 SD). Of note, GLV emissions induced by caterpillars vary over time, and can be more than twofold higher than the average during times of strong active feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the release rate of the dispensers is within the plant’s physiological range.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Volatile sampling</title><p>Volatile emissions were sampled using setups 1 and 2. Volatile profiling was measured with a high-throughput platform comprised of a PTR-ToF-MS (Tofwerk, Switzerland) and an automated headspace sampling system (Abon Life Sciences, Switzerland) supplied with clean airflow (0.8 l min<sup>–1</sup>). An outlet on receiver plants was accessible to the autosampler/PTR-ToF-MS system. The PTR-ToF-MS system drew air at 0.1 l min<sup>–1</sup>. Between samples, a zero gas measurement was performed for 3 s to avoid contamination. At each time point volatiles were continuously measured for 15–25 s and averaged to a single mean per sample. Complete mass spectra (0–500 m/z) were recorded in positive mode at ca. 10 Hz. The PTR was operated at 100°C and an E/N of approximately 120 Td. The volatile data extraction and processing were conducted using Tofware software package v3.2.2 (Tofwerk, Switzerland). Protonated compounds were identified based on their molecular weight+1. During volatile collection LED lights (DYNA, heliospectra) were placed ca. 80 cm above the glass cylinders and provided light at ca. 300 μmol m<sup>–2</sup> s <sup>–1</sup>. Identical light:dark cycle timing as in the greenhouse for plant growth was used. In order to quantify GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested plants and HAC dispensers, we collected total volatile emissions for 1 hr using an identical volatile collection and analysis method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erb et al., 2015</xref>. In brief, volatiles were collected in Super-Q adsorbent traps, which were then eluted in dichloromethane and injected into a GC-MS (Agilent, USA). Compound identities were confirmed with mass spectroscopy analysis and similarity to library matches (NIST search 2.2 Mass Spectral Library, USA). Emission rates of the Z-3 isomers of GLVs were quantified using a standard curve with synthetic compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Foliar terpene pools and gene expression</title><p>Setup 1 was used to determine terpene pools and gene expression. After 3, 8, 16.75, and 22 hr of exposure to HIPVs, the oldest developing leaf of receiver plants was harvested and flash-frozen on liquid nitrogen. The oldest developing leaf was chosen as it is the largest and highly responsive to bioactive HIPVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). A new set of plants was used for each time point. Analysis of foliar terpene pools was conducted using slightly modified, previously described, methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Escobar-Bravo et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, ca. 15 mg of ground fresh frozen leaf tissue was added to a 20 ml precision thread headspace glass vial sealed with a magnetic screw cap fitted with a silicone/PTFE septum (Gertel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany). Immediately after a vial was prepared, an SPME fiber (100 μm polydimethylsiloxane coating; Supelco, USA) was inserted into the vial and volatiles were collected for 40 min at 50°C. After collection, volatiles were thermally desorbed for 3 min at 220°C and analyzed using GC-MS (Agilent, USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow-rate of 1 ml min<sup>–1</sup> with a temperature gradient of 5 °C min<sup>–1</sup> from 60°C (1 min hold) to 250°C. Compound identification was based on similarity to library matches (NIST search 2.2 Mass Spectral Library, USA). For quantification of gene expression, total RNA was extracted and purified from ca. 80 mg ground fresh frozen tissue using the GeneJET plant RNA extraction kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA was removed from 1 μg purified RNA using gDNA Eraser (PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit, Perfect Real Time) following the manufacturer’s instructions (Takara Bio Inc, Kusatsu, Japan). Reverse transcription and cDNA was synthesized using PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (TaKaRa Bio). Gene expression was determined with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using ORA SEE qPCR Mix (highQu GmbH, Germany) on an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR system. The normalized expression (NE) values were calculated as: NE=(1/(PE<sub>target</sub><sup>Cttarget</sup>))/(1/(PE<sub>reference</sub><sup>Ctreference</sup>)) where PE = primer efficiency and Ct = cycle threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alba et al., 2015</xref>).

Different volatile compound classes were measured over a period of time using PTR-ToF-MS and GC-MS, under both natural light:dark conditions, and continuous light.

Firstly, I am wondering why VOCs (as measured by GC-MS) were not quantified. While I understand that quantification is time consuming and requires more work, it allows for comparisons to be made between lines of the same species, as well as across other literature on the subject. Simply relying on the area under the curve and presenting results using arbitrary units is not enough for analyses like these. AU values do not allow for conclusions regarding total quantities, and while I understand that this is not the main focus of this paper, it raises a lot of uncertainty for readers (for example, the references cited show that TMTT has been found to accumulate at similar levels of caryophyllene, however the AU values reported are an order of magnitude higher for TMTT. Again, without actual quantification this is meaningless, but for readers it is confusing).</p><p>With regards to the correlation analyses shown in figure 6, the results presented in many of the correlation plots are not actually informative. While there is a trend, I do not think that this is an appropriate way to show the data, as there are clearly other relationships at play. The comparison between plants under continuous light and normal light:dark conditions is interesting.</p><p>This paper addresses a very interesting idea and I look forward to seeing further work that builds on these ideas.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89855.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The exact dynamics of responses to volatiles from herbivore-attacked neighbouring plants have been little studied so far. Also, we still lack evidence whether herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) induce or prime plant defences of neighbours. The authors investigated the volatile emission patterns of receiver plants that respond to the volatile emission of neighbouring sender plants which are fed upon by herbivorous caterpillars. They applied a very elegant approach (more rigorous than the current state-of-the-art) to monitor temporal response patterns of neighbouring plants to HIPVs by measuring volatile emissions of senders and receivers, senders only and receivers only. Different terpenoids were produced within 2 h of such exposure in receiver plants, but not during the dark phase. Once the light turned on again, large amounts of terpenoids were released from the receiver plants. This may indicate a delayed terpene burst, but terpenoids may also be induced by the sudden change in light. As one contrasting control, the authors also studied the time-delay in volatile emission when plants were just kept under continuous light. Here they also found a delayed terpenoid production, but this seemed to be lower compared to the plants exposed to the day-night-cycle. Another helpful control was now performed for the revision in which the herbivory treatment was started in the evening hours and lights were left on. This experiment revealed that the burst of terpenoid emission indeed shifted somewhat. Circadiane and diurnal processes must thus interact.</p><p>Interestingly, internal terpene pools of one of the leaves tested here remained more comparable between night and day, indicating that their pools stay higher in plants exposed to HIPVs. In contrast, terpene synthases were only induced during the light-phase, not in the dark-phase. Moreover, jasmonates were only significantly induced 22 h after onset of the volatile exposure and thus parallel with the burst of terpene release.</p><p>An additional experiment exposing plants to the green leaf volatile (glv) (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate revealed that plants can be primed by this glv, leading to a stronger terpene burst.

Different volatile compound classes were measured over a period of time using PTR-ToF-MS and GC-MS, under both natural light:dark conditions, and continuous light.

Firstly, I am wondering why VOCs (as measured by GC-MS) were not quantified. While I understand that quantification is time consuming and requires more work, it allows for comparisons to be made between lines of the same species, as well as across other literature on the subject. Simply relying on the area under the curve and presenting results using arbitrary units is not enough for analyses like these. AU values do not allow for conclusions regarding total quantities, and while I understand that this is not the main focus of this paper, it raises a lot of uncertainty for readers (for example, the references cited show that TMTT has been found to accumulate at similar levels of caryophyllene, however the AU values reported are an order of magnitude higher for TMTT. Again, without actual quantification this is meaningless, but for readers it is confusing).</p><p>With regards to the correlation analyses shown in figure 6, the results presented in many of the correlation plots are not actually informative. While there is a trend, I do not think that this is an appropriate way to show the data, as there are clearly other relationships at play.

The data clearly show that internal terpene pools do not accumulate above daytime levels during darkness – this is further supported by gene expression data that show downregulation of terpene synthase genes during darkness. While quantification would certainly increase the ability to compare internal pools, it would not change the interpretation of our results. Also note that absolute quantification is challenging for compounds such as TMTT, which are not readily available.</p><p>Regarding the comment on Figure 6, while we agree there may be interesting patterns beyond linear relationships, as stated in our previous response, the purpose of our analysis was to determine if the higher terpene burst in receiver plants on the second day may be explained by sender plants emitting more GLVs on the second day. Figure 6 shows that this is not the case. Further analyses would not provide additional significant insights into the hypothesis that we tested here.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their overall positive outlook on our paper and for the constructive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The exact dynamics of responses to volatiles from herbivore-attacked neighbouring plants have been little studied so far. Also, we still lack evidence whether herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) induce or prime plant defences of neighbours. The authors investigated the volatile emission patterns of receiver plants that respond to the volatile emission of neighbouring sender plants which are fed upon by herbivorous caterpillars. They applied a very elegant approach (more rigorous than the current state-of-the-art) to monitor temporal response patterns of neighbouring plants to HIPVs by measuring volatile emissions of senders and receivers, senders only and receivers only. Different terpenoids were produced within 2 h of such exposure in receiver plants, but not during the dark phase. Once the light turned on again, large amounts of terpenoids were released from the receiver plants. This may indicate a delayed terpene burst, but terpenoids may also be induced by the sudden change in light. As one contrasting control, the authors also studied the time-delay in volatile emission when plants were just kept under continuous light. Here they also found a delayed terpenoid production, but this seemed to be lower compared to the plants exposed to the day-night-cycle. Another helpful control was now performed for the revision in which the herbivory treatment was started in the evening hours and lights were left on. This experiment revealed that the burst of terpenoid emission indeed shifted somewhat. Circadiane and diurnal processes must thus interact.</p><p>Interestingly, internal terpene pools of one of the leaves tested here remained more comparable between night and day, indicating that their pools stay higher in plants exposed to HIPVs. In contrast, terpene synthases were only induced during the light-phase, not in the dark-phase. Moreover, jasmonates were only significantly induced 22 h after onset of the volatile exposure and thus parallel with the burst of terpene release.</p><p>An additional experiment exposing plants to the green leaf volatile (glv) (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate revealed that plants can be primed by this glv, leading to a stronger terpene burst. The results are discussed with nice logic and considering potential ecological consequences. All data are now well discussed.</p><p>Overall, this study provides intriguing insights in the potential interplay between priming and induction, which may co-occur, enhancing (indirect and direct) plant defence.

Measurements of volatile compound classes and gene expression in receiver plants exposed to these volatiles led to the conclusion that the delayed emission of certain terpenes in receiver plants after the onset of light may be a result of stress memory, highlighting the role of priming and induction in plant defenses triggered by herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs).

Firstly, I am wondering why VOCs (as measured by GC-MS) were not quantified. While I understand that quantification is time-consuming and requires more work, it allows for comparisons to be made between lines of the same species, as well as across other literature on the subject. As experiments with VOC dispensers were also used in this experiment, I find it even more baffling that the authors didn't confirm the concentration of the emission from the plants they used to make sure they matched. The references cited justifying the concentration used (saying it was within the range of GLVs emitted by their plants) to prepare the dispenser were for either a different variety of maize (delprim versus B73) or arabidopsis. Simply relying on the area under the curve and presenting results using arbitrary units is not enough for analyses like these.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their comment. We have now quantified both the emission of dispensers and maize seedlings infested with 3 4th-instar Spodoptera exigua larvae. Averaged across 1 h, HAC dispensers emitted roughly 2x higher molar concentrations than total GLV molar concentrations emitted by plants infested by 3 caterpillars. Of note, GLV emissions induced by caterpillars vary over time, and can be more than 2-fold higher than the average during times of strong active feeding (Supplemental Fig 4). Thus, the release rate of the dispensers is well within the plant’s physiological range.</p><p>Note that the references cited were included to support the claim of the biological activity of all three GLVs rather than to justify concentration of our dispensers. We have rephrased this sentence to reflect this (see L330-333).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regards to the correlation analyses shown in Figure 6, the results presented in many of the correlation plots are not actually informative. By blindly reporting the correlation coefficient important trends are being ignored, as there are clearly either bimodal relationships (e.g. upper left panel, HAC/TMTT, HAC/MNT) or even stranger relationships (e.g. upper left panel, IND/SQT, IND/MNT) that are not being well explained by a correlation plot. It is not appropriate to discuss the correlation factors presented here and to draw such strong conclusions on emission kinetics. The comparison between plants under continuous light and normal light:dark conditions is interesting, but I think there are better ways to examine these relationships, for example, multivariate analysis might reveal some patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their comment. With our analysis we aimed at testing specifically whether the high release of known bioactive volatiles (GLVs and indole) by sender plants on the second day can explain the higher terpene emissions in the receiver plants. We explicitly mention this in the text (L176-L186). Indeed, under normal light conditions (light and dark phase), there are clear positive correlations between the GLV release of sender plants and the terpene release of receiver plants over time (see also Fig 1 and Fig 5). However, under continuous light conditions, GLV emissions in sender plants no longer correlate with terpene emissions in receiver plants (also apparent by comparison of Fig 4 and Fig 5). This shows that temporal variation in GLV emissions are insufficient to explain the delayed terpene burst. This is the relevant conclusion we draw from this analysis. As presented, we find the data to provide strong evidence that the delayed burst in receiver plant terpene emissions cannot be solely explained by higher availability of active signals on the second day. The priming experiment in Figure 7 then provides a direct additional test for this concept. While more complex analyses could indeed reveal additional patterns, these would not be particularly informative for the question at hand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2, the elevated concentrations of beta-caryophyllene found in the control plants at 8h and 16.75h measurement timepoints are curious. Is this something that is commonly seen in B73?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment. A small number of untreated plants indeed accumulated β -caryophyllene at night, which is likely the result of biological variability between samples. Our plants were soil-grown, and it is for instance possible that variation in soil biota may account for this variability. Alternatively, some plants may have been slightly stressed during handling. Note that this variability does not affect any of the conclusions in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While there can be discrepancies between emissions and compounds actually present within leaf tissue, it is a little bit odd that such high levels of b-caryophyllene were found at these timepoints, however, this is not reflected in the PTR-ToF-MS measurements of sesquiterpenes. It would be beneficial to include an overview of the mechanism of production and storage of sesquiterpenes in maize leaves, which would clarify why high amounts were found only in the GC-MS analysis and not the PTR-ToF-MS analysis, which is a more sensitive analytical tool. It is possible that the amounts of b-caryophyllene present in the leaf are actually extremely low, however as the values are not given as a concentration but rather arbitrary units, it is not possible to tell. I would include a line explaining what is seen with b-caryophyllene.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for this comment. It is important to note that accumulation in maize leaves can differ substantially from emission, especially at night when stomata are closed. This has been observed before in maize leaves (Seidl-Adams et al., 2015). As the reviewer suspects, earlier work indeed found that β-caryophyllene is a minor sesquiterpene compared to β-farnesene and α-bergamotene in B73 ( Block et al., 2018). The PTR-ToF-MS does not discriminate between terpenes with the same m/z and thus measures total sesquiterpene emissions. Given that sesquiterpene emissions are strongly regulated by stomatal aperture and that overall sesquiterpene accumulation in control plants is low, it is not surprising that we measure only minor amounts of sesquiterpene emissions in general, and in control plants in particular. We now text to the manuscript to explain these aspects (L116-L122).Block, A.K., Hunter, C.T., Rering, C. et al. Contrasting insect attraction and herbivore-induced plant volatile production in maize.

The AU values do not allow for conclusions regarding total quantities. An earlier study found that TMTT in induced B73 plants accumulates to similar amounts as β-caryophyllene (Block et al., 2018), thus it is not surprising to detect significant TMTT pools in induced maize leaves. It is important to note that the aim of the experiment here was to test the hypothesis that plants may be hyperaccumulating volatiles when the stomata are closed at night, which could potentially explain the delayed terpene burst on the second day. We do not observe such a hyperaccumulation, thus ruling out this as the primary factor responsible for the observed phenomenon. This is further supported by the continuous light experiments, where the delayed burst in terpene emission is not hindered by the lack of a dark phase.</p><p>Block, A.K., Hunter, C.T., Rering, C. et al.

Also, we still lack evidence of whether herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) induce or prime plant defences of neighbours. The authors investigated the volatile emission patterns of receiver plants that respond to the volatile emission of neighbouring sender plants which are fed upon by herbivorous caterpillars. They applied a very elegant approach (more rigorous than the current state-of-the-art) to monitor temporal response patterns of neighbouring plants to HIPVs by measuring volatile emissions of senders and receivers, senders only and receivers only. Different terpenoids were produced within 2 h of such exposure in receiver plants, but not during the dark phase. Once the light turned on again, large amounts of terpenoids were released from the receiver plants. This may indicate a delayed terpene burst, but terpenoids may also be induced by the sudden change in light. A potential caveat exists with respect to the exact timing and the day-night cycle. The timing may be critical, i.e. at which time-point after onset of light herbivores were placed on the plants and how long the terpene emission lasted before the light was turned off. If the rhythm or a potential internal clock matters, then this information should also be highly relevant. Moreover, light on/off is a rather arbitrary treatment that is practical for experiments in the laboratory but which is not a very realistic setting. Particularly with regard to terpene emission, the sudden turning on of light instead of a smooth and continuous change to lighter conditions may trigger emission responses that are not found in nature.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their comment. Although not explicitly mentioned it in the initial draft of the MS, we employed 15 min transition periods for light and dark phase transitions with a light intensity of 60 µmol m-2 s-1 (compared to 300 µmol m-2 s-1 at full light) to achieve a more gradual transition. We now included this information in the manuscript (L291-L292).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As one contrasting control, the authors also studied the time-delay in volatile emission when plants were just kept under continuous light (just for the experiment or continuously?). Here they also found a delayed terpenoid production, but this seemed to be lower compared to the plants exposed to the day-night-cycle. Another helpful control would be to start the herbivory treatment in the evening hours and leave the light on. If then again plants only release volatiles after a 17 h delay, the response is indeed independent of the diurnal clock of the plant.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This is a very interesting point raised by the reviewer. We now conducted an additional experiment under continuous light where we started the herbivory treatment just before the start of the dark phase (ca. 20:00 PM). We found a similar pattern: a distinct delay in the highest burst. However, interestingly, the burst was shifted from 12-18 hr to 10-12 hr (Supplemental Fig 1). This burst aligned reasonably well with the point at which lights would normally be turned on again. In light of this, and, as the herbivore additions typically started ca. 5 hrs after the onset of light following a dark period (Figures 1-7), we wanted to rule out the possibility that the lack of a burst on the first day, was simply due to a difference in induction capacity depending on how shortly after the onset of light plants became exposed to GLVs. As such, we designed an additional experiment to examine whether exposure to GLVs immediately after the lights come on induce higher terpene emissions than plants exposed to GLVs ca. 5 hr after lights come on (Supplemental Fig 2). Interestingly, emissions across the terpenes were similar, regardless how long after the onset of lights on plants were exposed to GLVs. This suggests that the delayed burst is not due to the fact that, on the second day, plants are exposed to GLVs immediately after the lights come on whereas the first day they are only exposed 5 hr after the lights come on. Both continuous light experiments (normal timing and shifted timing) show bursts that occur slightly earlier than we observe with under normal day : night light conditions (L159-L166 and L207-L211), suggesting an interaction between circadian and diurnal processes. For instance, it is possible that plants would start producing volatiles slightly earlier than the onset of the day, however, light and stomatal opening limits the exact timing of the burst under normal light:dark transitions. The additional data provide further evidence for the delayed burst as a timed response in maize plants.</p><p>Additionally, we have added explanation the continuous light figure legends that plants were grown under normal conditions and lights were only left on following treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interestingly, internal terpene pools of one of the leaves tested here remained more comparable between night and day, indicating that their pools stay higher in plants exposed to HIPVs.

If then again plants only release volatiles after a 17 h delay, the response is indeed independent of the diurnal clock of the plant.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: See public review comment.
