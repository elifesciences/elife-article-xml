models. The identification of a mutant of C/EBPα (C/EBPα<sup>R35A</sup>) that greatly accelerates BMT helped to illuminate the mechanism. Thus, incoming C/EBPα binds to PU.1, an obligate partner expressed in B cells, leading to the release of PU.1 from B cell enhancers, chromatin closing and silencing of the B cell program. Released PU.1 redistributes to macrophage enhancers newly occupied by C/EBPα, causing chromatin opening and activation of macrophage genes. All these steps are accelerated by C/EBPα<sup>R35A</sup>, initiated by its increased affinity for PU.1. Wild-type C/EBPα is methylated by Carm1 at arginine 35 and the enzyme’s perturbations modulate BMT velocity as predicted from the observations with the mutant. Increasing the proportion of unmethylated C/EBPα in granulocyte/macrophage progenitors by inhibiting Carm1 biases the cell’s differentiation toward macrophages, suggesting that cell fate decision velocity and lineage directionality are closely linked processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell fate</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>blood cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>lineage choice</kwd><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030</institution-id><institution>Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SGR 006713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torcal Garcia</surname><given-names>Guillem</given-names></name><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Tian V</given-names></name><name><surname>De Andres-Aguayo</surname><given-names>Luisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Berenguer</surname><given-names>Clara</given-names></name><name><surname>Graf</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM36477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lerner</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name><name><surname>Zaret</surname><given-names>Kenneth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-109354GB-100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmona</surname><given-names>Marcos Plana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Synergy Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torcal Garcia</surname><given-names>Guillem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mutation in the lineage-determining regulator C/EBPα that increases the factor’s affinity for its partner PU.1 dramatically accelerates the velocity of B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanisms underlying cell fate decisions during differentiation and development have long been a subject of fascination among biologists. It is widely accepted that lineage-restricted transcription factors (TFs) play a crucial role in driving cell differentiation by repressing the old gene expression program while activating new ones at bifurcation points. The balance between antagonistic TFs is a key determinant of cell fate, with the more highly expressed factor silencing the opposing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graf and Enver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orkin and Zon, 2008</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms, such as how gene silencing and activation are coordinated, and whether factors other than TF levels influence cell fate decisions, are still largely unknown.</p><p>A powerful method for studying mechanisms of cell fate decisions is to induce lineage conversions through TF overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graf, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou and Melton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graf and Enver, 2009</xref>). An especially efficient system for this purpose is the C/EBPα-induced transdifferentiation of B cells into macrophages, designated here as BMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xie et al., 2004</xref> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). C/EBPα is composed of a bZip DNA-binding domain on its C-terminus and a tripartite transactivation domain on its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramberger et al., 2021b</xref>). During hematopoiesis, it is most highly expressed in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohlsson et al., 2016</xref>) and its absence inhibits the formation of GMPs, and monocytes/macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heath et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). The C/EBPα-induced BMT requires partnership with the TF PU.1, which participates in regulatory networks of both B/T cells and in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothenberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laiosa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arinobu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leddin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A mutation of arginine 35 in C/EBPα accelerates C/EBPα-induced B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation (BMT).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the BMT method using primary cells.

In its mutated or unmethylated form C/EBPα induces BMT at a dramatically increased velocity, initiated by a higher interaction affinity for its partner TF PU.1. This triggers the acceleration of chromatin accessibility changes and the redistribution of PU.1 from B- to M-GREs. The methyltransferase involved in the methylation of C/EBPa is Carm1, and it plays a role in determining the lineage directionality of GMPs.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>A mutation of C/EBPα at arginine 35 accelerates BMT</title><p>In ongoing efforts to identify mutants of C/EBPα in post-translationally modified amino acids that affect BMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we used retroviral constructs with C/EBPα fused to ER and inducible by 17ß-estradiol (E2).

The finding that the chromatin of B-GREs is more accessible in uninduced C/EBPα<sup>R35A</sup> cells suggests a leakiness of the construct and could at least in part explain this finding. However, this poised state does not result in an altered expression of associated B cell genes compared to uninduced C/EBPα<sup>WT</sup> cells.

It is based on the identification of a C/EBPα missense mutant in a single arginine (R35), located within the unstructured transactivation domain, and which is specifically targeted by the methyltransferase Carm1. As summarized in the diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, an alanine replacement of R35 or Carm1 inhibition dramatically accelerates the velocity of BMT. This is based on an increased affinity between C/EBPα and its obligate partner PU.1. The C/EBPα and PU.1 combination induces a rapid closing of B cell GREs and opening of macrophage of GREs, further accelerated by the mutant. In addition, C/EBPα is capable of redistributing PU.1 from B cell to macrophage GREs, in a process again enhanced by the mutant, resulting in the coordinated silencing of B cell genes and activation of macrophage genes.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Diagram summarizing the mechanism of C/EBPα-induced B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation (BMT) and its acceleration by the R35 mutant.</title><p>Starting with a B cell shortly after E2-induced translocation of C/EBPαER into the nucleus, the C/EBPα-induced BMT occurs in various steps, illustrated in the upper row. In a first step incoming C/EBPα is bound by Carm1 and becomes asymmetrically di-methylated on arginine 35 (1). Then, C/EBPα interacts with PU.1, bound to B cell-restricted gene regulatory elements (B-GREs) (2). This induces PU.1 release, chromatin closing at B-GREs (3) and downregulation of associated B cell genes (4). Free PU.1 (possibly in a complex with C/EBPα) relocates to macrophage-restricted GREs (M-GREs), which are also bound by C/EBPα (5) resulting in chromatin opening at M-GREs (6) and upregulation of associated macrophage genes (7). As shown in the lower row, unmethylated C/EBPα, either because it is mutated at R35 or Carm1 is inhibited, interacts with a higher affinity for PU.1 than the wild-type, leading to the acceleration of all subsequent steps. In the diagram PU.1 is represented as a green icon when acting as a B cell regulator and as a blue icon after being repurposed as a myeloid regulator. Methylated and unmethylated C/EBPα are represented by purple and red icons (their depiction ignores the fact that C/EBPα binds as homo-or heterodimers). In the model we assume that methylated and unmethylated C/EBPα have distinct but overlapping functions. However, it is possible that C/EBPα<sup>WT</sup> cells contain a mixture of methylated and unmethylated C/EBPα, and that only the unmethylated form is active and can induce BMT. We assume that the methylated form is active in other cellular contexts, such as during granulocyte specification.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83951-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our data indicate that the interaction affinity between C/EBPα and endogenous PU.1, already expressed in B cells, is rate limiting, as the observed higher affinity of mutant C/EBPα is sufficient to accelerate all subsequent BMT steps. In this scenario, C/EBPα acts as a trigger for PU.1, which serves as a ‘relay’ that couples the concomitant silencing and activation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This mechanism avoids the formation of ‘confused’ cells, such as cells that upregulate the macrophage program without silencing the B cell program or vice versa, and therefore ensures the faithful establishment of the macrophage transcriptome. It will be interesting to determine whether the structure of PU.1 changes as it is repurposed from a B cell to a macrophage regulator during BMT, and if so, whether this reflects alternative forms of PU.1, such as recently described in an in vitro study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xhani et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, we have not attempted to integrate into our model the fact that PU.1 is expressed at approximately twice the levels in macrophages than in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Relay model of B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation (BMT).</title><p>In this model we propose that PU.1 acts as a relay that coordinates the silencing of B cell-restricted and activation of macrophage-restricted genes. The relay is triggered by C/EBPα entering into the nucleus (curved arrow) where it can interact with Carm1, which in turn can modulate C/EBPα activity (for details, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). PU.1 is initially bound to B-GREs in B cells, and during BMT gets relocated to M-GREs that are co-occupied by C/EBPα. The relay velocity is tuned by the potency of incoming C/EBPα, that is, whether or not the factor is methylated. The mutually antagonistic regulation of B cell and macrophage genes enabled by this mechanism ensures the faithful generation of the macrophage phenotype and prevents the formation of stable cell states that express mixed lineage markers (‘confused cells’). Of note, the relay mechanism is unidirectional since about 24hpi B cells become irreversibly committed to macrophages, due to the upregulation of endogenous <italic>Cebpa</italic> that maintains the novel cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bussmann et al., 2009</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83951-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A mechanism similar to the C/EBPα-induced redistribution (‘theft’) of PU.1 from B- to M-GREs by an incoming TF as described here has recently been described for Gata6-induced reprogramming of ESCs into primitive endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson et al., 2022</xref>) and might also be operative during the Oct4-induced reprogramming of Sox2-expressing neural progenitors to induced pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). A theft mechanism involving PU.1 has also been reported for T cell differentiation although in this case PU.1 acts as the ‘thief’ by redirecting the Runx1 and Satb1 to novel sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hosokawa et al., 2018</xref>). Another relevant example is the sequestering of Gata3 by Tbet from Th2 genes and its relocation to Th1 genes during Th1 cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hertweck et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, TF-mediated redistribution by a theft or ‘relay’ mechanism as proposed here may be a more widespread phenomenon governing cell fate decisions during differentiation.</p><p>Arginine side chains can also be converted by peptidylarginine deiminases to citrulline residues that cannot be methylated by Carm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuthbert et al., 2004</xref>) and therefore deimination at R35 might be involved in regulating C/EBPα activity. However, against this possibility is our previous finding that R35 is methylated but not citrullinated in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramberger et al., 2021b</xref>). Another argument is the observed capacity of TP064 to accelerate BMT, as this is a highly specific inhibitor of Carm1 that blocks the substrate binding site of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakayama et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The location of arginine 35 within the IDR of C/EBPα, together with its ability to regulate the activity of the factor, raises the possibility that C/EBPαR35A generates a locally structured stretch within the IDR that acts as a substrate for PU.1.

The initial inspection of the C/EBPα DNA binding profiles at 3 hpi suggested that C/EBPα<sup>WT</sup> and C/EBPα<sup>R35A</sup> have different DNA binding preferences for B- and M-GREs. However, the observation of similar ‘preferences’ by PU.1 suggests that they reflect differences in the timing of PU.1:C/EBPα release from B-GREs and binding to M-GREs. The kinetics of chromatin accessibility changes over time at the same sites observed by ATAC-seq further supports this interpretation.</p><p>The findings described help explain how C/EBPα and PU.1 co-operate to generate macrophage-like cells from fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, while C/EBPα<sup>WT</sup> can bind to closed chromatin and induce a transition to open chromatin, the combination with PU.1 does so faster and this is even further accelerated with C/EBPα<sup>R35A</sup>, at speeds exceeding that of other pioneer TFs studied so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lerner et al., 2020</xref>). Similar to our observations of gene expression during BMT, in this system the differences between the wild-type and the mutant are much more pronounced at an early timepoint, suggesting that the chromatin changes in C/EBPα<sup>WT</sup> cells eventually catch up.</p><p>Our research has uncovered a close connection between the speed of cell fate choice and directionality during forced and normal myeloid differentiation. Such a link may also have implications for the formation of cancer cells.

However, further research is needed to determine whether the two forms of C/EBPα exhibit mutually exclusive activities or distinct but overlapping functions.</p><p>A role of TF methylation by Carm1 in cell fate directionality has also been described for muscle differentiation of satellite stem cells.

Importantly, they suggest that the balance of two forms of a single TF - one post-translationally modified and the other not - can determine the directionality of a binary cell fate decision. This finding challenges the current view that the relative levels of antagonistic lineage-instructive TFs are primarily decisive for cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Radomska et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graf and Enver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torcal Garcia and Graf, 2021</xref>).

A scientific complementary metal oxide semiconductor camera was used with a 2.3 electrons rms read noise at standard scan, a 100×, 1.49 NA oil immersion objective, and a 561 nm green laser. For imaging experiments, one frame was acquired with a 100 ms exposure time at 10 Hz to measure the intensity of fluorescence of the nuclei, and for SMT experiments, 5000 frames were acquired with an exposure of 10 ms (100 Hz).</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Two-parameter SMT analysis</title><p>Quantification and statistical analysis of SMT was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lerner et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, TIF stacks SMT movies were analyzed using MATLAB-based SLIMfast script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teves et al., 2016</xref>), a modified version of MTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sergé et al., 2008</xref>), with a maximal expected diffusion coefficient (DMax) of 3 μm<sup>2</sup>/s. The SLIMfast output.txt files were reorganized by the homemade csv converter.m MATLAB script (available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lerner et al., 2020</xref>) in.csv format for further analysis. The single molecule tracking.csv files (see previous section) were first classified by the homemade SMT_Motion_Classifier.m MATLAB script. Single molecule trajectories (or tracks) with a track duration shorter than five frames were discarded from the analysis. Motion tracks are classified by the script in different groups: tracks with α≤0.7 were considered as Confined; motion tracks with 0.7 &lt; α &lt; 1 as Brownian; and motion tracks with α ≥ 1 as Directed. In addition, the motion tracks showing a behavior similar to a levy-flight (presenting mixed Confined and Directed/Brownian behavior) were detected by the presence of a jump superior to the average jump among the track + a jump threshold of 1.5, and classified as ‘Butterfly’. Butterfly motion tracks were segmented into their corresponding Confined and Directed/Brownian sub-trajectories for posterior analysis. As an additional filtering step of confined motions (including confined segments of Butterfly tracks), we defined a jump threshold of 100 nm, to filter out motion tracks with an average frame-to-frame jump size larger than 100 nm. All scripts are publicly available.</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing</title><p>To obtain samples for the ChiP-seq experiments biological duplicates of primary B cells expressing either C/EBPα<sup>WT</sup> ER or C/EBPα<sup>R35A</sup> ER were induced for 3 hr with E2 and 100,000 cells per sample processed by ChIPmentation, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schmidl et al., 2015</xref>) (see also: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3542">https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3542</ext-link>). Three µL of anti-C/EBPa antibody (Santa Cruz sc-61 14AA) or anti-PU1 (Santa Cruz sc-352 T21) were used per immunoprecipitation. Tagmentation of immobilized C/EBPa or PU1-enriched chromatin was performed for 5 min at 37 degrees in a 25 µL transposition reaction mix. Libraries were prepared with an Illumina TruSeq ChIP Library Preparation Kit and after quality control on Bioanalyzer sequenced (1 × 50 bp) on an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument.</p><p>ChIP-seq data were processed similarly to ATAC-seq data (refer to ‘determination of differentially accessible ATAC peaksanalysis of ATAC-seq data’ section) with the following modifications: bamCoverage was used with: <monospace>--binSize</monospace> 1 <monospace>--normalizeUsing</monospace> RPKM <monospace>--effectiveGenomeSize</monospace> 215057000.

Peaks with an average of at least 20 reads, p-adjusted ≤ 0.05 and |logFC| ≥ 1 were classified as differentially occupied peaks. The same process was repeated for PU.1 peaks in the C/EBPα<sup>WT</sup> and C/EBPα<sup>R35A</sup> systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4-30"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 9 software. To calculate significance, samples from at least three biologically independent experiments were analyzed. Two biological replicates were used for RNA- and ATAC- sequencing experiments and statistics applied to the expression of a collection of genes. For samples with n≥3, values shown in the figures represent mean ± s.d. Box plots represent median with quartiles and whiskers and individual values are shown. One-way, two-way ANOVA (with the corresponding multiple comparison analyses) and Student’s t-tests were applied accordingly. p-Values appear indicated in each figure only when ≤0.05. In time course experiments, p-values of differences between conditions by two-way ANOVA are shown. In box plots, p-values of each individual timepoint as well as p-values of differences between conditions by two-way ANOVA are shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-31"><title>Newly created materials</title><p>All constructs and cell lines listed can be requested from the corresponding authors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Discussions</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Antibodies used for cell surface staining in flow cytometry experiment<italic>s</italic>.</title><p>The table lists the antibodies used for the experiments and the sources.

residue in a transcription factor, C/EBPα, can alter the dynamics of cell fate transition. The study provides one of the most striking examples of transcription factor regulation by methylation and is well-executed, with compelling evidence to support the authors' claims. These findings substantially advance our understanding of a major research question.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83951.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Belz</surname><given-names>Gabrielle T</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00rqy9422</institution-id><institution>University of Queensland</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Wysocka</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.03.510647">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.03.510647v3">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Edward Morrisey as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joanna Wysocka (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide additional quantitative evidence for C/EBPalpha and PU.1 interactions as indicated by the reviewers.</p><p>2) Address clarification points raised by each reviewer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper, from a pioneering group in the fields of molecular hematopoiesis and cell fate reprogramming, strongly establishes the ability of the S35A mutant C/EBPalpha to accelerate BMT to remarkable speed. It also clearly identifies Carm1 as the key methyltransferase responsible for the impact of Arg35 in the function of C/EBPalpha. These are already very interesting and firmly-demonstrated results. The main issue with the paper in its current form is that there is an additional claim about how the S35A mutant is interacting with PU.1 to cause these effects, and that claim is much less clearly supported. Conversion of common target sites from closed to open status, as shown in Figure 4, is not the same as relocating a partner factor to qualitatively different sites across the genome.</p><p>The paper could be published with this claim converted to a suggestion, based on the current data, or it could be published in a higher-impact form if additional data could be provided to demonstrate the relocation more directly. The authors would be more expert about the logistics of the experiment, but it seems that a direct ChIP-seq-based comparison should be feasible and powerful for the argument of the paper.</p><p>The semiquantitative analysis of S35A binding to PU.1 in vitro suggests a ~2-fold increase in binding, though this would be a stronger interpretation if the experiment were carried out under linear conditions. But if this modest difference is really the basis of the huge increase in reprogramming speed, it suggests that by 1 hr of C/EBPalpha S35A exposure, PU.1 should already have moved away from B cell sites to myeloid sites that it does not occupy in response to WT C/EBPalpha until after more than 6 hr. This would make a very exciting general point about the impact of small affinity differences on global transcription factor redistribution if results like this were found. This kinetic prediction would be interesting to build into the design of the ChIP-seq experiment because then the results could indicate whether PU.1 relocation is fast enough to be a cause of the increased potency of C/EBPalpha S35A mutant effects or just another of its impacts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have several specific suggestions for improvement:</p><p>1. In experiments with fibroblast reprogramming, it is important to show that WT and R35A C/EBPα are expressed at equivalent levels in 3T3aER-R and 3T3aER-A cell lines.</p><p>2. The description of SMT experiments could be improved. From reading the text, I was confused as to what the authors meant by 'visualizing transcription factor interaction with open and closed chromatin' – how was this defined?

Not a big fan of the 'virtual ChIPs' – why not call it for what it is, which is changes in chromatin accessibility at a different subset of regulatory elements, classified based on the C/EBPα and PU.1 binding in B-cells? Figure 4E and F are confusing and imply that C/EBPα and PU.1 binding were actually measured during reprogramming with WT and R35A C/EBPα.

This is a minor point but most of the field refers to 'cofactors' as non-DNA binding coactivators and corepressors (such as Mediator, p300/CBP, etc) recruited to specific genomic sites by TFs.

Integrating the data obtained with our dynamic ATACseq data, the new findings largely support the previously proposed PU.1 redistribution (‘theft’) model. To make the data easier to understand, we now first show the PU.1 and C/EBPa binding to distinct B cell- and macrophage- restricted GREs contained in a single genomic fragment (new Figure 5). The findings nicely visualize how PU.1 becomes redistributed from B-GREs to M-GREs, in a C/EBPa mutant-accelerated manner. We were also happy to see that a genome-wide analysis of the data again shows the accelerated redistribution of PU.1 by C/EBPaR35A (new Figure 6). Finally, the comparison of the ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data also added more mechanistic detail, such as by revealing that chromatin remodeling of lineage restricted GREs can be uncoupled from the regulation of associated genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The semiquantitative analysis of S35A binding to PU.1 in vitro suggests a ~2-fold increase in binding, though this would be a stronger interpretation if the experiment were carried out under linear conditions.

It nicely reveals PU.1 as the most significantly enriched interactor with C/EBPaR35A, showing a 3.6-fold increase in biotin labeling compared to the wild type protein (Figure 3B). This suggests that the interaction affinity between C/EBPa and its partner is rate limiting for the velocity of the transdifferentiation process, an idea that we have now incorporated into the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have several specific suggestions for improvement:</p><p>1.

The data in Figure S4C show that C/EBPaR35A exhibits a similar stability than WT protein and is expressed at 20-30% lower levels under steady-state conditions, agreeing with the observed slightly lower overall biotin labeling of mutant proteins compared to wild type in the BioID assay (Figure 3B). These findings are also in line with the comparison of the two proteins in Western blots of transfected 293T cells and infected B cells, where the two proteins show similar expression levels (Figure 7C and D). Therefore, the finding that expression of C/EBPaR35A is similar or slightly lower than that of the wild type argues against the possibility that an elevated expression level of the mutant could explain the effects observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
