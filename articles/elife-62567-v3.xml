Parallel brain pathways encode innate and learned valences of cues, but the way in which they are integrated during action-selection is not well understood. We used electron microscopy to comprehensively map with synaptic resolution all neurons downstream of all mushroom body (MB) output neurons (encoding learned valences) and characterized their patterns of interaction with lateral horn (LH) neurons (encoding innate valences) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. The connectome revealed multiple <italic>convergence neuron</italic> types that receive convergent MB and LH inputs. A subset of these receives excitatory input from positive-valence MB and LH pathways and inhibitory input from negative-valence MB pathways. We confirmed functional connectivity from LH and MB pathways and behavioral roles of two of these neurons. These neurons encode integrated odor value and bidirectionally regulate turning. Based on this, we speculate that learning could potentially skew the balance of excitation and inhibition onto these neurons and thereby modulate turning. Together, our study provides insights into the circuits that integrate learned and innate valences to modify behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>valence</kwd><kwd>learnt behavior</kwd><kwd>action selection</kwd><kwd>connectome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eschbach</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><name><surname>Fushiki</surname><given-names>Akira</given-names></name><name><surname>Winding</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Afonso</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name><name><surname>Eichler</surname><given-names>Katharina</given-names></name><name><surname>Andrade</surname><given-names>Ingrid V</given-names></name><name><surname>Cocanougher</surname><given-names>Benjamin T</given-names></name><name><surname>Valdes-Aleman</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name><name><surname>Truman</surname><given-names>James W</given-names></name><name><surname>Cardona</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name><name><surname>Zlatic</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LeaRNN 819650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eschbach</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><name><surname>Zlatic</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>205050/B/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zlatic</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><name><surname>Winding</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>205038/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardona</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>205050/C/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zlatic</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><name><surname>Winding</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>205038/A/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardona</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electron-microscopy reconstruction and experimental investigation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reveal how adaptive action emerges from the multi-level interactions between the output of the olfactory memory center and the innate olfactory pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Selecting appropriate actions in response to sensory stimuli is a major brain function. To achieve this, brains must transform complex representations of sensory stimuli into representations of valences (attractiveness or aversiveness) that can be used to drive actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pearson et al., 2014</xref>). Many sensory stimuli have innate valences, acquired through evolution: some stimuli are innately attractive and others are innately repulsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li and Liberles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reisenman et al., 2016</xref>). However, to behave adaptively in an ever-changing environment, animals are also able to learn new valences for stimuli. These learned valences can be in conflict with innate ones. For example, repeated association of an innately attractive odor with punishment (e.g. pain or illness) allows a switch from innate attraction to learned aversion of the same odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcia et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pauls et al., 2010</xref>). The innate and learned valences are thought to be encoded in distinct brain areas in both vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li and Liberles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>) and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li and Liberles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marin et al., 2002</xref>). In mammals, the olfactory projection neurons (mitral cells) send divergent projections to two parallel higher order centers, the olfactory amygdala and the piriform cortex, implicated in innate and learned behaviors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li and Liberles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Root et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, in insects the olfactory projection neurons send divergent projections to the lateral horn (LH) and the mushroom body (MB, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerber and Stocker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>]), implicated in innate and learned behaviors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li and Liberles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heimbeck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McGuire et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Turner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parnas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, two distinct olfactory structures output valence signals that can be used for an odor response, but the way in which these signals are used to produce a coherent behavioral choice is still an open question. For example, how are conflicting valence signals resolved? Do opposing drives for behavior converge and get integrated, or do they remain in competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pearson et al., 2014</xref>)?</p><p>A major obstacle to addressing these questions has been the lack of comprehensive synaptic-resolution maps of the patterns of convergence between neurons that represent innate and learned valences. Another obstacle has been the inability to causally relate specific circuit elements to their function. Here, we were able to overcome these obstacles by using the tractable genetic model system of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larva.

The MB consists of a set of parallel fiber neurons, the Kenyon cells (KCs), that sparsely encode sensory inputs coming from olfactory and other projection neurons (PNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerber and Stocker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Papadopoulou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hige et al., 2015b</xref>]) KC axons are tiled into distinct compartments by terminals of modulatory neurons, mainly dopaminergic (DANs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>]). DANs carry information about positive and negative reinforcement and provide teaching signals for memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schroll et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>). In each compartment, DANs synapse onto KCs and onto the dendrites of compartment-specific MB output neurons (MBONs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>]). In the adult, individual MBONs have been shown to promote approach or avoidance and encode positive or negative valence, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>). Pairing of an odor with a DAN has also been shown to selectively depress the conditioned-odor drive to MBONs in that compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>). Prior to learning, positive- and negative-valence MBONs are thought to receive a similar odor drive. Aversive and appetitive learning depresses the odor drive to positive- and negative-valence MBONs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>). Learned valence of stimuli is therefore thought to be encoded as a skew in the activity of the population of MBONs. However, despite recent progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scaplen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schlegel et al., 2021</xref>), the way in which the learned valence is read out by the downstream networks and used to select actions and the way in which innate and learned valences are integrated is still poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we investigate the circuit mechanisms by which innate and learned valences interact in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae to regulate turning response to odors. We determined which larval MBONs encode positive valence and repress turning and which ones encode negative valence and promote turning. We exhaustively reconstructed all neurons postsynaptic to all MBONs, as well as all LHNs in an innately attractive pathway. These reconstructions revealed the structural patterns of convergence between the brain areas that encode innate and learned valences. We found that (i) some MBONs directly synapse onto LHNs, (ii) some LHNs directly synapse onto some MBONs, and (iii) some MBONs and LHNs converge onto distinct subtypes of ‘convergence neurons (CNs)’. One CN subtype is activated by attractive odors via the LH pathway and its activation represses turning (to allow approach). These CNs also receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from MBONs that encode opposite valence. As we showed for one of these CNs, the balance of mixed MB inputs can be modified by learning to modulate odor-evoked responses and thereby turning. These CNs may therefore integrate learned and innate valences and regulate turning based on the integrated value. Our study provides mechanistic insight into how conflict between opposing valences can be resolved by a population of integrative neurons. Furthermore, the connectome of the circuits for integrating learned and innate valences in the larval brain (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://l1em.catmaid.virtualflybrain.org/?pid=1">https://l1em.catmaid.virtualflybrain.org/?pid=1</ext-link>) provides an essential basis for further modelling and functional studies of value computation and action selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Associative learning modulates turning response to odors</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are innately attracted by most volatile molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mathew et al., 2013</xref>), and repelled by a few, such as CO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gershow et al., 2012</xref>). Larvae navigate gradients of innately attractive or repulsive odors via klinotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gershow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schulze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gepner et al., 2015</xref>), by modulating turning and crawling in response to changes in odor concentration. This navigational strategy involves turning every time the animal is moving in the bad direction, and not turning or actively repressing turning, every time the animal is moving in the good direction. By doing that, the animal will, on average, keep moving in the good direction and correct its course when moving in the bad direction. In the context of navigating odor gradients, this strategy involves turning when moving toward an aversive odor source (bad direction), or when moving away from an appetitive odor source (also bad direction because it takes the animal away from the source of appetitive odor). Thus, larvae approach innately attractive odors as follows: (i) When crawling towards the attractive odor source they sense an increase in odor concentration so they repress turning (and promote crawling); (ii) when crawling away from the attractive odor source they sense a decrease in odor concentration so they promote turning (and repress crawling). They avoid innately aversive odors by doing the opposite. Associative odor learning has been shown to modify the turning response to odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schleyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paisios et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we report similar findings using optogenetic punishment. We compared groups of <italic>ca</italic>. 30 larvae that received an innately attractive odor, ethyl acetate (volume dilution of 10<sup>4</sup> fold in water) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gershow et al., 2012</xref>), paired with the activation of the nociceptive Basin interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>) to larvae that received unpaired presentation of the two stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>). As expected, we found that after the innately attractive odor was paired with optogenetic punishment, on average, larvae no longer approached it, and instead avoided it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). To account for this behavioral change, we computed a navigation index as the overall distance crawled in the direction up the stimulus gradient divided by the total distance crawled. Following unpaired odor presentation this index reached +0.1, that is similar to previous studies looking at naive larvae navigating toward ethyl acetate, at this dilution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gershow et al., 2012</xref>). Following odor presentation paired with Basin activation, the index reached –0.1, that is similar to larvae navigating away from CO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gershow et al., 2012</xref>). This involved a change in the coupling between odor intensity change and turn probability: the paired group turned more when crawling up the odor gradient, than down the odor gradient, whereas the unpaired group larvae did the opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

Based on studies in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>), we hypothesized that some MBONs encode positive valence, while others encode negative valence. Since positive valence neurons are activated by attractive odors, an increase in their activity is expected to have the same effect on behavior as an increase in the concentration of an attractive odor (see above). Conversely, negative valence neurons are activated by aversive odors, so an increase in their activity is expected to have the same effect on behavior as an increase in the concentration of an aversive odor (see above). A neuron whose activation signals positive valence is therefore expected to suppress turning in response to an increase in its activity, and promote turning in response to a decrease in its activity.

Thus, while all positive-valence MBONs repressed turning when activated they differed in terms of their effect on speed and in terms of the response to a decrease in their activity.

If these neurons were activated by an increase in odor concentration (as would occur when the animal is crawling towards an odor source) they would promote turning which would result in odor avoidance. Notably, different negative-valence MBONs have different effects on the duration of the turn response: the response to some MBONs adapts more quickly with turning increased only shortly after the activation onset (e.g. MBONh1/h2, MBON-i1), while others induce a more sustained turn increase that lasts the duration (whole 15 s) of the light exposure (e.g. MBON-a2, MBON-k1). Some of these MBONs (-h1/h2 and -i1) also promoted crawling in response to a decrease in their activity. Thus, while all negative-valence MBONs promote turning when activated, they differ in terms of the offset response and the duration of the turning response. This suggests that the MB could potentially allow different types of aversive memories to be differentially expressed (with varying durations of turns, speeds of crawling or efficacies of navigational strategies).</p><p>In our experiments we observed a turn response to the red light used for optogenetic activation in control animals. We wanted to rule out the possibility that MBONs only modulate the light-evoke startle and confirm they could modulate turning even in the absence of a light-evoked turn. For a subset of positive- and negative-valence MBONs, we therefore repeated the optogenetic manipulation experiments in a different way, by constantly exposing larvae to dim blue light of constant intensity and bright red light (for CsChrimson activation) of randomly varying intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a-c</xref>). Under these conditions, control larvae habituated to light and did not show light-induced startle responses.

Also, for negative-valence MBONs, the greater the change in light intensity during a turn, the higher the probability of rejecting that direction and performing another turn. Conversely, for positive-valence MBONs, the greater the change in light intensity during a turn, the higher the probability of accepting that turn direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a and c</xref>). This indicates that activity in MBONs impacts multiple behavioral components involved in avoidance or approach of a sensory stimulus in a way that is consistent with their valence.</p><p>We found that most positive-valence MBONs innervate compartments implicated in aversive memory formation and receive synaptic input from DANs whose activation (paired with odor) induces aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f , and h</xref>).

We therefore combined the behavioral effects of MBON activation with this information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). We noted lateral inhibition between some MBONs that promote opposite behaviors: 6 instances of an avoidance-promoting MBON projecting inhibitory synapses (i.e. GABAergic or glutamatergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>]) onto an approach-promoting MBON, and hree instances of an approach-promoting MBON projecting inhibitory synapses onto an avoidance-promoting MBON.</p><p>We postulate that for these neurons disinhibition could enhance the contrast in odor drive to approach- and avoidance-promoting MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>).

Such disinhibition has been shown following aversive learning in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Owald et al., 2015</xref>). In the larva, we find that several approach- and avoidance-promoting MBONs are targets of lateral inhibition by MBONs of opposite valence, suggesting that existence of lateral inhibition between some MBONs that promote opposite actions may be a general principle of MB organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h and i</xref>). However, considering that this motif is not present between all MBONs driving approach or avoidance, additional mechanisms would be needed to account for a switch between approach and avoidance.

ORN42a and ORN42b synapse onto PN42a and PN42b, which bifurcate, sending projections to both the MB and the LH. While all of the olfactory PNs and KCs were recently reconstructed in an EM volume of a larval nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berck et al., 2016</xref>), the neurons downstream of PN42a and PN42b, other than KCs, were previously unknown. We therefore reconstructed all neurons downstream of PN42a and PN42b in the same EM volume and identified 22 pairs of LHNs (LHNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Second, we wanted to confirm that the reconstructed LHN pathway is sufficient to mediate innate olfactory behavior and that it encodes positive innate valence (i.e. that its activation represses turning). Since we do not yet have suitable GAL4 lines to selectively target these LHNs, we selectively activated this LHN pathway indirectly, by activating the upstream ORN42b, while at the same time inactivating the MB pathway. Since PN42b axons synapse only onto KCs and onto these LHNs, when KCs are inactivated, the only pathway downstream of ORN42b that can support behavior is the LHN pathway. We therefore compared turning response to optogenetic activation of ORN42b in larvae with silenced (using the potassium channel Kir2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baines et al., 2001</xref>]) or intact KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). In both groups, we observed a comparable and significant decrease in turning in response to an increase in ORN42b activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>).

This suggests that the MB contributes to some aspects of the innate odor response, specifically to turning following a decrease in odor concentration (as would occur when the animal is crawling away from an innately attractive odor source). Consistent with this idea, navigation in a gradient of ethyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) was less efficient when KCs were silenced.

Most LHNs that receive direct MBON input also receive reliable input from other LHNs, and some MBONs (e.g. MBON-m1) that receive direct LHN input also receive reliable input from other MBONs, and are therefore also CNs (LHN-CNs and MBON-CNs), but we continue to call them LHNs and MBONs for brevity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

Because we have not yet generated GAL4 lines for targeting LHNs in the larva, we could not determine their neurotransmitter identity. Some CNs receive a significant fraction of input (more than 5%) from inhibitory positive-valence MBONs and others from inhibitory negative-valence MBONs, suggesting their activation potentially encodes negative and positive valence, respectively. A prominent CN subtype receives input both from excitatory positive-valence MBONs and inhibitory negative-valence MBONs (N = 10). Activating the candidatepositive valence CNs could potentially suppress turning like the MBONs that excite them.

To do this, we needed the ability to selectively target GCaMP expression to these neurons. We have not yet generated Split-GAL4 lines for most of the newly identified CNs and LHNs, but we have generated Split-GAL4 lines for many MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore focus our initial investigation on the CN-MBON-m1 that integrates direct synaptic inputs from LHNs downstream of ORN42b PNs, from KCs, and from other MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Specifically, MBON-m1 receives cholinergic (excitatory) input from positive-valence MBON-e1 that repress turning and GABAergic (inhibitory) and glutamatergic (likely inhibitory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>]) input from negative-valence MBONs that promote turning (MBON-h1, MBON-h2, MBON-i1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

Unfortunately, the LH neurons being a more diverse cell population than the KCs, no driver lines exist that target the LH neurons as a population. Instead, we optogenetically directly activated the KCs, thus bypassing the LH (using GMR14H06-LexA line to drive CsChrimson) and imaged calcium transients in MBON-m1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). We did this in untrained individuals. Optogenetic activation of KCs evoked diverse responses in MBON-m1, from inhibitory to excitatory or no response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref>). We note that a natural odor is expected to activate only a small fraction (<italic>ca</italic>. 5% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>) of KCs. In our experiments with direct optogenetic activation of all KCs, MBON-m1 could receive a stronger excitatory input from KCs than in response to a natural odor. Despite this, KC activation did not activate MBON-m1 in many individuals, and on average, across the population of untrained animals, there was no significant excitatory response (i.e. the mean ∂F/F<sub>0</sub> is not significantly different from zero). Albeit variable, a response to KCs was generally present in MBON-m1: overall, the amplitude of change of ∂F/F<sub>0</sub> (i.e. |maximum ∂F/F<sub>0</sub> - minimum ∂F/F<sub>0</sub> |) was significantly higher after, compared to before, KCs activation.

The variability in the response to KC activation between individuals could be due to a number of factors, including slightly different levels of CsChrimson expression, different states or different experiences.</p><p>Our observation that MBON-m1 has excitatory response to KC activation in some individuals, inhibitory response in some, or no response in others suggests it receives both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the MB pathway. This is consistent with the connectome which shows MBON-m1 receives direct synaptic input both from inhibitory (GABA or glutamatergic), avoidance-promoting MBONs and from excitatory (cholinergic), approach-promoting MBONs, as well as from the KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). To further confirm that both the excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the MB pathway onto MBON-m1 are functional, we activated KCs and recorded MBON-m1 responses in explants, either in the absence or in the presence of blockers of inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Specifically, we bathed the same sample sequentially with saline, then with the chloride-gating GABA/glutamate receptor blocker, picrotoxin (PTX, 100;;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>]) and then with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blocker, mecamylamine (MCA, 100;;M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>). A strong excitatory response to KC activation appeared when PTX was added to the solution and disappeared when MCA was added to the solution. These results demonstrate that MBON-m1 receives both functional inhibitory and excitatory inputs from the MB pathway, in accordance with the direct synaptic input it receives from GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic MBONs, as well as from KCs. These functional connections could also be mediated via MB2ONs that are downstream of these MBONs. We speculate that learning could modulate the balance of excitation and inhibition onto MBON-m1 by modifying the strength of direct KC input onto MBON-m1 as well as KC input onto excitatory or inhibitory MBONs that synapse onto MBON-m1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Aversive earning depresses MBON-M1 response to conditioned odors</title><p>We wanted to confirm that learning can modify MBON-m1 conditioned-odor response.

If this is the case, we would expect that activating CN-33 will repress turning (allowing odor approach). To test this, we asked whether optogenetically increasing the activity of CN-33 would repress turning (using SS02108&gt; UAS-CsChrimson). SS02108 drives expression in two neurons with similar morphology in each hemisphere, CN-33 and MB2ON-86, and weakly in segmentally repeated local interneurons in the nerve cord downstream of aversive mechanosensory neurons. As a control, we removed SS02108-driven nerve cord expression using the Split-GAL4 repressor Killer Zipper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolan et al., 2017</xref>) under the control of teashirt-LexA (J.-M. Knapp and J. Simpson, unpublished data) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a-b</xref>). As a second control, we also activated MB2ON-86 alone using SS04330 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C-d</xref>). We found that optogenetic activation of CN-33 decreased turning and increased crawling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a-d</xref>). Additionally, we observed increased turning at the activation offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). To confirm this another way, we acutely optogenetically hyperpolarized CN-33 with GtACR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Govorunova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mohammad et al., 2017</xref>) and found this increased turning relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Thus, as was the case for MBON-m1, increasing and decreasing CN-33 bi-directionally modulates turning. To confirm that this effect was not specific to light-induced turning, we additionally performed reverse correlation analysis between turning behavior and red-light intensity derivative in larvae expressing CsChrimson in CN-33 and exposed to variable intensity of red light (that controlled CsChrimson activity) under a constant blue light (that masked the red light, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This allowed us to confirm that decreased activity if CN-33 correlated with turning behavior. Furthermore, the greater the decrease in CN-33 activity during a turn, the higher the probability of rejecting that turn direction and performing another turn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we also asked whether constitutively inactivating CN-33 directly affected odor navigation.

Many cues have both innate valences acquired through evolution and learned valences acquired through experience that can guide action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rangel et al., 2008</xref>). Innate and learned valences are thought to be computed in distinct brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li and Liberles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marin et al., 2002</xref>), but the circuit mechanisms by which they are integrated and by which learned valences can override innate ones are poorly understood. Using the tractable <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva as a model system, we describe with synaptic resolution the patterns of convergence between the output neurons of a learning center (the MB) and an innately attractive pathway in the lateral horn (the LH). We identified 62 neurons per brain hemisphere that represent direct points of convergence between the MB and the LH, that fall into a number of different subtypes based on their patterns of MB and LH inputs and potentially encode a number of distinct features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). One subtype of 10 convergence neurons (CNs) receives excitatory input from positive-valence MB and LH pathways and inhibitory input from negative-valence MB pathways. We confirmed functional connectivity from LH and MB pathways and behavioral roles of two of these neurons. These neurons encode integrated odor value (coding for positive value with an increase in their activity) and regulate turning. They are activated by an attractive odor, and when activated they repress turning. Conversely, when inactivated, they increase turning. Based on this, we speculate that learning could potentially skew the balance of excitation and inhibition onto these neurons and thereby modulate turning. For one of these neurons, we indeed verified that aversive learning skews inputs towards inhibition. Together, our study provides insights into the circuit mechanisms by which learned valences could interact with innate ones to modify behavior.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Patterns of onvergence between brain areas encoding innate and learned valences</title><p>The brain areas that compute innate and learned valences of stimuli interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Root et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schleyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wystrach et al., 2016</xref>), but despite recent progress, their patterns of interaction are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scaplen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schlegel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In principle, MBONs could synapse directly onto LHNs thereby directly modifying innate valences. Alternatively, LHNs could directly synapse onto MBONs. Finally, learned and innate valences could initially be kept separate, and MBONs and LHNs could converge on downstream neurons. We have found that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva (i) some MBONs synapse directly onto some LHNs; (ii) some MBONs received direct synaptic input from LHNs and (iii) many MBONs and LHNs converge onto downstream CNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), similar to findings in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schlegel et al., 2021</xref>).

Overall, the architecture suggests some early mixing of representations of innate and learned valences, but to some extent these representations are also kept separate in the LH and MB, and then integrated by the downstream CNs.

Learning alters the overall output towards positive- or negative-valence MBONs by modifying specific KC-to-MBON connections. This model raises several important questions. First, how is the output from MBONs of opposite valence integrated to compute a learned valence? Second, how does it interact with the output of the LH? Our findings provide further support for this model and shed insight into these questions.</p><p>Our EM reconstruction combined with neurotransmitter information has revealed a class of 10 CNs that receive excitatory input from positive-valence MBONs and inhibitory input from negative-valence MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).

On average, across the population of untrained individuals, KC activation did not induce a significant change in ∂F/F<bold><sub>0</sub></bold> in either CN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6c</xref>).

This variability may in part be due to technical reasons. Indeed, the variable responses to pan-KC optogenetic activation could be due to differences in CsChrimson expression in KCs across individuals (we verified the expression of CsChrimson for each individual recording but did not quantify it). However, such a difference is unlikely to be a reason for a range of responses that spans inhibition to excitation following the stimulation of the same neuronal population. Likewise, the exposure of the sensory organ to an odor may vary from one animal to the other depending on the location of the larva’s head in the chip’s channel. Together with other technical aspects, this may account for some of the variance observed in in vivo. Indeed, a decomposition of the variance within the datasets by ANOVA revealed a significant effect of the identity of the individual on the variance (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Interestingly though, the inter-individual variability contributed to a higher fraction of the overall variance in odor response in larvae with functional MBs than in larvae with silenced MBs (see R<sup>2</sup> values in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This analysis suggests that the MB pathway is a significant source of variability in odor-evoked responses in MBON-m1 and CN-33 and is consistent with the highly variable responses of these CNs to direct KC activation. The variability in response of CNs to MB inputs across untrained individuals could be due to different experiences prior to these experiments, as suggested also by the fact that MBON-m1 responses to trained odors are modified with training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). High variability in MBON responses to odor across individuals has previously also been observed in the adult flies and has been related to different individual experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hige et al., 2015b</xref>). The MBs can also compute other kinds of information, such as internal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bräcker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Siju et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Modi et al., 2020</xref>) which may modulate an individual’s disposition toward sensory stimuli. Therefore, the average response across untrained individuals might be similar to the response of a single individual in a naive neutral state (with any interindividual differences averaged out across a population), and the variability may represent the degree of freedom for the MB to tune this response to a stimulus depending on previous experience or state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Convergence neurons integrate learned and innate valence and regulate turning</title><p>How do the learned valences modify the innate ones? How is conflict between opposite innate and learned valences resolved during action selection? One possibility could involve the integration of conflicting signals into a unified representation of value, a notion similar to common currency valuation of options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pearson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>), which could then be used to promote or suppress specific actions (<italic>e.g</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paisios et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wystrach et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings suggest that the 10 CNs that can read out the learned valence by comparing MBON inputs of opposite valence also integrate the learned valence with the innate one. Thus, the 10 CNs that receive inhibitory input from negative-valence MBONs and excitatory input from positive-valence MBONs, also receive inputs from a positive-valence LHN pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). These neurons are therefore well poised to compute an integrated odor value and code for a positive value with an increase in their activity. For two members of this class (MBON-m1 and CN-33) we were able to confirm these predictions. We have shown they are activated by an innately attractive odor via the LH pathway in untrained animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6b</xref>). Furthermore, when the innate attractiveness of an odor was reduced through aversive training, the activity of MBON-m1 was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Finally, we have shown that activating MBON-m1 and CN-33 represses turning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6e</xref>), further supporting the idea that their activation encodes positive value. Interestingly, we also found that a decrease in their activity promotes turning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5b–c ,</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6e–f</xref>), raising the possibility that they could bi-directionally encode value, coding for negative value with a decrease in their activity.</p><p>In principle, a single CN of this type could potentially be sufficient to compute integrated odor value and regulate turning, but we found a population of 10 CNs with similar patterns of input from positive- and negative-valence pathways that likely operate partially redundantly with each other. Each CN also had unique aspects of connectivity, raising the possibility that they may also encode partially complementary features and that the integrated value could be distributed across the CN population.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Learning can modulate turning response to odors by modulating CN activity</title><p>Based on our findings we propose the following model that could explain the way in which learning could modulate innate responses to odors through a population of integrative CNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): (i) In naive animals, the CNs are activated by innately attractive odors, mainly via the LH pathway (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6b</xref> for untrained animals); (iii) when activated these neurons repress turning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6e</xref>), which enables crawling towards an attractive odor source; (iv) in naive animals the net MB drive onto these CNs is close to 0 (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d–e ,</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6c–d</xref> across a population of untrained animals); (v) aversive learning can skew the net MB output onto CNs towards inhibition, so that aversively-conditioned odor fails to activate these neurons (as shown for MBON-m1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>); (vii) if CNs are not activated, turning rate remains high when crawling towards the odor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5b–c ,</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6e–f</xref>, for turning rate when CNs are silenced); (viii) without sufficient suppression of turning by an odor, the animals’ ability to approach the odor source is impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). This proposed model could explain how aversive learning suppresses approach of innately attractive odors. To fully suppress approach, multiple CNs of this class would likely need to be silenced.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>CN-33 integrates LH and MB-derived inputs.</title><p>CNs whose activation suppresses turning are activated by innately attractive odors in naive animals via the LH pathway (when the net MB output onto them is 0). Learning could bidirectionally skew the net MB output onto the CNs towards excitation (appetitive learning), or inhibition (aversive learning). After aversive learning the conditioned odor would activate these CNs less, failing to suppress turning, or sometimes even inhibit them, thereby inducing turning and inducing avoidance.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62567-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig><p>The model presented above could readily be extended to explain how appetitive learning could enhance odor approach and how strong aversive learning could switch innate odor approach to learned avoidance. Thus, appetitive learning could skew the net MB drive towards excitation thereby repressing turning even more. In contrast, strong aversive learning could skew the conditioned odor drive towards inhibitory negative-valence MBONs so much that the inhibition would become stronger than the excitatory LH drive. The CN would then be inhibited by the aversively conditioned odor. Since inhibition of CNs promotes turning, the aversively conditioned odor could promote odor avoidance by inducing turning. Consistent with this idea, we observed inhibitory responses to the innately attractive odor in MBON-m1 and in CN-33, in some untrained individuals, and strong excitatory responses in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6b</xref>), proving that odor drive onto CNs can range all the way from strong excitation to inhibition. We did not observe inhibition of MBON-m1 following aversive learning in the microfluidic device, but this could be because the animals did not form a very strong aversive memory under these conditions. Testing these proposed extensions of the model will require the future development of automated single-animal training assays and calcium imaging tracking microscopes to correlate the strength of the learned behavior with the conditioned-odor response of the CNs.</p><p>Finally, our EM reconstruction did reveal a potentially opposite population of CNs that are inhibited by MBONs of positive value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>). It will be interesting to test in the future whether these neurons potentially encode negative value with an increase in their activity and positive value with a decrease in their activity and regulate turning in the opposite way: promoting turning when they are activated and repressing it when they are inhibited. Having two different populations of neurons that encode value in opposite ways could further increase the dynamic range of a distributed value code.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A behavior signal feeds back onto MB modulatory neurons</title><p>We find that many of the CNs that receive input from both MBONs and LHNs also provide direct (including CN-33) or indirect (including MBON-m1) feedback to MB modulatory neurons that provide teaching signals for learning (n = 18). In a former study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>), we have shown that at least some of these feedback connections are functional and can influence memory formation. For example, CN-33/FAN-7 is capable of generating an olfactory memory when it is paired with an odor. This type of connectivity is consistent with learning theories that propose that future learning is influenced by predicted value computed based on prior learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schultz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>).

To quantify the overall navigational response in the linear spatial gradient, we computed a navigation index by dividing the mean velocity of all larvae in the <italic>x</italic>-direction by the mean crawling speed. Hence, the navigational index was +/−1 if the larvae crawled uniformly straight up/down the gradient and 0 if the movement was unbiased. For each bout and at each time point, the position of the larva relative to the odor gradient was estimated as well as its likelihood to be engaged in a turn (details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gershow et al., 2012</xref>). To quantify turn-based navigation strategy, we compared the turn probability when the larvae were aligned towards the gradient (±15 degrees) to the turn probability when the larvae were aligned away from the gradient (±15 degrees). The experiments were repeated 7–10 times in each condition. The mean and s.e.m. of these parameters were computed for each experiment and further pooled for the repeats. A Welch z test was used for statistical comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Optogenetic neural activation screen</title><p>Optogenetic activation experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jovanic et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Ca</italic>. 30 larvae were separated from food by bathing them in a 20 % sucrose solution for a maximum of 10 min.

At 30 and 75 s, 15 s-long pulses of red 660 nm red light (4 µW/mm2, Philips Lumileds) were applied. For statistics, speed (normalized to the baseline before the stimulation) and turn angle are averaged for all larvae and time windows corresponding to the two stimulation.

The plate was placed in a darkened enclosure and larvae were observed under strobed 850 nm infrared illumination (ODL-300–850, Smart Vision Lights, Muskegon, MI) using a 14 fps 5 MP rolling shutter CMOS camera (Basler acA2500-14gm, Graftek Imaging, Austin, TX) in global-reset-release mode and an 18 mm c-mount lens (54–857, Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ) equipped with an IR-pass filter (Hoya R-72, Edmund Optics). For light stimulation, a custom circuit board (Advanced Circuits, Colorado) containing 66 deep red high brightness LEDs (Philips Lumileds, LXM3-PD01, 655 nm) and 12 royal blue high brightness LEDs (LXML-PR01-0500, 447.5 nm) evenly distributed over ∼25 cm × 25 cm. The LEDs were driven at constant current by a switch-mode LED driver circuit (based on LT3518, linear technology) operating at a switching frequency of 2 MHz. Illumination was provided from above the larvae; the LED circuit board was at the same height as the recording camera (∼50 cm above the behavioral arena). The intensity of the red and blue LEDs was controlled separately by pulse-width-modulation; in these experiments, blue LEDs was set at a constant intensity (3.7 μW/cm2) and the red light intensity varied following a Brownian random walk at an update rate of 112 Hz, and where light levels were specified by values between 0 (off) and 255 (maximum intensity, i.e. 911 μW/cm2). CsChrimson is slightly more sensitive to 655 nm than 448 nm light, so the blue light signal perturbed olfactory receptor neuron activity by less than 0.3 % of the red-light signal’s perturbation.

Briefly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as in other insects, the gross morphology of many neurons is stereotyped and individual neurons are uniquely identifiable based on morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goodman et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bate et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Costa et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the nervous system in insects is largely bilaterally symmetric and homologous, with mirror-symmetric neurons reproducibly found on the left and the right side of the animal. We therefore validated neuron reconstructions by independently reconstructing synaptic partners of homologous neurons on the left and right side of the nervous system. With this approach, we have previously estimated the false positive rate of synaptic contact detection to be 0.0167 (1 error per 60 synaptic contacts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>). Assuming the false positives are uncorrelated, for an n-synapse connection the probability that all n are wrong (and thus that the entire connection is a false positive) occurs at a rate of 0.0167<sup>n</sup>. Thus, the probability that a connection is a false positive reduces dramatically with the number of synaptic contacts contributing to that connection. Even for n = 2 synaptic contacts, the probability that a connection is not true is 0.00028 (once in every 3,586 two-synapse connections). We therefore consider ‘reliable’ connections those for which the connections between the left and right homologous neurons have at least three synapses each and their sum is at least 10.

Ipsilateral and contralateral connections are considered. Similarity is obtained by counting indices of value one that are observed at the same location in both the row neuron pair and the column neuron pair (matches) and counting the total number of value one indices that are only observed in the row or column alone, but not both (mismatches).

An eight-channel device included two control channels located at the periphery, three odorant channels in the middle, and one water channel to remove odorant residue (the two remaining channels were blocked by a stopper). Each channel was of equal length to ensure equal resistance. During an experiment, a combination of three channels was always open: the water channel, one of the three odorant delivery channels, and one of the control channels. The three odorant channels could be sequentially opened to deliver any odorant.

The stimuli sequences consisted of five seconds of odorant pulses followed by a washout period using water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In vivo calcium imaging</title><p>A first instar larva was loaded into a microfluidic device using a 1 mL syringe filled with 0.1 % triton-water solution. Using the syringe, a larva was pushed towards the end of the channel, where the 60 μm wide opening mechanically trapped further larval movement. Each larva was positioned such that its dorsal organ (nose) was exposed to the stimulus delivery channel. Larvae were imaged at 35 fps using a multiphoton microscope equipped with a fast resonant galvo scan module (customized Bergamo Multiphoton, Thorlabs) controlled by ScanImage 2016 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scanimage.org">http://www.scanimage.org</ext-link>). The light source was a femtosecond pulsed laser tuned to 925 nm (Mai Tai, Spectraphysics). The objective was a 25 X water immersion objective (NA 1.1 and 2 mm WD, Nikon). The CNs neurites (dendrites and their contralateral axon terminals) were spanned in at least one brain hemisphere by a volume scan (six slices with a step size of 2 μm).</p><p>For pairing of an odor with optogenetic activation of aversive neurons, a 660 nm laser (Obis 660, Coherent) photostimulation (<italic>ca</italic>. 480 µW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was directed towards the terminals of the aversive neurons using a galvo-galvo module (Thorlabs) controlled by ScanImage software. The scans were usually not saved during the pairing period, as the imaging laser power were set to minimum power to avoid photobleaching associated with long-run recording. The CS+ was delivered for 5 s, followed by a 5 s laser stimulation which overlapped with CS+ for 3 s. The CS- was presented alone for 5 s. Each bout consisted in two CS+ and two CS- presentation; each interspaced by 20±3 s of water flow, for a total of <italic>ca</italic>. 120 s-long bout. The odors presented were different for different animals and were one of the following four combinations of CS: AM+/EA-, EA+/AM-, ME+/EA-, EA+/ME-. Eight consecutive pairing bouts were performed. The position of the larva in the channel was assessed between each bout and rectified by adding triton-water-filled with the syringe if necessary. At the end of the eight bouts, the settings of the microscope were readjusted to allow optimal recording and the responses of the CN to delivery of the odors were reassessed the same way as before pairing. A single larva underwent between one and two of the pre-pairing and post-pairing scanning bouts.</p><p>The same system was used for co-stimulation of CNs with 10<sup>–4</sup> ethyl acetate and optogenetic activation of Kenyon cells. Here, two consecutive 3 s-long odors and two consecutive 3 s-long photo-stimulations were conveyed to the larva in a shuffled order, followed by two consecutive 3 s-long joined delivery of odor and photo-stimulation. Each stimulation was interspaced with 20±2 s of water flow for a total of <italic>ca</italic>. 100 s-long scanning bout. A single larva underwent between one and three of these bouts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Odor response analyses</title><p>The GCaMP6f fluorescence (averaged intensity of z-projection) was calculated for a region of interest (CN’s neurite), subtracted to background intensity, and normalized to the tdtTomato signal emitted at CN’s membranes of the same region <italic>F</italic><bold><sub>t</sub></bold> = (F<italic><sub>GCaMP_</sub></italic><bold><sub>t</sub></bold> )/ median(F<italic><sub>GCaMP</sub></italic>) <italic>- F</italic><sub>dTom_<bold>t</bold></sub> / median(F<italic><sub>GCaMP</sub></italic>). For each larva, one to two regions of interest (corresponding to the left and right hemispheres) were selected (by thresholding the projected maximum intensity image) for each larva and their fluorescence was averaged. Two to four repetitive stimulations were averaged as well. Movement artifacts were corrected by aligning frames using the strongest signal (tdtTomato- or GCaMP6f-derived) labeling the CN neurites and a combination of cross-correlation on Matlab (normxcorr2_general, 2010, Dirk Padfield) and manual correction.</p><p>Changes in fluorescence were quantified as ∂F/F<bold><sub>0</sub></bold> = (<italic>F</italic><bold><sub>t</sub></bold> - <italic>F</italic><bold><sub>0</sub></bold>)/<italic>F</italic><bold><sub>0</sub></bold>, where <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> was the average fluorescence intensity sampled from the frames of the 5 s preceding a stimulation. Quantifications of normalized mean and peak were the normalized value of, respectively, mean and maximum intensity for the frames during the stimulation (ON response) or for the 8 s following the stimulation (OFF response). For the absolute value of the response to KC stimulation, the difference in the absolute value of average ∂F/F<bold><sub>0</sub></bold> during and before KC stimulation was computed: |∂F/F<bold><sub>0</sub></bold> during stimulation| - |baseline ∂F/F<bold><sub>0</sub></bold> prior to stimulation|.</p><p>Statistical comparisons were done using a non-parametric Wilcoxon test for paired comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data exclusion</title><p>When movements artefacts were too important and rendered alignment impossible for a substantial part of the recording (<italic>ca</italic>. 10%), the data for this larva was discarded. Data for trained larvae was excluded if no calcium response was observed to any odors before and/or after the training session, as it likely indicated that the larva was dead or that the external sensory organs were not exposed to the odor flow.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Validation, Visualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Software, Validation, Visualization, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Software, Validation, Visualization, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Software, Writing – review and editing, Visualization, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Resources, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – original draft, Software, Writing – review and editing, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Resources, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Adjacency matrix of all reconstructed neurons.</title><p>Adjacency matrix between all neurons (all type of synaptic connection) reconstructed and considered in this and in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>): Olfactory Projection Neurons downstream of ORN42a and 42b (PNs), Lateral Horn Neurons downstream of these PNs (LHNs), Mushroom Body Output Neurons (MBONs), MB 2nd-Order Neurons downstream of MBONs (MB2ONs), Convergence Neurons (CNs). modulatory neurons (dopaminergic, octopaminergic, or unknown: respectively DANs, OANs, MBINs), Feedback 2nd-order Neurons (FB2Ns), Feed-Forward Neurons (FFNs), Kenyon Cells (KCs).</p></caption><media mime-subtype="octet-stream" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-62567-supp1-v3.csv"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Results of statistical analyses.</title><p>Details of statistical analyses of imaging data: probability resulting from Wilcoxon rank test and ANOVA.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="octet-stream" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-62567-supp2-v3.csv"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-62567-transrepform1-v3.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Second, they present a comprehensive EM-level neuroanatomical analysis of the postsynaptic partners of MBONs, identifying substantial convergence from these (as well as some MBONs) onto neurons of the lateral horn, a region associated with innate sensory-evoked behavioral responses. Third, through neurophysiological and behavioral analyses of two classes of these &quot;convergence neurons&quot; (CNs; one of which is also an MBON), they provide evidence for their role in representing sensory stimuli, evoking behavioral responses, and adapting after learning. Together this work provides an impressive anatomical framework, and initial functional insights, supporting the existence of extensive communication between neural circuits controlling learned and innate behavior. This work extends concepts initially established in earlier studies in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, notably valence assignment to MBONs (Aso 2014 PMID: 25535794), and MB-to-LN communication (Dolan 2018 PMID: 30244885), but has a wealth of original observations, datasets and reagents to facilitate future experimental exploration and modeling of the integration of learned and innate valence in the &quot;simple&quot; larval brain.</p><p>As the authors' can see from the reviews, major concerns have been expressed. In our consultations, we felt that these were important and needed to be addressed. The authors may choose to address these comprehensively and submit a revised manuscript for examination. If, on the other hand, they feel that the revisions asked will take too much time and effort to address, they may want to submit the manuscript elsewhere, In any case, please do let us know how you would like to proceed.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1. I have concerns over the strength of evidence from the calcium imaging analyses, as the response properties can be extremely variable in both magnitude and temporal dynamics between animals. I appreciate that the authors are quite transparent in displaying all their imaging traces in the supplement. However, I don't think that they are entirely objective in interpreting them. For example, analysis of MBON-m1 responses to pan-Kenyon Cell optogenetic activation can be strong, weak or non-existent, which the authors suggest is due to differences in individual animal's experience but could alternatively be due to various technical issues. (These are presumably not trivial experiments, the sample sizes for these experiments are general limited). But averaging all of the responses and then stating that &quot;the absolute value of ∂F/F0 was significantly increased after, compared to before, KC activation … indicating that there is a response, which is sometimes excitatory and sometimes inhibitory&quot; seems mostly guided in interpretation by the anatomical data rather than the physiological evidence obtained. In the corresponding legend (Figure 4d) it gets even more definitive &quot;… due to the fact that MBON-m1 receives functionally excitatory inputs from the MB in some individuals, and inhibitory in others&quot;. Their interpretations are plausible but preliminary.</p><p>Similarly, a key result in Figure 5a leads the authors to claim that MBON-m1 is modified by experience. In the main figure, they (unusually) do not plot the individual traces, which prevents appreciation of the variability evident in the corresponding supplementary figure (ED Figure 9): here, out of nine animals imaged, only three show dramatically diminished odor responses post-conditioning (in several cases there is little odor response even pretraining; and the non-conditioned odor can, in some cases, also show diminished responses). None of the nuance is really captured in what the authors state: &quot;As expected, we found significantly decreased responses of MBON-m1 to the paired (CS+) and not the unpaired odor&quot;. I have similar concerns with the physiological analysis of the other investigated neuron population (CN-33) (Figure 6c-d). For this populations, they do not examine the impact of learning (even though in the abstract they may a rather general statement about convergence neurons): &quot;Aversive learning skews their inputs towards inhibition to modulate turning.&quot;</p><p>In sum, for such complex experiments, and complex network interactions, a much larger dataset would be needed to solidify the authors' claims. Without further experimental data, the interpretation should be significantly toned down.</p><p>2. Presentation: while the overall quality of data presentation is high, because the manuscript is both composed of several parts and enormously detailed in the neuroanatomy, the central narrative is very hard to follow. The reader has to cope with numerous acronyms and abbreviations (e.g., &quot;some MBONs (MBON-m1) that receive direct LHN input also receive reliable input from other MBONs (Figure 3e), and are therefore also CNs (LHN-CNs and MBON-CNs), but we continue to call them LHNs and MBONs for brevity&quot;) as well as frequent laboriously constructed phrases (e.g., &quot;a neuron whose activation signals negative valence (avoidance) is expected to promote turning in response to an increase in its activity). I realise that such linguistic turns of phrases are frequently unavoidable but in the context of such a juggernaut of data the authors could probably refine their text to make it as accessible as possible. There is a lot of repetition, including &quot;interpretations&quot; in the results (notably, trying to conclude the meaning of calcium imaging data in the context of the neuroanatomy – see point 1), which would be better in the Discussion, as well as unnecessary restatement of results in several of the figure legends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript uses a combination of EM-based connectomics, behavior, and calcium imaging to explore how learned and innate valence signals are integrated to drive action selection in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Building on previous work where the authors characterized the valence of memory encoding for mushroom body compartments, they then characterize the valence encoding of the output neurons for each of these compartments, and reconstruct all downstream targets. They find a complex network of downstream neurons which receive input from mushroom body output neurons encoding opposite valances. Using behavior, optogenetics, and calcium imaging the authors explore how two such convergence neurons might integrate both learned and innate valence, as well as signals of opposite valence.</p><p>This work exploring the integration of valence signals in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system represents an interesting parallel with the author's other recent work exploring how memory encoding in the mushroom body. Most of the conclusions are well supported. However, there are a number of issues that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1. Conclusions of the paper</p><p>a. The primary hypothesis of this paper seems to be that in addition to depression of the KC-MBON connection due to aversive learning, shown in (Eschbach 2020), there exist other mechanisms for the comparing of learned valences, including integration at both the MBON and CN level. One proposed mechanism is that MBONs encoding opposite valences inhibit one another. The connectome only somewhat supports this mechanism. Of the tested MBONs, only 2 show the strict lateral inhibition described. Three have no interactions, two inhibit MBONs with both the same and opposite valence, one excites MBONs of both the same and opposite valence, and one inhibits an MBON of the same valence. Based on these connection motifs, can it really be said that lateral inhibition is a general principle for mushroom body organization?</p><p>b. The latter half of the paper focuses on two CNs, one an MBON itself, and another a feedback neuron (described in Eschbach 2020). The author's primary argument is that these neurons integrate both learned and innate valences, as well as are integrating inputs of MBONs of opposite valence. The data presented is consistent with the idea that both MBON-m1 and CN-33 integrate information from both the LH (innate) and the mushroom body (learned), however, it is not entirely clear that there is sufficient functional evidence to support the idea that either of these neurons is integrating MBON input of opposite valence. The connectome does suggest that this is the case, however, silencing of the mushroom body had no effect on the response of either MBON-m1 or CN-33 to odors. Pairing the odor with an aversive stimulus clearly demonstrates that the neurons are capable of integrating innate and learned stimuli, but it is unclear if the inputs from positive MBONs are being depressed as shown in the schematic in Figure 7.</p><p>2. Behavioral experiments</p><p>a. The optogenetic stimuli used for conditioning experiments in Figure 2 produce a large (startle?) response, on top of which all other behavior is measured. What evidence is there that the behavioral conditioning experiments in Figure 2 are not producing a potentiation or reduction of this light-induced startle response? This is particularly worrisome in the majority of cases where the dynamics of the conditioned behavior follow a similar time-course to the startle response. Overall, it is not convincing that this analysis is cleanly separating MBONs that would drive avoidance and approach independent of the light artifact.</p><p>b. Each MBON in Figure 2 is classified as driving either approach or avoidance, but the dynamics of their angular steering and speed vary widely. This should at least be discussed in the text, and the authors should justify their decision for categorization in light of this variability.</p><p>3. Calcium Imaging experiments</p><p>The calcium imaging data throughout the paper is quite noisy and responses are variable across individual animals. The authors sometimes attribute this variability to biological variability in circuit connectivity (eg, Figure 6). Where this is done, it is worth including an explicit comparison of within fly vs across variability, to test the degree to which responses are stereotyped within an animal.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62567.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1.

To address this point further we have performed additional experiments, additional analysis of variability and modified the text to state clearly additional sources of variability.</p><p>To provide further evidence that the MBON-m1 and CN-33 do receive both indirect functional excitatory and inhibitory inputs from KCs consistent with the prediction from the connectome, we activated KCs and recorded MBON-m1 and CN-33 responses in the absence and presence of a blocker for the inhibitory chloride-gating GABA/glutamate (vGluT) receptors (picrotoxin, PTX) or acetylcholine (AChR) receptors (mecamylamine, MCA). Specifically, we expressed CsChrimson in KCs and GCamp6f in either MBONm1 or CN-33, and bathed the same sample sequentially with saline, PTX, or MCA, while activating KCs optogenetically.</p><p>In both neurons, a strong excitatory response to KC appeared when PTX was added to the solution and disappeared when MCA was added to the solution. Further the response when the neurons were bathed in saline was on average not significantly different from zero, but the overall amplitude of fluorescence change was higher during, compared to before stimulation, which suggest again a general mixed response of these neurons to KC stimulations.</p><p>These results, we think, provide conclusive evidence that MBON-m1 and CN-33 receive both functional inhibitory and excitatory inputs from the MB pathway, in accordance with the anatomical data that shows they receive synaptic input from GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic MBONs.</p><p>We have added a new Figure 4e and 6d with the new results in the presence of receptor blockers and a paragraph in the Results sections:</p><p>“Our observation that MBON-m1 has excitatory response to KC activation in some individuals, inhibitory response in some, or no response in others suggests it receives both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the MB pathway. This is consistent with the connectome that shows MBON-m1 receives direct synaptic input both from inhibitory (GABA or Glutamatergic) avoidance-promoting MBONs and from excitatory (cholinergic) approach-promoting MBONs, as well as from the KCs (Figure 4a). To further confirm that both the excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the MB pathway onto MBON-m1 are functional, we activated KCs and recorded MBON-m1 responses in explants either in the absence or in the presence of blockers of inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitter receptors (Figure 4e). Specifically, we bathed the same sample sequentially with saline, then with the chloride-gating GABA/glutamate receptor blocker, picrotoxin (PTX) and then with the acetylcholine (AChR) receptor blocker, mecamylamine (MCA). A strong excitatory response to KC appeared when PTX was added to the solution and disappeared when MCA was added to the solution. These results demonstrate that MBON-m1 receives both functional inhibitory and excitatory inputs from the MB pathway, in accordance with the direct synaptic input it receives from GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic MBONs, as well as from KCs.”</p><p>“To confirm a functional connection from the MB onto CN-33 we optogenetically activated all KCs in untrained individuals and imaged calcium transients in CN-33. […] Since CN-33 does not receive any direct KC input but does receive direct MBON input, these functional connections must be indirect and mediated by the MBONs (and possibly also by MB2ONs that receive input from these MBONs and synapse onto CN-33).”</p><p>To address the possibility that the variability could be due to technical issues, such as a variability in Kenyon Cell activation, we measure the intensity of the light stimulation in each experiment and we verify the expression of the TdTomato tagged CsChrimson for each recording. Nevertheless, we have also added statements in the text that the variability in the response to KC activation could be due to a number of factors: (1) slightly different levels of CsChrimson expression (2) different states and (3) different experiences.</p><p>We have also compared inter-individual variability with intra-individual variability and found that the interindividual variability is greater than intra-animal variability (Supplementary File 2). Thus, the responses of a neuron from a single animal are more consistent with each other, suggesting that at least within a single animal the conditions do not vary as much. We now display the intra-individual variability in the plots for imaging data in Figure 4c-e and 6b-d.</p><p>Interestingly, we also found that the inter-animal variability contributed to a higher fraction of the overall variance in odor response in animals with a functional MB compared to those with silenced KCs (Supplementary File 2). This suggests that the MB could be a significant source of inter-individual variability in odor-evoked responses in MBON-m1 and CN-33.</p><p>Here are the excerpts of the text that we added or modified:</p><p>Results</p><p>“Interestingly, odor-evoked responses were highly variable across individuals (ranging from inhibition to excitation), even though, on average across individuals the response was excitatory (Figure 4c). ANOVA revealed that inter-individual variability was significantly higher than the intra-individual variability (<italic>i.e.</italic> high and significant Fisher’s F in Supplementary File 2). Compared to those with silenced KCs, inter-animal variability in animals with a functional MB contributed to a higher fraction of the overall variance in odor response (Figure 4c, and compare the r<sup>2</sup> coefficients in Supplementary File 2). This suggests that the MB could be a significant source of inter-individual variability in odor-evoked responses in MBON-m1…”</p><p>“KCs activation did not activate MBON-m1 in many individuals, and on average, across the population of untrained animals, there was no significant response (<italic>i.e.</italic> the mean ∂F/F0 is not significantly different from zero). […] The variability in the response to KC activation between individuals could be due to a number of factors, including slightly different levels of CsChrimson expression, different states or different experiences.”</p><p>“As was the case for MBON-m1, ANOVA revealed that inter-individual variability in CN-33 odor response was significantly higher than the intra-individual variability (<italic>i.e</italic>. high and significant Fisher’s F in Supplementary File 2). In addition, compared to those with silenced KCs, inter-animal variability in animals with a functional MB contributed to a higher fraction of the overall variance in odor response (<italic>i.e.</italic> compare the r2 coefficients in Supplementary File 2). The MB could therefore be a significant source of inter-individual variability in odor-evoked responses of CN-33.”</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“We observed high variability in the responses of both CN-33 and MBON-m1 both to activation of the whole MB pathway, as well as to odor presentation. […] Therefore, the average response across untrained individuals might be similar to the response of a single individual in a naive neutral state (with any interindividual differences averaged out across a population), and the variability may represent the degree of freedom for the MB to tune this response to a stimulus depending on previous experience or state.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, a key result in Figure 5a leads the authors to claim that MBON-m1 is modified by experience. In the main figure, they (unusually) do not plot the individual traces, which prevents appreciation of the variability evident in the corresponding supplementary figure (ED Figure 9): here, out of nine animals imaged, only three show dramatically diminished odor responses post-conditioning (in several cases there is little odor response even pretraining; and the non-conditioned odor can, in some cases, also show diminished responses). None of the nuance is really captured in what the authors state: &quot;As expected, we found significantly decreased responses of MBON-m1 to the paired (CS+) and not the unpaired odor&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Even when using the classical, manual training paradigms in freely behaving animals not all individuals learn. Thus, in a training paradigm in freely behaving animals (pairing of odor with optogenetic Basin activation) the mean learning score across multiple batches of animals was -0.3 (see Figure 1e in Eschbach et al., 2020. Nature neuroscience) and the mean preference index for the aversively conditioned odor was also -0.3 (N = 20 batches; see Supplementary Figure 2b in Eschbach et al., 2020. Nature neuroscience).</p><p>The learning performance score is defined as [preference index (paired) – preference index (unpaired)]/2. If all animals from the paired group were avoiding an aversively conditioned odor, and all animals in the unpaired group were approaching it, then the learning score would be close to -1. Thus, an average learning score of -0.3 indicates that while, on average, there is a significant difference between paired and unpaired groups, not all animals learn to avoid the conditioned odor. This score means that, on average, the number of larvae that approach the conditioned odor is decreased by 30%, i.e. that ca. ⅓ of animals have learnt to avoid the odor.</p><p>The preference index for an odor is defined as [N(larvae close to odor source) – N(larvae far from odor source)]/N (total). The average preference score for the aversively conditioned odor in the paired group was -0.3, indicating that, on average, 30% more larvae are found far from the odor source than close to it. Also, an appetitive associative memory has been shown to be formed to the unpaired odor in larvae undergoing an aversive odor training (Schleyer et al., 2018), which could be consistent with an increased response of MBON-m1 to the learned odor.</p><p>In the present study we found MBON-m1 has dramatically diminished responses to CS+ in 3/9 animals and mildly reduced responses to CS+ in a further 4/9 animals (Figure 5a). MBON-m1 also had dramatically increased response to CS- in 3/9 animals (Figure 5a). These findings are largely consistent with the learning performance obtained by training freely behaving animals. We would like to note that this is the first time in the larval field that individual immobilised animals were trained in the microscope and it would have been possible that restrained animals did not learn as well as unrestrained ones. The finding that ⅓ of restrained animals showed dramatically diminished MBON-m1 responses to CS+, suggests they learn with similar probability to freely crawling animals.</p><p>It is possible that with different training conditions, such as more training trials, longer overlap between CS and US or higher intensity of Basin activation, the probability of learning (and depressing the MBON response) could increase. However, identifying the conditions that give higher learning probabilities and stronger reductions in MBON response to CS+, is a long-term effort that requires systematic variation of one parameter at a time. Such a project is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>We would also like to point out that compared to training populations of freely behaving animals, loading animals into a microfluidic device and training them in a two-photon microscope is extremely time consuming and low-throughput. Thus, it is not feasible to obtain high Ns in such experiments.</p><p>We have shown that we do have a statistically significant reduction in MBON-m1 response in paired group compared to unpaired group. This suggests that MBON-m1 response to conditioned odor is reduced through aversive training.</p><p>To address the Reviewers’ point we have therefore modified Figure 5a to show traces from individual animals, and not just the average response. We have also modified the text in the Results section to stress the variability in MBON-depression across individuals, and to mention that this level of variability is consistent with other training paradigms in freely behaving animals:</p><p>“We found that the response to conditioned odor was variable across individuals (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2d), but on average, we found significantly decreased responses of MBON-m1 to the paired (CS+) and not the unpaired odor (CS-, Figure 5a, Supplementary File 2). In some individuals we also observed an increased response to the CS- after training (Figure 5a, Figure 4 —figure supplement 2d). In previous studies temporally pairing Basin activation with an odor in freely behaving animals induced an aversive memory where the mean learning score across multiple batches of animals was -0.3 (<italic>i.e.</italic> on average, the number of larvae approaching the odour was decreased by 30%) [36]. Also, an appetitive associative memory has been shown to be formed to the unpaired odor in larvae undergoing aversive odor training [69]. Thus, our results after training immobilised animals in the microscope, showing a dramatic decrease in MBON-m1 response to CS+ in 3 out of 9 animals, and an increased response to CS- in another 3 animals (Figure 5a), are by and large consistent with learning scores in freely behaving animals.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have similar concerns with the physiological analysis of the other investigated neuron population (CN-33) (Figure 6c-d).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point we have provided additional experimental evidence for the existence of indirect functionally excitatory and inhibitory connections from KCs onto CN-33, consistent with the prediction from the connectome and added new Figure 6d. We activated KCs and recorded CN-33 responses in the absence and presence of GABA (picrotoxin, PTX) or AChR blockers (mecamylamine, MCA). A strong excitatory response to KC appeared when PTX was added to the solution and disappeared when MCA was added to the solution. These results demonstrate that CN-33 receives both functional inhibitory and excitatory inputs from the MB pathway, in accordance with the anatomical data that shows it receives synaptic input from GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic MBONs.</p><p>We have added a new Figure 6d showing the responses of CN-33 before and after perfusion with GABAR and AchR blockers.</p><p>We have added the following section in the Results:</p><p>“CN-33 receives direct synaptic input both from inhibitory avoidance-promoting and from excitatory approach-promoting MBONs, which could counterbalance each other. Consistent with this anatomical connectivity, adding the GABA/vGluT receptor blocker, PTX, revealed strong excitatory responses of CN33 to KC activation. […] As for MBON-m1, we found high interindividual variability of response to KCs activation compared to intraindividual variability (<italic>i.e.</italic> significant Fisher’s F, Supplementary File 2), which suggests that the balance of excitatory vs. inhibitory drive from MB pathways onto CN-33 is individual-specific.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For this populations, they do not examine the impact of learning (even though in the abstract they may a rather general statement about convergence neurons: “Aversive learning skews their inputs towards inhibition to modulate turning).”</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment we have significantly modified our claims in the abstract and text to focus on the structural and functional connections from MB and LH onto CN-33:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>“Animal behavior is shaped both by evolution and by individual experience. Parallel brain pathways encode innate and learned valences of cues, but the way in which they are integrated during action-selection is not well understood. We used electron microscopy to comprehensively map with synaptic resolution all neurons downstream of all Mushroom Body output neurons (encoding learned valences) and characterized their patterns of interaction with Lateral Horn neurons (encoding innate valences) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. The connectome revealed multiple <italic>convergence neuron</italic> types that receive convergent Mushroom Body and Lateral Horn inputs. A subset of these receives excitatory input from positive-valence MB and LH pathways and inhibitory input from negative-valence MB pathways. We confirmed functional connectivity from LH and MB pathways and behavioral roles of two of these neurons. These neurons encode integrated odor value and bidirectionally regulate turning. Based on this we speculate that learning could potentially skew the balance of excitation and inhibition onto these neurons and thereby modulate turning. Together, our study provides insights into the circuits that integrate learned and innate to modify behavior.”</p><p>Based on the structural and functional connections, in the Discussion we speculate that aversive learning could skew CN-33 responses to learning in a similar way to MBON-m1:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“One subtype of 10 convergence neurons (CNs) receives excitatory input from positive-valence MB and LH pathways and inhibitory input from negative-valence MB pathways. We confirmed functional connectivity from LH and MB pathways and behavioral roles of two of these neurons. These neurons encode integrated odor value (coding for positive value with an increase in their activity) and regulate turning. They are activated by an attractive odor, and when activated they repress turning. Conversely, when inactivated, they increase turning. Based on this we speculate that learning could potentially skew the balance of excitation and inhibition onto these neurons and thereby modulate turning. For one of these neurons we indeed verified that aversive learning skews inputs towards inhibition. Together, our study provides insights into the circuit mechanisms by which learned valences could interact with innate ones to modify behavior.”</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Detailed statistics (Analysis of variance):</th><th/><th/><th/><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">'Source'</td><td align="left" valign="top">'Sum Sq.'</td><td align="left" valign="top">'d.f.'</td><td align="left" valign="top">'Mean Sq.'</td><td align="left" valign="top">'F'</td><td align="left" valign="top">'Prob&gt;F'</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">'indiv'</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.26</td><td align="left" valign="top">4</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.065</td><td align="left" valign="top">10.9</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.8e-07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">'CS'</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.09</td><td align="left" valign="top">2</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.046</td><td align="left" valign="top">7.8</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.0007</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">'indiv*CS'</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.11</td><td align="left" valign="top">8</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.014</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.4</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.021</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">'Error'</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.55</td><td align="left" valign="top">93</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.006</td><td align="left" valign="top">[]</td><td align="left" valign="top">[]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">'Total'</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.00</td><td align="left" valign="top">107</td><td align="left" valign="top">[]</td><td align="left" valign="top">[]</td><td align="left" valign="top">[]</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, for such complex experiments, and complex network interactions, a much larger dataset would be needed to solidify the authors’ claims. Without further experimental data, the interpretation should be significantly toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>To address these comments we have added new functional connectivity and calcium imaging experiments and we have significantly toned down some of the interpretations.</p><p>i. We have performed new functional connectivity experiments (activating KCs and imaging in MBONm1 and CN-33) before and after perfusion with GABAR and AchR blockers. These experiments demonstrate that MBON-m1 and CN-33 receive indirect functional excitatory and inhibitory input from KCs, consistent with the predictions from the connectome. We have added new Figure 4e and 6d with these results.</p><p>ii. We have performed a low N of new experiments in which we imaged CN-33 responses to conditioned and unconditioned odor following aversive training. These experiments show that CN-33 response to conditioned odor is significantly reduced. We have included Figure for Reviewers with these results.</p><p>iii. Since we could not generate a large N for the above learning experiments due to the pandemic and lack of childcare, we have removed the speculation about the role of CN-33 in learning from the Abstract and the Results to focus only the structural and functional connections from MB and LH onto CN-33. Based on the structural and functional connections, in the Discussion we speculate that aversive learning could skew CN-33 responses to learning in a similar way to MBON-m1.</p><p>In summary, the main findings and contributions of our manuscript are:</p><p>1. Providing, for the first time, a comprehensive synaptic-resolution wiring diagram of the circuitry downstream of mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) and lateral horn neurons (LHNs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva.</p><p>2. Identifying, for the first time, the actions evoked by the activation of individual larval MBON types. We show that MBONs from aversive memory compartments promote approach (promote crawling and repress turning), whereas MBONs from appetitive compartments promote avoidance (promote turning and repress crawling).</p><p>3. Integrating the structural information with neurotransmitter profiles of MBONs and their roles in promoting actions.</p><p>4. Comprehensive characterisation of the patterns of convergence between MBONs and LHNs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae.</p><p>5. Discovery of CNs that receive convergent inputs of opposite sign and opposite valence from MB and LH pathways.</p><p>6. For two members of this population we demonstrate they receive functionally excitatory connections from an attractive LH pathway and both functionally excitatory and inhibitory connections from the MB pathway. This functional connectivity is consistent with the structural input from both excitatory and inhibitory MBONs. Interestingly, the excitatory MBONs that provide input to these two CNs are approach-promoting, and the MBONs that provide inhibitory input to these CNs are avoidance-promoting.</p><p>7. For these two members of the CN population we also demonstrate their activation promotes approach and their inhibition promotes avoidance, consistent with the findings that they receive excitatory input from MBONs and LHNs that promote approach and inhibitory input from MBONs that promote avoidance.</p><p>8. For one of these CNs (MBON-m1) we also show that aversive training reduces their responses to paired odor, compared to unpaired odor.</p><p>9. Based on these findings we speculate in the Discussion that the newly discovered population of CNs could compute integrated odor value (by comparing their excitatory approach-promoting and inhibitory avoidance-promoting inputs) and promote actions based on this integrated value. While it is beyond the scope of this already large study to investigate in detail the role of each of these CNs in memory-based action selection, we think that identifying a candidate population of neurons that could be involved in the computation of integrated value and action selection is very important and will inspire numerous targeted follow-up studies.</p><p>Just the EM reconstruction alone is a valuable resource for the community and would merit publication on its own.</p><p>We have gone much further to test functionally some of the structural connections observed in the connectome and to test the behaviors evoked by MBONs and some CNs. We have further confirmed that conditioned odor response of at least one of the CNs (MBON-m1) is modified by associative learning. Based on these findings we speculate in the Discussion that other newly discovered populations of CNs could be modified in a similar way.</p><p>We believe that the structural and functional connectivity findings and behavioral activation results merit publication because they provide a slew of new circuit motifs and candidate pathways that are a valuable resource for many future follow up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript uses a combination of EM-based connectomics, behavior, and calcium imaging to explore how learned and innate valence signals are integrated to drive action selection in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Building on previous work where the authors characterized the valence of memory encoding for mushroom body compartments, they then characterize the valence encoding of the output neurons for each of these compartments, and reconstruct all downstream targets. They find a complex network of downstream neurons which receive input from mushroom body output neurons encoding opposite valances. Using behavior, optogenetics, and calcium imaging the authors explore how two such convergence neurons might integrate both learned and innate valence, as well as signals of opposite valence.</p><p>This work exploring the integration of valence signals in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system represents an interesting parallel with the author’s other recent work exploring how memory encoding in the mushroom body. Most of the conclusions are well supported. However, there are a number of issues that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>1. Conclusions of the paper</p><p>a. The primary hypothesis of this paper seems to be that in addition to depression of the KC-MBON connection due to aversive learning, shown in (Eschbach 2020), there exist other mechanisms for the comparing of learned valences, including integration at both the MBON and CN level.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what the Reviewer means by “shown in Eschbach 2020”. We had not shown that MBONs are depressed by learning in Eschbach 2020, although studies in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown this. Here, we have shown that MBON-m1 response to CS+ is depressed by learning (Figure 5a). Our main question in this study was about the way in which inputs from distinct MBONs (encoding distinct valences) are integrated with each other and with LH inputs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One proposed mechanism is that MBONs encoding opposite valences inhibit one another. The connectome only somewhat supports this mechanism. Of the tested MBONs, only 2 show the strict lateral inhibition described. Three have no interactions, two inhibit MBONs with both the same and opposite valence, one excites MBONs of both the same and opposite valence, and one inhibits an MBON of the same valence. Based on these connection motifs, can it really be said that lateral inhibition is a general principle for mushroom body organization?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point. Our intention was not to suggest that lateral inhibition was the main mechanism for comparing learned valences. In fact, lateral inhibition between MBONs could only occur for some compartments (tip of the VL, CA, upper toe of the ML, LA and MBON-m1), but not for others. On its own it would not be sufficient to explain a winner-take-all action selection mechanism. Our intention was to propose that lateral inhibition could contribute to comparing learned valences and increasing the contrast between them. We would argue, however, that the existence of lateral inhibition between at least some MBONs of opposite valence is one of the general principles of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MB organisation, since it has been found both in the adult (Felsenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, Nature, 2017) and in the larva (in this study).</p><p>We have modified the relevant section in the Results in the text to clarify these points:</p><p>“We therefore combined the behavioral effects of MBON activation with this information (Figure 2i). […] We therefore investigated if interactions between MBONs could be found one synapse downstream of the MBONs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The latter half of the paper focuses on two CNs, one an MBON itself, and another a feedback neuron (described in Eschbach 2020). The author’s primary argument is that these neurons integrate both learned and innate valences, as well as are integrating inputs of MBONs of opposite valence.</p></disp-quote><p>Our connectome has revealed that CN-33 and MBON-m1 receive strong (more than 10 synapses) and reliable (in both hemispheres) direct synaptic inputs from excitatory and inhibitory MBONs of opposite valence. Thus, MBON-m1 receives GABAergic and glutamatergic input from avoidance-promoting MBON-i1 and -h1, and cholinergic input from approach-promoting MBON-e1. CN-33 receives glutamatergic input from avoidance-promoting MBON-i1 and MBON-e2, and cholinergic input from the approach-promoting MBON-e1.</p><p>However, we do agree that we had not previously shown that the structural inputs from the cholinergic, GABA-ergic and glutamatergic MBONs are functional.</p><p>To address this point we have therefore designed experiments to test whether CN-33 and MBON-m1 receive convergent functional inhibitory and excitatory input from their presynaptic MBONs, consistent with the structural connectome. We do not have LexA lines for individual MBONs (or CNs) to activate them directly. Instead, we activated KCs to indirectly activate MBONs and imaged the responses of CN33 and MBON-m1 to pan-KC activation before and after perfusion with GABAR/vGluR (picrotoxin, PTX) and AchR (mecamylamine, ME) blockers. We observed significantly increased excitatory responses to KC activation in the CNs after perfusion with the GABAR/vGluR blocker, demonstrating functional excitatory inputs from the MB pathway, consistent with the structural inputs onto these neurons from cholinergic MBONs. This result also demonstrates that MBON-m1 and CN-33 receive strong inhibitory (GABAergic or glutamataregic) inputs which can prevent the excitatory response, consistent with structural inputs from GABAergic and glutamatergic MBONs. The excitatory responses were abolished in the presence of AchR blocker. In addition, when bathed with saline, the CNs show KC-evoked mixed responses (excitatory, inhibitory, or absent), which is visible when considering the overall absolute amplitude in fluorescence change. This result is consistent with the prior findings in vivo that we reported in the manuscript in Figure 4d and 6c.</p><p>In our view these new functional connectivity experiments in the presence and absence of blockers provide conclusive evidence for the existence of both functionally excitatory and inhibitory connections from the MB onto CN-33 and MBON-m1. These functional inputs are consistent with the direct synaptic inputs from cholinergic and GABAergic or glutamatergic MBONs onto CN-33 and MBON-m1. The functionally excitatory connection from KCs onto MBON-m1 could be mediated both by KCs and excitatory MBONs. However, KCs are not known to be inhibitory, so the functionally inhibitory connections from KCs onto MBON-m1 must be indirect, mediated by MBONs. CN-33, does not receive any direct KC input, so both the functional excitatory and inhibitory connections must be mediated by the MBONs. At the same time the connectome shows that CN-33 receives inhibitory input from MBON-i1 and -e2 that promote avoidance and excitatory input from MBON-e1 that promotes approach. Similarly, MBON-m1 receives inhibitory input from MBON-i1 and- h1 that promote avoidance and cholinergic input from MBON-e1 that promotes approach. Thus the direct inhibitory inputs onto CNs are provided by MBONs that promote avoidance, and direct excitatory inputs are provided by MBONs that promote approach. Together, this structural and functional connectivity data provides strong support for the idea that CN-33 and MBON-m1 integrate input of opposite sign from MBONs of opposite valence. However, we cannot also exclude the possibility that some of the functionally excitatory and inhibitory input we observed in our functional connectivity experiments is mediated by MB2Ons that are downstream of these MBONs and that also synapse onto CNs.</p><p>We have added new Figures 4e and 6d with these results and new sessions in the Results sections. We have also mentioned that some of the functional inputs may be mediated by MB2Ons.</p><p>“Our observation that MBON-m1 has excitatory response to KC activation in some individuals, inhibitory response in some, or no response in others suggests it receives both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the MB pathway. […] We speculate that learning could modulate the balance of excitation and inhibition onto MBON-m1 by modifying the strength of direct KC input onto MBON-m1 as well as KC input onto excitatory or inhibitory MBONs that synapse onto MBON-m1.”</p><p>“CN-33 receives direct synaptic input both from inhibitory avoidance-promoting and from excitatory approach-promoting MBONs, which could counterbalance each other. Consistent with this anatomical connectivity, adding the GABA/vGluT receptor blocker, PTX, revealed strong excitatory responses of CN33 to KC activation (Wilcoxon test, p&lt;0.01). This experiment confirms that CN-33 receives functional inhibitory and excitatory input from KCs (Figure 6d). Since CN-33 does not receive any direct KC input but does receive direct MBON input, these functional connections must be indirect and mediated by the MBONs (and possibly also by MB2Ons that receive input from these MBONs and synapse onto CN-33).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data presented is consistent with the idea that both MBON-m1 and CN-33 integrate information from both the LH (innate) and the mushroom body (learned), however, it is not entirely clear that there is sufficient functional evidence to support the idea that either of these neurons is integrating MBON input of opposite valence. The connectome does suggest that this is the case, however, silencing of the mushroom body had no effect on the response of either MBON-m1 or CN-33 to odors. Pairing the odor with an aversive stimulus clearly demonstrates that the neurons are capable of integrating innate and learned stimuli, but it is unclear if the inputs from positive MBONs are being depressed as shown in the schematic in Figure 7.</p><p>2. Behavioral experiments</p><p>a. The optogenetic stimuli used for conditioning experiments in Figure 2 produce a large (startle?) response, on top of which all other behavior is measured. What evidence is there that the behavioral conditioning experiments in Figure 2 are not producing a potentiation or reduction of this light-induced startle response? This is particularly worrisome in the majority of cases where the dynamics of the conditioned behavior follow a similar time-course to the startle response. Overall, it is not convincing that this analysis is cleanly separating MBONs that would drive avoidance and approach independent of the light artifact.</p></disp-quote><p>There is indeed a consistent turning startle response to red light exposure, which appears potentiated or abolished when MBONs are activated at the same time. Our hypothesis is that this apparent modulation of the startle response indicates a role of the MBONs in modulating turning (in response to odor), in parallel and independently of the modulation of turning by the light pathway, with the two kinds of inputs (MBON activation and light) likely linearly summed for the expression of turning behavior. This reasoning is based on the reconstruction of the visual pathway which appears to converge with the odor pathway directly downstream of the LH (<italic>i.e.</italic> at the same level as the CN layer, with some overlap), and on the findings by Gepner <italic>et al.,</italic> (<italic>eLife</italic>, 2015) which showed that light and odor pathways interact linearly on turning behavior. However, we agree that based on the experiments presented in Figure 2 it was not possible to exclude that MBONs are not sufficient to modulate turning on their own, but they can only modulate the light-evoked turning responses.</p><p>To address this point we therefore performed another series of behavioural experiments where larvae were constantly exposed to blue light of low intensity and red light with randomly varying intensity (a white noise stimulus). Under these conditions control larvae adapt to the light stimulus and ignore the changes in variation of red light stimuli, and do not show red light-induced turning responses (See empty Split control in new Figure 2 —figure supplement 3a-c). However, we found that the changes in red light intensity still modulated turning in individuals expressing CsChrimson in specific MBONs, demonstrating that MBONs can promote or repress turning and crawling even when there is no response to light. Thus, their effect is independent of the light-induced startle response.</p><p>In these experiments we performed reverse-correlation analysis to further demonstrate the role of MBONs in promoting approach or avoidance, as previously done for ORs (Gepner <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>eLife</italic> 2015) and asked whether the light intensity (<italic>i.e.</italic> the activity of MBON was reducing or increasing prior to turns).</p><p>We tested a subset of MBONs whose activation promoted turning in our previous experiments (avoidance-promoting) and a subset whose activation repressed turning (approach-promoting).</p><p>Consistent with our previous results we found that activity of the two sets of MBONs had opposite correlation with turning behaviour (new Figure 2 —figure supplement 3a-b).</p><p>For the avoidance-promoting MBONs from appetitive compartments, turns occurred after a significant increase in light intensity (<italic>i.e.</italic> after an increase in their activity). This is entirely consistent with our prior finding that activating these MBONs increased turning (at the onset of light).</p><p>For the approach-promoting MBONs from aversive compartments turns occurred after a significant decrease in light intensity (<italic>i.e.</italic> after a decrease in their activity). This is entirely consistent with our prior finding that reducing the activity in these MBONs increased turning (at the offset of light).</p><p>These results are further consistent with the idea that an increase in the activity of avoidance promoting MBONs promotes turning, resulting in avoidance of an odor whose concentration is increasing. Conversely, a decrease in the activity of approach-promoting MBONs promotes turning. This ensures that if the animal is crawling away from an attractive odor source it turns to correct its course.</p><p>These experiments also enabled us to analyse how the increase or decrease in MBON activity during a single head cast (turn) influences the likelihood of acceptance or rejection of that turn direction (new Figure 2 —figure supplement 3c). Larvae are known to accept turns during which they sense an increase in the concentration of an attractive odor and reject casts during which they sense an increase in the concentration of an aversive odor (Gomez-Marin and Louis 2012, Gershow et al., 2012).</p><p>The reverse correlation analysis showed that, for avoidance-promoting MBONs, the greater the light intensity (<italic>i.e.</italic> MBON activity) during a head cast, the greater the likelihood of rejecting that direction and performing another head-cast. Conversely, for approach-promoting MBONs, the greater the decrease in light intensity (<italic>i.e.</italic> MBON activity) during a turn, the higher the likelihood of accepting that direction (and not performing another head cast).</p><p>We believe these new experiments clearly demonstrate that MBON activity directly affects actions involved in odor navigation, such as the probability of turning and the probability of accepting a new direction after a head-sweep.</p><p>We have added new Figure 2 —figure supplement 3a-c. with these results and the following section in the Results:</p><p>“In our experiments we observed a turn response to the red light used for optogenetic activation in control animals. We wanted to rule out the possibility that MBONs only modulate the light-evoke startle and confirm they could modulate turning even in the absence of a light-evoked turn. For a subset of positive- and negative-valence MBONs we therefore repeated the optogenetic manipulation experiments in a different way, by constantly exposing larvae to dim blue light of constant intensity and bright red light (for CsChrimson activation) of randomly varying intensity (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3a-c). Under these conditions, control larvae habituated to light and did not show light-induced startle responses. Reverse-correlation analysis[51,56,57] between turning and red light intensity revealed that larvae with CsChrimson in negative-valence MBONs turn following an increase in red light intensity (<italic>i.e.</italic> an increase in MBON activity), and larvae with CsChrimson in positive-valence MBONs turn following a decrease in light intensity (<italic>i.e.</italic> a decrease in MBON activity, Figure 2 —figure supplement 3a-b). Also, for negative-valence MBONs, the greater the change in light intensity during a turn, the higher the probability of rejecting that direction and performing another turn. Conversely, for positive-valence MBONs, the greater the change in light intensity during a turn, the higher the probability of accepting that turn direction (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3a and 3c). This indicates that activity in MBONs impacts multiple behavioral components involved in avoidance or approach of a sensory stimulus in a way that is consistent with their valence.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Each MBON in Figure 2 is classified as driving either approach or avoidance, but the dynamics of their angular steering and speed vary widely. This should at least be discussed in the text, and the authors should justify their decision for categorization in light of this variability.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. In the text, we had discussed the existence or absence of a turning response to the reduction in activation (at the offset of light) for some MBONs, but we did not indeed mention other kinds of variability.</p><p>Thus, while all avoidance promoting MBONs increase turning in response to an increase in their activity, relative to controls, some of them evoke stronger turning responses than others, and some of them evoke prolonged turning responses compared to others. For example MBON-a2 promotes turning throughout the period in which it is activated, whether some adaptation of the turning response is observed for other MBONs.</p><p>Similarly, while all avoidance-promoting MBONs promote turning in response to an increase in their activity, only two of them also promote crawling in response to a decrease in their activity. Thus, the reduction in MBON-h1/h2 and MBON-i1 evokes an increase in crawling speed compared to controls. This response to light-offset is not observed for MBON-a2, -k1, and e2.</p><p>Conversely, while all approach-promoting MBONs repress turning in response to an increase in their activity, two of them (MBON-m1 and MBON-a1) also evoke an increase in mean crawling speed, compared to controls, while others do not.</p><p>Finally, three approach-promoting MBONs evoke an increase in turning, compared to controls, in response to a decrease in their activity at light offset (MBON-a1, -g1/g2, and m1), but others do not.</p><p>This does indeed suggest that even MBONs of the same type could provide slightly different contributions to the avoidance or approach response. This could potentially enable the larva to learn specific types of avoidance or approach responses depending on the type of punishment or reward.</p><p>We have now added a description of the variable effects of different MBONs and a speculation about the possible roles of this variability in learning specific conditioned responses:</p><p>“Activating some MBONs repressed turning and promoted crawling, compared to controls (Figure 2bc and e-g). […] This suggests that the MB could potentially allow different types of aversive memories to be differentially expressed (with varying durations of turns, speeds of crawling or efficacies of navigational strategies).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Calcium Imaging experiments</p><p>The calcium imaging data throughout the paper is quite noisy and responses are variable across individual animals. The authors sometimes attribute this variability to biological variability in circuit connectivity (eg, Figure 6). Where this is done, it is worth including an explicit comparison of within fly vs across variability, to test the degree to which responses are stereotyped within an animal.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment we have now applied ANOVA on the data in order to assess how stereotyped the responses are within animals (see new Supplementary File 2).</p><p>Of note, the variability of responses to the optogenetic activation of KCs, or to natural odor is primarily inter-individual rather than intra-individual: the Anova analysis shows a strong individual effect on the response both for MBON-m1 and CN-33 (new Supplementary File 2).</p><p>Furthermore, we also found that the inter-animal variability in response to odor was larger (relative to the overall variance) when the MBs are functional, than when MBs are inactivated (in animals in which KCs express TNT; new Supplementary File 2). This suggests that the inter-animal variability is coming from the learning pathway, rather than from the innate pathway.</p><p>We have added new sections in the Results and Discussion mentioning this analysis.</p><p>Results</p><p><bold>“</bold>Interestingly, odor-evoked responses were highly variable across individuals (ranging from inhibition to excitation), even though, on average across individuals the response was excitatory (Figure 4c). ANOVA revealed that inter-individual variability was significantly higher than the intra-individual variability (<italic>i.e.</italic> high and significant Fisher’s F in Supplementary File 2). Compared to those with silenced KCs, inter-animal variability in animals with a functional MB contributed to a higher fraction of the overall variance in odor response (Figure 4c, and compare the r<sup>2</sup> coefficients in Supplementary File 2). This suggests that the MB could be a significant source of inter-individual variability in odor-evoked responses in MBONm1.”</p><p><bold>“</bold>We found that the inter-individual variability of MBON-m1 responses to KC activation was significantly higher than the intra-individual variability (see Fisher’s F in Supplementary File 2). The variability in the response to KC activation between individuals could be due to a number of factors, including slightly different levels of CsChrimson expression, different states or different experiences.”</p><p>“As was the case for MBON-m1, ANOVA revealed that inter-individual variability in CN-33 odor response was significantly higher than the intra-individual variability (<italic>i.e</italic>. high and significant Fisher’s F in Supplementary File 2). In addition, compared to those with silenced KCs, inter-animal variability in animals with a functional MB contributed to a higher fraction of the overall variance in odor response (<italic>i.e.</italic> compare the r<sup>2</sup> coefficients in Supplementary File 2). The MB could therefore be a significant source of inter-individual variability in odor-evoked responses of CN-33.”</p><p><bold>“</bold>As for MBON-m1, we found high interindividual variability of response to KCs activation compared to intraindividual variability (<italic>i.e.</italic> significant Fisher’s F, Supplementary File 2), which suggests that the balance of excitatory vs. inhibitory drive from MB pathways onto CN-33 is individual-specific.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p><bold>“</bold>We observed high variability in the responses of both CN-33 and MBON-m1 both to activation of the whole MB pathway, as well as to odor presentation. […] Therefore, the average response across untrained individuals might be similar to the response of a single individual in a naive neutral state (with any interindividual differences averaged out across a population), and the variability may represent the degree of freedom for the MB to tune this response to a stimulus depending on previous experience or state.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
