There is an ongoing dispute regarding the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the emergence of awareness, which is partially raised by the confound between report- and awareness-related activity. To address this problem, we designed a visual awareness task that can minimize report-related motor confounding. Our results show that saccadic latency is significantly shorter in the aware trials than in the unaware trials. Local field potential (LFP) data from six patients consistently show early (200–300ms) awareness-related activity in the PFC, including event-related potential and high-gamma activity. Moreover, the awareness state can be reliably decoded by the neural activity in the PFC since the early stage, and the neural pattern is dynamically changed rather than being stable during the representation of awareness. Furthermore, the enhancement of dynamic functional connectivity, through the phase modulation at low frequency, between the PFC and other brain regions in the early stage of the awareness trials may explain the mechanism of conscious access. These results indicate that the PFC is critically involved in the emergence of awareness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual consciousness</kwd><kwd>frontal lobe</kwd><kwd>local field potential</kwd><kwd>event related potential</kwd><kwd>iEEG</kwd><kwd>saccade</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STI2030-Major Projects+2021ZD0204300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Mingsha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32061143004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Mingsha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32030045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Mingsha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011161</institution-id><institution>State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open Research Fund CNLZD2202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Yongzheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While minimizing the report-related motor confounding, event-related potential (ERP), high-frequency power, and functional connectivity of the local field potential (LFP) activity in human prefrontal cortex were enhanced under the emergence of visual awareness.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A conscious state means that a person has some kind of subjective experiences, such as seeing a painting, hearing a sound, thinking about a problem, or feeling an emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al., 2016</xref>). The neural mechanism of consciousness is one of the most fundamental, exciting and challenging pursuits in the 21st-century brain science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mashour, 2018</xref>). Among the various aspects of consciousness, visual awareness, as a core of consciousness, has attracted enormous attention in consciousness research. Visual awareness seems quite simple: we see an object and seem to immediately know its shape, color and other properties. However, the neural processes behind the emergence of visual awareness are quite sophisticated and largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dehaene et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The typical method to study the neural mechanism of visual awareness is to present external stimuli with similar physical properties but to elicit different conscious experiences, such as using near perceptual threshold stimuli, visual masking, or attentional blinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim and Blake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dehaene and Changeux, 2011</xref>). Then, the aware and unaware states are determined through the subjective reports of participants, and the awareness-related neural activity is dissociated by the brain activation difference between the two states. Using this approach, some studies have found that activities in broad brain regions are correlated with visual awareness. For example, an fMRI study of lexical visual masking found that only consciously perceived and reported words can induce activation of higher-order cortical regions such as the frontal and parietal lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dehaene et al., 2001</xref>). Another study using a visual masking task found changes in the amplitude of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals and high-gamma power in occipital-temporal regions, which indicated that these regions played an important role in the emergence of awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisch et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>However, there is still much debate about the origin of conscious awareness in the brain. Some hypotheses (global neuronal workspace theory, higher-order theory, etc.) argued that visual awareness arose from the frontoparietal network, in which the prefrontal cortex played a key role, and they argued that the earliest biomarker of awareness in EEG is the P3b wave onset approximately 300ms after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mashour et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2019</xref>). For example, based on the electrophysiological study of a visual awareness-guided saccade selection paradigm in macaques, by comparing the action potential firing characteristics of neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), V4 and V1, only dlPFC neurons were closely associated with visual awareness states. Therefore, the authors argued that stimuli must elicit a threshold level of prefrontal activity for conscious detection to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Vugt et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, other hypotheses (integrated information theory, recurrent processing theory, etc.) proposed that the ‘hot zone’ of the posterior cortex of the brain, including the parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe, is sufficient to generate visual awareness, and its biomarkers on EEG are the relatively earlier visual awareness negativity (VAN) at approximately 200ms after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamme, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dembski et al., 2021</xref>), whereas the PFC is not necessary for the emergence of conscious experience.</p><p>This controversy is partially caused by the confounding effect of report-related activity, such as motor planning and execution, on awareness-related activity. The reason is that the study of awareness usually requires subjective reports to determine different awareness states, while the prefrontal cortex is closely related to such report-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seth and Bayne, 2022</xref>). To solve this problem, some researchers use the no-report paradigm to rule out report-related impacts. For instance, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study employing human binocular rivalry paradigms found that when subjects need to manually report the changing of their awareness between conflict visual stimuli, the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes all exhibited awareness-related activity. However, when report was not required, awareness-related activation was largely diminished in the frontal lobe but remained in the occipital and parietal lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frässle et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the no-report paradigm may overestimate the neural correlates of awareness by including unconscious processing, because it infers the awareness state through other relevant physiological indicators, such as optokinetic nystagmus and pupil size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsuchiya et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of subjective reports, it remains controversial regarding whether the presented stimuli are truly seen or not. Therefore, neither the typical report paradigm nor the no-report paradigm is ideal for visual awareness research, thus, it is difficult to solve the problem of whether the PFC participates in conscious perception.</p><p>In addition, when studying the role of the PFC in visual awareness, the noninvasive technologies mostly used in previous studies, that is, Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and M/EEG have limitations. Although fMRI research can detect the whole brain activation pattern, it is difficult to describe the dynamic changes and sequences of different brain regions in the rapid process of visual awareness due to its limited time resolution (approximately several seconds). For example, even though a recent fMRI study using the no-reported paradigm found that there are still visual awareness-related activities in the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kronemer et al., 2022</xref>), it remains unclear when these activities begin and whether PFC activity occurs earlier or later than other brain regions. At the same time, although EEG and MEG have a very high temporal resolution, their low spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio limit their interpretation of awareness-related activities, especially high-frequency activities (highly correlated with local population neuronal activities). For example, although increasing evidence shows that the earliest biomarker of visual awareness in EEG is more likely to be the VAN, which starts at approximately 180–300ms (may be delayed to 300–460ms for low-visible stimulus) and peaks at the parieto-occipital region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Northoff and Lamme, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koivisto and Revonsuo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koivisto et al., 2008</xref>), rather than the P3b wave onset at approximately 300–500ms which peaks in the central frontoparietal region, it is still unclear whether there are local visual awareness-related activities in the PFC during the VAN period. In addition, a few recent studies have suggested that awareness may be related to the activities of brain networks, including the PFC, rather than that of a single brain region. However, most of these brain network studies used noninvasive research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kronemer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2023</xref>), and due to the limitations mentioned above, it is difficult to detect the dynamic changes in brain networks in a more precise spatial-temporal profile during the generation of visual awareness.</p><p>To address the questions mentioned above, we designed a novel visual awareness task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that can minimize motor-related confounding, while retaining the explicit subjective report. The contrast of the cue stimulus (grating) was roughly divided into three levels: well above the visual perceptual threshold, near the visual perceptual threshold and zero contrast (no stimulus). During each experiment, in nearly 80% of trials, the contrast of the grating was close to the subject’s visual perceptual threshold so that the subjects could sometimes see the grating and sometimes could not. Subjects were required to choose a saccade direction according to the visual awareness state (seeing the grating or not seeing the grating) and the color of the fixation point. Notably, subjects were unable to choose the saccade direction or effectively prepare for saccades until the color of the fixation point was changed. Moreover, the subjects needed to choose the saccade direction, both in the awareness and unawareness states, according to the color of the fixation point so that the report behaviors were matched between the two awareness states. Such a paradigm can effectively dissociate awareness-related activity from motor-related activity in terms of time (the fixation point changes color 650ms after the grating onset) and report behavior, thereby being report-independent of the awareness states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merten and Nieder, 2012</xref>), thus minimizing the impact of motor-related factors on visual awareness. In addition, saccade parameters (such as reaction time, etc.) under different awareness states can be compared to explore the influence of visual awareness on saccade behavior. Then, we applied the above behavioral paradigm to six clinical patients with implanted electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography, sEEG) in prefrontal and other cortices and 10 healthy subjects. The behavior and local field potential (LFP) data of six patients were recorded while they performed the task, and we also collected the behavioral data of 10 healthy subjects for comparison with the patients’ behavioral data.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the visual awareness task.</title><p>A trial started when a fixation point (0.5°x0.5°, white cross) appeared at the center of the screen (radius of eye position check window is 4°, the dotted circle). After the subject fixated on the fixation point for 600ms, a cue stimulus (Gabor grating, 2x2° circle) was presented for 50ms at a fixed position (7°) on the left (or right, see Methods) side of the screen for all participants. In 70% of the trials, the grating contrast was maintained near the subject’s perceptual threshold by a staircase method; in 10% of the trials, the stimulus contrast was well above the threshold; and in the other 20% of the trials, the stimulus contrast was 0, namely, no stimulus appeared. After another 600ms delay, the color of the fixation point turned red or green, and two saccade targets (1x1°, white square) appeared at fixed positions (10°) on the left and right sides of the screen. If the grating was seen, the green fixation point was required to make a saccade to the right target, while the red fixation point was required to make a saccade to the left target. If the grating was not seen, the rule of saccadic direction was inverted.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89076-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral results</title><p>To detect the effect of cue stimulus (grating) contrast on the emergence of visual awareness, we first analyzed the proportion of participants being aware of the grating as a function of its contrast. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows exemplified sessions from a patient and healthy subject, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the population results of the two participant groups.

We compared the saccadic parameters between the awareness and unawareness states in near-threshold contrast levels (NA vs. NU), as well as in high and low contrast levels (HA vs. LU), as a control. While saccadic reaction time showed a significant difference between the two awareness states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the other parameters did not. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) shows the mean saccadic reaction time of patients and healthy subjects under different awareness states and contrast levels. The results showed that the average saccadic reaction time was significantly shorter under the awareness state than under the unawareness state at both the near-threshold contrast level and the high-low contrast level (p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test), and it was also explicit and consistent at the individual level. The results showed that the saccadic reaction time in the aware trials was systematically shorter than that in the unaware trials. Such results demonstrate that visual awareness significantly affects the speed of information processing in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Local field potential results</title><p>While the patients were performing our visual awareness task, we recorded the local field potential (LFP) from 901 recording sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, projected on Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain template ICBM152), in which 245 sites were located in the PFC.

There was a vigorous visual evoked response under the HA condition (light red line) compared to the LU (light blue line) condition.

Furthermore, we applied the temporal generalization method to the HG activity. Although the group results still show that the decoding performance of HG activity is limited in time generalization, the generalization results are not consistent at the individual level, which may be attributed to the variability of electrode location in different patients.

To rule out this possibility, we compared the distribution of grating contrast in the NA and NU conditions for each patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Overall, we find that the distributions of grating contrasts largely overlap with each other (red and blue curves). The Kolmogorov‒Smirnov test resulted in no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) between the two contrast distributions in all patients except patient 2. Although intuitively the trials with higher contrast contributed more to the NA condition and the trials with lower contrast contributed more to the NU condition, the contrast difference between the NA and NU conditions were not significantly different perhaps because the grating contrast was designed to be near the perceptual threshold (the ‘aware’ percent is 50%) in most trials. Moreover, for patient 2, the difference between the mean grating contrast in the NA and NU trials was also subtle (0.15%), much less than the difference between NA and HA (17.35%) or NU and LU (0.84%). However, it is clear in the results above that the different activities between NA and NU were much stronger than those between the same awareness states, that is NA vs. HA or NU vs. LU.

Second, there are ERP and HG activities related to visual awareness in the prefrontal LFP, and these activities begin at the early stage (200–300ms). Then, we found that the awareness state can be reliably decoded from the broadband and HG activities of the PFC at approximately 200–300ms after stimulus onset. Finally, the functional connectivity between the PFC and other brain regions in the low-frequency band (1–8 Hz) also appeared awareness-related changes, and the initial time and location of this change are consistent with the above HG results. The results above are not caused by the difference in the physical properties of external stimuli. Therefore, we propose that the prefrontal cortex also plays a key role in the early stage of visual awareness generation even if motor effects are excluded.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Advantages and limitations of the behavioral paradigm used in the present study</title><p>Compared with the regular report-dependent visual awareness task, we employed a task that effectively dissociated the activity of visual awareness from the activity of saccadic decision and execution in terms of time (the fixation point changes color 650ms after the grating onset) and reporting behavior. Since the choice of reporting behavior depends on the visual awareness state and the color of the fixation point, the subjects were unable to effectively prepare the subsequent saccadic reports during the delay period of the task; thus, the visual awareness-related activity evoked by the grating stimulus and report-preparation-related activity were temporally dissociated. Furthermore, both in the awareness and unawareness states, the subjects needed to choose the saccade direction after the fixation point changes its color so that the saccade directions in the two visual awareness states were fully matched to exclude the effects of saccade preparation- and execution-related activity on visual awareness-related activity. Compared with the no-report paradigms, our novel paradigm required subjects to make explicit reports of their awareness states so that it can be more accurate regarding the judgment of the awareness status.</p><p>Moreover, the intervals for the initial fixation period and delay period were both fixed at 600ms, instead of randomly varied, in order to keep subjects’ anticipation being similar in all trials. Also, the location of grating remained same in all trials for the same purpose.</p><p>It was also worth noting that our task does not remove the confound of report entirely, that is the post-perceptual confound might relate to planning to report perception, which is different for perceived and not perceived stimuli. Nevertheless, our task did minimize the motor-related confound to awareness-related activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Visual awareness states affect saccadic reaction time</title><p>Many factors affect saccadic reaction time, including the characteristics of external stimuli and the internal state of the brain. The physical properties of external visual stimuli have a direct impact on the performance of saccades; for example, saccadic reaction time decreases with increasing visual stimulus contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allik and Kreegipuu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deplancke et al., 2010</xref>). A widely accepted view is that the greater contrast of visual stimuli will automatically attract more bottom-up attention and speed up information processing in the brain, thereby shortening the saccadic reaction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Posner and Petersen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>). Other studies found that endogenous factors, such as top-down attention, can also significantly shorten the saccadic reaction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Posner, 1980</xref>).</p><p>One study briefly reported that the average reaction time (button press) for word semantic classification in the awareness state was approximately 300ms faster than in the unawareness state, but the statistical test did not reach a significant level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaillard et al., 2009</xref>). In present study, we found that the saccadic reaction time of all subjects in the aware trials was significantly smaller than that in the unaware trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). More critically, the grating contrast near the threshold was not significantly different between the aware and unaware trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>); thus, such results cannot be merely caused by the contrast difference in the grating. Here, we showed that awareness states significantly affect saccadic reaction time, which supports our previous hypothesis.</p><p>An alternative interpretation for RT difference between aware and unaware condition in our study is that the difference in task-strategies used by subjects/patients to remember the response mapping rules between the perception and the color cue (e.g. if the YES +GREEN = RIGHT and YES +RED = LEFT rules were held in memory, while the NO mappings were inferred secondarily rather than being actively held in memory).</p><p>Another possibility is that the reaction time is strongly modulated by the confident level, which has been described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marzi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broggin et al., 2012</xref>). However, in previous studies, the confident levels were usually induced by presenting stimulus with different physical property, such as spatial frequency, eccentricity and contrast. However, the dependence of visual process on the salience of visual stimulus confounds with the effect of visual awareness on the reaction time of responsive movements, which is hard to attribute the shorter reaction time in more salient condition purely to visual awareness. In contrast, we create a condition (near aware threshold) in the present study, in which the saliency (contrast) of visual stimulus is very similar in both aware and unaware conditions in order to eliminate the influence of stimulus saliency in reaction time. We think that the difference in reaction time in our study is mainly due to the modulation of awareness state, which was not reported previously.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Visual awareness-related activities appeared in the PFC at an early stage</title><p>The long debate about the neural mechanism of consciousness focuses on the location, that is ‘front’ vs. ‘back’, and the time, that is ‘early’ vs. ‘late’, of its origin in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seth and Bayne, 2022</xref>). Concerning the dispute of location, our results show that the prefrontal cortex still displays visual awareness-related activities even after minimizing the influence of the motor-related confounding variables related to subjective reports such as motion preparation, which indicates that the prefrontal cortex does participate in the information processing of visual awareness. Regarding the time dispute, our results show that at 200–300ms after stimulus onset, the VAN time window, the prefrontal cortex has activities related to visual awareness, and these activities include not only ERP activities but also HG activities, which are highly related to the firing of local population neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisch et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, the recording sites with early ERP and HG visual awareness-related activities are mostly concentrated in the middle lateral prefrontal cortex. This shows that the prefrontal cortex, especially the middle lateral prefrontal cortex, started visual awareness-related activities, including local activities, at a relatively early stage.</p><p>Several iEEG studies have shown the early prefrontal cortical involvement in visual perception, including ERP and HFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khalaf et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vishne et al., 2023</xref>). However, in these studies, the differential activity between conscious and unconscious conditions was not investigated, thus, the activity in prefrontal cortex might be correlated with unconscious processing, rather than conscious processing. In present study, we compared the neural activity in PFC between conscious and unconscious trials, and found the correlation between PFC activity and conscious perception.</p><p>Although one iEEG study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaillard et al., 2009</xref>) reported awareness-specific PFC activation, the awareness-related activity started 300ms after the onset of visual stimuli, which was ~100ms later than the early awareness related activity in our study. Also, due to the limited number of electrodes in the previous study (2 patients with 19 recording sites mostly in mesiofrontal and peri-insular regions), it was restricted while exploring the awareness-related activity in PFC. In the present study, the number of recording sites (245) were much more than previous study and covered multiple areas in PFC. Our results further show earlier awareness-related activity (~200ms after visual stimuli onset), including ERP, HFA and PLV. These awareness-related activity in PFC occurred even earlier (~150ms after stimulus onset) for the salient stimulus trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, D</xref>, HA condition)’.</p><p>However, the proportions are much smaller than that reported by Gaillard et al, which peaked at ~60%. We think that one possibility for the difference may be due to the more sampled PFC subregions in present study and the uneven distribution of awareness-related activity in PFC. Meanwhile, we noticed that the peri-insula regions and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), which were similar with the regions reported by Gaillard et al, seemed to show more fraction of awareness-related sites than other subregions during the delay period (0–650ms after stimulus onset). To test such possibility and make comparison with the study of Gaillard et al., we calculated the proportion of awareness-related site in peri-insula and MFG regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found although the proportion of awareness-related site was larger in peri-insula and MFG than in other subregions, it was much lower than the report of Gaillard et al. One alternative possibility for the difference between these two studies might be due to the more complex task in Gaillard et al. Nevertheless, we think these new results would contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanism underlying conscious perception, especially for the role of PFC.</p><p>Some recent studies utilizing the no-report paradigm supported our results. For example, a recent electrophysiological study of rhesus monkeys found that even if monkeys do not need to report their conscious content under the binocular competition paradigm, there were also visual awareness-related spiking activities in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kapoor et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, some previous human intracranial studies also reported ERP, HG, and single-neuron activities related to visual perception in the higher visual areas of the temporal lobe, such as the superior temporal gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reber et al., 2017</xref>). However, due to the limitations of the experimental paradigm, these studies cannot completely exclude the impact of subjective reports. Moreover, most of the electrodes in previous studies were located in the temporal lobe, and electrodes in the prefrontal cortex are rare. As our data show that the proportion of sites with earlier ERP and HG responses in the prefrontal cortex is low and relatively concentrated, it is not hard to explain that earlier visual awareness-related activities in the prefrontal cortex were not found in previous iEEG studies, especially in the HG band. Our results, on the one hand, support that the prefrontal cortex may play an important role in the emergence of visual awareness and thus support the 'front of the brain’ theories of consciousness in the origin brain regions. However, our data also support the prediction of the early emergence of consciousness proposed by the 'back of the brain’ theories. This means that our result also challenges some predictions of these mainstream theories.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Awareness state can be effectively decoded from PFC activities from an early stage</title><p>Compared with traditional univariate analysis, MVPA-based machine learning decoding may be more sensitive to the information contained in brain activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grootswagers et al., 2017</xref>), so it has gradually become a powerful tool for the study of neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs). Therefore, we used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to decode the awareness states at the single-trial level through broadband and HG activities in the prefrontal cortex. Our decoding results show that whether through broadband or HG activities, the decoding performance began well above the chance level at approximately 200–300ms. This shows that the prefrontal cortex has begun to encode visual awareness-related information in 200–300ms, which is consistent with the above univariate analysis results. In addition, a recent electrophysiological study of rhesus monkeys using the no-report paradigm also found that even without the requirement of explicit reporting, awareness-related neurons can still be found in the lateral prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys, and conscious content can be accurately decoded by the MVPA method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kapoor et al., 2022</xref>). Another human fMRI study also found similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kronemer et al., 2022</xref>). These results supported our experimental results.</p><p>In addition, we also applied the temporal generalization method during decoding. Temporal generalization analysis shows how different brain activity patterns change and transform over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">King and Dehaene, 2014</xref>). Our results show that the representation pattern of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex for visual awareness-related information is dynamic, not static, and this result is very consistent at the individual level and across the control conditions. Such a result may be consistent with the nature of conscious perception. The process of conscious perception (visual awareness) includes a series of processes from phenomenal consciousness (‘qulia’) to conscious access. Therefore, at the level of large, high-order brain regions, the representation of this complex process in the brain should be continuously transmitted and transformed, that is, dynamically changed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Evaluate the role of the prefrontal cortex in visual awareness at the brain network level</title><p>There is growing evidence showing that conscious experience may be represented at the brain network level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kronemer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2023</xref>). Thanks to the simultaneously recorded LFP data in multiple brain regions with a high signal-to-noise ratio and high spatial-temporal resolution, we can analyze the dynamic functional connectivity changes under the aware and unaware conditions at the millisecond scale. Since the signals in the low-frequency band are more involved in the information interaction between different brain regions and the activities in the high-frequency band are more representative of the local neural activities, it is easy to understand the functional connectivity changes in the low-frequency band between relatively distant brain regions. Some previous studies have found that the phase synchronization of neural activities in beta and gamma bands is related to visual awareness, but because most of these studies are based on fMRI, it is difficult to describe the dynamic changes in such brain networks on a more precise time scale. The only human iEEG study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaillard et al., 2009</xref>) reported that the phase synchronization of the beta band in the aware condition also occurred relatively late (&gt;300ms) and mainly confined to posterior zones but not PFC. Moreover, most of these studies did not rule out the influence of motor-related processing, and these processes are often associated with changes in the functional connectivity of multiple brain regions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report dynamic changes in functional connectivity on the millisecond time scale in the low-frequency band (1–8 Hz) associated with visual awareness, and this change is not caused by motor-related confounding factors, such as motion preparation. Moreover, the early sites of PLV and HG overlapped each other to a large extent. Such converging results may further suggest that the middle lateral prefrontal cortex, the brain regions where these sites are located, plays a crucial role in the emergence of visual awareness.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Our results may contribute to some theoretical concepts related to consciousness</title><p>Compared with the unaware trials, the high-frequency activity in the PFC and the functional connectivity between many brain regions in the aware trials increased. These results may confirm some theoretical concepts, such as ‘ignition’ and conscious access. Global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT) emphasizes ignition and conscious access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dehaene and Changeux, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mashour et al., 2020</xref>). Ignition means nonlinear brain activation to small stimulus changes (such as perceptual threshold stimulation). For the near-threshold stimulus used in the current study, while the sensory information in the brain passes through a certain threshold in a specific brain area, such as the lateral prefrontal cortex, the population of neurons discharges (HG activity of local field potential), that is, ‘ignition’. This is consistent with many previous human intracranial studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reber et al., 2017</xref>). However, as discussed above, in contrast with previous studies, our study detected earlier awareness-specific ‘ignition’ in the human PFC, while minimizing the motor-related confounding.</p><p>Conscious access means that conscious contents can be shared by many other local information processors in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dehaene and Changeux, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mashour et al., 2020</xref>). For example, when you see the grating, you can either report it orally or draw it down. Such a function may require the participation and coordination of many related brain regions or networks, but there is no clear biomarker for how these brain regions coordinate. The explicit increase in the PLV, specifically appearing in the aware trials, in the low-frequency band found in the current study may provide potential biological meaning for conscious access; that is, many brain regions interact with each other through phase synchronization in the low-frequency band to accomplish information sharing of conscious content.</p><p>Interestingly, the beginning time of prefrontal visual awareness-related activities found in ERP and HG activities is very consistent with the onset time of dynamic functional connectivity enhancement, both of which start at 200–300ms. In addition, the dynamic functional connectivity of the sites with early HG visual awareness-related activity is usually the earliest to enhance compared to other sites, and the two have good consistency. And this consistency suggested that conscious access and phenomenal awareness may be closely coupled, occurring initially in the lateral PFC at the early stage, and indicate a potential process of conscious perception: subtle change in the external stimulus or internal brain state - population neuron discharge in specific brain areas (ignition, phenomenal consciousness appeared) - phase synchronization of various brain areas induced by specific brain areas (conscious access). Further research is needed to regulate the activity of the middle lateral prefrontal cortex in the high-gamma band or the phase synchronization in the low-frequency band to explore whether the prefrontal cortex plays a causal role in the process of conscious perception.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>Six adult patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (6 males, 32.33±4.75 years old, mean ± SEM) and 10 healthy subjects (4 males, 6 females, age 27.80±3.92, mean ± SEM) participated in this study.

After the subject fixated on the fixation point for 600ms, a cue stimulus (Gabor grating, 2x2° circle) was presented for 50ms at a fixed position (7°) on the left (or right) side of the screen for all participants. The side where the grating appears (left or right) is opposite to the hemisphere where the patients’ electrodes are implanted (left or right). For example, if the patient’s electrodes are implanted on the right side, the grating would appear on the left side of the screen. For patients 1, 5, and 6, the electrodes were implanted in both hemispheres, and the grating is set on the right side. In 70% of the trials, the grating contrast (weber contrast, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Vugt et al., 2018</xref>) was maintained near the subject’s perceptual threshold by a 1 up/1 down staircase method, and the step was either 0.39% or 0.78% for each participant. In 10% of the trials, the stimulus contrast was well above the threshold, and in the other 20% of the trials, the stimulus contrast was 0, namely, no stimulus appeared. After another 600ms delay, the color of the fixation point turned red or green, and two saccade targets (1° x 1°, white square) appeared at fixed positions (10°) on the left and right sides of the screen. If the grating was seen, the green fixation point was required to make a saccade to the right target, while the red fixation point was required to make a saccade to the left target.

Gratings with high contrast (well above the perceptual threshold) and zero contrast (grating absent) served as control conditions to evaluate the understanding and performance of the task.

To simplify such complex issue, we consider the change in magnitude of LFP during delay period in our task represents awareness related activity, regardless its actual value being positive or negative. Therefore, we first calculated the absolute value of activity difference between aware and unaware trials in individual recording site, then used Shepard’s method to calculate the activity in each vertex and projected on the surface of brain template as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Decoding Analysis</title><p>We implemented a machine learning framework for trial-by-trial classification using broadband amplitude and high-gamma magnitude of LFP activities in the PFC via the MVPA-Light toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guggenmos et al., 2018</xref>). We applied the LDA classification and temporal generalization on each participant separately, and all trials from each class were undersampled to balance the unequal trial number between different conditions. Then, the trials were randomly assigned into 10 folds, and all trials within each fold were subaveraged across every four trials to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Decoding was then followed with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure on the subaveraged trials. This procedure was repeated 10 times so that each fold in the dataset was used exactly once for testing, and at least once for training, but never at the same time. And the fold assignment was repeated five times, which resulted in total 50 iterations for the decoding analysis of each patient.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Functional Connectivity analysis</title><p>The time-across phase-locking value (PLV) was calculated in the brainstorm toolbox. Time-frequency transformation was conducted via the Hilbert transform method. The time-across PLV measures if the phase difference between two signals is consistent across trials with respect to the event that defines the trials (i.e. the output is a mean across trials per time point) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercier et al., 2022</xref>). PLV values range between 0 (for totally random) and 1 (for perfect phase locking). For clear demonstration here, the mean PLV in the baseline period (−200–0ms) of each pair of recording sites was subtracted. The group analysis of PLV was performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betzel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sadaghiani et al., 2022</xref>.

Several leading theories of consciousness propose a necessary role for (at least some sub-regions of) PFC in basic perceptual awareness (e.g., global neuronal workspace theory, higher order theories), while several other leading theories posit that much of the previously reported PFC contributions to perceptual awareness may have been confounded by task-based cognition that co-varied between the aware and unaware reports (e.g., recurrent processing theory, integrated information theory). By employing intracranial EEG in human patients and a threshold detection task on low-contrast visual stimuli, the authors assessed the timing and location of neural populations in PFC that are differentially activated by stimuli that are consciously perceived vs. not perceived. Overall, the reported results support the view that certain regions of PFC do contribute to visual awareness, but at time-points earlier than traditionally predicted by GNWT and HOTs.</p><p>Major strengths of this paper include the straightforward visual threshold detection task including the careful calibration of the stimuli and the separate set of healthy control subjects used for validation of the behavioral and eye tracking results, the high quality of the neural data in six epilepsy patients, the clear patterns of differential high gamma activity and temporal generalization of decoding for seen versus unseen stimuli, and the authors' interpretation of these results within the larger research literature on this topic. This study appears to have been carefully conducted, the data were analyzed appropriately, and the overall conclusions seem warranted given the main patterns of results.</p><p>Weaknesses include the saccadic reaction time results and the potential flaws in the design of the reporting task. As the authors acknowledge, this is not a &quot;no report&quot; paradigm, rather, it's a paradigm aimed at balancing the post-perceptual cognitive and motor requirements between the seen and unseen trials. On each trial, subjects/patients either perceived the stimulus or not, and had to briefly maintain this &quot;yes/no&quot; judgment until a fixation cross changed color, and the color change indicated how to respond (saccade to the left or right). Differences in saccadic RTs (measured from the time of the fixation color change to moving the eyes to the left or right response square) were evident between the seen and unseen trials (faster for seen). In the discussion, the authors summarize several alternative explanations of the saccade results and limitations of their report paradigm that will help guide future research.</p><p>The current results help advance our understanding of the contribution of PFC to visual awareness. These results, when situated within the larger context of the rapidly developing literature on this topic provide converging evidence that some sub-regions of PFC contribute to visual awareness, but at latencies earlier than originally predicted by proponents of, especially, global neuronal workspace theory. Three recent studies that used &quot;no report paradigms&quot;, but with clearly visible stimuli, reported very similar results in PFC (Vishne et al., 2023; Broday-Dvir et al., 2023; Cogitate et al., 2023). The current study uses a report paradigm, but with consciously seen vs. unseen conditions, to fill the gap left by these previous studies, i.e., it remained unclear whether the PFC results from the previous studies were related to conscious or unconscious processing. Taken as a whole, evidence appears to be converging for a limited and early-in-time (200-300ms) contribution of PFC to visual awareness, after task and motor confounds are minimized.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89076.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors report a study in which they use intracranial recordings to dissociate subjectively aware and subjectively unaware stimuli, focusing mainly on prefrontal cortex.</p><p>The authors have dealt successfully with some of my previous concerns, especially the more direct link to the Gaillard et al., (2009) paper, and the associated analyses, has improved the manuscript.

However, in these studies, the differential activity between conscious and unconscious conditions was not investigated, thus, the activity in prefrontal cortex might be correlated with unconscious processing, rather than conscious processing. In present study, we compared the neural activity in PFC between conscious and unconscious trials, and found the correlation between PFC activity and conscious perception. Although one iEEG study(Gaillard et al., 2009) reported awareness-specific PFC activation, the awareness-related activity started 300 ms after the onset of visual stimuli, which was ~100 ms later than the early awareness related activity in our study. Also, due to the limited number of electrodes in the previous study (2 patients with 19 recording sites mostly in mesiofrontal and peri-insular regions), it was restricted while exploring the awareness-related activity in PFC. In the present study, the number of recording sites (245) were much more than previous study and covered multiple areas in PFC. Our results further show earlier awareness-related activity (~ 200 ms after visual stimuli onset), including ERP, HFA and PLV, which sheds new light on understanding of the role of PFC in conscious perception.</p><p>We have added this discussion in the MS (lines 522-536);</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the shorter reaction times for perceived vs not perceived stimuli (confident vs not confident responses) has been described many times previously and is not a new result.Thank you very much for your comment. We agree that the reaction time is strongly modulated by the confident level, which has been described previously (Broggin, Savazzi, &amp; Marzi, 2012; Marzi, Mancini, Metitieri, &amp; Savazzi, 2006). However, in previous studies, the confident levels were usually induced by presenting stimulus with different physical property, such as spatial frequency, eccentricity and contrast. It is well known that the more salient stimuli will induce the faster process of visual information and speed up the process of visuomotor transformation, eventually shorten the reaction time (Corbetta &amp; Shulman, 2002; Posner &amp; Petersen, 1990). Therefore, the dependence of visual processing on the salience of visual stimulus confounds with the effect of visual awareness on the reaction time, which is hard to attribute the shorter reaction time in more salient condition purely to visual awareness. In contrast, we create a condition (near perceptual threshold) in the present study, in which the saliency (contrast) of visual stimulus is very similar in both aware and unaware conditions in order to eliminate the influence of stimulus saliency in reaction time. We think that the difference in reaction time in our study is mainly due to the modulation of awareness state, which was not reported previously.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the discussion in the MS (lines 497-507).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Specific comments follow:</p><p>Abstract: &quot;we designed a visual awareness task that can minimize report-related confounding&quot; and in the Introduction lines 112-115: &quot;Such a paradigm can effectively dissociate awareness-related activity from report-related activity in terms of time... and report behavior&quot;; Discussion lines 481-483 &quot;even after eliminating the influence of the confounding variables related to subjective reports such as motion preparation&quot; and other similar statements in the manuscript should be removed. The task involves report using eye movements with every single stimulus. The fact that there is report for both perceived and not perceived stimuli, that the direction of report is not determined until the time of report, and that there is delay between stimulus and report, does not remove the report-related post-perceptual processing that will inevitably occur in a task where overt report is required for every single trial. For example, brain activity related to planning to report perception will only occur after perceived trials, regardless of the direction of eye movement later decided upon. This preparation to respond is different for perceived and not perceived stimuli, but is not part of the perception itself. In this way the current task is not at all unique and does not substantially differ from many other report-based tasks used previously.</p></disp-quote><p>The objective of present study is to assess whether PFC is involved in the emergence of visual awareness. To do so, it is crucial to determine the subjective awareness state as correct as possible. Considering the disadvantage of non-report paradigms in determining the subjective awareness state (Tsuchiya et al. TiCS, 2015; Mashour et al, Neuron, 2020), we employed a balanced report paradigm. It has been argued (Merten &amp; Nieder, PNAS, 2011) that, in the balanced report paradigms, subjects could not prepare any motor response during the delay period because only the appearance of a rule cue (change color of fixation point at the end of delay period) informed subjects about the appropriate motor action. In this case, the post-perceptual processing during delay period might reflect the non-motor cognitive activity. Alternatively, as being mentioned by reviewer, the post-perceptual processing might relate to planning to report perception, which is different for perceived and not perceived stimuli. Therefore, up to date, the understanding of the post-perceptual processing remains controversial. According to reviewer’s comment, we have modified the description of our task as following: “we designed a visual awareness task that can minimize report-related motor confounding”. Also, have changed “report-related” to “motorrelated” in the text of manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 3, 4 changes in posterior middle frontal gyri suggest early frontal eye field involvement in perception.

Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 2012 ). Therefore, up to date, the understanding of the post-perceptual processing remains controversial. Considering reviewer’s comment together with other opinions, we have modified the description of our task as following: “we designed a visual awareness task that can minimize report-related motor confounding”. Also, we have changed “report-related” to “motor-related” in the rest of manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the question whether the saccadic RT in our balanced response paradigm should be expected to be similar between aware and unaware condition, we think that the RT should be similar in case if the delay period is long enough for the decision of “no” to be completed. In fact, in a previous study (Merten &amp; Nieder, PNAS, 2011), the neuronal encoding of “no” decision didn’t appear until 2s after the stimulus cue onset. However, in our task, the delay period lasted only 600 ms that was long enough to form the “yes” decision, but was not enough to form the “no” decision.

Using almost the exact same &quot;matching task&quot;, the authors of this previous study show that they get a P3b for both the perceived and not-perceived conditions, confirming that post-perceptual cognition/report confounds were not eliminated, but instead were present in (and balanced between) both the perceived/not-perceived trials due to the delayed matching aspect of the design.

Schröder et al. found while P3b showed significant difference between perceived and not-perceived trials in direct report task, the P3b was presented in both perceived/not-perceived trials and not significantly different in the matched task. Based on these findings, Schröder et al. argued that P3b represented the task specific post-perceptual cognition/report rather than the emergence of awareness per se. Considering the similarity of tasks between Schröder et al. and ours, we agree that our task is not able to totally eliminate the confound of post-perceptual cognition/report related activity with awareness related activity. Nevertheless, our task is able to minimize the confound of motorrelated activity with the emergence of awareness by separating them in time and balancing the direction of responsive movements. Therefore, we modified the term of “report-related” to “motor-related” in the text of revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On page 2, lines 71-75, the authors' review of the Frassle et al.

However, in both of these conditions, visual awareness was changing with the main difference being whether there was sensory conflict between the two eyes or not. Such a contrast would presumably subtract out the common activity patterns related to visual awareness changes, while isolating rivalry (and the resulting neural competition) vs. non-rivalry (and the lack of such competition) which is not broadly relevant for the goal of measuring neural correlates of visual awareness which are present in both sides of the contrast (rivalry and replay).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your suggestion.

We have cited this study and made discussion in the revised manuscript (line 522-533). We agree that several iEEG studies have shown the early involvement of PFC in visual perception (Vishne et al. 2023; Khalaf et al. 2023; Kwon et al. 2021). However, in these studies, authors did not compare the neural activity between conscious and unconscious conditions, leaving the possibility that the ERP and HFA were correlated with the unconscious information processing rather than awareness-specific processing. In the present study, we compared the neural activity in PFC between conscious and unconscious trials, and found that the activity of PFC specifically correlated with conscious perception. As we mentioned in the previous version of manuscript, there is one iEEG study (Gaillard et al. 2009) that reported awareness-specific activity in PFC. However, the awareness related activity started more than 300 ms after the onset of visual stimuli, which was about 100 ms longer than the early awareness related activity in our study. Nevertheless, according to reviewer’s comment, we modified our argument as following in lines 621-623:</p><p>‘However, as discussed above, in contrast with previous studies, our study detected earlier awareness-specific ‘ignition’ in the human PFC, while minimizing the motor-related confounding.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experimental task section of Methods: Were any strategies for learning the response cue matching task suggested to patients/subjects, and/or did any patients/subjects report which strategy they ended up using?

Although this paper reports some interesting findings (the videos are very nice and informative!) the interpretation of the data is unfortunately problematic for several reasons. I will detail my main comments below. If the authors address these comments well, I believe the paper may provide an interesting contribution to further specifying the neural mechanisms important for conscious access (in line with Gaillard et al., Plos Biology 2009).</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We appreciate very much for the reviewer’s encouraged opinion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main problem with the interpretation of the data is that the authors have NOT used a so called &quot;no-report paradigm&quot;. The idea of no report paradigms is that subjects passively view a certain stimulus without the instruction to &quot;do something with it&quot;, e.g., detect the stimulus, immediately or later in time. Because of the confusion of this term, specifically being related to the &quot;act of reporting&quot;, some have argued we should use the term no-cognition paradigm instead (Block, TiCS, 2019, see also Pitts et al., Phil Trans B 2018). The crucial aspect is that, in these types of paradigms, the critical stimulus should be task-irrelevant and thus not be associated with any task (immediately or later). Because in this experiment subjects were instructed to detect the gratings when cued 600 ms later in time, the stimuli are task relevant, they have to be reported about later and therefore trigger all kinds of (known and potentially unknown) cognitive processes at the moment the stimuli are detected in real-time (so stimulus-locked). You could argue that the setup of this delayed response task excludes some very specific report related processes (e.g., the preparation of an eye-movement), which is good, however this is usually not considered the main issue. For example when comparing masked versus unmasked stimuli (Gaillard et al., 2009 Plos Biology), these conditions usually also both contain responses but these response related processes are &quot;averaged out&quot; in the specific contrasts (unmasked &gt; masked). In this paper, RT differences between conditions (that are present in this dataset) are taken care of by using this delayed response in this paper, which is a nice feature for that and is not the case for the above example set-up.</p><p>Given the task instructions, and this being merely a delayed-response task, it is to be expected that prefrontal cortex shows stronger activity for subjectively aware versus subjectively unaware stimuli. Unfortunately, given the nature of this task, the novelty of the findings is severely reduced. The authors cannot claim that prefrontal cortex is associated with &quot;visual awareness&quot;, or what people have called phenomenal consciousness (this is the goal of using no-cognition paradigms). The only conclusion that can be drawn is that prefrontal cortex activity is associated with accessing sensory input: and hence conscious access. This less novel observation has been shown many times before and there is also little disagreement about this issue between different theories of consciousness (e.g., global workspace theory and local recurrency theories both agree on this).</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree that the no-report/no-cognition paradigms contain less cognition within the post-perceptual processing than the report paradigms. We designed the balanced response task in order to minimize the motor related component from post-perceptual processing, even though this task does not eliminate the entire cognition from post-perceptual processing. Regarding reviewer’s comment that our task is not able to assess the involvement of PFC in the emergence of awareness, we have different opinion. As we mentioned in the manuscript, the findings of early awareness related activity (~200 ms) in PFC, which resemble the VAN activity in EEG studies, indicate the association of PFC with the emergence of visual awareness (phenomenal consciousness).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The best solution at this point seems to rewrite the paper entirely in light of this. My advice would be to state in the introduction that the authors investigate conscious access using iEEG and then not refer too much to no-cognition paradigm or maybe highlight some different strategies about using task-irrelevant stimuli (see Canales-Johnson et al., Plos Biology 2023; Hesse et al., eLife 2020; Hatamimajoumerd et al Curr Bio 2022; Alilovic et al., Plos Biology 2023; Pitts et al., Frontiers 2014; Dwarakanth et al., Neuron 2023 and more). Obviously, the authors should then also not claim that their results solve debates about theories regarding visual awareness (in the &quot;no-cognition&quot; sense, or phenomenal consciousness), for example in relation to the debate about the &quot;front or the back of the brain&quot;, because the data do not inform that discussion. Basically, the authors can just discuss their results in detail (related to timing, frequency, synchronization etc) and relate the different signatures that they have observed to conscious access.</p></disp-quote><p>The objective of present study is to assess whether PFC is involved in the emergence of visual awareness (i.e., phenomenal consciousness). Interestingly, we found the early awareness related activity (~200 ms after visual stimulus onset), including ERP, high gamma activity and phase synchronization, in PFC, which indicate the association of PFC with the emergence of visual awareness. Therefore, we would like to keep the basic context of manuscript and make revision according to reviewers’ comments.</p><p>On the other hand, we totally agree reviewer’s argument that the report paradigm is more suitable to study the access consciousness. Indeed, we have found that the awareness related activity in PFC could be separated into two subgroups, i.e., early activity with shorter latency (~200 ms after stimulus onset) and late activity with longer latency (&gt; 350 ms after stimulus onset). In addition, the early activity was declined to the baseline level within ~200 ms during delay period, whereas the late activity lasted throughout the delay period and reached to the next stage of task (change color of the fixation point). Moreover, the early activity occurs primarily within the contralateral PFC of the visual stimulus, whereas the late activity occurs within both contralateral and ipsilateral PFC. While the early awareness related activity resembles the VAN activity in EEG studies (associating with p-consciousness), the late awareness related activity resembles the P3b activity (associating with a-consciousness). We are going to report these results in a separated paper soon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think the authors have to discuss the Gaillard et al PLOS Biology 2009 paper in much more detail. Gaillard et al also report a study related to conscious access contrasting unmasked and masked stimuli using iEEG. In this paper they also report ERP, time frequency and phase synchronization results (and even Granger causality). Because of the similarities in approach, I think it would be important to directly compare the results presented in that paper with results presented here and highlight the commonalities and discrepancies in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for reviewer’s comment.

In addition, we also extended discussion with other relevant studies in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In lines 528-549,</p><p>‘Although one iEEG study reported awareness-specific PFC activation, the awareness-related activity started 300 ms after the onset of visual stimuli, which was ~100 ms later than the early activity in our study. Also, due to the limited number of electrodes in PFC (2 patients with 19 recording sites mostly in mesiofrontal and peri-insular regions), their experiments were restricted while exploring the awareness-related activity in PFC. In the present study, the number of recording sites (245) were much more than previous study and covered more areas in PFC. Our results further show earlier awareness-related activity (~ 200 ms after visual stimuli onset), including ERP, HFA and PLV.

Previous work has shown PFC activations to masked stimuli (e.g., van Gaal et al., J Neuroscience 2008, 2010; Lau and Passigngham J Neurosci 2007) as well as PFC activations to subjectively unaware stimuli (e.g., King, Pescetelli, and Dehaene, Neuron 2016) and this is a very nice illustration of that with methods having more detailed spatial precision. Although potentially interesting, I wonder about the objective detection performance of the stimuli in this task. So please report objective detection performance for the patients and the healthy subjects, using signal detection theoretic d'. This gives the reader an idea of how good subjects were in detecting the presence/absence of the gratings. Likely, this reveals far above chance detection performance and in that case I would interpret these findings as &quot;PFC activation to stimuli indicated as subjectively unaware&quot; and not unconscious stimuli. See Stein et al., Plos Biology 2021 for a direct comparison of subjectively and objectively unaware stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>We gratefully appreciate for reviewer’s helpful and valuable comments. We do notice that the activity of PFC in subjectively unawareness condition (stimulus contrast near perceptual threshold) is significantly higher than stimulus absent condition. Such results, by using sEEG recordings with much higher spatial resolution than brain imaging and scalp EEG, support findings of previous studies (citations). Considering the question of neural correlation of unawareness processing is a hot and interesting topic, after carefully considering, we would like to report these results in a separate paper, rather than add these results in the current manuscript in order to avoid the distraction.</p><p>According to reviewer’s comment about the objective detection performance of the stimuli in our task, we analyzed the signal detection theoretic d’. The values of d’ in patients and healthy subjects are similar (1.81±0.27 in patients and 2.12±0.37 in healthy subjects). Such results indicate that the objective detection performance of subjects in our task is well above the chance level. Since our task merely measures the subjective awareness, we agree reviewer’s comment about the interpretation of our results as “PFC activation to stimuli indicated the subjective unawareness rather than objective unawareness”. We will emphasize this point in our next paper.</p><p>We have added the d prime in the MS (lines149-150).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7 of the paper the authors want to make the case that the contrast does not differ between subjectively aware stimuli and subjectively unaware stimuli. However so far they've done the majority of their analyses across subjects, and for this analysis the authors only performed within-subject tests, which is not a fair comparison imo. Because several P values are very close to significance I anticipate that a test across subjects will clearly show that the contrast level of the subjectively aware stimuli is higher than of the subjectively unaware stimuli, at the group level. A solution to this would be to sub-select trials from one condition (NA) to match the contrast of the other condition (NU), and thereby create two conditions that are matched in contrast levels of the stimuli included. Then do all the analyses on the matched conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank reviewer for the helpful comment. Regarding reviewer’s comment “However so far they've done the majority of their analyses across subjects, and for this analysis the authors only performed within-subject tests, which is not a fair comparison imo”, if we understand correctly, reviewer considered that it was fair if the analysis of neural activity in PFC was done across subjects but the stimulus contrast analysis between NA and NU was done individually. Actually, it is not the case. In neural activity analysis, the significant awareness-related sites were identified firstly in each individual subject (Fig. 3A and Fig 4A, and Methods), same as the analysis of stimulus contrast (see Methods). Only in the neural population activity analysis, the activity of awareness-related sites was pooled together and made further analysis.</p><p>To further evidence the awareness related activity in PFC is not highly correlated with stimulus contrast, we compared the activity difference between two different stimulus contrast conditions, i.e., stimulus contrast difference between high-contrast aware (HA) and NA conditions (large difference, ~14%), and between NA and NU conditions (slight difference, ~0.2%). The working hypothesis is that, if PFC activity is closely correlated with the contrast of stimulus contrast, we expect to see the activity difference between HA and NA conditions is much larger than that between NA and NU conditions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data of two patients in which the previous analysis showed significant or near significant difference of stimulus contrast between NA and NU conditions (Author response image 1, below, patient #2 and 1). The results (Author response image 1) show that the averaged activity difference (0-650 ms after visual stimulus onset) between HA and NA was similar as the averaged activity difference between NA and NU trials, even though the stimulus contrast difference was much larger between HA and NA conditions than between NA and NU conditions. Such results indicate that the awareness-related activity in PFC cannot be solely explained by the contrast difference between NA and NU conditions. Based on these results, we think that it is not necessary to perform the analysis as reviewer’s comment “A solution to this would be to sub-select trials from one condition (NA) to match the contrast of the other condition (NU), and thereby create two conditions that are matched in contrast levels of the stimuli included. Then do all the analyses on the matched conditions”. Another reason that impedes us to do this analysis is due to the limited trial numbers in our dataset.</p><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Relationship between stimulus contract and PFC activity.</title><p>X axis represents the stimulus contrast difference between two paired conditions, i.e., aware versus unaware in near perceptual threshold conditions (NA – NU, red dots); aware in high contrast condition versus aware in near perceptual threshold condition (HA – NA, blue dots).

The results show that activity difference is similar between two paired conditions regardless the remarkable contrast difference between two paired conditions. Such results indicate that the greater activity in NA trials than in NU trials (Fig. xx-xx) could not be interpreted by the slight difference in stimulus contrast between NA and NU trials.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89076-sa4-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related, Figure 7B is confusing and the results are puzzling.

For example, a statement like the following &quot;Consciousness, as a high-level cognitive function of the brain, should have some similar effects as other cognitive functions on behavior (for example, saccadic reaction time). With this question in mind, we carefully searched the literature about the relationship between consciousness and behavior; surprisingly, we failed to find any relevant literature.&quot; This is rather problematic for at least two reasons. First, not everyone would agree that consciousness is a highlevel cognitive function and second there are many papers arguing for a certain relationship between consciousness and behavior (Dehaene and Naccache, 2001 Cognition; van Gaal et al., 2012, Frontiers in Neuroscience; Block 1995, BBS; Lamme, Frontiers in Psychology, 2020; Seth, 2008 and many more). Further, the explanation for the reaction time differences in this specific case is likely related to the fact that subjects' confidence in that decision is much higher in the aware trials than in the unaware trials, hence the speeded response for the first. This is a phenomenon that is often observed if one explores the &quot;confidence literature&quot;. Although the authors have not measured confidence I would not make too much out of this RT difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that and modified accordingly in lines 492-507.</p><p>‘An alternative interpretation for RT difference between aware and unaware condition in our study, i.e., reflecting task-strategies used by subjects/patients to remember the response mapping rules between the perception and the color cue (e.g., if the YES+GREEN=RIGHT and YES+RED=LEFT rules were held in memory, while the NO mappings were inferred secondarily rather than being actively held in memory).</p><p>Another possibility is that the reaction time is strongly modulated by the confident level, which has been described in previous studies(Broggin et al., 2012; Marzi et al., 2006). However, in previous studies, the confident levels were usually induced by presenting stimulus with different physical property, such as spatial frequency, eccentricity and contrast. However, the dependence of visual process on the salience of visual stimulus confounds with the effect of visual awareness on the reaction time of responsive movements, which is hard to attribute the shorter reaction time in more salient condition purely to visual awareness. In contrast, we create a condition (near aware threshold) in the present study, in which the saliency (contrast) of visual stimulus is very similar in both aware and unaware conditions in order to eliminate the influence of stimulus saliency in reaction time. We think that the difference in reaction time in our study is mainly due to the modulation of awareness state, which was not reported previously.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would be interested in a lateralized analysis, in which the authors compare the PFC responses and connectivity profiles using PLV as a factor of stimulus location (thus comparing electrodes contralateral to the presented stimulus and electrodes ipsilateral to the presented stimulus). If possible this may give interesting insights in the mechanism of global ignition (global broadcasting), supposing that for contralateral electrodes information does not have to cross from one hemisphere to another, whereas for ipsilateral electrodes that is the case (which may take time). Gaillard et al refer to this issue as well in their paper, and this issue is sometimes discussed regarding to Global workspace theory. This would add novelty to the findings of the paper in my opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>We gratefully appreciate reviewer’s helpful and available suggestions. We have made the analysis accordingly. We find that the awareness-related ERP activation in PFC occurs earlier only in the contralateral PFC with latency about 200 ms and then occurs in both contralateral and ipsilateral PFC about 100 ms later. In addition, the magnitude of awareness-related activity is stronger in the contralateral PFC than in ipsilateral PFC during the early phase (200-400 ms), then the activity becomes similar between contralateral and ipsilateral PFC. Moreover, the awareness related HG activity only appears in the contralateral PFC. Such results show the spatiotemporal characteristics of visual awareness related activity between two hemispheres. We are going to report these results in a separate paper soon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Some of the font sizes in the figures are too small.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To me, the abbreviations are confusing, (NA/NU etc).
