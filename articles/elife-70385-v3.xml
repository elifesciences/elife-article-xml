frequently emerge when an acquired <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mutation triggers unchecked proliferation and subsequent arrest in melanocytes. Recent observations have challenged the role of oncogene-induced senescence in melanocytic nevus formation, necessitating investigations into alternative mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance of proliferation arrest in nevi. We compared the transcriptomes of melanocytes from healthy human skin, nevi, and melanomas arising from nevi and identified a set of microRNAs as highly expressed nevus-enriched transcripts. Two of these microRNAs—MIR211-5p and MIR328-3p—induced mitotic failure, genome duplication, and proliferation arrest in human melanocytes through convergent targeting of AURKB. We demonstrate that <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> induces a similar proliferation arrest in primary human melanocytes that is both reversible and conditional. Specifically, <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> expression stimulates either arrest or proliferation depending on the differentiation state of the melanocyte. We report genome duplication in human melanocytic nevi, reciprocal expression of AURKB and microRNAs in nevi and melanomas, and rescue of arrested human nevus cells with AURKB expression. Taken together, our data describe an alternative molecular mechanism for melanocytic nevus formation that is congruent with both experimental and clinical observations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Lots of people have small dark patches on their skin known as moles. Most moles form when individual cells known as melanocytes in the skin acquire a specific genetic mutation in a gene called <italic>BRAF</italic>. This mutation causes the cells to divide rapidly to form the mole. After a while, most moles stop growing and remain harmless for the rest of a person’s life.</p><p>Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from damaged melanocytes. The same mutation in <italic>BRAF</italic> that is found in moles is also present in half of all cases of melanoma. Unlike in moles, the melanoma-causing mutation makes the melanocytes divide rapidly to form a tumor that keeps on growing indefinitely. It remains unclear why the same genetic mutation in the<italic> BRAF</italic> gene has such different consequences in moles and melanomas.</p><p>To address this question, McNeal et al. used genetic approaches to study melanocytes from moles and melanomas. The experiments identified some molecules known as microRNAs that are present at higher levels in moles than in melanomas. Increasing the levels of two of these microRNAs in melanocytes from human skin stopped the cells from growing and dividing by inhibiting a gene called <italic>AURKB</italic>. This suggested that these microRNAs are responsible for halting the growth of moles.</p><p>Introducing the mutated form of <italic>BRAF</italic> into melanocytes also stopped cells from growing and dividing by inhibiting <italic>AURKB</italic>. However, changing the environment surrounding the cells reversed this effect and allowed the melanocytes to resume dividing. In this way the mutated form of <italic>BRAF</italic> acts like a switch that allows melanocytes in skin cancers to start growing again under certain conditions.</p><p>Further experiments found that a drug called barasertib is able to inhibit the growth of melanoma cells with the mutant form of <italic>BRAF</italic>. Future work will investigate whether it is possible to use this drug and other tools to stop skin cancer tumors from growing, and possibly even prevent skin tumors from forming in the first place.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>melanocytes</kwd><kwd>nevi</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5OD019787</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Judson-Torres</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA229896</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Judson-Torres</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F31CA236377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNeal</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA042014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Judson-Torres</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sandler Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Judson-Torres</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>5 for the Fight</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5 for the Fight Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Judson-Torres</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oncogenic BRAF causes genome duplication and reversible growth arrest in human melanocytes that is conditional on microRNA expression and differentiation state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cutaneous melanoma is a potentially deadly skin cancer arising from the pigment-producing melanocytes of the human epidermis. An activating mutation in the BRAF proto-oncogene (BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>) drives over half of all cutaneous melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garnett and Marais, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davies et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pollock et al., 2003</xref>). Yet, when a melanocyte acquires a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation, the cell does not immediately transform to cancer. Instead, it usually undergoes clonal proliferation followed by stable arrest resulting in a benign skin lesion known as a melanocytic nevus or ‘mole’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pollock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastian, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dankort et al., 2009</xref>). Despite the continued expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, the majority of melanocytic nevi remain innocuous for the lifespan of the individual, suggesting that nevus cells have robust intrinsic defenses against hyperproliferation. By inducing hyperproliferation and subsequent arrest, the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation elicits divergent, biphasic phenotypes within a single cell—a poorly understood phenomenon. Characterization of the mechanisms and environmental factors that distinguish the two phenotypes could illuminate candidate strategies for chemoprevention of melanocytic nevus formation or interception of melanoma initiation.</p><p>The BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation is clonally present in ~80% of human melanocytic nevi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pollock et al., 2003</xref>) and melanocyte-specific expression of the oncogene is sufficient to induce nevus formation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dankort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Damsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ruiz-Vega et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> drives proliferation arrest in melanocytes. The prevailing theory to explain this seemingly paradoxical role for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> is oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michaloglou et al., 2005</xref>). Cellular senescence is defined as the permanent cell-cycle arrest of previously replication-competent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He and Sharpless, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2020</xref>). Senescence is associated with a variety of molecular hallmarks including elevated expression of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and other cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitors, TP53, H2AX, lysosomal beta-galactosidase and senescence-associated secretory proteins (SASPs) as well as a DNA content profile indicative of arrest in the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campisi and d’Adda di Fagagna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collado and Serrano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshari et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chatsirisupachai et al., 2019</xref>). The concept of OIS as a barrier to tumorigenesis derived from observations of a durable proliferation arrest induced by overexpression of oncogenic RAS or RAF in immortalized human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>More recent studies have questioned whether the term ‘senescence’ aptly describes the proliferation arrest of melanocytic nevi. Cell cycle re-entry that accompanies nevus recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">King et al., 2009</xref>), eruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burian and Jemec, 2019</xref>), or transformation to primary melanoma suggests that the nevus arrest phenotype is reversible rather than permanent. Similarly, the expression of senescence markers does not readily distinguish human melanocytic nevi from primary or transformed melanocytes in humans (16<sup>INK4A</sup>, TP53, H2AX, and beta-galactosidase) or mice (any known hallmark of senescence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ruiz-Vega et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cotter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tran et al., 2012</xref>). Setting aside the permanence of OIS, melanocytic nevus arrest was largely thought to be driven by induction of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> expression from the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gene. Indeed, early studies demonstrated that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induces p16<sup>INK4A</sup> expression and that melanocytic nevi frequently express high levels of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michaloglou et al., 2005</xref>). Despite this, p16<sup>INK4A</sup> expression is neither ubiquitous across melanocytic nevi, nor uniform within the cells of a single nevus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oaxaca et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>), and neither knockdown of the 16<sup>INK4A</sup> transcript nor ablation of the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> locus prevents the onset or rescues BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced proliferation arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michaloglou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haferkamp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McNeal et al., 2015</xref>). BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> also stimulates expression of p15<sup>INK4B</sup>—the translational product of the <italic>CDKN2B</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McNeal et al., 2015</xref>) which is situated adjacent to the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> locus—suggesting BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> might orchestrate arrest via multiple cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that induce arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, prior to genome synthesis. While the loss of the <italic>CDKN2A/B</italic> locus is a formative event in melanoma progression, genetic evolution studies of melanoma progression suggest that selection against the <italic>CDKN2A/B</italic> locus occurs after BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanocytes have already escaped nevus-associated arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shain et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these data complicate the straightforward model wherein BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induces the expression of cell cycle regulators leading to proliferation arrest, which is later circumvented by the genetic loss of those regulators.</p><p>Given these observations, we reasoned that the arrest response of human melanocytes to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> might be distinct from previous reports of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced OIS in other cell types. Specifically, we hypothesized that nevus-associated arrest is conditional and coordinated by reversible changes in gene expression. Here, we identify a transcriptional program that is consistently elevated in melanocytic nevi and includes microRNAs (miRNAs) previously shown to have diagnostic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babapoor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torres et al., 2020</xref>). In parallel, we observe that, unlike RAF-induced OIS in fibroblasts, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced arrest in human melanocytes is reversible and conditional. Merging these two observations, we discover that in melanocytes, regulation of miRNAs coupled to differentiation status permits toggling between BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-driven hyperproliferative to arrested phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Melanocytic nevus-enriched miRNAs induce mitotic failure and proliferation arrest in primary human melanocytes</title><p>Since melanocytic nevi do not consistently express known senescence markers, we sought to characterize the transcripts that are specifically elevated within nevus melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We analyzed previously published data sets comparing RNA expression between benign and malignant melanocytic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torres et al., 2020</xref>). Each clinical specimen contained matched RNA samples derived from melanocytic nevi and melanomas that arose from those nevi. We reasoned that downregulated transcripts within these newly formed melanomas could represent the most immediate barriers to melanocyte growth. Of the differentially expressed genes (adjusted p value&lt;0.05), 6 of the top 10 with elevated expression in nevi were non-coding miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among these were miRNAs previously shown as enriched in nevi compared to melanomas, including MIR211-5p, MIR125A-5p, MIR125B-5p, and MIR328-3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torres et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Latchana et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether elevated expression of these miRNAs distinguished nevus melanocytes from normal epidermal melanocytes, we profiled melanocytes from fresh healthy skin and nevi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Three of the miRNAs (MIR211-5p, MIR328-3p, and MIR125B-5p) were also more highly expressed in melanocytic nevi as compared to healthy melanocytes or melanomas—an expression pattern consistent with enrichment in arrested melanocytes—whereas one miRNA (MIR125A-5p) presented a pattern consistent with lineage-specific expression that is lost upon transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We conclude that MIR211-5p, MIR328-3p, and MIR125B-5p are transcripts specifically enriched in arrested melanocytic nevi.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Melanocytic nevus enriched miRNAs induce arrest in primary human melanocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of hypothesized plastic nature of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>- and nevus-associated proliferation arrest.

The introduction of either MIR211-5p or MIR328-3p resulted in significantly fewer melanocytes compared to a non-targeting control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Increased concentrations of these mimics resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in EdU uptake, consistent with a cell cycle defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To better characterize the effect of MIR211-5p or MIR328-3p expression on cell cycle and cell viability, we performed time-lapsed quantitative phase imaging (QPI). We and others have previously established QPI as a method for adherent cell cytometry that can simultaneously measure melanocyte proliferation, cell death, and cell cycle stage with single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hejna et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Falck Miniotis et al., 2014</xref>).

The dry mass of a cell is a measurement of total biomass (DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, etc.) and is quantitatively measured by QPI. Relative dry mass fluctuates with cell cycle stage in a predictable manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Falck Miniotis et al., 2014</xref>). The 20–40% increase we observed here is characteristic of cells that have doubled their DNA content but failed to complete mitosis. We confirmed this finding by measuring DNA content of the arrested populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). We observed significant increases of cells with both 4 N DNA content and greater than 4 N DNA content, indicative of cytokinesis failure following DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, time-lapsed imaging revealed incidences of tripolar mitosis and anaphase bridging in miRNA-expression melanocytes—both processes associated with cytokinesis failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Normand and King, 2010</xref>)—which were not observed in control conditions or standard culture (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The expression of both AURKB and GPR3 protein and mRNA was enriched in melanomas as compared to nevi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate an inverse expression between two miRNAs (MIR211-5p and MIR328-3p) and two targeted mRNAs (AURKB and GPR3) that toggles concurrently with the transition of arrested melanocytic nevi to melanomas. To further investigate whether either mRNA was sufficient to rescue miRNA-mediated arrest, primary melanocytes were transduced with constructs expressing either zsGreen (control), AURKB, or GPR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I-K</xref>), then subsequently nucleofected with either MIR211-5p or MIR328-3p. Expression of either mRNA partially rescued MIR211-5p-induced arrest, while AURKB, but not GPR3, partially rescued MIR328-3p-induced arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Thus, while other MIR211-5p and MIR328-3p targets, including GPR3, may play a role in the induction of melanocyte proliferation arrest, these data suggest that AURKB inhibition is a critical convergent node of both miRNAs in facilitating proliferation arrest in nevi. This interpretation is further supported by the well-established role of AURKB as an essential orchestrator of successful mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D’Avino and Capalbo, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induces a reversible and conditional proliferation arrest in human melanocytes</title><p>We hypothesized that AURKB inhibition by MIR211-5p and MIR328-3p may be the underlying mechanism by which BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induces proliferation arrest in melanocytes.

Media was then replaced to remove doxycycline. Within 12 hr of doxycycline removal, the previously arrested melanocytes began to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), demonstrating that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced proliferation arrest in melanocytes is reversible and dependent on continued oncogene expression.</p><p>Nevi recurrence after excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">King et al., 2009</xref>) and eruption upon external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burian and Jemec, 2019</xref>), together with our observation that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induced arrest is reversible in melanocytes, suggested that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced arrest may depend on secondary signals from the microenvironment. Tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) is a protein kinase C (PKC) activator commonly used as a mitogen in primary melanocyte media to substitute for endothelin receptor type B activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hsu et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, TPA also inhibits the cell cycle of melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coppock et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arita et al., 1998</xref>). BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression permits growth of the Melan-A cell line in the absence of TPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wellbrock et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore wanted to determine the relative contributions of TPA and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> to the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced primary melanocyte arrest in vitro. We induced BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in primary human melanocytes in two medias—one containing TPA (+TPA) or one containing the endothelin receptor type B ligand, endothelin-1 (TPA-free) and observed divergent dose-responsive phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In the presence of TPA, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression inhibited cell proliferation. By contrast, in TPA-free media, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression induced proliferation, a phenotype that persisted for the remaining duration of the primary cultures (4–6 weeks). We next subjected melanocytes to the arrest-inducing conditions of doxycycline treatment in +TPA media for 4 days, then replaced with doxycycline-containing, TPA-free media. We observed a rapid shift to the proliferative phenotype even in the continued presence of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To determine whether the observed reversibility of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced growth arrest was due to insufficient duration or degree of expression of the oncogene, we exposed melanocytes to a high concentration of doxycycline (60 ng/ml) for 30 days prior to switching medias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Melanocytes in +TPA media remained arrested for the duration of doxycycline treatment then grew again upon removal of either doxycycline or TPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–K</xref>). From these results, we conclude that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression induces divergent and interconvertible phenotypes—either hyperproliferation or a reversible arrest—in human melanocytes conditional on extrinsic stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced arrest is dependent on melanocyte growth conditions and differentiation state</title><p>To investigate the relative contributions of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and TPA to the expression of MIR211-5p and MIR328-3p, we conducted small RNA sequencing of melanocytes grown in +TPA or TPA-free media and with or without BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression.

Principal component (PC) analysis revealed that 97.4 % of the variance between samples was explained by two PCs—PC1 (81.75 variance) separated transcriptomes based upon exposure to TPA and PC2 (15.7% variance) separated transcriptomes based upon BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

As expected from the PC analysis and similar to the miRNA profiles, most gene expression variance was due to media conditions with a smaller, but consistent, set of genes activated by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>.</p><p>One initially surprising result of this analysis was the static expression of both MIR211-5p and MIR328-3p in +TPA conditions, regardless of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression. However, as inhibitors of translation, miRNA function depends on the expression level of its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mukherji et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ovando-Vázquez et al., 2016</xref>), effectively functioning as buffers of gene expression that prevent aberrantly high levels of a transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ebert and Sharp, 2012</xref>). BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> has been previously demonstrated as an upstream activator of AURKB transcription in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore reasoned that MIR211-5p expression in +TPA conditions might dampen AURKB activation by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. Consistent with this hypothesis, the addition of doxycycline induced AURKB expression in TPA-free/MIR211-5p low conditions, but this effect was not observed in +TPA/MIR211-5p high conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>We next conducted gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) comparing TPA-regulated genes and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>- regulated genes to Molecular Signature Database Hallmark gene sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>), the KEGG PATHWAY database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kanehisa et al., 2016</xref>), and signatures important in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ryu et al., 2011</xref>), human melanocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belote et al., 2021</xref>), or melanoma cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoek and Goding, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsoi et al., 2018</xref>). Among the pathways uniquely enriched with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression were the expected increases in signatures downstream of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, MAPK (KRAS) signaling, and glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haq et al., 2014</xref> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Gene sets uniquely enriched in +TPA media included signatures associated with cell cycle regulation, such as the G2-M checkpoint, oxidative phosphorylation, the MITF program, and differentiated melanocytes. In contrast, TPA-free media-induced gene sets are associated with cell adhesion and melanocyte progenitor and stem cells. Corroborating this observation, melanocytes grown in TPA-free media expressed higher levels of AXL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>), lower levels of MLANA, a melanocyte differentiation marker, and presented greater activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase, enzymatic activity associated with stemness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). These results indicate that exposure to TPA induces a more differentiated melanocyte phenotype, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prince et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vidács et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kormos et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To look for synergist effects of both BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression and media conditions, we performed GSEA analyses on each set of pair-wise conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref> and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Generally, most gene sets identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> were regulated by only one of the two stimuli. For example, genes downstream of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> signaling were only influenced by doxycycline exposure. Interesting exceptions to this trend were the inflammatory response, which required both stimuli; cell cycle regulation gene sets, which were activated by TPA alone but further elevated when supplemented with doxycycline; and epithelial to mesenchymal transition genes, which were activated by either stimulus. A subset of melanocyte dedifferentiation gene sets, specifically neural crest genes, the melanoma invasion program, and the AXL program, but not markers of melanocyte stem cells, were activated by either TPA-free media or BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression, albeit the activation was more pronounced in the former. This observation suggests that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression alone does induce some programs associated with melanocyte dedifferentiation, but with the retention of MIR211-5p expression, the induction is insufficient to overcome growth arrest.</p><p>Collectively, our transcriptomic analyses support a model whereby growth in +TPA conditions induces a more differentiated state in melanocytes coinciding with an increase in MIR211-5p expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). This increased MIR211-5p combined with relatively stable MIR328-3p expression, dampens entry into mitosis and/or successful completion of mitosis at least in part through AURKB inhibition. The attenuation of cell division results in an accumulation of cells in G2/M—an effect that is more pronounced in conditions stimulating accelerated growth, such as with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression. To test this model, we transduced doxycycline-inducible BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanocytes in +TPA conditions with lentiviral constructs constitutively expressing either AURKB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>) or miRNA sponges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) that inhibit either MIR211-5p or MIR328-3p. AURKB expression had no baseline effect on melanocyte growth, but rescued BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>), suggesting the inability of the oncogene to induce AURKB in this context serves as a bottleneck in cell division. Also consistent with the model, sponges against either MIR211-5p or MIR328-3p increased baseline division rate and rescued BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced arrest, demonstrating that both miRNAs contribute to inhibition of melanocyte division, with effects that are more pronounced in the presence of growth signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>AURKB inhibition drives melanocytic nevus-associated proliferation arrest</title><p>To further investigate whether this mechanism of arrest occurs in clinical nevus specimens, we examined an independent cohort of 15 nevi for evidence of mitotic failure.

The percent observed binucleated melanocytes ranged from 3% to 12% (mean=6.3%). It is important to note that since binucleation can only be observed in the fraction of cells sectioned perpendicular to the plane of the adjacent nuclei, 3–12% is likely an underestimate. We also observed giant multinucleated cells in 10 of the 15 nevi, indicative of multiple rounds of DNA synthesis and cytokinetic failure and consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rogers et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>AURKB inhibition is critical for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced arrest of human nevi.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative image of 15 H&amp;E-stained melanocytic nevus.

Nevus-derived melanocytes appeared healthy in culture. Consistent with the histopathologic cohort, co-staining with melanocyte marker, MLANA, and Hoechst revealed frequent 4 N and 8 N melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Transduction of nevus melanocytes with an AURKB and mCherry expressing lentiviral vector at low multiplicity of infection showed that the mCherry positive cells divided significantly more than their mCherry negative counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>) in cells from all three nevus donors. This result suggests that expression of AURKB is also rate limiting for the proliferation of human nevus melanocytes, as we observed in primary melanocytes expressing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>.</p><p>To test the sufficiency of AURKB inhibition to limit BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> hyperproliferation in melanoma, we assessed normalized growth rate inhibition of three cultures—primary human melanocytes, an established BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> human melanoma cell line, and a short-term BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> human melanoma culture—when exposed to a pharmacologic AURKB inhibitor (Barasertib). Normalized growth rate measurements (such as GR<sub>50</sub>) incorporate baseline cell division rate and are demonstrably more reproducible than the commonly calculated half-maximal inhibitor concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) when comparing different cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hafner et al., 2016</xref>). An additional advantage of GR<sub>50</sub> is the ability to distinguish growth rate inhibition (GR<sub>50</sub> approaches 0) versus cell death (GR<sub>50</sub> is negative). Since GR<sub>50</sub> calculations require proliferation curves, we conducted live QPI over 48 hr with a range of Barasertib concentrations (0–300 nM). Primary melanocytes were largely resistant to the compound with reduced growth apparent only at supraphysiological levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In contrast, both melanoma cultures responded to tenfold lower dosage of the compound with GR<sub>50</sub> approaching zero, indicating primarily arrest, not death. In these conditions, the per cell dry mass also increased significantly, consistent with a G2/M arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that AURKB inhibition limits the rate of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced proliferation in human melanocytic nevi and melanomas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cellular senescence is conventionally defined as a permanent cell-cycle arrest associated with a variety of molecular markers and an irreversible arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He and Sharpless, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>). The vast majority of melanocytic nevi are stably arrested and harbor BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, an oncogenic mutation that induces cellular senescence when expressed in a variety of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michaloglou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 1998</xref>). While these observations seemingly implicate OIS as the mechanism driving nevus-associated proliferation arrest, a substantial body of evidence has challenged this paradigm in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ruiz-Vega et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">King et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burian and Jemec, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cotter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oaxaca et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haferkamp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McNeal et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we provide further evidence to challenge the model that acquisition of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induces premature cellular senescence in melanocytes and uncover an alternative mechanism driving nevus formation and stability. We propose that acquisition of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation does not necessitate growth arrest, but instead permits melanocytes to toggle between hyperproliferation and mitotic arrest. Our transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that external stimuli can modulate the differentiation state of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanocytes, orchestrate the expression level of MIR211-5p, and inform which phenotype is triggered by the oncogene—before or after the oncogene is introduced.</p><p>The senescence model is largely rooted in seminal work demonstrating that sustained ectopic expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induces proliferative arrest in primary human melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michaloglou et al., 2005</xref>)—an experiment reproduced by several independent labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haferkamp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McNeal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leikam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2016</xref>), including our own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). In each of these studies, melanocytes were cultured in TPA-containing media. Thus, while observations presented here—that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -induced proliferative arrest is reversible and conditional on the presence of TPA— provide new insights that challenge the senescence model, they do not contradict the data presented in these previous reports.</p><p>One inherent limitation of using any in vitro approach to investigate the mechanisms underlaying clinical phenomena is an inherent incongruity in the magnitude of duration. Melanocytic nevi frequently persist for several decades, whereas in vitro experiments are generally conducted on the order of days to weeks. In previous in vitro studies, the periods of time melanocytes were monitored subsequent to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> introduction ranged from 1 to 3 weeks. In studies utilizing an inducible RAF in human fibroblasts, 24 hr of expression was sufficient to drive a durable proliferative arrest, even upon removal of the oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 1998</xref>). In this study, we induced growth arrest with high levels of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> for 30 days and observed the arrest was still reversible. It remains possible that an even longer exposure to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> would elicit a permanent proliferative arrest consistent with senescence. It is noteworthy, however, that the identified mechanisms driving proliferative arrest in vitro were also supported by analyses of clinical nevi specimens.</p><p>While supported by analyses of both primary human melanocytes and clinical specimens, one limitation to this report is the lack of in vivo confirmation using animal models. One well-established genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma expresses BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> from the endogenous locus in tyrosinase-expressing cells with spatiotemporal control. The predominant phenotype of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> activation in this model is melanocytic hyperplasia, which increases in prominence with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dankort et al., 2009</xref>). While growth-arrested melanocytic ‘nevus-like’ lesions also form in this model, they are not associated with markers of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ruiz-Vega et al., 2020</xref>). More recently, an elegant study utilizing a zebrafish model of melanoma demonstrated that driving BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression from promoters associated with melanocyte progenitors, but not differentiated melanocytes, resulted in melanoma initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arianna et al., 2021</xref>). These observations are all consistent with our data and support the conclusion that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced proliferation in melanocytes is dependent on differentiation state. Further studies will be required to confirm whether the microRNA mechanism reported here is conserved between human and model systems.</p><p>The presented model offers an explanation for several clinical phenomena. First, melanocytic nevi form when BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> drives hyperproliferation followed by proliferation arrest. Second, nevus eruption involves the expansion of previously stable nevi over a short period of time. Third, incomplete excision of melanocytic nevi can result in subsequent regrowth of the benign lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">King et al., 2009</xref>). Each event requires interconversion of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanocyte between a proliferative and arrested phase. Our data demonstrate that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanocytes can indeed oscillate between proliferative and arrested states and are consistent with each of these phenomena. Our interpretation assumes that once acquired, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression is constant and that the environmental context of the melanocytes is variable, serving as a ‘gatekeeper’ to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced proliferation. However, if BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression also fluctuates, then an equally plausible interpretation of our data is that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> serves as a ‘gatekeeper’ to environmentally induced proliferation. Interestingly, nevus eruption has been observed in metastatic melanoma patients treated with single agent selective BRAF inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dalle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zimmer et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with our observation that proliferation arrest in melanocytes requires sustained expression of the oncogene. A more thorough understanding of the responsible environmental stimuli in physiologic conditions, discussed in more detail below, would help to clarify which of the mechanisms—variable BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, variable environment, or both—underlie nevus formation, eruption, and recurrence.</p><p>It is important to note that while our data support a model of reversible proliferation arrest in nevi, we do not suggest this reversal is commonplace. Unquestionably, the vast majority of melanocytic nevi present with sustained arrest. However, we do propose that the duration of arrest is dynamic and modulated by exposure to external signals. Since our data suggest that loss of MIR211-5p and MIR328-3p expression and restoration of AURKB expression is concurrent with progression to melanoma, identification of the source of cell-extrinsic signals might suggest new strategies for chemoprevention or therapy. We have identified TPA, a known activator of PKC signaling, as one extrinsic factor that induces expression of MIR211-5p and a more dedifferentiated state. Previous studies have identified TPA as either a mitogen, inhibitor of the G1/S transition, or inhibitor of the G2/M transition, dependent on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coppock et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arita et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arita et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stavroulaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chao-Hsing and Hsin-Su, 1991</xref>). We demonstrate that in vitro, TPA activation of MIR211-5p is required for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced mitotic failure. Yet, the inclusion of TPA in primary melanocyte culture is artificial and the environmental stimulus that regulates MIR211-5p expression in skin remains unknown. One hypothesis is that PKC activation from keratinocyte interactions serves as the extrinsic stimulus. MIR211-5p is reported to be transcriptionally regulated by both MITF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mazar et al., 2010</xref>) and UV exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Su et al., 2020</xref>). However, TPA-free media containing an endothelin receptor type B ligand, endothelin-1, did not elicit MIR211-5p expression or BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> arrest, suggestive that the downstream signaling pathways regulated by the two molecules are not identical. PKC activation can also result in increased MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herrera et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ueda et al., 1996</xref>) raising the possibility that internal MAPK fluctuations may play a role in toggling between BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced proliferation versus arrest. The term ‘mitogenic window’ describes the specific range of oncogene doses that elicit a hyperproliferative phenotype. The mitogenic window for MAPK signaling activation can be remarkably fine. Here, we conducted a twofold dilution series of doxycycline but observed no evidence of a mitogenic window. However, it remains possible that we simply missed the ‘sweet spot’ in TPA conditions, and that a finer dilution series would reveal a mitogenic window even in the presence of TPA. Regardless, our data demonstrate that in TPA conditions the mitogenic window for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression is, at least, exceedingly narrow, whereas in non-TPA conditions the window is wide open. An important future direction will be to identify the nature and physiological source of this signal for melanocytic nevi in human skin.</p><p>Diminished MIR211-5p/MIR328-3p expression concurrent with increased AURKB expression occurs in a substantial portion of melanomas. AURKB expression was previously reported as significantly elevated in melanoma metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>) and here we report increased expression in primary melanomas. Similarly, MIR211-5p expression is consistently observed as lost in melanoma as compared to melanocytic nevi across independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babapoor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torres et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Latchana et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, MIR211-5p expression levels classify nevi from melanomas with a high degree of accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babapoor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torres et al., 2020</xref>). We have reported on the diagnostic potential of MIR328-3p expression as well, although multi-study validation was impeded by the absence of hybridization probes in earlier microarray-based profiling data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torres et al., 2020</xref>). In vitro, we have now demonstrated that inhibition of either miRNA is sufficient to block BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced arrest in melanocytes. These data suggest that mitotic failure serves as a barrier to melanoma progression and is consistent with the genome duplication and copy number alterations associated with invasive melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vergara et al., 2021</xref>). In melanoma, the specific cause of this genomic instability is unknown, but reentry of cells into cell cycle after mitotic failure has been shown to cause genome duplication and accumulation of copy number alterations in other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Telentschak et al., 2015</xref>). Further experiments will be necessary to determine whether dysregulation of the spindle checkpoint in nevi contributes directly to the copy number variations present in melanomas.</p><p>In summary, we have identified that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induces a reversible arrest in human melanocytes orchestrated by MIR211-5p/MIR328-3p regulation of AURKB and conditional on the melanocyte differentiation state.

In addition, the levels of the microRNAS are themselves dependent on microenvironmental controls. This manuscript would appeal to researchers in the melanoma field, especially those studying the underlying mechanisms behind phenotypic plasticity and tumor heterogeneity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;BRAF V600E induces reversible mitotic arrest in human melanocytes via microRNA-mediated suppression of AURKB&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The section dealing with the influence of TPA on melanocytes is especially interesting, but not always easy to follow. Some issues related to clarity should be addressed. Briefly, TPA and BrafV600E represent two independent inputs into melanocytes, and the behaviors that result from activating them separately or together are clearly non-additive. The most unbiased way to look at the data is from the standpoint of a 2x2 matrix of four conditions, with TPA+ or – on one axis and BRAFV600E + or – on the other. The authors present some data in this format, while in other cases they hold one condition constant and vary the other. From the standpoint of presentation, this helps the authors build their case that TPA essentially &quot;gates&quot; the response to Braf. Of course, one could just as easily use the same data, to support the case that Braf &quot;gates&quot; the response to TPA. Neither one is more or less true than the other, and given that TPA is presumed to be a stand-in for some as-yet-unknown environmental factor that melanocytes encounter in vivo, it is difficult to say which perspective is the more useful. Although I would not go so far as to suggest that the authors change the order in which data are discussed – it flows very logically as it is – it would be helpful to see some sort of summary figure that re-frames all of the observations into the simple 2x2 matrix format, so that readers could consider their own interpretations.</p><p>2a.

Although recent studies have called into question the view that nevi arrest by senescence, studies done in vitro based on the introduction of BrafV600E into melanocytes have suggested that, at least in vitro, they are driven into senescence. Are the authors disputing the results of those studies, or are there methodological differences to explain the discrepancy (e.g. other groups cultured cells for longer or in different media)?</p><p>2c. One implication of the data in Figure 3 is that, if not for the common use of TPA in culture medium, introduction of BrafV600E into melanocytes would result in durable (long-lasting) stimulation of proliferation.

We had based our previous interpretations on the assumption that in the clinical presentation of nevi and melanomas, even if not in our in vitro system, once the BRAF mutation was acquired it was constant, but the environment might change. But you are absolutely correct, if expression of the oncogene can vary (and why not?), then either interpretation is equally as valid. From our perspective, either interpretation is also equally as interesting. We personally favor the interpretation that the transcriptional landscape “gatekeeps” the growth-arrest phenotype because the mechanism we’ve identified here – MIR211-5p expression – is downstream of the media conditions, not mutant BRAF expression – but it’s the observation that the phenotype is reversible and conditional at all we find most interesting. We also recognize the importance of providing both perspectives for the reader to consider. To better acknowledge both interpretations:</p><p>First, we discuss both interpretations in the Discussion (lines 758-767):</p><p>“Our interpretation assumes that once acquired, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression is constant and that the environmental context of the melanocytes is variable, serving as a “gatekeeper” to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced proliferation. However, if BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression also fluctuates, then an equally plausible interpretation of our data is that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> serves as a “gatekeeper” to environmentally induced proliferation. Interestingly, nevus eruption has been observed in metastatic melanoma patients treated with single agent selective BRAF inhibitors<sup>62–66</sup>, consistent with our observation that proliferation arrest in melanocytes requires sustained expression of the oncogene. A more thorough understanding of the responsible environmental stimuli in physiologic conditions, discussed in more detail below, would help to clarify which of the mechanisms – variable BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, variable environment, or both – underlie nevus formation, eruption and recurrence.”</p><p>Second, we have provided an updated Supplementary File 5 that includes all differential expression for pairwise comparisons of all conditions and a new Supplementary File 6, which includes GSEA enrichment results for all of the pairwise comparisons, for the reader to consider.</p><p>Third, we have attempted to present more of the data, as suggested, as 2x2 matrics. In the original submission, the GSEA analysis results were not provided as a matrix – this was an intentional choice as the GSEA approaches we are familiar with require a pair-wise comparison. We originally ran all sets of pair-wise GSEAs and noticed that almost all significant enrichments were true in either both TPA conditions or both dox conditions. Therefore, for the sake of clearly presenting the data, we presented the data by holding one condition constant. However, there are a few cases of where the two stimuli converged – which we now discuss in lines 420-455. The new Figure 4—figure supplement 1 is our attempt at summarizing the set of pair-wise comparisons to 2x2 matrices. To further ensure the reader can make their own interpretations, Supplementary File 6, as mentioned above, contains all enrichments for all comparisons.</p><p>Finally, we updated our summary panel (Figure 4J) to indicate that change in BRAF expression can also change the phenotype (labels and double headed arrows). This panel, itself a matrix, combined with the afore mentioned Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, summarizes our observations is the 2x2 format requested.</p><p>We believe these changes provide the data required for the reader to generate their own interpretations while also acknowledging both interpretations as a possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2a. Throughout the work, it is noteworthy that most proliferation assays are rather short-term. If there's a reason for that (i.e. affects on proliferation are only transient) that should be discussed. In particular, the following questions related to behaviors over time should be resolved:</p></disp-quote><p>When designing the experiments, we chose durations of BRAF induction that are consistent with most previous studies exploring this topic. To further push the system, we have now included additional experiments presented in Figure 3I-K, whereby we treated the melanocytes with dox for 30 days, prior to either removing the dox or removing the TPA. The melanocytes remained arrested for the 30-day duration prior to proliferating again once Dox or TPA was removed.</p><p>With this additional experiment, our durations are now equal to or greater than that usually published by the field. However, we also appreciate the obvious discrepancies between any reasonable in vitro experiment and a melanocytic nevus that may persist for many decades. Longer experiments could yield different results, but we would be hard pressed to justify how long is “long enough” to truly model decades. It is for this reason that we were excited to find evidence for the mechanism discovered in vitro in the clinical specimens we analyzed.</p><p>To ensure readers appreciate all of these points, we have now included the following paragraphs in the discussion (lines 719-729):</p><p>“One inherent limitation of using any in vitro approach to investigate the mechanisms underlaying clinical phenomena is an inherent incongruity in the magnitude of duration. Melanocytic nevi frequently persist for several decades, whereas in vitro experiments are generally conducted on the order of days to weeks. In previous in vitro studies, the periods of time melanocytes were monitored subsequent to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> introduction ranged from one to three weeks. In studies utilizing an inducible RAF in human fibroblasts, 24 hours of expression was sufficient to drive a durable proliferative arrest, even upon removal of the oncogene<sup>17</sup>. In this study, we induced growth arrest with high levels of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> for thirty days and observed the arrest was still reversible. It remains possible that an even longer exposure to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> would elicit a permanent proliferative arrest consistent with senescence. It is noteworthy, however, that the identified mechanisms driving proliferative arrest in vitro were also supported by analyses of clinical nevi specimens.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2b. Although recent studies have called into question the view that nevi arrest by senescence, studies done in vitro based on the introduction of BrafV600E into melanocytes have suggested that, at least in vitro, they are driven into senescence. Are the authors disputing the results of those studies, or are there methodological differences to explain the discrepancy (e.g. other groups cultured cells for longer or in different media)?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data are consistent with previous in vitro studies when considering the data presented in those studies, albeit not always when considering the authors’ interpretations of those data. The previous studies we are aware of (our papers included) all include TPA in their media, and thus our observation that BRAFV600E + TPA = growth arrest is entirely consistent. Removal of TPA from the media is the most notable methodological difference. Other possibilities included the duration of the experiment or the dose of BRAF expression – both of which we address in new Figures3I-K. In short, we do not believe there are discrepancies between our observations and the previous studies, and we have added to our understanding of the system by exploring altering variables that were not previously considered.</p><p>To make these points clear, we have added the following discussion to the manuscript (lines 712-717):</p><p>“The senescence model is largely rooted in seminal work demonstrating that sustained ectopic expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induces proliferative arrest in primary human melanocytes<sup>9</sup> – an experiment reproduced by several independent labs<sup>24,25,59,60</sup>, including our own<sup>23</sup>. In each of these studies, melanocytes were cultured in TPA containing media. Thus, while observations presented here – that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> -induced proliferative arrest is reversible and conditional on the presence of TPA – provide new insights that challenge the senescence model, they do not contradict the data presented in these previous reports.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2c. One implication of the data in Figure 3 is that, if not for the common use of TPA in culture medium, introduction of BrafV600E into melanocytes would result in durable (long-lasting) stimulation of proliferation. Although this paper addresses the early responses of melanocytes, it would be valuable to state whether those responses persist or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewers’ comment regarding the concept of short-term and long-term / “durable” effects of BRAF expression. We do continue to monitor cell growth in TPA free media both with and without Dox, and the phenotype continues for the duration of the culture, which we now mention in line 352. In full transparency, “duration” is usually ~4-6 weeks – the primary human melanocytes we use are not immortalized and do crash due to telomere crisis. The time until crash is dependent on the prep and the rate of divisions, regardless of BRAF status. We are presently conducting studies repeating these experiments on the background of different combinations of melanoma-associated mutations, inclusive of TERT promoter and CDKN2A loss mutations, but these studies are the foundation of an independent project in the lab and are outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We suspect the most likely reason for the differences in sensitivity is the aneuploidy that results from BRAFV600E. Two recent Nature papers (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33505028/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33505027/) demonstrate that whole genome doubling renders cells sensitive to mitotic checkpoint inhibition. Our demonstration that BRAF induces aneuploidy that these cells are more sensitive to AURKB inhibition mirror these findings. It is not that diploid cells are not “at all” responsive to mitotic checkpoint inhibition, they are just significantly less sensitive – the same as we see here. The mechanisms aren’t entirely known, and dissecting the mechanisms will require multiple studies all of their own, but the explanation I have been offered by experts in the field is that the more chromosomes there are that need separated, the more AURKB molecules are required for successful separation. BRAF increases the demand for AURKB but the miRNAs prevent increased AURKB from being produced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The limited sample sizes (n = 3) in earlier experiments in addition to the lack of in vivo work lessens the potential clinical impact this manuscript could have on the melanoma community. If it is possible to extend the sample size for some of this work, it would improve the importance of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this feedback. We have guessed that the earlier experiments being referred to are those in Figure 1 demonstrating growth arrest induced by miRNA overexpression. As requested, we have now extended this sample size by repeating over-expression experiments with additional melanocyte preps (Figure 1J). We also point out that Figures 1D, E, G and J each report on reduced proliferation and each have 3 replicates, and in addition the screen represented in Figure 2C included multiple wells of each miRNA as controls and was likewise thrice repeated. In short, the phenotype is very reproducible.</p><p>We are sorry to hear the reviewers are skeptical of the long-term clinical impact of this study due to lack of in vivo model systems. Although we respect this viewpoint, we are a bit more optimistic. It is our lab philosophy that there is value in staying as close to the “human model system” as possible. Like other of our studies, this study first generates hypotheses through observation of clinical specimens, then explores those hypotheses in primary human melanocyte culture, then confirms the major mechanisms using clinical specimens again. Will this approach yield observations that are ultimately clinically impactful? We hope to know the answer to that soon enough. The data presented here have resulted in funding for pre-clinical and clinical studies to test the utility of our observations for chemoprevention or early detection of melanoma. We hope to report on these studies in a few years. In the meantime, there are many other fantastic labs that utilize elegant model animal systems, and we have been excited to see some of them making discoveries in their systems that support some of the observations we have made here. We suspect that human-focused studies, such as ours, that complement animal models and determine which observations are conserved in human and which are model-specific will be ultimately useful for the field.</p><p>In lines 741-751 of the discussion, we now better acknowledge these merits and weaknesses as well as published studies in animal models that support our observations:</p><p>“While supported by analyses of both primary human melanocytes and clinical specimens, one limitation to this report is the lack of in vivo confirmation using animal models. One well-established genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma expresses BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> from the endogenous locus in tyrosinase expressing cells with spatiotemporal control. The predominant phenotype of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> activation in this model is melanocytic hyperplasia, which increases in prominence with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dose<sup>6</sup>. While growth-arrested melanocytic “nevus-like” lesions also form in this model, they are not associated with markers of senescence<sup>8</sup>. More recently, an elegant study utilizing a zebrafish model of melanoma demonstrated that driving BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression from promoters associated with melanocyte progenitors, but not differentiated melanocytes, resulted in melanoma initiation<sup>61</sup>. These observations are all consistent with our data and support the conclusion that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced proliferation in melanocytes is dependent on differentiation state.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Some very specific questions that the authors should address are the following:</p><p>Figure 2E: the detected miRNA binding sites in AURKB and GPR3 seem a little weak; how do these sequences rank among other detected targets for these miRNAs in the genome?</p></disp-quote><p>MicroRNAs bind mRNAs with only partial complementarity. The binding sites of MIR211 and MIR328 include the seed sequence of the miRNAs which are the most important sequence for targeting mRNAs. Successful binding is dependent not only on this sequence, but also on the expression of the target gene relative to other target genes and the availability of the binding site. We generally use programs such as TargetScan or miRWalk to identify candidate targets, but knowing how context-dependent miRNA targeting is, we don’t put a lot of stock in the exact ranking. Instead, as we did here, we look for genes that are predicted as targeted and also inversely expressed in the context we care about – in this comparing nevi to melanoma specimens. Figure 2C, y-axis, shows how downregulated the AURKB transcript is upon MIR211 over-expression in comparison to the other predicted targets. By this empirical measurement, it is one of the top most downregulated targets.</p><p>Regarding a priori ranking of predicted targets using computational methods, miRWalk is a relatively recent method that incorporates a machine learning based approach, and considers numerous variables in addition to sequence to assign a “probability of binding” score. This tool predicts that MIR328-3p and MIR211-5p have 0.85 and 0.96 probabilities of binding AURKB, respectively, and the two MIR328-3p sites have 1.00 probabilities of binding GPR3. We now include these calculated probabilities in the revised Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3G: Notwithstanding the presentation value of displaying cell number relative to the dox-negative control, doing so suppresses information about how TPA itself affects cell number.

IC50s referencing cell proliferation assays are not expected to be equal to IC50s referencing the activity of the kinase in a cell-free biochemical assay. The two assays contain substantial differences in potential off-target kinases, where the compound needs to be localized to be effective, and all the factors related cell division that may not be directly related to inhibition of the kinase. For example, the IC50 of the well documented BRAFV600E inhibitor, vemurafenib, in cell free assays is 31nM, but can range from 3-5µM in cell lines (PMID: 25623468). Published IC50s of barasertib in melanoma cell lines (same citation) are in the 30-300nM range. We also emphasize that we report GR50s, which account for differences in the baseline growth rates of the cells – an additional variable that cell-free assays cannot account for.</p></body></sub-article></article>
