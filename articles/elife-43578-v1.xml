Studies of a rare monogenic disorder – autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1) or autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) and the mutated gene underlying the disease, Autoimmune regulator (<italic>AIRE</italic>) – have shed light on how reaction against self is avoided. The <italic>AIRE</italic> gene encodes a transcription factor that promotes thymic presentation of genes with limited peripheral tissue distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>AIRE</italic>-mediated antigen exposes naïve T-cells to self-molecules that otherwise would not be present in the thymus, and is therefore critical for the negative selection of autoreactive T-cells. Patients with APS1 develop multiple tissue-destructive manifestations and harbor autoantibodies targeting the affected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahonen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ferre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Söderbergh et al., 2004</xref>). A number of <italic>bona fide</italic> autoantigens have been identified in APS1 over the years, many of which are now used routinely in the clinical assessment of patients with APS1 and also in other autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alimohammadi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alimohammadi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ekwall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kisand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Landegren et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Landegren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Meager et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Puel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Shum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Winqvist et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Winqvist et al., 1992</xref>). To gain a more comprehensive view on the autoantigen spectrum in APS1 we used a panel of 9000 full-length human proteins to perform a broad-scale mapping of autoantibody targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Landegren et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Landegren et al., 2015</xref>). In the proteome array screen we replicated previously reported autoantigens and further identified and validated three novel major autoantigens. We limited our analyses to autoantibody targets that were shared between multiple patients and thereby showed statistically robust association with the patient group. We did not address autoantibody signals against targets that were observed only in one or a few patients, as we could not confidently separate these types of signals from the background of normal variation and technical noise. Indeed, elevated signals of this kind were observed both among patients and among the healthy controls.</p><p>Meyer et al. recently reported results from a screening experiment using a similar approach in APS1 patients, where the same protein panel was used to study autoantibodies in a comparable cohort of patients with APS1 and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>). We were surprised that their description of the autoantigen spectrum was very different from ours. Meyer et al. identified over 3700 proteins as autoantigens in APS1, corresponding to around 40% of the investigated panel. The healthy controls were found to largely lack high-level serum reactivity, which was used as evidence for the relevance of the autoantibody targets identified in the APS1 patients.</p><p>As the methods reported in the experiments by Meyer et al. were very similar to those we used, we asked whether differences in the approach to data analysis could explain the different conclusions. We noted that Meyer et al. applied a cutoff definition that could be expected to result in a skewed detection of autoantibody signals between patients and controls. To address this question, we used proteome array data for 51 APS1 patients and 21 healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Landegren et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Landegren et al., 2015</xref>) to reevaluate the autoantigen spectrum in APS1. In permuted datasets we found that the approach to data analysis used by Meyer et al. was strongly biased towards overestimating the number of autoantibody signals in the patient group. When we applied alternative statistical analyses without this inherent skewing effect, we found no support for the conclusion of broad antigen spectrum in APS1. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meyer et al. (2016)</xref> also proposed that subjects with APS1 that harbor neutralizing autoantibodies against type I interferons are protected against developing type 1 diabetes, one of the autoimmune manifestations of the disorder. We attempted to validate this finding in a larger cohort of APS1 subjects with type 1 diabetes and could find no evidence to support this proposed association.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>No evidence for widespread autoantibody reactivity in APS1 patients</title><p>We used our previously collected proteome array dataset to reevaluate the autoantigen spectrum in APS1. The data were generated by screening a panel of 9000 full-length human proteins (ProtoArray) with sera from 51 patients with APS1 and 21 healthy blood donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Landegren et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Landegren et al., 2015</xref>). We followed the analytical approach used as closely as possible from the information available in the published article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>). The fluorescence signal intensities were log-transformed and normalized using robust linear modeling based on the human-IgG and anti-human-IgG controls. Control spots and suspected printing contamination signals were sorted out (for further details, see Materials and methods). After filtering, 6540 unique proteins remained.</p><p>As a first step to ascertain if our dataset was comparable to the dataset in Meyer et al., we performed the same approach to statistical analysis as described to identify autoantibody signals in the APS1 patients and the healthy controls. Z-scores were calculated for all individuals over all proteins as the number of standard deviations above the mean value for the healthy controls. At low Z-score cutoffs (1, 2 and 3) the number of autoantibody signals was similar for patients and controls. However, at higher cutoffs the patient group deviated from the control group, and at cutoff level Z ≥ 5, autoantibody signals were only observed among the APS1 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Our dataset thereby showed a similar result as the one by Meyer et al. when we used the same statistical analysis, specifically identifying high-level autoantibody signals among the APS1 patients. Investigation of established autoantigens in APS1 provided further support that the datasets in our study and the one by Meyer et al. were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43578.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The statistical analysis used by Meyer et al. is biased towards overestimation of the number of autoantibody signals in the patient group.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We used our previously published proteome array dataset for 51 APS1 patients and 21 healthy controls to reevaluate the autoantigen spectrum in APS1. (<bold>B</bold>) To first determine if our dataset and the one by Meyer et al. were comparable, we applied the same statistical analysis as in Meyer et al. to identify autoantibody signals among the APS1 patients and healthy controls. Z-scores were calculated for all individuals over all proteins as the number of standard deviations above the mean value, where both mean and standard deviation were calculated based on the 21 healthy controls. Similar to the results by Meyer et al., high-level autoantibody signals (Z &gt; 5) were specially observed among the patients. (<bold>C</bold>) To next determine whether the difference between patients and controls was true our could be explained by a biased statistical analysis we performed the same analysis in groups of subjects randomly assigned to represent ‘cases’ or ‘controls’. Fifty-one subjects were assigned to represent ‘cases’ and 21 subjects were assigned to represent ‘controls’, and autoantibody cutoffs were calculated based on the ‘controls’. The process was repeated 100 times. High-level autoantibody signals were specifically observed among the subjects assigned to represent ‘cases’. Mean values over the 100 permutations are presented in the table. (<bold>D</bold>) To determine whether the bias of the statistical analysis was dominating the overall results we applied a reversed cutoff, based on the values obtained for the APS1 patients instead of the healthy controls, to the true groups of patients and controls. The controls now showed high-level autoantibodies against greater number of proteins than the patients.

The great majority of the new targets (Z ≥ 3) showed elevated level in only one or a few patients, with 37% of the targets representing single outlier values and only 26% being shared by more than three patients. The novel hits were further generally low in signal intensity compared to the established APS1 autoantigens. Looking at the top signal in the cohort for each target, the previously established autoantigens showed an average signal intensity of over thirty-seven thousand arbitrary fluorescence units while the new targets averaged at just below one thousand (<bold>A</bold>). We next investigated whether the new targets showed enrichment for tissue-specific genes. It has been shown that the <italic>AIRE</italic> gene promotes thymic expression of proteins with limited tissue distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with the function of <italic>AIRE</italic>, the previously identified autoantigens in APS1 typically show tissue-specific expression. Therefore, studying enrichment of the tissue-specific genes could provide a way to determine if the new targets differed from a random sample of the array content.

We first looked at the distribution of autoantibody signals among patients and controls by applying different fixed signal cutoffs. The number of elevated IgG signals was higher in the APS1 patients than in the healthy controls, although the difference was small compared to that found by Meyer et al. (<bold>A</bold>). For example, at an arbitrary cutoff of 10,000 arbitrary fluorescence intensity units the APS1 patients displayed autoantibody responses against an average of 22 unique proteins as compared to 15 proteins in the healthy controls. Furthermore, the difference was almost completely eliminated when we excluded already known autoantigens – decreasing the number of autoantibody signals to an average of 16 proteins in the APS1 patients compared to the unchanged average of 15 proteins in the healthy controls (<bold>B</bold>). The results were similar for other cutoff values. We also compared the number of autoantibody signals between patients and controls by applying Z-score cutoffs. To allow for an unbiased detection of autoantibody signals, equally prone to register signals among patients and controls, we did not base the Z-score on the healthy controls as in the study by Meyer et al. but instead on the whole cohort. We further excluded the 10% highest and 10% lowest signals before calculating the cutoff, so that the cutoff level would not be affected by outlier values. This type of analysis is expected to detect elevated signals that occur in one or a few subjects, however, autoantibody signals that are present in many subjects are overlooked as the cutoff is consequently increased. Again we observed a small difference in the number of autoantibody signals between the patients and controls (<bold>C</bold>), which was further reduced by excluding the known autoantigens (<bold>D</bold>). Thereby, in contrast with results by Meyer et al. specifically identifying high-level autoantibody signals among the APS1 patients, we found only a small difference in the number of autoantibody signals between patients and controls. We also calculated the statistical significance that the number of autoantibody signals in APS1 differed from permutated data by comparing the number of distinct proteins with at least one hit (Z ≥ 3) among the APS1 cases to what is expected by random (when 21 samples are randomly assigned to represent controls and the remaining 51 represent cases) (<bold>E</bold>). The p-value was computed as the fraction of the permutations that result in as many distinct proteins as observed or more. At higher z-scores the numbers were borderline significant, showing a trend towards that the APS1 patients display higher numbers of autoantibody signals than the permutated data ‘cases’. The results were in line with the investigations in A-D. In all panels, the complexity factor was calculated as the number of distinct proteins divided by the number of individuals divided by the average number of proteins per individual. In panel A and B: Pat = APS1 patients, BG = healthy controls. In panel C and D: p=APS1 patients, C = healthy controls.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43578-fig1-figsupp7-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>As a next step, we asked whether the difference in number of autoantibody signals between patients and controls was true or could be explained by a skewed data analysis. Meyer et al. used a cutoff based on the mean and standard deviation of the values obtained for the healthy controls to identify autoantibody signals. Consequently, elevated signals that occur among the controls increase the cutoff while elevated signals among the patients do not affect the cutoff. It could therefore be expected that elevated signals occurring sporadically in both patients and controls were detected unequally between the groups. To determine if this was the case, we first performed a simulation where we introduced an elevated outlier value in either the APS1 patient group or the control group for one of the proteins in the array. For this example, we chose the protein serum albumin, which did not show elevated signal for any patient or control. When we replaced one of the patient values with a signal value at saturation level (65,000 signal units), the cutoff was not affected and the elevated outlier scored as autoantibody positive at Z-score cutoffs of 3, 4 and 5 as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, when we introduced an outlier at the same signal level in the control group the cutoff drastically increased, which gave the absurd result that the outlier scored as autoantibody negative at Z = 5. The example thereby revealed that even extremely elevated values in the control group could be missed in the analysis.</p><p>We also performed simulations where outliers were introduced in random normal data representing 51 ‘cases’ and 21 ‘controls’, which showed how outliers introduced in the controls were less likely to be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We next used our proteome array dataset to study groups of patients and controls randomly assigned to represent ‘cases’ or ‘controls’. Out of the 51 patients and 21 healthy blood donors in our cohort, we randomly assigned 51 subjects to represent ‘cases’ and 21 subjects to represent ‘controls’. The ‘control’ group was used to calculate the autoantibody cutoff levels. The process was repeated 100 times. The permuted datasets revealed a strong bias of the analytical method, specifically identifying high-level autoantibodies (Z ≥ 5) among the subjects assigned to represent ‘cases’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>We also performed a similar analysis limited to the healthy blood donors only, assigning eleven blood donors to represent ‘cases’ and the remaining ten to represent ‘controls’. Autoantibody signals were detected at high level in the blood donors that were assigned to represent ‘cases’ while those assigned to represent ‘controls’ did not show autoantibody signals above Z ≥ 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). To better determine how the analytical bias influenced the overall results, we applied a reversed cutoff to our dataset based on the values obtained for the 51 APS1 patients instead of those for the 21 healthy controls. The healthy controls now turned out to show greater numbers of high-level (Z ≥ 5) autoantibody signals than the APS1 patients, revealing that the skewing effect of the data analysis was dominating the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>We further found that the targets identified using the data analysis by Meyer et al. were mostly low in signal, and in contrast to the established autoantigen, did not differ from a random sample of the protein panel when looking at the number of tissue-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). When we applied alternative statistical analyses that treated cases and controls in a neutral way to compare the total number of autoantibody signals between the groups, we found only a minor difference between APS1 patients and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). The difference between the groups was furthermore mostly explained by the previously identified APS1 autoantigens. Our investigations collectively suggested that the approach to data analysis used by Meyer et al. led to erroneous conclusions regarding the breadth of the antigen spectrum in APS1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>No association between neutralizing autoantibodies to interferons and type 1 diabetes in APS1</title><p>Autoantibodies against type 1 IFNs are present in almost all patients with APS1 and represent a valuable biomarker for the disease, even early in the course of the disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Meager et al., 2006</xref>). Meyer et al. reported that type I IFN autoantibodies showed neutralizing effect in many but not all patients with APS1. The authors further found an inverse correlation between the capacity to neutralize IFNα and the development of type 1 diabetes in a small number of APS1 patients. Among 21 investigated APS1 patients, sera from all 13 patients without type 1 diabetes neutralized IFNα while sera from all eight patients with type 1 diabetes showed only low or negligible neutralization. No healthy controls or any other non-APS1 controls were included in the experiment. It was proposed that IFN autoantibodies could potentially protect patients with APS1 from developing type 1 diabetes.</p><p>We set out to investigate the proposed association between neutralizing type I IFN autoantibodies and type 1 diabetes. We investigated sera from three groups: 16 APS1 patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, 14 APS1 patients without type 1 diabetes from Sweden, Finland, the US and the UK, and five healthy controls. IFN neutralization was studied using a previously described cell-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>). Healthy control peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with IFNα, IFNω or IFNγ in the presence of APS1 patient or healthy control serum. We used the same serum concentration (10%) as previously applied to quantify interferon neutralizing autoantibodies in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gupta et al. (2016)</xref>. CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes were then stained for intranuclear phospho-STAT1, which is a marker of IFN-dependent intracellular response. As expected, APS1 sera specifically neutralized IFNα- and IFNω- but not IFNγ-dependent pSTAT1 while healthy control sera did not show neutralization in any of the IFN stimulation assays. As control, serum from a patient with IFNγ autoantibodies and disseminated mycobacterial infection neutralized IFNγ- but not IFNα- or IFNω-dependent pSTAT1, and serum from a patient with IFNα and IFNω autoantibodies and thymoma neutralized IFNα- and IFNω- but not IFNγ-dependent pSTAT1 (data not shown). In contrast to the results by Meyer et al., we found strong neutralization of IFNα- and IFNω-dependent cellular response in all tested APS1 sera, with no difference between patients with type 1 diabetes compared to those without diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

In this regard, Meyer et al. proposed two new major insights: i) that the spectrum of autoantibodies in APS1 is much broader than previously appreciated; ii) that neutralizing autoantibodies to type 1 IFNs could provide protection against type 1 diabetes in APS1 patients. Using a similar experimental approach on an independent cohort of APS1 subjects we found no evidence to support either conclusion. The finding of a broad autoantigen spectrum in APS1 was based on a biased statistical analysis prone to overestimate the number of autoantibody signals in the patient group. Collectively, we find no evidence to support the previous conclusion that almost half of the proteome is targeted by autoantibodies in APS1 patients and instead find that the autoantibody repertoire is far more restricted.</p><p>Studies of APS1 and its mouse model have provided important insights to the molecular mechanisms underlying immunological self-tolerance. The <italic>Aire</italic>-controlled genes have been studied comprehensively in mouse thymic tissue using omics technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sansom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Venanzi et al., 2008</xref>). Comprehensive studies of autoimmune targets in <italic>AIRE</italic>-deficient subjects represent an equally important source of information for understanding <italic>AIRE</italic>’s role in immune tolerance. Protein array technology provides the opportunity for mapping autoantibody targets on a broad scale. However, an inherent challenge with these types of studies, where thousands of tests are performed simultaneously, is to identify the relevant signals from a background of normal variation and technical noise. Unbiased comparison against controls becomes critical. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meyer et al. (2016)</xref> used the healthy controls to define normal signal ranges and to identify autoantibody responses. This type of approach is in many situations appropriate. In this case, however, it became a pitfall when a cutoff definition that requires the assumption that the controls show normal signals was used to compare the number of elevated signals between patients and controls. Background signals were unevenly recorded between patients and controls, resulting in the identification of an autoantigen spectrum dominated by the type of stochastic low-level signals that are also present among healthy individuals.</p><p>In our previous study of the autoantigen repertoire in APS1 we limited our analyses to autoantibody targets that were shared between multiple patients and thereby could be reliably identified from their statistical association with the patient group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Landegren et al., 2016b</xref>). Here we used other approaches to also address rare autoantigens in APS1. These studies revealed a only minor difference in the total number of autoantibody signals between APS1 patients and controls, which is in stark contrast with the results by Meyer et al. The healthy control group was small in both our study and the one by Meyer et al. A larger numbers of healthy controls would have provided better means to identify and evaluate the relevance of rare autoantibody signals in APS1 patients.</p><p>Meyer et al. also proposed that type I IFN autoantibodies may have disease ameliorating activity and protect patients with APS1 from developing type 1 diabetes, based on the absence of IFN neutralizing autoantibodies in a small number of APS1 subjects with type 1 diabetes (n = 8). In our independent investigation on a larger number of APS1 subjects with type 1 diabetes (n = 16) we could not repeat the reported association. Instead we found strong neutralization of the type I IFN-dependent cellular response in all investigated APS1 sera, with no difference in sera obtained from APS1 patients with or without type 1 diabetes. It is important to consider different explanations why the association between interferon neutralization and type 1 diabetes was not replicated, including differences in methodology. We used an established method and the same serum concentration as previously applied for quantifying neutralizing effect of interferon autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>). The positive and negative controls in the experiments also verified a reliable detection of neutralizing activity. Our results raise the need for further investigations to establish any association between IFN neutralizing autoantibodies and development of diabetes before embarking on in-depth investigations on targeting type 1 IFNs for the treatment or prevention of type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (Homo sapiens)</td><td valign="top">Serum samples from patients with APS1 from Sweden, Norway and Finland, and blood donor controls from Sweden</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26084804">26084804</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26830021">26830021</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td valign="top">Serum samples from patients with APS1 from USA</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27588307">27588307</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td valign="top">Blood donor controls from NIH Blood Bank</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Fluorophore-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-human IgG</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 647 Goat Anti-Human IgG; Cat#A21445,</td><td valign="top">Concentration: 1:2000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Fluorophore-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-pSTAT1</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 647 mouse anti-human Stat1 (pY701); Cat# 612597</td><td valign="top">5 uL/test</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Fluorophore-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-CD14</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">FITC mouse anti-human CD14; Cat# 555397</td><td valign="top">2 uL/test</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Recombinant human interferon-alpha 2</td><td valign="top">PBL Assay Science</td><td valign="top">Cat # 11101–2</td><td valign="top">Concentration: <break/>10 ng/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Recombinant human interferon-alpha</td><td valign="top">Peprotech</td><td valign="top">Cat# 300–02J</td><td valign="top">Concentration: <break/>10 ng/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Recombinant human interferon-gamma 1b</td><td valign="top">ActImmune</td><td valign="top">NDC 42238-111-01</td><td valign="top">Concentration: <break/>400 U/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Protein microarray</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">ProtoArray v5.0 (PAH0525020)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Blocking buffer kit used in the protein array screening</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Blocking Buffer Kit (PA055)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Software used for protein microarray scanning, alignment and data acquisition</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">GenePix Pro microarray (v6.1)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">FlowJo</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FlowJo (v10.5.3)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">Prism</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">GraphPad Prism (v6.0)</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study subjects</title><p>The patient cohort that was studied using protein arrays included individuals with APS1 from Sweden, Finland and Norway and healthy blood donors from Sweden, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Landegren et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Landegren et al., 2015</xref>).

Autoantibodies against GAD65 were found in all five patients with type 1 diabetes and in 3 of the seven patients (42.9%) without type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>APS1 cohort from Finland and Sweden</title><p>Eleven patients with type 1 diabetes and seven patients without type 1 diabetes from Finland and Sweden were included to the study on neutralizing IFN autoantibodies. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus was based on typical biochemical findings, including the presence of glycosuria, elevated plasma glucose levels, decreased plasma levels of insulin and C-peptide, and elevated hemoglobin A1c. Seven out of the 18 patients were female. The mean age of the patients was 25 years (range 9–49 years). The most common clinical manifestations in the patients were chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (100%), adrenal insufficiency (89%), hypoparathyroidism (83%), malabsorption (39%), gonadal insufficiency (33%), pernicious anemia (17%), alopecia (17%), vitiligo (11%) and autoimmune hepatitis (11%). GAD65 autoantibodies were detected in 5 out of 11 (45%) patients with type 1 diabetes and in 2 of the seven patients (29%) without type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Protein array screening</title><p>Human protein arrays containing ~9000 full-length human proteins (ProtoArray v5.0, Thermo Fisher) were screened with serum samples from patients with APS1 and healthy controls. The arrays were probed with serum at a concentration of 1:2000, and otherwise followed Invitrogen’s protocol for <italic>Immune Response BioMarker Profiling</italic>. A GenePix 4000B microarray scanner and the GenePix Pro microarray (v6.1) software was used for scanning, alignment and data acquisition. The proteome array dataset has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Landegren et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Landegren et al., 2015</xref>). The protein array screening experiment was not repeated. Suspected printing contamination artifacts were identified and excluded as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Landegren et al., 2016b</xref>). No outliers were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Fluorescence intensities were background corrected and the mean value was computed over duplicate spots. Print-order artifacts were removed as follows: all spots with a Spearman correlation &gt;0.8 to a spot with higher intensity that was printed right before were excluded. Values were log10-transformed and robust linear modeling (RLM) was applied to normalize the data based on human IgG and anti-human IgG controls as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sboner et al., 2009</xref>). RLM was implemented in the rlm function in the R package MASS. When more than one spot on the array was associated with the same gene name the mean value over the spots was calculated, such that each gene name was only represented once. The Z-scores were computed as the number of standard deviations away from the mean, where both mean and standard deviation were computed based on a set of ‘controls’. The Z-scores were computed for each protein separately.</p><p>We also calculated a robust Z-score based on trimmed mean and standard deviations, where the most extreme 10% of the values at each end were excluded when computing the mean and standard deviation. Enrichment of targets in any of the <italic>Human Protein Atlas</italic> classifications was measured using a hypergeometric test. The expression annotation categories were defined according to the following: <italic>tissue enriched</italic> – at least five-fold higher mRNA levels in a particular tissue as compared to all other tissues), <italic>group enriched</italic> - at least five-fold higher mRNA levels in a group of 2–7 tissues and <italic>tissue enhanced</italic> - at least five-fold higher mRNA levels in a particular tissue as compared to average levels in all tissues. The following proteins in the ProtoArray panel were treated as known autoantigens in the analyses: CYP1A2, DDC, GAD1, GAD2, GIF, IFNA1, IFNA13, IFNA14, IFNA16, IFNA17, IFNA2, IFNA21, IFNA4, IFNA5, IFNA6, IFNA8, IFNW1, IL17A, IL22, KCNRG, MAGEB2, PDILT, TGM4, TPH1 and TSGA10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Functional evaluation of interferon autoantibodies</title><p>Healthy control peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC; 1 × 10<sup>7</sup>/mL) were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 15 min at 37°C with IFNα (10 ng/mL), IFNω (10 ng/mL), or IFNγ (400 U/mL) in the presence of 10% patient or control serum, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>).

The first is whether the extent of autoantigens in APECED patients is truly as broad as claimed by the Meyer publication. This is well challenged by the article, raising a 'data interpretation' debate. Landegren goes to great lengths to prove how the same data can be analyzed to show a broad range of serum autoreactivity or a restricted set of autoantigens. In an age of big data, this is entertaining and enlightening. Their concern is 100% warranted. The problem that is raised is that if one uses a small set of controls that are relatively homogeneous to define Z score thresholds for thousands of analytes, the analysis will favor outliers in a larger patient group. This is obvious, but not well understood. One simply should not use a small number of controls to define thresholds in these sorts of assays. Or if one does, then there must be a validation with a larger set or different assays. The point is well demonstrated. Landegren could have taken this further and more generally by making the point that one should not use a small number of controls to define thresholds as they simply are NOT sufficiently representative of the range of signals in health - that would be helpful for readers. What is perhaps less well done is to allow room for the possibility that there may be a broad reactivity since neither the original study nor the challenging analysis actually has sufficient controls to appropriately do the Z score approach and the alternative Landegren Fishers test approach is conservative. In other words, neither can actually conclude their view on broad vs restricted. Landegren should be critical of their own study by stating that they also had few controls and, therefore, used a more conservative approach to define the threshold, but that this is likely to be biased in the opposite direction to that of Meyer.</p><p>The second point of contention is the relationship of type 1 IFN neutralizing autoantibodies to diabetes in the APECED patients. Here, the challenge may be warranted but less convincing. It is important to examine a second cohort since the numbers in the Meyer paper were small.

They can conclude that the APECED patients who develop diabetes in their cohort have type 1 IFN neutralizing autoantibodies, but they cannot comment on whether the titer is the same or different to the APECED patients without diabetes since they have reached assay saturation in both groups.

The first is whether the extent of autoantigens in APECED patients is truly as broad as claimed by the Meyer publication. This is well challenged by the article, raising a 'data interpretation' debate. Landegren goes to great lengths to prove how the same data can be analyzed to show a broad range of serum autoreactivity or a restricted set of autoantigens. In an age of big data, this is entertaining and enlightening. Their concern is 100% warranted. The problem that is raised is that if one uses a small set of controls that are relatively homogeneous to define Z score thresholds for thousands of analytes, the analysis will favor outliers in a larger patient group. This is obvious, but not well understood. One simply should not use a small number of controls to define thresholds in these sorts of assays.

It is encouraging to read that the Reviewer finds our points well demonstrated and enlightening.</p><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the small number of controls is an important limitation of both the study by Meyer et al. and ours. A larger number of controls would indeed have provided better means to evaluate what is truly patient-specific and what can be explained by normal variation. This would be especially important for determining the relevance (if any) of the type of rare autoantibody signals that are observed both among patients and healthy controls.</p><p>Despite this limitation, we are able to conclude the following:</p><p>1) Only a very restricted set of proteins (&lt;1% of the protein panel) are targeted by autoantibodies in multiple APS1 patients. These major autoantigens, which can be readily identified by their statistical association with the patient group, are described in our previous article (Landegren et al., 2016).</p><p>2) There is no support for the Cell paper claim of broad antigen spectrum in APS1. Our analyses of permutated data clearly shows that their observed difference in numbers of autoantibody signals between patients and controls can be explained by a bias in the data analysis.</p><p>3) The total number autoantibody signals (also including rare autoantigens) is only slightly higher in APS1 compared to healthy control, which is in stark contrast with the Cell paper claim. When we apply different approaches that treat patients and controls in a neutral way to count the total number of autoantibody signals (either using Z-scores based on the values for both patients and controls where the most extreme values at each end have been excluded, or simply using fixed signal intensity cutoffs) we only find small difference between the patient group and the control group. This difference was furthermore mostly explained by the previously described autoantigens (Figure 1-figure supplement 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Changes made to the manuscript:</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the following to the Discussion, explaining limitations of our study of the autoantigen repertoire:</p><p>In our previous study of the autoantigen repertoire in APS1 we limited our analyses to autoantibody targets that were shared between multiple patients and thereby could be reliably identified from their statistical association with the patient group (Landegren et al., 2016b). Here we used other approaches to also address rare autoantigens in APS1. These studies revealed a only minor difference in the total number of autoantibody signals between APS1 patients and controls, which is in stark contrast with the results by Meyer et al. The healthy control group was small in both our study and the one by Meyer et al. A larger numbers of healthy controls would have provided better means to identify and evaluate the relevance of rare autoantibody signals in APS1 patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second point of contention is the relationship of type 1 IFN neutralizing autoantibodies to diabetes in the APECED patients.

Specifically, we sought to repeat the observation that “patients without T1D collectively neutralized all IFNa subtypes, whereas those with T1D showed only low or negligible neutralization”.</p><p>In our validation study, we applied an established method to investigate autoantibody-mediated interferon neutralization in a larger cohort of APS1 patients with and without T1 diabetes. We used the same serum concentration as applied in the article by Gupta et al. for quantifying neutralization effect of interferon autoantibodies. The performance of the assay was verified using positive control sera (from a patient with IFNγ autoantibodies and disseminated mycobacterial infection, and from a patient with IFNα and IFNω autoantibodies and thymoma). In contrast to the Cell paper we included healthy blood donor sera as negative controls in our experiment, which would allow us to determine whether or not the APS1 without T1 diabetes truly showed negligible neutralization as previously claimed.</p><p>Our validation experiment showed strong and specific neutralization of IFNα- and IFNω in all tested APS1 sera, with no difference between patients with type 1 diabetes compared to those without diabetes. The results thus did not support the reported association with T1 diabetes status. Furthermore, our results from comparing APS1 to healthy control sera were in direct conflict with the Cell paper claim of low or negligible interferon neutralization in APS1 patients with T1 diabetes.</p><p>We understand from reading the comments of Reviewer 2 that the authors of the Cell paper can now only detect a difference in neutralization between patients with and without diabetes at certain serum dilutions.
